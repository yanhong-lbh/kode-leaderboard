    "article_text": "Sammy Hagar doesn’t feel old yet and explains why he has no plans to retire. Sammy Hagarrecalled why he \"wanted to break\" David Lee Roth's \"f----’\" neck when they toured together in 2002. In 1985, the 77-year-old singer-songwriter replaced Roth as the frontman of Van Halen, joining guitarist Eddie Van Halen, Eddie's brother and drummer Alex Van Halen and bassist Michael Anthony. Hagar parted ways with the legendary rock band in 1996, but later rejoined Van Halen from 2003 to 2005. Roth was Van Halen's lead singer from 1974 to 1985 before briefly reuniting with the band in 1996. He returned as a full-time member of Van Halen from 2006 to their disbandment in 2020. SAMMY HAGAR ADMITS HE WOULDN’T BE AS ‘LEGENDARY’ WITHOUT VAN HALEN As Hagar and Roth fronted Van Halen during different eras, theymaintained a rivalryfor decades. However, the two teamed up when they co-headlined the \"Song for Song, The Heavyweight Champs of Rock and Roll\" tour, though they clashed behind the scenes and in the media. During a recent interview withRolling Stone,Hagar weighed in on whether he would ever consider sharing a bill with Roth again. Sammy Hagar, left, recently recalled his fury over David Lee Roth's no-shows during their 2002 tour.(SGranitz/WireImage) \"The circumstances would have to be right,\" he said. \"Dave always wants too much. He always tries to upstage. He tried to pull stuff on the Sam and Dave tour [in 2002]. The nights when he was opening, when we flip-flopped … which I would never do again. I would never bother. But look, I’m not an opening act for anybody.\" The Red Rocker claimedthat Rothwould let fans down by pulling out of shows at the last minute when they were touring together. LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

I wanted to break the guy’s f----’ neck.\" The two singers have been rivals for decades.(Kevin Kane/WireImage) Hagar claimed he might share a bill with Roth again if the \"circumstances\" were \"right.\"(SGranitz/WireImage) \"And the stupidest thing is, he did the worst when he headlined,\" he added. \"He couldn’t follow me with a band of kids playingEddie’s guitarsolo note for note and playing ‘Eruption’ and s---. He did his whole Van Halen show from 1983, and I’m going, ‘What an idiot!’ He should have represented himself a little more like who he was as a solo artist.\" Hagar rose to fame in the early 1970s as the lead singer of the rock band Montrose and later established himself as a successful solo act before becoming a member of Van Halen. While speaking with Rolling Stone, Hagar shared that he felt \"so fortunate\" to have had a solo career prior to joining Van Halen.

    "article_text": "Ric Bucher discusses who is to blame for the Los Angeles Lakers' first-round loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves among Luka Dončić, LeBron James, Austin Reaves, JJ Redick and others. The Los Angeles Lakers faced scrutiny last June when the franchise decided to hire an inexperienced JJ Redick as the franchise's next head coach. While Redick guided the Lakers to victory in a game against the Timberwolves in his coaching debut in October, Los Angeles came up short against Minnesota in the postseason. The Timberwolves held on for a103-96 victoryin Game 5 to eliminate the Lakers from playoff contention. Several critics have questioned Redick's decision-making during theplayoff series, especially his handling of the team's rotation.

    "title": "Vance denies Waltz's removal as NSA was due to 'Signalgate,' calls his UN ambassador nomination a 'promotion'",
    "article_text": "Vice President JD Vance discusses U.S. strikes against Houthis, Michael Waltz's nomination and trade negotiations on 'Special Report.' Vice President JD Vance saidMike Waltzhas the trust of both himself and President Donald Trump after the now-removed national security advisor was nominated Thursday to become the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. \"I think you could make a good argument that it’s a promotion,\" Vance said in an exclusive interview on \"Special Report\" from the Nucor Steel Berkeley plant in South Carolina. \"We brought Mike on to do some serious reforms at the National Security Council. He has done that.\" The former Ohio senator said the White House believes Waltz will better serve the administration as UN ambassador, a Senate-confirmed position. U.S. National Security Adviser Michael Waltz attends a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office of the White House on April 7, 2025 in Washington, DC.((Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)) Waltz’s exit comes nearly four months after he resigned fromhis Florida congressional seatto take the NSA role at the White House. The Army veteran faced growing scrutiny after he created a group chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal in late March, where top national security officials discussed pending attacks against the Houthis in Yemen. HEGSETH FACES LATEST BATTLE DEFENDING HIS DEFENSE SECRETARY POST AT THE PENTAGON Waltz inadvertently added The Atlantic’s editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg to the \"Houthi PC small group\" on Signal, whereDefense Secretary Pete Hegsethshared sensitive information about the timing of U.S. military strikes in Yemen. Hegseth, a former \"Fox & Friends Weekend\" co-host, maintains the information he shared was not classified. U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth delivers remarks during a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the Pentagon on Feb. 5 in Arlington, Va.(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Democrats have expressed disbelief that information relating to targets and strikes would not have been classified given its sensitive nature. The Pentagon’s acting inspector general isinvestigating Hegseth’s useof Signal. Vance told Fox News chief political anchor Bret Baier that Waltz’s ousting was not a result of \"Signalgate,\" which he called a \"nothingburger.\" He argued the former Florida congressman is simply being moved to another administration position because Trump believes Waltz would do a \"better job in a different role.\" The vice president was also added to theSignal group chatalong with DNI Tulsi Gabbard, CIA director John Ratcliffe and other senior members of the Trump administration. In the chat, Vance expressed his disagreement with the strikes, arguing that such action could be seen as \"inconsistent\" with Trump’s foreign policy messaging when it comes to European allies stepping up to the plate for their own defense. He viewed the strikes as \"bailing\" Europe out. U.S. Vice President JD Vance speaks as he visits Nucor Steel Berkeley on May 1, 2025 in Huger, South Carolina.((Photo by Kevin Lamarque-Pool/Getty Images)) \"I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There’s a further risk that we see a moderate to severespike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc,\" the vice president wrote in Signal. HOUTHIS SHOOT DOWN 3RD US REAPER DRONE AS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES DAILY AIRSTRIKES Vance told Baier that he believes the Signal chat reflected well on him because it shows his willingness to engage in conversation with other administration officials about how best to implement the president’s agenda. \"I think that's what a good national security team should do,\" he explained. The U.S. has been striking Houthi targets in Yemen for more than 40 days straight.US Central Command (CENTCOM)said in a statement earlier this week that since the start of Operation Rough Rider, it has struck over 800 targets. The strikes have killed hundreds of Houthi fighters and numerous leaders, including senior missile and UAV officials, according to CENTCOM. Vance said the Houthis see the consequences offiring on American shipsin international waters and disrupting global trade.

    "article_text": "Kennewick School Board President Gabe Galbraith and Vice President Micah Valentine react to Washington state school officials defying President Trump's executive order on transgender athletes in girls sports. President Donald Trump's newly formedTitle IX investigative teamhas been called upon in the state of Washington. Department of Education (DOE) Secretary Linda McMahon announced Wednesday the team will be launching an investigation into Washington Superintendent of Public InstructionChris Reykdal's office. The team, a joint initiative by the DOE and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), is taking action in response to Reykdal requiring schools to allow biologically male trans athletes on girls sports teams. \"Multiple Washington state school districts have reported that OSPI is requiring school boards to adopt policies that allow males to participate in female sports and occupy female-only intimate facilities, thereby raising substantial Title IX concerns,\" the announcement said. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM McMahon issued a warning to Reykdal and the rest of the Democrat-controlled state. \"Washington state appears to use its position of authority to coerce its districts into hiding ‘gender identity’ information from students’ parents and to adopt policies to covertly smuggle gender ideology into the classroom, confusing students and letting boys into girls sports, bathrooms and locker rooms,\" McMahon said. \"If true, these are clear violations of parental rights and female equality in athletics, which are protected by federal laws that will be enforced by the Trump administration.\" Reykdal provided a statement to Fox News Digital and did not indicate his office would cooperate with the federal investigation. \"My job as the leader of this constitutional office is to communicate, uphold and enforce the law,\" Reykdal said. \"My office will enforce our current laws as we are required to do until Congress changes the law and/or federal courts invalidate Washington state’s laws. Unless, and until that happens, we will be following Washington state’s laws, not a president’s political leanings expressed through unlawful orders.\" Reykdal spoke in defense oftransgender athletesin girls sports in an address Feb. 20, claiming it was \"inaccurate\" to say there are only two genders. \"It is quite simply inaccurate to say, biologically, that there are only boys and there are only girls,\" Reykdal said on camera. \"There's a continuum. There's a science to this. There are children who areborn intersex.There are children whose hormones and whose chromosomes are not consistent with their sex at birth.\" STATE EDUCATION CHIEF SAYS IT'S ‘INACCURATE’ TO SAY THERE ARE ONLY TWO GENDERS, IN DEFENSE OF TRANS ATHLETES Washington's high school athletes are allowed to compete based on their gender identity rather than their biological sex. Washington Interscholastic Activities Association (WIAA) policy states that each athlete will participate in programs \"consistent with their gender identity or the gender most consistently expressed,\" and there are no medical or legal requirements. Bills that would prohibit transgender girls from participating in girls and women's sports have been introduced but not passed. The Kennewick School Board filed a Title IX complaint with the DOE's Office of Civil Rights against Reykdal's office in late March over the issue. Kennewick School Board President Gabe Galbraith previouslytold Fox Newsthe district is seeking federal intervention to ensure the order will eventually be honored. SCHOOL BOARD PLEADS WITH TRUMP ADMIN TO FORCE STATE BAN ON TRANSGENDERS IN GIRLS SPORTS AS DEMOCRATS REFUSE \"There's boys participating in girls sports. There's boys in girls locker rooms. It's unfair. It's not safe, and we're asking the federal government to just step in and put an end to this and ensure that the state is following President Trump's statements,\" he said. Other school districts have taken a stand against Reykdal since President Trump signed his \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports\" executive order Feb. 5. TheTumwater School District'sboard of directors voted later that month to ban trans girls from playing for girls sports teams. The resolution passed by a vote of 3-1 after a civil rightscomplaint was filedagainst the district over an incident involving a trans athlete in a girls basketball game. The complaint alleged that the Tumwater School Districtin Washingtonis investigating 15-year-old Frances Staudt for \"misgendering\" the opponent and violating the district's policies against bullying and harassment Feb. 7. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP According to the document, Staudt asked the school's principal and athletic director before the game whether the player was a biological male. The administrators then allegedly confirmed that they had been notified that the player was transgender but denied her pleas to have the player removed. However, the DOE OCR announced an investigation into Tumwater School District just days later. Now, the Trump administration is going further up the chain of command in the state, and taking aim at the superintendent. In addition to reports that Washington schools are allowing trans athletes in girls sports, the DOE cited in its announcement Wednesday that La Center School District in La Center, Washington, received aletter of findingindicating Reykdal was requiring districts to enact policies, such as mandating that districts not notify parents of a change in their child’s \"gender identity,\" Follow Fox News Digital’ssports coverage on X,and subscribe tothe Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.

Gilmore agrees with President Donald Trump that making cuts to foreign funding requires a \"scalpel, not a hatchet,\" but asserts that more can be done to strategically reform foreign aid. \"The decisions we make today will create the world of tomorrow. If we start by abandoning foreign assistance, that new world will be run by China and our adversaries,\" Gilmore told Fox News Digital. \"Now more than ever, the U.S. needs to build up our military and national security strength while deploying a robust ‘soft’ power strategy and political initiative to counter China and Russia's growing global influence.\" Left to right: Russian President Vladimir Putin, U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping(Reuters) PETE MAROCCO, MASTERMIND BEHIND DISMANTLING OF USAID PROJECTS, LEAVES STATE DEPARTMENT However, Gilmore stressed in a recent op-ed that \"every dollar\" offoreign aidmust make America safer and stronger, and align with U.S. national strategy.

EUROPE STEPS UP TO FUND ITS OWN DEFENSE, PROVIDE SECURITY FOR UKRAINE AFTER TRUMP THREATS On Wednesday, Estonia officially welcomed the arrival of six HIMARS satellite-guided rocket systems made in the U.S. It’s a weapon that has been used in Ukraine effectively, destroying targets up to 186 miles away. \"We have created, as Estonians, the rule that if the U.S. is investing $1, we are adding $10 on top of that. And all this going back to [sic] goes back to the U.S. economy, and we are getting the capabilities,\" Tsahkna said. In recent weeks, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Finland and Poland announced they would withdraw from the Ottawa Convention, which bans the use of anti-personnel land mines. Russia, which is not party to the treaty, has deployed mines in the roughly 20% of Ukraine it now occupies. Estonia is a small country of 1.3 million people located in Eastern Europe, with an area about twice the size of New Jersey. It shares a 214-mileborder with Russia.

Today, it receives 80% of its natural gas from the U.S. Not all countries have been as defiant. The 27-nationEuropean Union, of which Estonia is a member, has only cut 60% of its energy imports from Russia. Last year, the European Union spent more on Russian oil and gas than aid to Ukraine, according to the Kiel Institute. The Kremlin is also waging war on another front as well. \"Russia is using religion of the church as a tool for their own political goals,\" Tsahkna said. The foreign minister also weighed in on Russia's proposed three-day ceasefire surrounding its May 9 celebrations marking the end of World War II. \"This is not that serious,\" Tsahkna replied. RUSSIA DECLARES 3-DAY CEASEFIRE IN UKRAINE FOR WWII VICTORY DAY Since late 2023, nearly a dozen undersea cables in the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Finland have been cut. Russia is suspected but \"it’s very hard to say exactly,\" Tsahkna said.

When asked about the prospects of a ceasefire and eventual end of hostilities in Ukraine, Tsahkna replied with a warning: \"President Trump has said very clearly that he wants to have peace.

    "article_text": "Adi and Yael Alexander, parents of Hamas captive Edan Alexander, discuss their plan to meet with lawmakers in Washington, D.C., and the Trump administration's insistence that bringing home Edan is a top priority. The parents of the American hostages still held by the Hamas terrorist organization in Gaza have called on PresidentDonald Trumpto use his reputation for being \"tough\" and apply pressure on not only known enemies but one of his closest allies: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. There are 59 hostages still in Gaza, at least 24 of whom are assessed to be alive, including American-IsraeliEdan Alexander, now 21 years old after having spent two birthdays in Hamas captivity. Itay Chen, 19, Omer Neutra, 21, Judy Weinstein Haggai, 70, and her husband, Gadi Weinstein, 73, are all believed to have beenkilled by Hamasin it's attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and whose bodies were taken into Gaza. \"I believe that the president is a very tough person, and he should be tough with the enemies and with friends as well,\" Adi Alexander, who is Edan's father, told Fox News Digital in a direct reference toIsrael. Edan Alexander and family(Adi Alexander) PRESIDENT TRUMP GAVE ME BACK MY LIFE AFTER 471 DAYS OF HAMAS CAPTIVITY – PLEASE SAVE THE REMAINING HOSTAGES \"We asked of the president to keep everybody accountable,\" Alexander, who sat next to his wife, Yael, described after the second phase of a ceasefire, which was supposed to begin in March but failed and Israel resumed military operations in the Gaza Strip to the immense frustration of mediators. In addition, the families urged Trump to keepNetanyahu\"on a short leash\" and to \"get him back to negotiate as soon as possible and stop this thing.\" Trump this week marked his 100th day in office, and the families of the five Americans still held hostage urged him to reflect on his strategy and apply pressure on both Israel and Hamas, through both economic and diplomatic means, to secure therelease of all 59 hostages. \"With the election results, we had such high hopes,\" Ruby Chen,father to Itay, told reporters during a press event on Wednesday. \"We know he cares about the topic, and we saw, even before the inauguration, his comments on the topic with the ‘hell to pay’ and ‘all the hostages need to come out.’\" \"But I think the 100-day mark that we are at this moment, I think it's a good time to reflect and say that the job's not done,\" said Chen, sitting next to his wife, Hagit Chen. Trump sparked international concern in February when he suggested theGaza Strip should be turnedinto the \"Riviera of the Middle East,\" and fears have mounted that as Washington continues to discuss potentially displacing Palestinians and Israel continues aggressive military operations, Hamas may be unwilling to give up its leverage: the hostages.

The families of the hostages are careful not to get overly involved in the heated political topics, but instead they have highlighted the importance of and need for a solid strategy to first secure the release of all remaining hostages, and then figure out a day-after plan. Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff has suggested that Hamas could become politically active in the Gaza Strip, but they need to fully disarm. \"I think the best approach will be just to call for both parties to rise above politics, although it will be very difficult with Hamas, which is politically struggling to survive in this region, but definitely to call on [the] Israeli government to rise above politics,\" Alexander said. \"Do not think about politically surviving and prioritize human life.\" Emaciated Israeli hostages, from left, Ohad Ben Ami, Eli Sharabi and Or Levy, who were held hostage by Hamas in Gaza since Oct. 7, 2023, are taken by terrorists to a stage before being handed over to the Red Cross in Deir al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip on Feb. 8, 2025.(AP/Abdel Kareem Hana) The families pointed to polling from Israel that shows nearly 70% of Israelis favor ending military operations against Hamas in order to return all the hostages more than 573 days since they were abducted, including some 48% of Netanyahu’s coalition base. Some 39% of his conservative base apparently oppose the strategy, and another 13% are unsure. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP While there is evident frustration among the families of the hostages, who have made clear the Israeli government has not offered anywhere near the same level of support or communication provided by both the Biden and Trump administrations, they said that, ultimately, the adversary is the terrorist organization that captured, in some instances killed, and continues to hold captive their loved ones. \"Just to be clear, Hamas is the enemy,\" said Neutra, who sat next to her husband, Ronen. \"Hamas committed these atrocious crimes. They're holding on to our family members. We don't want to see them continue to be a threat to Israel. \"But it's about priority, and it's about being in the situation for 19 months now,\" she added.

    "article_text": "Fox News national correspondent Griff Jenkins reports on the White House website changing the headline regarding COVID-19 origins to ‘Lab Leak’ on ‘Special Report.’ China is blaming the United States for theorigin of COVID-19,accusing Washington of \"evading responsibility\" for the virus amid multiple statements by President Donald Trump that it was leaked from a lab in Wuhan. In amultipage paper,the Communist regime said the infectious disease was present in the U.S. earlier than what was officially determined. \"The US should cease from shifting blame and evading responsibility, stop finding external excuses for its internal malaise, and genuinely reflect on and overhaul its public health policies,\" the paper states. \"The US cannot continue to turn a deaf ear to the numerous questions over its conduct.\" Fox News Digital has reached out to the White House. CREDIBILITY CRISIS: NEW YORK TIMES HELPED MISLEAD AMERICA OVER COVID LAB LEAK THEORY The new COVID.gov website showing the \"true origins\" of the coronavirus.(Covid.gov ) The paper came after the White House earlier this month revamped itsCOVID.gov website,showing the \"true origins\" of the disease. The website, which previously focused on promoting the vaccine to Americans, walks readers through evidence supporting the lab leak theory, how former National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci promoted the idea that COVID-19 originated naturally, former PresidentJoe Bidenpardoning Fauci for \"any offenses against\" the U.S. he may have committed, and providing details on the origin of the \"social distancing\" rules and mask mandates. The new site outlines that a biological characteristic found in the virus was not found in nature, bolstering the lab-leak theory, while noting that Wuhan, China, where the firstcoronavirus case was found,is also home to China's \"foremost SARs research lab\" and that \"if there was evidence of a natural origin it would have already surfaced.

However, China said in its paper that a past joint study conducted with the World Health Organization (WHO) found that COVID-19 was most likely transmitted from bats to humans via another animal.

    "article_text": "Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., and Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., speak at a press conference announcing a privileged resolution that would require the Trump administration to report on its work with El Salvador on prisoner negotiations and funding. Top Democrats announced an effort Thursday to force the Trump administration to provide a report on how it is specifically complying with a court order to facilitate the return of wrongfully deported U.S. residentsto El Salvador. The resolution to do so from Sens. Tim Kaine of Virginia, Charles Schumer of New York, Alex Padilla of California and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland is \"privileged,\" – meaning it will require a full Senate vote. Kaine cited the specific code under a 1961 foreign assistance law that allowed such. If passed, and the White House fails to abide by it, U.S. security assistance to El Salvador would be immediately frozen, Schumer, Kaine and Van Hollen said. NOT A MARYLAND MAN: GOP BLASTS DEMOCRAT SENATOR FIGHTING FOR RETURN OF SALVADORAN NATIONAL Sens. Chris Van Hollen, left, and Timothy Kaine, right, speak on a new resolution.(Fox News) At a press conference outside the Capitol, the three men laid out how the vote would work, and one lawmaker later disclosed a separate effort to schedule a vote on sanctions against El Salvador over President Nayib Bukele's work with Trump. \"I also send a message to the government of El Salvador,\" Kaine said during his remarks, breaking into Spanish midway. \"You might think it's cute right now to grab attention by a bromance with PresidentDonald Trump. He's going to be a president for poco mas (a short time) – tres anos mas (three years more).\" Continuing in Spanish, Kaine said the two countries will always have relations, before transitioning back to English to say that the U.S. will not soon forget \"you violating the human rights of American citizens, you're wrong.\" \"We will remember this forever,\" Kaine pledged. \"And there will be significant and challenging downstream consequences for any nation that violates the rights of Americans.\" KILMAR GARCIA NOW GETS 5 TOTAL DEM PROPONENTS IN EL SALVADOR The move was spurred by the case ofKilmar Abrego Garcia, a suspected MS-13 gang member who was deported from Maryland to his home country last month. Van Hollen later said the privileged resolution was not expresslyabout Garcia, but instead the greater idea that such people could be deported and/or treated without due process. Echoing Kaine on repercussions for San Salvador’s government from Washington, Van Hollen spoke of plans to also seek a sanctions vote against Bukele \"and all those who are part of his government conspiring with Donald Trump to deprive residents of the United States of their constitutional rights.\" Returning again to speaking bilingually, Kaine responded to a reporter’s question by summing up the privileged resolution in Spanish. \"We have a guarantee of a vote after ten days on El Salvador and we are sending a message to President Trump that he needs to follow the law. And we are also sending a message to President Bukele that we are not going to forget if the government of El Salvador is violating American human rights,\" he said. In a statement in English aside from the conference, Kaine said Bukele \"has rounded up tens of thousands of Salvadorans without due process and jammed them indefinitely into overpopulated torture centers. And now he’s trying to do the same to people living in the United States,\" Kaine said in a statement obtained by Fox News Digital prior to the conference. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"We will use this resolution to force accountability,\" said Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, a House supporter of the resolution – though Kaine said it does not require their blessing. Van Hollen, who took a junket to El Salvador to attempt to bring Garcia to Maryland – where his family lives – said Trump has failed to comply with the order to facilitate his return. Both Trump and Bukele appeared to agree in an Oval Office meeting last month that returning Garcia would be \"preposterous\" and that the court order didn’t quite say what critics said it did. Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso, R-Wyo., on Thursday devoted his floor speech to the overall subject of immigration and touched on the El Salvador matter. \"President Trump is off to a strong start. His strategic and historic deportation campaign, the largest in our history, is making our streets safer. The criminals President Trump is expelling are the worst of the worst. They are murderers, drug dealers, gang members, and human traffickers. They’re gone. In 100 days, 66,000 deportations have been carried out. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests of illegal immigrant criminals have already outpaced all of 2024 under Joe Biden,\" Barrasso said. \"Americans are thrilled that President Trump is enforcing the law and restoring order. The Democrats on the other hand are furious,\" he said. He cited Van Hollen's El Salvador trip, and riffed that the media dubbed Garcia \"a Maryland man.\" \"A member of this body (Van Hollen) – led that charge. In 2023, that member’s constituent Rachel Morin – a mother of five – was brutally murdered by an illegal immigrant. Did he speak out? No. Did he meet with her family? No. He refused. Yet he rushed to El Salvador to fight for a gang member.\" Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for comment. Charles Creitz is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

    "article_text": "Fencer Stephanie Turner reveals why she took herself out of the tournament when faced with a transgender opponent on 'America Reports.' House Republicanshave subpoenaed USA Fencing (USFA) board chair Damien Lehfeldt in an effort to compel him to testify in front of Congress during a hearing examining the participation of transgender women in biologically women's sports. The subpoena comes after USA Fencing's Chief Executive Officer Phil Andrews told the Subcommittee on Delivering on Government Efficiency, which intends to hold the hearing on May 7, that Lehfeldt would be unavailable to testify for unspecified reasons, according to a letter sent in tandem with the subpoena. Lehfeldt's apparent refusal to cooperate comes after he allegedly made public statements online indicating he had intended to be present at the hearing. \"Under the Ted Stevens Act, an [National Governing Body]—such as USFA—is required to provide equal opportunities to athletes regardless of sex when engaged in developing interest and participation in the sport it governs throughout the United States,\" the letter accompanying the subpoena stated, signed by GOP House Oversight Chairman James Comer. FEMALE FENCER DEFENDS PROTEST AGAINST TRANSGENDER OPPONENT \"The Subcommittee is concerned that the policies of USFA may not uphold these obligations and that the underlying law is not accomplishing its intended purpose. Therefore, the Subcommittee is investigating whether additional legislation regarding requirements of NGBs of amateur sports, like USFA, is necessary to address these issues.\" LehfeldtandAndrewshave both publicly expressed their support for allowing transgender women to compete on biological women's sports teams. House Republicans' decision to subpoena Lehfeldt follows an incident when a female fencer named Stephanie Turner was punished by USA Fencing for refusing to compete against a transgender competitor earlier this year. Turner, during a regional meet in March, refused to compete against a transgender competitor who had previously competed in the men's division. A video of her taking a symbolic knee at the start of the match, eventually earning her a \"black card,\" fencing's most severe penalty, went viral following the incident. Turner was ultimately disqualified from the event and escorted out of the venue immediately following her act of civil disobedience. ENGLAND SPORTS GOVERNING BODY BANS TRANSGENDER ATHLETES FROM WOMEN'S SOCCER FOLLOWING UK COURT RULING \"In fencing, personally, I see it quite often,\" Turner said following the incident. \"I have witnessed transgender fencers in women's tournaments and girls' tournaments in different age categories, specifically Y-14 (the youngest age group).\" Fencer Stephanie Turner kneels in front of a USA Fencing official(Courtesy of ICONS) The letter accompanying Lehfeldt's subpoena said the Subcommittee on Delivering on Government Efficiency requested multiple times that Lehfeldt provide an explanation for why he would not be in attendance to testify during the May 7 hearing. The letter said it exhausted several options to accommodate the USA Fencing board chair, including considering moving the date of the hearing and providing Lehfeldt extra time to obtain legal representation. USA Fencing's counsel subsequently asked the subcommittee whether it would be open to considering alternative witnesses, to which the committee said it would if they were made available on May 7. However, no reason for Lehfeldt's unwillingness to testify was provided, according toHouse Republicans. MARK CUBAN WEIGHS IN ON TRANSGENDER ATHLETES IN WOMEN'S SPORTS: ‘PEOPLE JUST AREN’T READY' Several days later USA Fencing indicated Andrews would be willing to participate in Lehfeldt's place, if the hearing could be moved two days later to May 9, according to House Republicans. A day later, they said, Lehfeldt indicated to the subcommittee that he was formally declining to testify.

When ICE agents, assisted by Oklahoma state police, carried out the raid, they encountered a naturalized U.S. citizen originally from Guatemala as well as three others, the youngest of whom was 17.

But characterizing it as the \"Republican Congress\" doesn’t do justice to the present circumstances. This truly is \"President Trump’s Congress.\" The president’s relationship with Republican lawmakers is light-years away from the fraught, shotgun marriage of 2017 after he unexpectedly captured the White House. Republicans on Capitol Hill didn’t know what to do with him.

They chortled at what they believed were untenable ideas emanating from the White House. And Trump also didn’t know what to do with congressional Republicans, either. He and then-House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., formed the Odd Couple of politics. But Trump’s relationship with then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., was even worse. So they focused on areas of agreement. Congressional Republicans viewed the Trump presidency as a means to an end. They saw an opportunity to pass some of their legislative priorities.

Mitch McConnell have a contentious relationship.(AP Photo; Reuters) McConnell muscled three of President Trump’sSupreme Courtnominees to confirmation, altering the contours of the high court for a generation. Ryan bored deeply into his area of expertise: tax policy. By Christmas 2017, the Republican-led Congress approved the vaunted \"Trump tax cuts.\" But they stumbled early on repealing and replacing ObamaCare. \"I will not sugarcoat this. This is a disappointing day for us,\" said Ryan when he had to yank an initial plan to end ObamaCare off the floor in the spring of 2017. TheHousefinally approved a revamped repeal and replace package more than a month later. But the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., torpedoed the effort with his vote against the plan later that summer.

But that doesn’t mean there isn’t GOP skepticism. \"Seems like that's a pretty tight timeframe,\" said Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., of Johnson’s aspirations. \"I'm not aware of any consensus, even within one of the bodies. Let alone a bicameral consensus.\" \"A July 4 timeframe will be optimistic,\" said Sen.

Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, relayed what he heard from constituents in Ohio. \"People were like, \"What's taking so long?’ They don't think it's rushed by any means. They're like, ‘Where's the bill?’\" said Davidson. \"If we don’t get this by mid-June, I think people back home are going to go ‘What are you guys doing?’\" This is why Democrats say Republicans are fretting privately. \"They’re clearly conflicted about Medicaid cuts,\" said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va. \"They're conflicted about raising the debt ceiling just with Republican votes. They've traditionally wanted to get Democratic votes for that and not do it all on their own. But if they do it in the reconciliation bill, they're going to have to do it all on their own.\" Sen. Tim Kaine(Reuters) AndRepublicansare starting to get nervous about the success or failure of the bill. The president – and most congressional Republicans – have banked their entire political calculus on this gambit. \"It's a job for alcohol. Not coffee,\" said Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., noting the anxiety now permeating congressional Republicans. \"Some of them would make a Valium nervous.\" Kennedy contends he’s not worrying. But says that even after another two months of hand-wringing, the Senate \"won’t reach consensus. Nor will the House.\" But who will forge common ground? \"The president is going to have to be the arbiter because he's going to put his muscle behind this to sell it,\" observed Kennedy. The sides are much more in sync. But this bill is such a behemoth that 53 Senate Republicans and 220 House GOPers won’t be able to sort this out on their own. They will look to the president to solve this. \"What do you think is the difference between Republicans and how they responded to President Trump during his first term? And what you see now?\" yours truly asked Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. \"I think they are much more afraid of him now. He's done much more in terms of threatening them in both privately and even publicly,\" replied Schumer. \"They don't know what to do. They’re between a rock and a hard place. On the one side, Trump threatens. On the other side, there are the American people who hate what Trump is proposing.\" I posed a similar interrogative to Senate Majority LeaderJohn Thune, R-S.D. Senate Majority Leader John Thune(Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images) \"Can you characterize the difference in the response from congressional Republicans to President Trump this time around, compared to 2017? They seemed a little skeptical of him in 2017. That's not the case now,\" I observed. \"We all watched what happened in November and the mandate he got from the American people. It was clear. It was decisive,\" said Thune. \"A lot of us who served with him in the last term also saw the effects and the results of a lot of the decisions that he made with respect to policy. And they were the right ones. And in the end, he was proven right when it came to the economy, the border and national security.\" The point is that Trump enjoys a very different Congress compared to the one he tangled with in 2017. It’s Trump’s Congress now. GOPers will generally do what he asks. But when it comes to the tax cut and spending package, Trump must ultimately make the decisions on specific items he wants in the legislation. The question is whether the president will eventually rule things in or out. Trump’s Congress will respond to that.

He wants his one big, beautiful bill,\" said House Republican Conference Chairwoman Lisa McClain, R-Mich., on Fox. \"I wouldn't want be the one that stands in the way of the president on his agenda.\" But this won’t be easy.

    "article_text": "Fox News Digital obtained video from Southern Illinois University’s school of medicine, where several administrators pushed back against Trump executive orders. (Southern Illinois University) FIRST ON FOX:Leaked video obtained by Fox News Digital shows school administrators at an Illinois school of medicine rejecting multiple Trump executive orders, including on combatting DEI, and outlining how the school plans to fight back against them. Trump’s executive order on gender ideology \"is an attack on women\" and on \"basic human rights,\" according to Dr. Jerry Kruse, Dean, Provost, and CEO of Southern Illinois University (SIU) School of Medicine. Kruse recently gave a speech in a small group discussion about Trump’s executive orders and actions that was obtained by the medical and policy advocacy group Do No Harm. \"We will resist obeying in advance. We won't do any anticipatory obedience,\" Kruse said. \"The existing laws have not changed, no court directives will require any change in compliance at this time.\" Kruse added that \"these executive orders and actions and the general philosophy that they espouse constitute direct attacks on all that is important to us\" while mentioning science, higher education and healthcare.

Kruse explained that the school of medicine is \"very fortunate\" to be part of a university system that is \"on top of it\" in terms of pushing back on Trump’s executive orders. Kruse also claimed that the executive orders on immigration and DEI from the Trump administration are \"an attack on human rights and on justice and fairness\" that \"have engendered fear among large segments of the population of law-abiding people.\" At one point in his speech, Kruse said he would provide employees with the \"resources\" to \"fight back.\" The SIU school system has been active in promoting DEI in recent years, and it was a topic discussed in the presentation.

Theschool’s websitehosts a page featuring its work on DEI that says it works to \"ensure that our students, residents, faculty, and staff reflect the demographics of central and southern Illinois while also equipping them with the knowledge and skills to address health disparities through culturally responsive care, patient access, education, and health literacy initiatives.\" In February of this year, the SIU Board of Trusteesreaffirmed its commitmentto DEI and the school’s VP of anti-racism and DEI, Sheila Caldwell, claimed that DEI is \"lifesaving\" and has had measurable improvements for minority students in retention rates. SIUSOM receives millions in active grant funding from NIH and HHS and Dr. Donald Torry, Associate Dean for Research, said during the presentation that none of the grant funding has been affected so far. In terms of immigration executive orders, Dr. Vidhya Prakash, Associate Dean of Clinical Affairs and Population Health and Chief Medical Officer, said during the presentation that a school dean recently sent an email to faculty members instructing them not to comply with ICE and that they should call security if a situation arises. \"So please understand that no member of our school of medicine whether it's an employee or its a trainee, should have to engage in conversation or discourse with ICE,\" she said, adding that the school has patients who are \"afraid\" and live in fear of being apprehended. \"Continue doing what you have been doing,\" Paulette Dove, Senior Counsel for Health Affairs for the SIU system, said during the presentation, adding that the \"law has not changed.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP President Donald Trump speaks with reporters at the White House.(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) \"These issues demand a strong institutional and collective response,\" Kruse said. \"Thankfully, the SIU system stands firm with a strong voice.

Miller appeared alongside White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt during a Thursday morning briefing, declaring that the administration is bringing a \"system of merit\" back to the U.S. \"This administration is not going to let our society devolve into communist, woke, DEI strangulation,\" Miller said. \"We are going to have a system of merit.\" \"It's not just a social and cultural issue, it's an economic issue.

Crockett, a first-term progressive who has made headlines for several controversial comments this year, appeared unaware of the apparent double standard, which drew criticism from conservative accounts and commentators andRepublican lawmakers. \"As far as I'm concerned, you randomly kidnapping folk and you throwing them out of the country against their civil rights, against their constitutional rights,\" Crockett said in a video posted to her Instagram page, which as 1.3 million followers. \"And, frankly, how would they feel if some other country decided that they were gonna just start throwing people randomly in our country?

    "title": "Top GOP nominee in Virginia race defiant after Youngkin advisor denies ‘extortion’ claims",
    "article_text": "Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin discusses the Virginia elections and top issues facing voters. The campaign for Virginia’s Republican nominee for lieutenant governor is pushing back amid a firestorm of controversy and Republican infighting in Virginia, which has pitted the nominee against Gov.Glenn Youngkin. A source familiar with the conversations told Fox News Digital that a Youngkin advisor attempted to solicit business from thelieutenant governornominee just days before allegedly attempting to extort him. John Reid, the Republican nominee for lieutenant governor, is refusing to drop out of the race after being pressured to do so by the governor because of lewd photos he allegedly posted on a Tumblr account. In a video posted on Sunday, Reid, who is gay, denied that the Tumblr account with lewd photos belonged to him. He said he would not back down from the race and accused the Youngkin-linked Spirit of Virginia political action committee, which is run by Matt Moran, of attempted \"extortion.\" Reid also said Spirit of Virginia offered to purchase the negative research against him gathered by Republican-aligned America Rising PAC and to bring an end to the negative coverage. AFTER HURRICANE HELENE, VIRGINIA COUPLE WELCOMES NEW HOME BUILT BY VOLUNTEERS Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (Right) explained that he wanted Lt. Gov. nominee John Reid to step down from race because allegations were a \"distraction,\" but added that the \"decision is John’s and up to John.\"(John Reid Campaign/AP) Reid’s team filed a cease-and-desist letter against Moran on Monday. Moran has since filed an affidavit in which he denied attempting to extort Reid's team, saying, \"I never attacked John and did not threaten or coerce him\" and \"I communicated what I truly believed was in his best interests in my judgement.\" Moran said he was \"clear in the meeting that I had acted on the information as a friend and colleague of John Reid, and adamantly deny the characterization of the meeting.\" However, audio of an April 25 conversation with Moran and Reid’s team, which was obtained and reviewed by Fox News Digital, casts doubt on Moran’s characterization of the conversation. During the conversation, Moran stated that \"if John were to step aside … I would go buy it all from America Rising, if that's what you want. The campaign could go buy it all from America Rising.\" At another point in the conversation, Moran states that \"it is in no one's best interest for any of this to continue\" and that if Reid \"stays in the race, it is going to continue.\" FORMER CONGRESSWOMAN TURNED VA GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE ABIGAIL SPANBERGER ACCUSED OF ETHICS VIOLATION The Virginia State Capitol(AP Photo/Steve Helber/File) \"That hurts our candidates up and down the ticket,\" said Moran, adding, \"Him getting out of the race is the only way it stops, and then, yeah, it absolutely would have to stop forevermore after that.\" Additionally, a source familiar with the conversations told Fox News Digital that Moran pitched the Reid campaign services from hisadvertising company, Creative Direct, in a conversation on April 21. Youngkin has explained his decision to ask Reid to step down by saying that \"explicit social media content like this is a distraction\" and \"it’s a distraction for campaigns, and it’s a distraction from people paying attention to the most important issues.\" He noted, however, that \"the decision is John’s and up to John.\" WINSOME EARLE-SEARS KNOCKS GUBERNATORIAL OPPONENT FOR HIDING BIDEN'S HEALTH: SHE CANNOT BE TRUSTED Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin(Sarah Silbiger/Getty Images) A spokesperson for Reid’s campaign claimed in a statement to Fox News Digital that \"the threat was clear\" in the April 25 conversation and that \"Moran’s affidavit denying it is not accurate.\" The spokesperson added that \"it’s deeply unfortunate he chose to create this distraction for the party after failing to secure business for himself from the campaign.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In response to these accusations, Moran referred Fox News Digital to Wednesday'sX postin which he said, \"I've known John Reid for years and consider him a friend\" and that \"over the last nine days, I was actively supporting and assisting John as the Lt. Governor nominee of the Republican Party.\" \"Let me be clear, facts matter, and they will demonstrate the accusations against me are unfounded,\" Moran said. The X post Moran shared included a letter from his attorney, George Terwilliger, in which the attorney stated that \"the facts, evidence, and witnesses would demonstrate that Mr. Moran never attempted to extort, coerce, or pressure Mr. Reid directly or indirectly, but rather as a seasoned professional endeavored to provide sound advice regarding the viability of Mr. Reid's candidacy to someone he counted as a friend.\" Peter Pinedo is a politics writer for Fox News Digital.",

    "article_text": "John Fabbricatore, a former Denver ICE field office director, discusses the arrests of Tren de Aragua members and other criminals on 'The Story.' A federal judge has allowed Venezuelans targeted for deportation under the Alien Enemies Act in the Southern District of Texas to proceed with a class-action lawsuit against PresidentDonald Trump'sadministration. U.S. District Judge Fernando Rodriguez Jr., who was appointed by Trump during his first term, issued a 12-page order on Thursday granting a group of petitioners \"class certification.\" \"The unusual circumstances of this case present a compelling justification to utilize a procedure equivalent to a class action authorized by Rule 23,\" Rodriguez wrote. The Trump administration has argued the petitioners have \"no basis\" to establish a protected legal class \"to resolve whether an alien has been properly included in the category of alien enemies–necessarily individual determinations.\" TRUMP TO NAME HAITIAN GANGS FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS: REPORT More than 250 suspected gang members arrive in El Salvador after being deported by the Trump administration on March 16.(El Salvador Presidency/Handout/Anadolu via Getty Images) The judge considered whether individual \"habeas corpus hearings\" would be required for every Venezuelan national targeted under the Alien Enemies Act in the Southern District of Texas to determine whether they aremembers of Tren de Aragua,the Venezuelan gang the State Department designated as a foreign terrorist organization in March. Rodriguez said \"requiring individualized habeas corpus proceedings to repeatedly address the common legal issues unduly wastes judicial resources.\" Trump issued anexecutive orderon March 14, \"Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren De Aragua.\" About 100 people have been detained in the Southern District of Texas and \"designated as alien enemies under the Proclamation,\" Rodriguez noted. \"The present matter raises many common questions of law, but also indisputably raises some questions of fact that would require individualized hearings to resolve,\" Rodriguez wrote on Thursday. \"As to the former, Petitioners challenge the lawfulness of the President’s invocation of the AEA through the Proclamation. \"They argue, primarily, that the preconditions required to apply the AEA do not exist, that the intended application of the Proclamation and the AEA violate the designated alien enemies’ due process rights under the Constitution, and that the procedures that Respondents seek to follow violate the Immigration and Nationality Act and the Convention Against Torture. More than 250 suspected gang members arrive in El Salvador by plane on March 16, including 238 alleged members of Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang and 23 members of the MS-13 gang who were deported.(El Salvador Presidency/Handout/Anadolu via Getty Images) TRUMP ADMIN REVOKES 4K FOREIGN STUDENTS' VISAS IN FIRST 100 DAYS, NEARLY ALL WITH SERIOUS CRIMINAL RECORDS \"These issues hold true for any individual that Respondents designate as an alien enemy under the Proclamation and subject to removal under the AEA,\" the order said. \"A favorable result on any of these legal theories as to one individual will prove equally applicable to other Venezuelan aliens designated as alien enemies under the Proclamation. As a result, the Court finds that Petitioners identify at least one contention that is central to the validity of each class member’s claims.\" The judge acknowledged that, at the same time, \"petitioners cannot deny that whether any particular individual is a member of TdA would require a fact-specific, individualized determination.\" \"It is true that the Court would have to determine the applicable legal standard, and this analysis would apply to every class member. But the hearings themselves would proceed individually, as the relevant facts for each person differ,\" he said. According to Reuters,the Trump administration deported at least 137 Venezuelans from the El Valle Detention Center inRaymondville, Texas,under the Alien Enemies Act on March 15, but relatives of dozens of the men say they are not TdA members. In a separate 36-page opinion, Rodriguez also said Thursday the Trump administration could not rely on the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan nationals who are TdA member anyway because the gang's presence in the U.S. cannot be classified as an \"invasion\" or \"predatory incursion\" under federal law. \"Neither the Court nor the parties question that the Executive Branch can direct the detention and removal of aliens who engage in criminal activity in the United States,\" Rodriguez, nominated by Trump in 2018, wrote. \"The President’s invocation of the AEA through the Proclamation exceeds the scope of the statute and is contrary to the plain, ordinary meaning of the statute’s terms. Seventeen alleged members of Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang and members of the MS-13 gang were deported to El Salvador by the U.S on March 31.(El Salvador Press Presidency Office/Anadolu via Getty Images) \"The Court concludes that the President’s invocation of the AEA through the Proclamation exceeds the scope of the statute and, as a result, is unlawful,\" Rodriguez wrote. In mid-April, Rodriguez granted a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from removing Venezuelans held at the Raymondville detention center. The judge later broadened his ruling to protect all Venezuelans detained in his judicial district, which includes the cities of Houston, Galveston, Laredo, McAllen, Brownsville, Corpus Christi and Victoria, from deportation. Rodriguez’s ruling Thursday is significant because it is the first formal permanent injunction against the administration using the AEA and contends the president is misusing the law. The Trump administration claims that TdA is acting at the behest of the Venezuelan government. \"The Proclamation makes no reference to and in no manner suggests that a threat exists of an organized, armed group of individuals entering the United States at the direction of Venezuela to conquer the country or assume control over a portion of the nation,\" Rodriguez wrote. \"Thus, the Proclamation’s language cannot be read as describing conduct that falls within the meaning of ‘invasion’ for purposes of the AEA.\" The judge also noted that the provision has only been used during the two World Wars and the War of 1812. If the administration appeals, it would go first to the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. That is among the nation’s most conservative appellate courts, and it also has ruled against what it saw as overreach on immigration matters by both the Obama and Biden administrations. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Supreme Court has already weighed in once on the issue of deportations under the AEA. The justices held that migrants alleged to be gang members must be given \"reasonable time\" to contest their removal from the country. The Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report.

In 1973, then-President Richard Nixon made a similar move when he named national security advisor Henry Kissinger to also serve as secretary of state, State Department records show. Waltz and other National Security Council staffers were ousted from their office on Thursday in the most high-profile executive office exits of the second Trump administration. Trump's announcement on naming Waltz as U.N. ambassador unfolded just hours after the news began circulating. The former national security advisor had been at the heart of the Signal chat leak debacle that unfolded in March, when the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic magazine was inadvertently added to a group chat with high-profile Trump officials such as Waltz, Secretary of DefensePete Hegsethand CIA Director John Ratcliffe discussing military strikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen. Speculation had mounted for weeks that Waltz would be removed from his position amid the fallout of the chat leak, though the administration has maintained that no classified material was shared in the group chat and that the president had confidence in his National Security Council team.

Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., withdrew her nomination in March, including David Friedman, former U.S. ambassador to Israel; Ellie Cohanim, former deputy special envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism at the State Department under the first Trump administration; and special presidential envoy Richard Grenell. Grenell said he was a \"hard no\" on servingin the U.N. ambassadorrole ahead of Trump's announcement. Trump announced Stefanik as his original choice for the role in November 2024, just days after his successful election against former Vice PresidentKamala Harris.

Sources told Fox News that Waltz and his deputy Alex Wong are out, with additional names likely to come. Democrats on Thursday said they would not be the last. Hours after Waltz was ousted as national security advisor, Trump named the former U.S. representative as ambassador to the United Nations. Rep. Elise Stefanik withdrew her nomination for the post earlier this year, so she could hold onto her House seat to protect the Republican Party's slim majority. \"I am pleased to announce that I will be nominating Mike Waltz to be the next United States Ambassador to the United Nations,\" Trump said on Truth Social.

The challenge is taking off on social media and has raised nearly $400,000 on the event’s fundraising site. EXPERIMENTAL ALS DRUG COULD OFFER NEW HOPE FOR PATIENTS IF APPROVED, RESEARCHERS SAY The trend revival has sparked some controversy for taking attention away fromALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis),also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. The average life expectancy after ALS diagnosis is typically two to five years, according to the ALS Association.

    "article_text": "Registered dietitian nutritionist Ilana Muhlstein from Los Angeles breaks down the foods that are considered healthy but are high in calories More people are focused on staying healthy and fit as they grow older — but it's true that it can become more challenging with age. New research has revealed that cellular changes during the aging process can cause belly fat — and that's exacerbated by stress and sleep issues that contribute toweight gain. \"People often lose muscle and gain body fatas they age— even when their body weight remains the same,\" study author Qiong (Annabel) Wang, Ph.D., an assistant professor in the Department of Molecular & Cellular Endocrinology at City of Hope, said in a press release. 'OATZEMPIC' DIET DRINK FOR WEIGHT LOSS: DOES IT WORK AND IS IT SAFE? Published in the journal Science, the preclinical research involved experiments on mice that were later confirmed with human cells. New research points to human cells changing with age, which can contribute to belly fat.(iStock) Researchers focusedon a group of stem cells called adipocyte progenitor cells (APCs) within the fatty tissue responsible for age-related weight gain. When they transplanted these cells from mice of various ages into another group of younger mice, they noticed the creation of large numbers of fat cells within the younger mice. MEN FACE HIGHER CANCER RISK WITH THIS SPECIFIC BODY FAT MEASUREMENT However, when they transplanted a batch of cells from young mice into old mice, they did not see the same effect. The results confirmed that older stem cells are more likely to lead to new fat cells, regardless of the age of the host receiving them, the press release noted. Older cells were found to produce more fat regardless of the host's age.(iStock) \"While most adult stem cells’ capacity to grow wanes with age, the opposite holds true with APCs — aging unlocks these cells’ power to evolve and spread,\" said Adolfo Garcia-Ocana, chair of the Department of Molecular & Cellular Endocrinology at City of Hope, in the press release. Aging also changes these APCs into yet another group of cells called committed preadipocytes, age-specific (CP-As), which actively churn out new fat cells. FAKE OZEMPIC DRUGS FOUND IN US DRUG SUPPLY, FDA WARNS Humans have a \"signaling pathway\" — a chemical reaction that controls how the body makes cells — called the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR), experts said. \"Our research indicates that LIFR plays a crucial role in triggering CP-As to create new fat cells and expand belly fat in older mice,\" Wang said in the same release. Despite the effects of aging, there are steps people can take toprevent expanding waistlines, according to Dr. Sajad Zalzala, co-founder and chief medical officer of AgelessRx in Detroit, Michigan. \"As we age, our ability to maintain lean muscle mass decreases, which contributes to metabolic slowdown and increased fat storage, particularly around the abdomen.\"(iStock) \"As we age, our ability to maintain lean muscle mass decreases, which contributes to metabolic slowdown and increased fat storage, particularly around the abdomen,\" Zalzala, who was not involved in the City of Hope study, told Fox News Digital.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Eating protein at the beginning of the day keeps you full longer, stabilizes blood sugar and encourages muscle maintenance, according to the doctor. \"Chronically high cortisol levels, which can be driven bypoor sleepor stress, promote fat storage, especially around the waist,\" Zalzala noted.

    "article_text": "Mount Sinai urology chair Dr. Ash Tewari joins ‘Fox News Live’ to discuss the PSA test designed to catch the ‘silent killer.’ A new means ofprostate cancer screeningcould emerge as an alternative to the PSA test, which has long been the first-line option. Using machine learning, a form ofartificial intelligence, Swedish researchers analyzed urine samples from more than 2,000 men with prostate cancer, along with a control group. They determined that the simple, non-invasive urine test was able to detect biomarkers of prostate cancer with a high degree of accuracy — and could also determine the grade (stage) of the disease. The results were published in the journal Cancer Research. PROSTATE CANCER DRUG NOW AVAILABLE TO MORE PATIENTS WITH AGGRESSIVE FORM OF DISEASE \"Prostate cancer can be effectively identified by analyzing the expression of candidate biomarkers in urine,\" confirmed lead author Martin Smelik from Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden, who spoke to Fox News Digital about the findings. A new means of prostate cancer screening could emerge as an alternative to the PSA test, which has long been the first-line option.(iStock) \"This approach outperforms the current blood tests based on PSA, but at the same time keeps the advantages of being non-invasive, painless and relatively cheap.\" The researchers were surprised by the \"heterogeneity of tumors,\" which refers to \"the differences between tumors of the same type in different patients, the differences betweencancer cellswithin a single tumor, or the differences between a primary (original) tumor and a secondary tumor,\" according to the National Cancer Institute. PROSTATE CANCER RISK INCREASES BY 45% AMONG MEN WHO SHARE ONE TROUBLING BEHAVIOR \"One of the main challenges of the study was to overcome this and to identify biomarkers that were specific for prostate cancer, but also expressed in all types of patients,\" Smelik said. Dr. Timothy Showalter, a radiation oncologist at UVA Health in Virginia and chief medical officer at Artera, was not involved in the study but commented on the findings. A simple, non-invasive urine test was able to detect biomarkers of prostate cancer with a high degree of accuracy, the study found.(iStock) \"This study highlights the power ofmachine learningapplied to patient data in identifying breakthroughs that can help us diagnose cancer earlier, when our treatments are most effective,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"Prostate cancer screening has not seen a transformative advance in decades, and current approaches still rely on the PSA blood test, which is known to have low specificity for clinically significant cancers.\" The existing PSA test works by monitoring levels of prostate-specific antigen in the blood. It can be used to screen for prostate cancer or monitor the disease’s progression, but some risks and limitations have been noted. \"Prostate cancer screening has not seen a transformative advance in decades.\" Matthew C. Abramowitz, M.D., co-chair and clinical lead of the Genitourinary Malignancies Site Disease Group at the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center in Miami, Florida, echoed the need for alternatives to the PSA test. \"While PSA is an incredibly sensitive tool for issues related to the prostate, it is not specific to prostate cancer,\" Abramowitz, who was not involved in the study, told Fox News Digital. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"The techniques proposed in the current study suggest the promise of identifying specific cancer markers in the urine, minimizing some of the specificity concerns associated with PSA.\" While PSA has the advantage of simplicity, quickness and reasonable cost, determining the meaning behind any abnormal findings often requires further testing, such as MRIs and biopsies, the doctor noted. The existing PSA test works by monitoring levels of prostate-specific antigen in the blood, but some risks and limitations have been noted.(iStock) False positives are also common with the PSA test, occurring in about 6% to 7% of the cases. \"Only about25% of menwho have a biopsy due to an elevated PSA level are found to have prostate cancer,\" states the NIH. The study did have some limitations, chiefly the low number of samples. \"The urine prostate cancer prediction model was performed on a small data set and appears to be largely an analysis of European men, both of which may limit its applicability to other high-risk prostate cancer populations,\" Abramowitz noted. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER The test could also come with a significant cost increase due to the specialized equipment necessary to perform the analyses, he added. The researchers acknowledged the need for larger studies to validate the findings and to potentially include other cancers. This work may pave the way for more specific screening methods that improve our ability to detect high-grade cancers before they progress or metastasize, ultimately improving cure rates and reducing treatment-related morbidity.\"(iStock) \"While this study was focused specifically on prostate cancer, we believe that some of the methods could be generalized to other cancers as well, which we would like to try in our future studies,\" Smelik said. The ultimate goal, according to the researchers, is to achieve more efficient screening programs within the next few years, potentially helping toprevent and treat prostate cancer.

    "article_text": "John Evenson, a tugboat that sank in 1895, was recently discovered by a team of maritime experts. It was found in Lake Michigan. (Wisconsin Historical Society) Archaeologists recently made a startling discovery: They found that two 18th-century shipwrecksoff the coast of Central Americawere actually two Danish slave ships. The ships, named Fridericus Quartus and Christianus Quintus, are located in shallow waters off Costa Rica's Cahuita National Park. The 18th-century vessels were shipwrecked in 1710, according to the National Museum of Denmark. \"Fridericus Quartus was set ablaze, while Christianus Quintus had its anchor rope cut, following which the ship was wrecked in the surf,\" the museum's press release noted. \"Until now, it has not been clear exactly where the ships were lost.\" RARE 4,000-YEAR-OLD MUSICAL INSTRUMENT 'BURIED IN THE GROUND' PUZZLES ARCHAEOLOGISTS Pictures show divers carefully examining the shipwreck, which shows signs of significant decay from the past 315 years. Though the ships were excavated in 2023, researchers didn't know that they were slave ships until recently. The vessels were long believed to be pirate ships. Divers recently unveiled the findings from an excavation of two Danish slave ships, Fridericus Quartus and Christianus Quintus. The vessels were long believed to be pirate ships.(Jakob Olling / National Museum of Denmark) The excavation involved, in part, taking samples from the wood of the ships, as well as yellow bricks that were part of the ship's cargo. Researchers also conducted dendrochronological analyses — tree-ring dating — to determine where the wood came from. They found it came from Northern Europe. \"The timbers originate in the western part of the Baltic Sea, an area that encompasses the northeastern German province of Mecklenburg, as well as Schleswig-Holstein, Denmark and Scania — and that the tree was cut down sometime during the years 1690-1695,\" the release said.

    "title": "Married women face REAL ID documentation hurdles: 'I can't accept this'",
    "article_text": "Fox News correspondent Chanley Painter reports on growing concerns from lawmakers and travelers as the deadline to use Real ID-compliant licenses for air travel gets closer. Some married women across the U.S. are sharing that they've been facing unexpected hurdles in obtaining their REAL ID as the May 7th deadline looms to have the documentation tofly domestically. The common obstacle among them is proving their name change due to marriage without having in their possession their originalmarriage certificateneeded to verify that change. It has become a logistical nightmare, for example, for Dorothy Ballone — formerly Hotchkiss — of Rochester, New York. She's been on a mission to try to obtain her original marriage certificate from 67 years ago, she told Fox News Digital this week. NEW JERSEY ADDS REAL ID 'EMERGENCY' APPOINTMENTS AS AIRLINES SHARE URGENT REMINDERS The nonagenarian has been working since February to track down the authentic document since being turned down on her first trip to the Department ofMotor Vehiclesin New York. \"I found online all the documents that I would need, my Social Security [card], my birth certificate. A couple of things stating where you live, like your utility bill and your bank statement, stuff like that — and your marriage license,\" said Ballone. A REAL ID sign reminding travelers of the documentation they need is shown above in an airport this week.(Fox News Digital) \"I had even more documents than that with me.\" She arrived at the DMV with a copy of her marriage license from Aug. 19, 1958, along with certification stating that the document was an exact photocopy of the original with a notary public's stamp and all applicable information. \"I put all my documents on the counter, and [a clerk] pulled out the marriage license and said, 'I can't accept this.' And I said, ‘Why not?’ She said, 'It's a copy.' And I said, 'That's all I have.' And she said, ‘No, I need the original,’\" Ballone told Fox News Digital. She went on a wild goose chase to try to obtain her original marriage license. Ballone said she was told to go toher churchto obtain the original. Ballone reached out to the church in East Rochester where she was married, and was told the church does not have marriage licenses dating back that far. LOOMING REAL ID DEADLINE CAUSES CHAOS AT DMVS AS CRITICS TAKE TO SOCIAL MEDIA She then went on a wild goose chase as she tried to obtain her original marriage license — reaching out to local clerks' offices, government officials, even the Diocese of Rochester. The city of Rochester eventually claimed to have the original marriage license — and mailed it. Some married women nationwide are facing unexpected hurdles as they try to obtain their REAL ID in time for the May 7th deadline.(Fox News Digital) The document she received was certified, yet Ballone was denied a REAL ID once again, she said. She has been in contact with her local assemblywoman and the assistant commissioner of the New York Department of Motor Vehicles, she told Fox News Digital. NEED REAL ID IN A HURRY? HERE ARE SOME ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS OUTSIDE THE DMV Even though she's lived under her married name for decades and has a driver’s license bearing her married name, the state has continued to denyher REAL ID application,Ballone said, until she provides her official marriage document. They've heard from DMV officials that this has become an issue. Ballone told Fox News Digital that two of her neighbors are having the same issue with tracking down their original marriage licenses. They said they've heard from DMV officials that this has become an issue. Fox News Digital reached out to the city of Rochester, New York.

    "article_text": "Cybersecurity and privacy attorney Leeza Garber breaks down concerns over Chinese ownership of TikTok on 'Fox Report.' None of us signed up for our personal info to be bought and sold online. Between data brokers, people-search sites and all the other places our details end up, it happens constantly and usually without us even realizing it. If you’ve everGoogled yourselfand found your phone number or home address floating around on some shady-looking website, you know the feeling. If that’s you, you probably started looking for ways to remedy the situation and may be wondering if it’s better to remove your personal information from the web yourself or use a data removal service.

A woman working on her laptop(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) When the data broker problem first got on my radar (granted, it was because data removal services started to emerge), I figured I could just opt out on my own. After all, most of them have opt-out pages with a process. Whitepages, one of the most popular people-search sites, for example, has the following process. This is just one example, but other search sites have similar opt-out processes, give or take a few steps. A man working on a laptop(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) INSURANCE DATA BREACH EXPOSES SENSITIVE INFO OF 1.6 MILLION PEOPLE If you want to remove your information from all (or most) of the data brokers that have it, here’s what you’ll have to do. It’s definitely doable, but not painless. Some sites make it easier, but others require you to upload your ID (not recommended), ask you to send snail mail or outright reject your request unless you use a specific email domain, not to mention all the CAPTCHAs that feel like they were designed to break your spirit. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? A woman working on her laptop(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) HOW TO GET RID OF ROBOCALLS WITH APPS AND DATA REMOVAL SERVICES I’ve since tried using a data removal service that automates the opt-out process, handling the complexities on your behalf. See below for what this gives you. I didn’t have to babysit the process, and I didn’t have to guess whether it was working. I just got updates when the removals were confirmed. GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE If you’re still weighing your options, here’s how the two approaches stack up. Manual opt-outs demand a significant time investment, requiring you to personally navigate each data broker’s unique removal process. While free, this approach offers variable coverage depending on how diligently you track down brokers, and consistency is challenging; you’ll need to repeat the process regularly tokeep your data private. Success also depends heavily on your ability to decipher vague opt-out instructions and adapt to each broker’s requirements. In contrast, data removal services save time by handling the legwork for you. They provide broad coverage by targeting numerous brokers simultaneously and maintain consistency through ongoing monitoring. While these services come with subscription fees, they eliminate the need for personal expertise, offering a hands-off solution to data privacy. After testing both manual opt-outs and automated services, using a personal data removal service emerges as the clear solution for reclaiming your data. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.Check out my top picks for data removal services here. If you’ve got the time and patience, you can absolutely take the DIY route. But if you’re looking for a way to protect your privacy without sinking hours into research, filling out forms and monitoring, a data removal service makes things a lot quicker and more convenient. For most people, this is likely the better option. Many states have privacy laws that give you the right to request that data brokers remove your personal information, but the system seems to be rigged to make exercising those rights unreasonably difficult. While it shouldn’t be necessary, data removal services offer a way to cheat that system.

    "title": "ALEX BERENSON: Trump's crafty deal could end war in Ukraine, but media's war on Trump goes on",
    "article_text": "National Security Advisor Michael Waltz says the rare minerals deal with Ukraine is good for American taxpayers and provides updates on peace negotiations with Russia and the threat from Iran. \"Trump Pressures Ukraine to Accept a Peace Plan That Sharply Favors Russia.\" SoThe New York Times warneda week ago, when the White House said Ukraine and Russia needed to make peace quickly. Slate, which has reached MSNBC levels of crazy-liberal, went even further: Trump’s Ukraine Peace Plan Gives Russia Everything It Wants Sharply favoring Russia! Giving Russia everything it wants! We are back in 2016, with Donald Trump as a Kremlin agent, a modern Manchurian candidate. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy speak in Rome where they both attended Pope Francis' funeral on April 26, 2025.(Vatican and Ukraine Ambassador to Holy See) Just one problem. These headlines aren’t even close to the reality of what the Trump administration is proposing. (I know, you’re shocked.) In fact, the more I read and think about the ceasefire proposal, the more impressed I am with the tack President Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have taken. They are walking a very narrow tightrope. If they can manage it they’ll deserve enormous praise. Nobel Peace Prize-type praise, though the Kremlin will freeze over before King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden puts that medal around Trump’s neck. UKRAINE SIGNS DEAL TO GIVE US ACCESS TO RARE MINERALS WITH TRUMP ADMIN ‘COMMITTED TO A PEACE PROCESS’ Let’s start with some unpleasant facts: Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is an old-school land grab by a murderous dictator. In a perfect world, the Ukrainian people would rise up, evict the Russian army with boomerangs, and ride into the sunset. But in this world, China puts a million Uighurs in open-air detention camps and nobody does squat. Viruses gonna virus, and great powers gonna great power. Even middling powers, if they have nuclear arms and the right (aka wrong) attitude. In this world, after an initial burst in 2022,Ukraine has lost territoryslowly but steadily for the last two years, despite massive American aid. Russia has four times Ukraine’s population, and a leader who faces no domestic constraints keeping him from losing as many men as he deems necessary.The Europeans talk a good game about helping, but they have neither the military nor the political will to do more than talk (again, shocker!) For 80 years, Europe has had a terrible case of \"let’s you and him fight.\" This war is only the latest proof. Have you noticed the Bundeswehr on the Ukrainian front lines? Me neither. So Ukraine needs the United States. And the United States has elected a president who does not believe this war is a good idea. President Trump wants peace. The left says he wants peace because he hates Zelenskyy and wants to build Trump Tower Kremlin. The right says he wants peace because he is tired of sending American tax dollars so Ukrainian and Russian boys can kill each other. Me, I’m not going to guess. I don’t presume to know what’s in our president’s head, much less his heart. Here’s what I do know. A peace that simply gives the Russians a few months to rearm is not a peace at all. Here’s what else I know. The Trump administration knows that, too. The administration has not fully released its ceasefire proposal publicly (a smart move, and a sign that it is serious rather than playing political games). But the details of it have leaked, as the administration no doubt expected. And its most important element is the one the media has barely mentioned: The proposal contains NO restrictions on the size of the Ukrainian military, as the Russian government wanted. That was a non-starter for Ukraine, a true red line. Nor does the proposal require Zelenskyy to quit, or even — as far as we know — hold free elections. Nor does it require Ukraine or any other country to recognize that the Crimean peninsula is part of Russia (though, apparently, it does extend American recognition). So why is the left shrieking? First, because the deal keeps the front lines in place, pretty much. Meaning that Russia is going to continue to occupy the territory it now occupies. So Trump is… wait for it… rewarding aggression! He’s allowing Putin to redraw Europe’s borders! (Well, one border of one country that even most Europeans probably couldn’t find on a map.) Yep. He sure is. Newsflash: Putin is not going to voluntarily give up the territory that hundreds of thousands of men have died taking. And Ukraine can’t make him. That’s why we need a ceasefire. What exactly do the critics propose? Newsflash: Putin is not going to voluntarily give up the territory that hundreds of thousands of men have died taking. And Ukraine can’t make him. That’s why we need a ceasefire.There is nothing unusual about an armistice that keeps the front lines in place. Like, say, at the end of the Korean War. Maybe after Putin dies, a new Russian regime will decide eastern Ukraine wasn’t so important after all and pull back. In the interim, the fighting and killing have stopped. Second, because the United States apparently promises to recognize Crimea as Russian territory. The humanity! Except thatCrimea WAS Russian territoryfrom 1783, when Catherine the Great annexed it, until 1954, when Soviet leader Nikola Khrushchev transferred it back from Russia to Ukraine. Sure, 1954 sounds like a while ago - except that in 1954, both Russia and Ukraine were parts of the Soviet Union. In other words, Khrushchev’s transfer made no practical difference. The Kremlin, as the seat of Soviet control, still controlled the territory, and did so until the USSR collapsed in 1991. Thus, between 1783 and 2014, the Crimea was under Moscow’s rule for 208 years, and Kiev’s for 23. Does this mean Crimea belongs to Russia? I have no idea. Steve Witkoff meets with Vladimir Putin in St. Petersburg.(Reuters ) What I do know is that when Russia took Crimea (back) in 2014, neither the United States nor anyone else rushed to Ukraine’s aid. The Crimean Peninsula is strategically vital to the Kremlin, because its port of Sevastopol is Russia’s only warm-water port. It is much more important to Russia than the territory Russia has seized since 2022, and even after Putin is long gone, Russia isn’t going to give it up without a fight. And, again, the Trump administration isn’t saying Ukraine has to accept this takeover as part of a peace deal, only that the United States will.Third, the critics are whining that the proposal includes a ban on Ukraine joining NATO. This objection is genuinely stupid. Even before the war, Ukraine was — at best — decades from joining NATO. So, to review: The deal the Trump administration has proposed doesn’t require Zelenskyy to quit, allows Ukraine to retain its ability to fight, does not require it to cede any territory it hasn’t already lost, and — as far as we know — does not limit the ability of Europe or the United States to continue to aid Ukraine militarily. In return, Russia keeps Crimea and the other territory it has already grabbed. And it has the potential to have sanctions — sanctions that have proved completely ineffective in changing its behavior — removed. I guess I’m missing the part where this proposal \"sharply favors Russia.\"No wonder the Kremlin, despite its public praise for Trump, hasn’t jumped on it. About that public praise: Putin needs a win if he’s going to make peace. On the other hand, after three years of promising to evict the Russian army, Zelenskyy needs someone to blame for the fact that he couldn’t.The Trump administration is providing a useful foil for both. Zelenskyy gets to rant about the American betrayal while Putin puffs his chest and lets his media lavish praise on him for outfoxing the Americans. The deal doesn’t change. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONThe key word in all of this is lasting.If the Russians take this deal only to break the ceasefire and make a new push on Kiev in a few months, it will be hard not to regard any peace as a massive miscalculation.But is Putin really likely to be spoiling for another war? This one didn’t go as planned. It cost him hundreds of thousands of men for marginal territorial gains.And he must know that if he starts hostilities again, the United States and Europe will see little choice but to come to Kiev’s aid. This way, he can declare victory and get back to his billion-dollar Black Sea palace. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION I think the odds are good that if Trump can push this deal through, it will hold until Putin winds up in the great Kremlin in the sky (or, more likely, down below). In that case, Trump’s critics will no doubt acknowledge his incredible achievement in ending Europe’s most brutal war in generations quickly and relatively cleanly.Sure they will.

Imagine entire communities forced to abandon homes, churches, and graves of ancestors in just 24 hours. Elderly neighbors collapsing on mountain roads while fleeing, children crying from hunger, and families separated forever. This nightmare became a reality for 120,000 Armenian Christians when Azerbaijan ethnically cleansed Nagorno-Karabakh, otherwise known as Artsakh. Among those paying the price isRuben Vardanyan, who now sits in a prison cell for trying to help. The last time this happened to Armenians, America responded heroically. WhenOttoman Turksslaughtered 1.5 million Armenian Christians in the first genocide of the 20th century, ordinary Americans launched the Near East Relief Foundation, raising over $117 million (equivalent to $2.7 billion today) to save Armenian orphans and refugees, America's first major international humanitarian effort. President Wilson championed their cause, calling it \"the starving Armenians\" in a phrase that entered national vocabulary. ARCHAEOLOGISTS UNCOVER ONE OF THE WORLD'S OLDEST CHRISTIAN CHURCHES Thoserescued Armeniansbecame part of America's fabric. Every time Americans enjoy Cher's music, watchKim Kardashian's shows, or remember Andre Agassi's tennis victories, they're witnessing the legacy of Armenian Genocide survivors who found safety in America. Today, however, my father,Ruben Vardanyan, has no voice to tell his story. For more than 550 days, he has been a political prisoner for simply advocating for the rights of Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh to live in their ancestral homelands. Ruben Vardanyan(Free Armenian Prisoners Campaign) Ruben and David Vardanyan(Vardanyan family) Ruben Vardanyan(Free Armenian Prisoners Campaign) CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION He is not alone. Today, there are at least 23 other Armenian Christian prisoners illegally detained in Baku. Even more concerning, civil society organizations estimate that Azerbaijan also now holdsmore than 300political prisoners, a group that has swollen in recent months to include more Armenian and Azeri human rights defenders, journalists, and activists. My father’s imprisonment stems not from a life of political activism, but from his unwavering support for those facing adversity around the world, including in Nagorno-Karabakh. Before he became a political prisoner, he was known as a businessman and humanitarian. Over the last 10 years, his life’s purpose has been focused on philanthropy, especially in his native Armenia. As part of this work, he also co-founded theAurora Humanitarian Initiative, a global humanitarian movement which honors humanitarians who risk their lives to help others in places such as Rwanda, Iran, andAfghanistan.

This photo was taken when Vardanyan visited Barankitse's Maison Shalom shelter in Kigali, Rwanda in 2019. (Courtesy Aurora Humanitarian Initiative) As was the case 110 years ago, we remain hopeful that the United States will once again come to the aid of Armenians prosecuted for their nationality and faith today. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Personally, I am alive because my great-grandfather was saved by an American orphanage organized by Christian missionaries in Etchmiadzin, Armenia. Today, we see signs that Armenians are again not alone. Most importantly, President Trump hasvowed to protect persecuted Armenian Christiansin Azerbaijan and beyond. His National Security Advisor, Michael Waltz, has also called for the release of the Armenian political prisoners. It is this kind of support and pressure that will ultimately prevail.

    "title": "From the farm gate to the dinner plate, America’s food economy is under attack",
    "article_text": "‘Fox News Sunday’ anchor Shannon Bream meets the McCauley family in Kansas to discuss the state of the U.S. farming industry and the potential ramifications of President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Across rural America,farmersare no strangers to uncertainty. They navigate droughts, floods, fluctuating market prices, and soaring input costs. But this year, the storm isn’t coming from the skies — it’s coming from Washington. In just a few short months, we've watched DOGE undermine contracts withfarmcommunities and slash funding from the programs that keep rural America running. President Trump has only deepened the chaos with his ill-fated blanket tariff-by-tweet regime—on-again, off-again tariff chaos that leaves farmers unable to plan, plant, or price with any certainty. And instead of standing up for those who feed and fuel this country, Congressional Republicans have doubled down by proposing billions in cuts to essential Farm Bill programs and nutrition assistance like SNAP. Tariffs are alreadysqueezing farmers hard. The cost of fertilizer, equipment, and fuel is going up. Export markets are evaporating as other countries retaliate. And here at home, consumers are tightening their belts, spending less at the grocery store as their disposable incomes shrink under the weight of rising prices. Farmers are being hit on every side — higher costs, lower income, and vanishing customers. It’s no surprise that farm bankruptcies are up 55 percent. SEN RAND PAUL: TERMINATE THE TRUMP TARIFFS BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE We’ve seen this story before, because we’ve seen Trump’s agenda before.Farm bankruptciessoared during the last Trump presidency. And the dirty little secret is that we didn’t win Trump’s last trade war – Brazil did. China found a new, permanent source of exports from South America. And even after the trade war ended, our market share never recovered. Brazil is now the world’s largest exporter of soy, beef, and chicken meat—and is expected to ship even more to China this year. Trump’s last trade war didn’t just rattle markets—it leveled farm country. Even after the headlines moved on, rural communities were left to sift through the wreckage, rebuilding from losses that many will never fully recover. This time will be no different. When foreign demand dries up because of trade retaliation — or when American-made tractors cost more because of new import duties— the economics of family farming collapse. And when farms go under, the towns and communities that depend on them suffer too. But tariff pain doesn’t stop at the farm gate. It travels all the way through the food supply chain to the dinner plate. New tariffs are set to cost the average American household nearly $4,000 a year. Families already struggling to make ends meet are now facing rising food prices and fewer options. And at the same time, Washington is pulling back the programs that help close the gap. Last month, the Trump administration clawed back $1 billion in federal funding for nutrition programs, including the Local Food for Schools Cooperative, which channels farm goods to school cafeterias. That means less fresh produce for kids and fewer purchases from regional farms. Meanwhile, Congress is proposing deep cuts to SNAP, the program that helps 40 million Americans put food on the table and supports farm income in the process. SNAP isn’t just a lifeline for hungry families. It’s an engine of economic activity. Every $1 spent through SNAP generates about $1.50 in economic output, output that ripples back up the supply chain from grocery stores and trucking companies to rural farms and food producers. Gutting SNAP means pulling money out of grocery stores, out of local economies, and out of the hands of those who need it most. These decisions aren’t hurting folks in the Beltway. They’re hurting families on Michigan cherry farms, in Ohio corn country, and on soybean farms in Iowa. And they’re happening under the false banner of fiscal responsibility — when in reality, they’re shifting the burden from the wealthy and well-connected onto those least able to absorb it. It’s easy to score political points with tough talk on trade. It’s a lot harder to look a 3rd generation soybean farmer in the eye and explain why they’re going bankrupt — or tell a rural school why their cafeteria trays are empty. Trade policy should be grounded in strategy, not symbolism. It should be informed by the people who live with the consequences — not by politicians chasing headlines. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Farmers never ask for special treatment. They ask for stable rules, open markets, and a level playing field. They want to plan for the next season — and the next generation — without being caught in the crossfire of political posturing. President Trump needs to understand: tariffs, program cuts, and food policy aren’t abstract budget lines. They are forces that shape real lives — from the farm gate to the dinner plate. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The question we should be asking right now isn’t just what Washington is cutting — but who is paying the price.

    "article_text": "Fox News correspondent CB Cotton joins ‘America's Newsroom’ to give the latest on U.S. airports soon requiring REAL IDs to be shown for domestic flights. Congress passed theREAL ID Actin 2005, a few years after the 9/11 attacks. The subsequent 9/11 Commission Report revealed many weaknesses in our national security, including the fact that hijackers Khalid Al-Mihdhar and Nawaf Al-Hazmi got California drivers’ licenses through a facilitator in San Diego. They probably used those to board the American Airlines plane they crashed into the Pentagon, killing 189 people. International and domestic criminals and terrorists love \"breeder documents\" (papers issued based on low evidence), which they can use to get better identification documents (IDs) like a passport, birth certificate, and Social Security card. That’s why for air travel and other serious business, all passengers should have identification based on information that has been verified, so we know who they really are. After two decades of the government kicking the can down the road with one excuse after another, the deadline for needing aREAL IDto catch a domestic flight is up on May 7. This time, we need to keep it. REAL ID SEES NATIONWIDE STATE GOVERNMENT COMPLIANCE AHEAD OF DEADLINE, BUT IT WASN'T ALWAYS THAT WAY (Fox News Digital) Over the past four years, former president Joe Biden and his Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas released at the border, paroled, or let sneak in over 10 million essentially unidentified aliens. Many hadthrown away their IDor didn’t have any, so DHS took their word for who they were. There was no way to do proper background checks in their home countries. Some of them turned out to be terrorists, rapists, and murderers here – and for all we know, they may have been before at home, if we had only known their real identities and records. Many Americans were outraged over the last few years to see aliens at our interior airports checking in for domestic flights with only their Notice to Appear (NTA - the document they got at the border that tells them to show up in court for a deportation hearing). Some were flying on the taxpayer dime. Others were flown in the middle of the night to avoid public attention. Meanwhile, all of us had to carry proper documents that take time and money to get. Most states will issue you anon-REAL IDlicense with less proof than the REAL ID version. For the real deal, you need some combination of documents such as a birth certificate, passport, Social Security card, and proof of residence. It’s not easy, but once you’ve done it in your home state, you don’t have to repeat the exercise when you renew. Some of those holding non-REAL ID compliant drivers’ licenses are living in the U.S. illegally. Nineteen states plus Washington, D.C. have allowed people who claim residence there to get some version of a license even if they are illegal, arguing that it improves road safety. Real ID and TSA lines(Reuters/DC DMV) For another two weeks, foreign nationals have a choice of showing a driver's license, foreign passport, military ID, federal Employment Authorization Card, or even their Notice to Appear to get on a domestic flight. After May 7, they will need a passport or a state-issued drivers’ license that complies with federal REAL ID standards. Or there’s always the Greyhound. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Just as Leftists want men to self-ID into women’s spaces, they seem fine with unidentified foreigners self-declaring who they are before getting on a plane. I’m not. If we’re going to keep handing over our nail clippers thanks to the 9/11 hijackers, and taking off our footwear thanks to shoe-bomber Richard Reid, we can at least ask our fellow travelers to have a secure ID that is based on verified facts and not just their say-so. The one exception that the Department of Homeland Security will make to the newREAL IDrequirement is for foreigners booking a flight out of the country. With the border more secure than ever, that would mean they’d be self-deporting, unless they can qualify for a visa in the future. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told Fox News that \"81% of air travelers hold REAL ID-compliant or acceptable IDs.\" The other 19% can get with the program. Some on the American right, and Libertarians, don’t like the REAL ID requirement. But the rest of us will pay that small price to ensure safer skies and so we know that someone has verified the identity of the guy sitting next to us.

It seems a week can’t go by lately withoutCalifornia Democrat Governor Gavin Newsomattempting some new political gimmick. A new podcast here. A new frivolous lawsuit there. Anything to distract Californians across the state from his abysmal record as governor. His latest stunt is classic Newsom.

CALIFORNIA FLOATS PLAN TO ALLOW HOMELESS STUDENTS TO SLEEP IN THEIR CARS AMID HOUSING CRISIS What the president is trying to do in renegotiating trade policies is to have a fair market economy. He wants to stimulate more manufacturing in the U.S. tobring back middle-class jobs. California Gov. Gavin Newsom is fully responsible for the problems of his state.(AP Photo/José Luis Villegas, File) Despite the governor’s cries that \"President Trump’s unlawful tariffs are wreaking chaos on California families, businesses, and our economy — driving up prices and threatening jobs,\" earlier this week,CalMatters published a blistering column,\"California’s economy was already sluggish before Trump’s global tariffs,\" completely debunking the governor’s claims. Dan Walters’ piece ends \"California’s economic woes predate Trump. Much of it was self-inflicted.\" In other words, Gavin Newsom’s economy is a result of Gavin Newsom’s policies. Back in January, thelegislature’s budget analystdescribed that economy as \"lackluster, with elevated unemployment, a stagnant job market outside of government and healthcare, and sluggish consumer spending.\" To anyone paying attention, that wasn’t a surprise. Up and down our state,Californians feel the impactsof the economic damage Gavin and his Democratic allies have inflicted. Up in the north state, a once-thriving timber industry fell to environmental over-regulation, and now to cheaper Canadian imports.

The job market is stagnant. Crime and homelessness have made too many communities shells of what they once were. As hard as he continues to try,Governor Newsom can’t blame President Trumpor anyone else. These failures are his own.

While that’s a far cry from the 600 million Alexa devices out there, the company is making some progress on the rollout of Alexa+, which wasfirst unveiled in February. At the time, Amazon said that Alexa+ would roll out in waves over the coming months. Amazon’s new digital assistant aims to let users talk with it in a more natural style, and eventually have agentic abilities that allow it to use third-party apps on a user’s behalf. Alexa+ should be able to generate original responses on the fly, much like the voice modes in OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini, rather than the predetermined responses of the old Alexa and Siri systems. However, as The Washington Post reported at launch, the Alexa+ that’s rolling out todaylacks some of the key features the company demoed in February. The report notes that, at launch, Alexa+ did not have the ability to use third party apps like GrubHub, generate a bedtime story for children, or brainstorm a gift idea. It’s unclear when those features will make it into Alexa+. “We have a lot more functionality that we plan to add in coming months,” Jassy said on the call. During his opening comments, Jassy claimed that Alexa+ is one of the first action-oriented AI agents for consumers. But he noted that this technology is still rather “primitive” and “inaccurate.” Currently, most multi-step AI agents have a low accuracy rate, between 30% and 60%, the Amazon CEO said. Jassy set a goal for the company’s web-browsing agent that powers Alexa+,Nova Act, to achieve 90% accuracy in this domain. Amazon’s rollout of Alexa+ seems to be progressing faster than Apple’s rollout of its new, LLM-powered Siri. When asked about the new Siri delays on Apple’s Thursday earnings call, which occurred simultaneously wiith Amazon’s, CEO Tim Cook said the company needed “more time to complete the work.” Along the road to supercharge legacy digital assistants with generative AI, both Apple and Amazon havereportedly run into snags and delays. Some of the biggest hiccups are around getting LLMs to use tools and integrate with other systems. Doing so allows Alexa and Siri to complete practical tasks such as setting timers and reading texts, but implementing it has proven harder than expected.

Scrollers are the ones who come to Reddit’s core product, which is community conversation and engaging about topics they’re passionate about, from r/sourdough to r/popculturechat. Then there are the Seekers; the people who might type their specific query into Google Search and tack “Reddit” on the end so they can find real advice and opinions from real people. Reddit Answers, the company’s AI-powered chatbot that surfaces verbatim answers and summaries from existing Reddit posts, is for the Seekers. And early results suggest it is already gaining traction. “Up until very recently, we haven’t built a product for them,” Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said Thursday on the company’s first-quarter earnings call. “Those users are not coming to Reddit for a community in that moment. They’re coming for an answer. And I think we can [acknowledge] the use case that the user’s bringing us and be more effective at solving it.” Reddit announced during the call that its Answers product already has 1 million weekly active users since itlaunched in beta in December. Last month, Reddit expanded Answers beyond the U.S. and into Australia, the U.K., Canada, and India. The feature, which is still in beta, currently lives in the navigation bar of the app as its own separate experience. Going into 2025, Reddit plans to integrate Answers more deeply into the platform in a few different ways. Huffman said the most obvious way to do this would be to integrate Answers into the primary search box, which could allow users to type in a full query rather than just a few keywords. The executive also said the company is exploring ways to integrate Answers into the beginning of the user journey. “So you’re a new user opening Reddit for the first time, using Answers to see what’s in Reddit and learn that Reddit almost certainly has what you’re looking for,” he said. Another “point of entry” for Answers would be through external search, “helping [users] get a more summarized or easy-to-parse version of the answer on Reddit,” Huffman said. That could also protect Reddit from being at the mercy of Google Search. In the fourth quarter of 2024, a Google Search algorithm change caused some “volatility” with Reddit’s user growth, which spooked investors at the time, despite beating earnings estimates. “We’re an open platform, and we want people to find Reddit content in [Google] Search,” Huffman said. “Being open drives awareness and visibility. It can also create variability, and we do expect some bumps along the way from Google, because we’ve already seen a few this year. This is expected in any year, but given that the Search ecosystem is under heavy construction, the near term could be more bumpy than usual.” Reddit’s stock soared in after-hours trading as the company beat analyst earnings expectations and strong user growth. The company reported revenue of $392.4 million, up 61% year-over-year, an adjusted EBITDA of $115.3 million, and daily active unique users of 108.1 million, a 31% YoY increase. In the second quarter, Reddit estimates revenue in the range of $410 million to $430 million and adjusted EBITDA between $110 million and $130 million.

While almost a $1 billion in extra fees paid to the government is nothing to sneeze at, Apple is so enormous that one analyst on the quarterly earnings call described the hit as surprisingly low. Apple reported first quarter revenue of $95.4 billion. And even with the tariff payment, it still reported earnings per share profit of $1.65, a first-quarter record,it said. The big question on the minds of tech users — as well as many tech startups that prefers to outfit employees with Macs — is if Cook foresees ongoing tariffs increasing Apple’s prices. At least as far as the next quarter is concerned, this is unlikely. When asked outright about tariff-induced price increases, Cook said he had “nothing to announce at this time.” He explained that Apple is now importing a larger portion of its iPhones from India, rather than China, keeping the tariff hit reduced. As for Macs, a bigger portion of those are coming from Vietnam, he said. The devices produced in China are largely being sent to Apple’s customers outside the U.S., he added. The biggest hit in tariff costs for Apple, he said, was with the AppleCare and the accessories businesses — aka spare parts to fix a broken device covered under its warranty program, and things like iPhone cases. For those businesses, the tariff rate hit “at least 145%,” he said. He didn’t imply that costs would be increased to cover that hit, yet, either. But he did explain that Apple hasn’t been hit as hard as it could have been. That was largely because its products “including iPhone, Mac, iPad, Apple Watch and Vision Pro” aren’t currently subject “to global reciprocal tariffs” whilethe Commerce Department conducts an investigationinto how tariffs affect imports of semiconductors and the products that use them. So should consumers and startups buy their Macs now rather the later? Cook says Apple is doing what it can to keep costs in check, including influencing the tariff policy itself. “Obviously, we’re very engaged on the tariff discussions. We believe in engagement and will continue to engage. On the pricing piece, we have nothing to announce today,” Cook said.

While the iPhone maker saw only “limited impact” from tariffs in the March quarter, Cook said Apple couldn’t forecast what that would mean for the coming quarter. However, if things remained the same, the company estimates tariffs will only add $900 million to its costs in Q3. The news was a relief to investors, with one even calling it a “pretty good outcome.” However, investors were still concerned as to what the next quarters could hold, given the rapid changes to U.S. trade policy in recent weeks. Cook told investors Apple’s estimate was meant to provide some color and would only hold if the current global tariff rates, policies, and applications didn’t change for the balance of the quarter and if no new tariffs were added. He also warned that this estimate shouldn’t be used to project the impact of tariffs in future quarters, as there are “unique factors” that benefit the June quarter. Inan interview with CNBC, Cook had downplayed the impact of tariffs, noting that Apple is already sourcing about half its iPhones for the U.S. from India, and most other products for the U.S. market from Vietnam.

The new round will value the company at around $470 million, according to the source. However, the deal hasn’t closed and terms may still change. The Khosla investor leading the deal is Keith Rabois. Mach Industries is a buzzy defense tech startup, a status propelled by its founding origin story and connection to Sequoia. Thornton was just a teenager when he dropped out of MIT to found Mach Industries, which was Sequoia’s first defense tech investment. Mach is developing vertical liftoff vehicles and weapons that can work from the edge of space. It is also developing smaller factories that can be easily built and distributed when more production is needed. In March,Mach announced it was selected by the Army Applications Laboratoryto develop a vertical takeoff precision cruise missile it calls “Strategic Strike.” It also announced plans for its first factory, a 115,000-square foot-facility in Huntington Beach, California. This new funding should bring the startup’s total funding to about $185 million, to date. Sequoia led Mach’s $5.7 million seed round, which wasannouncedin June 2023.

In apost on X, Stripe product manager Michael Luo said the team “cooked up a quick guide” that walks iOS developers through how to accept payments using Stripe outside of their apps, so they can take advantage of the new option, which was made possible by the court’s decision.

Go live now!Docs in the 🧵pic.twitter.com/gKguWwBanv Apple allowed developers to link to external websites to make purchases, but it only reduced its 30% commission by 3%, and added “scare screens” that warned consumers about the potential dangers of paying developers outside its App Store. Judge Rogers said Apple’s policy didn’t follow either the spirit or the letter of the law, in terms of her prior injunction, and ordered the company to change its policies immediately. Stripe’snew documentationexplains how developers can set up a link inside their app to accept payments on iOS for digital goods using Stripe Checkout. The option would redirect an app’s customers to a secure, Stripe-hosted payments page as a part of the new checkout experience, the company says. Of course, using Stripe is not as simple as taking advantage of the default option of Apple’s in-app purchases, as it requires developers to set up and maintain their own payments page and checkout experience. However, Stripe’sstandardpayment processing fees are 2.9% plus $0.30 per transaction, making it a much more affordable alternative to Apple’s 30% commission (or even its 15% commission for select apps, like those in Apple’s Small Biz program or subscription apps, starting in year two). Stripe’s announcement is already gaining traction, with the news getting thousands of likes on X from eager developers. Longtime Apple critic, David Heinemeier Hansson, who is the creator of Ruby on Rails and co-owner of 37Signals, which makes software like Basecamp andHEY, also praised Stripe’s solution. Hansson, over the years, has repeatedly feuded with Apple for rejecting HEY’s email and calendaring apps because they were set up to avoid using Apple’s in-app purchase mechanisms. On X,Hansson suggestedthe change to Apple’s policies to now allow for external payments will make more businesses possible on the App Store. “Apple’s loss in court is immediately opening up a whole new world for app developers,” he says. “Entire business models were impossible under the old 30% regime.” Topics Consumer News Editor Sarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

Many, many startupsare racing to develop AI research tools for the scientific domain, some with massive amounts of VC funding behind them. Tech giants seem bullish, too, on AI for science. Earlier this year, Google unveiled the “AI co-scientist,” an AI the company said could aid scientists in creating hypotheses and experimental research plans. The CEOs of AI companies OpenAI and Anthropic haveassertedthat AI tools could massively accelerate scientific discovery, particularly inmedicine. But many researchers don’t consider AI today to be especially useful inguiding the scientific process, in large part due to itsunreliability. FutureHouse on Thursday released four AI tools: Crow, Falcon, Owl, and Phoenix. Crow can search scientific literature and answer questions about it; Falcon can conduct deeper literature searches, including of scientific databases;  Owl looks for previous work in a given subject area; and Phoenix uses tools to help plan chemistry experiments. Today, we are launching the first publicly available AI Scientist, via the FutureHouse Platform.Our AI Scientist agents can perform a wide variety of scientific tasks better than humans. By chaining them together, we've already started to discover new biology really fast. With…pic.twitter.com/wMMmZoGZPI “Unlike other [AIs], FutureHouse’s have access to a vast corpus of high-quality open-access papers and specialized scientific tools,”writesFutureHouse in a blog post. “They [also] have transparent reasoning and use a multi-stage process to consider each source in more depth […] By chaining these [AI]s together, at scale, scientists can greatly accelerate the pace of scientific discovery.” But tellingly, FutureHouse has yet to achieve a scientific breakthrough or make a novel discovery with its AI tools. Part of the challenge in developing an “AI scientist” is anticipating an untold number of confounding factors. AI might come in handy in areas where broad exploration is needed, like narrowing down a vast list of possibilities. But it’s less clear whether AI is capable of the kind of out-of-the-box problem-solving that leads to bonafide breakthroughs. Results from AI systems designed for science so far have been mostly underwhelming. In 2023, Google said around 40 new materials had beensynthesizedwith the help of one of its AIs, called GNoME. Yetan outside analysisfound not a single one of the materials was, in fact, net new. AI’s technical shortcomings and risks, such as its tendency tohallucinate, also make scientists wary of endorsing it for serious work. Even well-designed studies could end up being tainted by misbehaving AI, which struggles with executing high-precision work. Indeed, FutureHouse acknowledges that its AI tools — Phoenix in particular — may make mistakes. “We are releasing [this] now in the spirit of rapid iteration,” the company writes in its blog post. “Please provide feedback as you use it.” Topics AI Editor Get inside access to Europe’s top investment minds — with leaders from Monzo, Accel, Paladin Group, and more — plus top-tier networking at StrictlyVC London.

Bench didn’t specify how many people were affected, but one person who works there estimated that Bench was eliminating dozens of positions – that’s a big chunk of the around 300 people who work for the company. Departments like client success and tax services were directly impacted, with one person directly familiar with the matter telling TechCrunch that most of Bench’s U.S.-based tax advisory team was eliminated. Employer.com, the San Francisco HR tech company thatbought Bench last year, told TechCrunch the decision to make the cuts “was not made lightly.” “We deeply appreciate the contributions of our employees who have worked diligently to maintain these accounts,” Employer.com CMO Matt Charney said. Under previous ownership, Bench raised over $110 million in VC funding and over $50 million in debt, but never reached profitability. Thecompany burned through its cashand abruptly shut down, laying off its entire staff andleaving thousands of customers without access to their books. Employer.comthen swooped in, buying Bench for$9 million, re-hiring most of the startup’s workforce, and pledging to revive the startup. The move saved Bench from total collapse. But two current Bench workers and a former one told TechCrunch that Bench has kept most of its workforce on as independent contractors, renewing their 30 day contracts every month instead of hiring them as full-time employees.At the time of the sale, Employer.com said this was a temporary measure. These people also told TechCrunch that Bench has said internally that a majority of its workforce would be based outside of North America. However, CMO Charney said the recent cuts reflect “the realities of turning around the business and addressing legacy issues, rather than being part of any strategic outsourcing initiative.” Charney told TechCrunch that Bench is continuing to explore longer-term solutions for employees, which the company calls “Benchmates,” but that this structure was the most viable option to get people onboarded quickly post-close. Beyond structuring its workforce, Bench has faced other challenges, the current and former Benchmates told TechCrunch. For example, a large number of Bench customers churned after tax season ended on April 15, they said. Bench also wasn’t able to finish many customers’ taxes on time, one person directly familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. Some frustrated customers alsoalleged that Bench charged people for services they already paid forunder prior ownership. (Bench told TechCrunch at the time that it honors all pre-paid services.) Charney told TechCrunch that while some customers have left, this was partly an intentional move to let go of unprofitable customers. “While we’ve seen an uptick in customer churn, a significant portion of it has been intentional and necessary,” Charney said. “Over time, legacy pricing and servicing decisions made before our acquisition of Bench led to a subset of customers being supported at a loss.” Charney added that going forward, Bench has plans to grow both features and headcount.

On Thursday, Ai2, the nonprofit AI research institute,releasedOlmo 2 1B, a 1-billion-parameter model that Ai2 claims beats similarly-sized models from Google, Meta, and Alibaba on several benchmarks. Parameters, sometimes referred to as weights, are the internal components of a model that guide its behavior. Olmo 2 1B is available under a permissive Apache 2.0 license on the AI dev platform Hugging Face. Unlike most models, Olmo 2 1B can be replicated from scratch; Ai2 has provided the code and data sets (Olmo-mix-1124,Dolmino-mix-1124) used to develop it. Small models might not be as capable as their behemoth counterparts, but importantly, they don’t require beefy hardware to run. That makes them much more accessible for developers and hobbyists contending with the limitations of lower-end and consumer machines. There’s been a raft of small model launches over the past few days, from Microsoft’sPhi 4 reasoning familytoQwen’s 2.5 Omni 3B. Most of these — and Olmo 2 1B — can easily run on a modern laptop or even a mobile device. Ai2 says that Olmo 2 1B was trained on a data set of 4 trillion tokens from publicly available, AI-generated, and manually created sources. Tokens are the raw bits of data models ingest and generate — 1 million tokens is equivalent to about 750,000 words. On a benchmark measuring arithmetic reasoning, GSM8K, Olmo 2 1B scores better than Google’s Gemma 3 1B, Meta’s Llama 3.2 1B, and Alibaba’s Qwen 2.5 1.5B. Olmo 2 1B also eclipses the performance of those three models on TruthfulQA, a test for evaluating factual accuracy. This model was pretrained on 4T tokens of high-quality data, following the same standard pretraining into high-quality annealing of our 7, 13, & 32B models. We upload intermediate checkpoints from every 1000 steps in training.Access the base model:https://t.co/xofyWJmo85pic.twitter.com/7uSJ6sYMdL Ai2 warns that that Olmo 2 1B carries risks, however. Like all AI models, it can produce “problematic outputs” including harmful and “sensitive” content, the organization says, as well as factually inaccurate statements. For these reasons, Ai2 recommends against deploying Olmo 2 1B in commercial settings.

But Wednesday night, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers wrote in aseethingfiling that Apple was intentionally violating her 2021 ruling. Now Epic is bringing its flagship gameFortniteback to the iOS App Store, where it will incentivize users to buy Fortnite’s digital goods through Epic directly, since they’ll get a better price. With the Epic Games Store’s new webshops feature, other developers will be more easily able to follow suit. Usually, Epic takes a 12% share of a developer’s earnings from the Epic Games Store, which is still a better deal than what developers get from Apple. But starting in June, Epic Games will not take a cut from the first $1 million each game earns annually. Only after a game eclipses $1 million in revenue will Epic begin taking a cut. “With new legal rulings in place, developers will be able to send players from games to make digital purchases from webshops on any platform that allows it, including iOS in the European Union and United States,” Epic said.

The new app connection feature, called Integrations, and expanded deep research tool, dubbed Advanced Research, are available in beta for subscribers to Anthropic’s Claude Max, Team, and Enterprise plans, and soon Pro. In related news, Anthropic has also upped the rate limits for its AI-powered coding tool,Claude Code, for Max customers. Integrations and Advanced Research are both a part of Anthropic’s effort to keep pace with competing chatbots like Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Anthropicreportedlyhopes to reach $34.5 billion in revenue in 2027, and while it’s certainlymakinginroads, it has a long way to go. Anthropic’s annualized revenue was around $1.4 billion in early March,according to one report. Integrations builds on the company’sMCP protocol, which lets AI models draw data from sources such as business tools to complete tasks, as well as from content repositories and app development environments. Integrations taps MCP to allow developers to create and host app servers that enhance Claude’s capabilities and let users discover and connect these servers to Claude. “When you connect your tools to Claude, it gains deep context about your work — understanding project histories, task statuses, and organizational knowledge — and can take actions across every surface,”wrote Anthropic in a blog post. To start, there are a number of Integrations from Anthropic partners, including Atlassian, Zapier, Cloudflare, Intercom, Square, and PayPal. Each expands what Claude can do. For example, the Atlassian Integration lets Claude summarize and create pages in Atlassian’s Confluence workplace software, while the Zapier Integration allows Claude to connect to the former’s app automation workflows. As for the other new Claude feature launching today, Advanced Research, it allows Claude to crawl “hundreds” of internal and external sources to deliver what Anthropic describes as “more comprehensive” reports on a topic in anywhere from five to 45 minutes. Advanced Research can take advantage of Claude’s newly expanded connectors, Anthropic says, to search across Integrations and — when using the Claude Desktop app on macOS or Windows — MCP-connected local drives. “With its new ability to do more complex research, available when you toggle on the Research button, Claude breaks down your request into smaller parts, investigating each deeply before compiling a comprehensive report,” continued Anthropic in the blog post. “When Claude incorporates information from sources, it provides clear citations that link directly to the original material.” There’s been a raft of deep research tools launched recently across chatbots such as Gemini, Microsoft’s Copilot, and xAI’s Grok. Driving them are “reasoning” AI models, which possess the ability to think through problems and fact-check themselves — skills arguably important for conducting in-depth research on a subject. Anthropic’s Research tool previously was among the faster tools in the deep research category, taking around a minute to compile reports. But the results tended to be shallower, in part because Research didn’t employ a reasoning model.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us After nearly 13 years in business,Fivetranwill now be able to offer its customers an end-to-end data movement solution. Fivetran, which helps enterprises move data from a variety of sources into cloud databases, announced on Thursday it has acquiredCensus, a reverse extract, transform, and load (ETL) platform that enables companies to transfer data out of databases and into operational tools. Census was founded in 2018 and raised more than $80 million in venture funding from such firms as Sequoia, Andreessen Horowitz, and Tiger Global. The terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Census waslast valued at $630 million in 2022. Once the acquisition closes, the entire Census team will migrate over to Fivetran and the Census brand will eventually be integrated into the Fivetran platform. George Fraser, the co-founder and CEO of Fivetran, told TechCrunch that the deal made sense for Fivetran for a lot of reasons. For one, customers have been asking Fivetran for a reverse ETL solution for years. The company thought about developing an offering of its own, going so far as to build a prototype. But Fraser said Fivetran realized it would be a better use of resources to bring on a company that had already figured it out instead. “Technically speaking, if you look at the code underneath [these] services, they’re actually pretty different,” Fraser said. “You have to solve a pretty different set of problems in order to do this.” Once Fivetran decided it made more sense to add reverse ETL via an acquisition, Census was a natural choice, Fraser said, because the two companies shared many of the same customers and the two platforms are very similar stylistically. “People who like Fivetran, as compared to Informatica or building their own connectors, they are going to be people who also like Census,” Fraser said. “The two products make broadly similar philosophical choices, and so they tend to appeal to the same customers, which is very important when you’re thinking about synergy.” It didn’t hurt that the founding teams of Census and Fivetran go way back, either. Fraser said he met the Census team, which includes CEO Boris Jabes and co-founder Anton Vaynshtok, during Y Combinator’s 2013 winter batch. Fraser and his co-founder, Taylor Brown, were going through the YC program while Jabes and Vaynshtok were building Meldium, a password and account management system,that was acquired by LogMeIn in 2014. They all stayed in touch and even talked about Census as a concept years before the company was founded. Now, close to a decade later, everything is coming under one roof. “We talked to the Census founders about their idea before they even started the company, and Taylor [Brown] and I joked at the time that it might end up in an acquisition, because there’s a lot of synergy between the two things,” Fraser said. “In some ways, this has been fated, I think.” Topics Senior Reporter, Venture Get inside access to Europe’s top investment minds — with leaders from Monzo, Accel, Paladin Group, and more — plus top-tier networking at StrictlyVC London.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers is pissed off at Apple. Really,reallypissed off. In Rogers’ newly released 80-page decision, she took Apple and its executives to task for defying the court’s orders in itsoriginal case with Fortnite maker Epic Games. Though Apple largely won that round, as it was determined the tech giant was not a monopolist, the court decided that Apple was behaving in an anticompetitive fashion in one specific area: by not allowing app developers to offer their customers other ways to pay outside of Apple’s own payment platform. The judge ruled that developers should be able to link to other ways to make purchases from inside their apps, so they could process payments via their own website and payment systems. In doing so, developers should have been able to forgo paying Apple’s 30% commission on in-app purchases. Apple, however, made it even more onerous for any developers who chose this option. It only dropped its commission to 27% for these outside purchases and added “scare screens”: warnings to dissuade customers who may have been tempted to go the route of outside purchases. With only a 3% discount off Apple’s original commission, this method could end up costing developers even more when their own payment processing fees were taken into consideration. As a result, Apple protected its lucrative App Store business model at the expense of its reputation, its relationship with the iOS developer community, and its good standing in the eyes of the law. In Rogers’ decision, it’s clear she’s had enough of Apple’s tactics, and the ruling is full of juicy tidbits where she clearly expresses so. Apple responded to the court’s ruling with the following statement: “We strongly disagree with the decision. We will comply with the court’s order and we will appeal.” If you don’t have time to read all 80 pages yourself, we’ve rounded up some of the best bits below. “Apple’s response to the Injunction strains credulity. After two sets of evidentiary hearings, the truth emerged. Apple, despite knowing its obligations thereunder, thwarted the Injunction’s goals, and continued its anticompetitive conduct solely to maintain its revenue stream. Remarkably, Apple believed that this Courtwould not see through its obvious cover-up (the 2024 evidentiary hearing).” “In stark contrast to Apple’s initial in-court testimony, contemporaneous business documents reveal that Apple knew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option. To hide the truth, Vice-President of Finance, Alex Roman, outright lied under oath.” “Internally, Phillip Schiller had advocated that Apple comply with the Injunction, but Tim Cook ignored Schiller and instead allowed Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri and his finance team to convince him otherwise. Cook chose poorly …The Court refers the matter to the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California to investigate whether criminal contempt proceedings are appropriate.” … “As Mr. Schiller was not advocating for a commission, and Mr. Maestri was fully advocating for the lucrative approach, Mr. Cook was the tie-breaker.” (Anyone notice that Maestri isn’t at Apple anymore, by the way?) “This is an injunction, not a negotiation. There are no do-overs once a party willfully disregards a court order. Time is of the essence. The Court will not tolerate further delays. As previously ordered, Apple will not impede competition. The Court enjoins Apple from implementing its new anticompetitive acts to avoid compliance with the Injunction. Effective immediately Apple will no longer impede developers’ ability to communicate with users nor will they levy or impose a new commission on off-app purchases.” “Apple engaged in tactics to delay the proceedings. The Court later concluded that delay equaled profits.” “Ultimately, Epic and Apple hired three special masters to review Apple’s privilege claims after its re-review. (See, e.g., Dkt. No. 1191.) Apple’s production positions, after its dissembling at the evidentiary hearing, revealed that delay worked to its advantage.” … “THE COURT FURTHER FINDS that Apple’s abuse of attorney-client privilege designations to delay proceedings and obscure its decision-making process warrants sanction to deter future misconduct. Apple is SANCTIONED in the amount of the full cost of the special masters’ review and Epic’s attorneys’ fees on this issue alone through approximately May 15, 2025, the anticipated date of completion. The parties shall meet and confer on the actual amount due.” “In its most simple configuration, ‘linked-out purchases’ after the Injunction are purchases made off the Apple platform, but from which a consumer can leave the platform using a link on the app. Now, under the revised Guidelines, Apple not only charges developers ‘a 27% commission,’ but also expanded the scope of the commission requirement by demanding a 27% commission on digital goods and services transactions that take place on a developer’s website upon immediate use of the link, and payment for any ‘digital goods and services transactions that take place on a developer’s website within seven days after a user taps through an External Purchase Link … to an external website.’ … Apple hid its decision-making process from the Court only to have it uncovered at the second evidentiary hearing in 2025.” … “Apple coded its activities relating to Injunction compliance as ‘Project Michigan’ … When the Ninth Circuit issued its stay of the Injunction on December 8, 2021 (Dkt. No. 841), Apple appears to have ceased any compliance efforts.” “Despite the fact that the Court now has evidence that Apple investigated the landscape, knew how it would harm developers, and understood it would not comply with the goal of the Injunction, Apple nonetheless determined at the June 20, 2023 meeting that it would charge a commission on link-out purchases, although it had not yet decided what that commission would be … Apple’s knowledge and consideration of these issues was hidden from the Court and not revealed until the 2025 hearing.” “The testimony of Mr. Roman, Vice President of Finance, was replete with misdirection and outright lies. He even went so far as to testify that Apple did not look at comparables to estimate the costs of alternative payment solutions that developers would need to procure to facilitate linked-out purchases.” … “Mr. Roman did not stop there, however. He also testified that up until January 16, 2024, Apple had no idea what fee it would impose on linked-out purchases: Q. And I take it that Apple decided to impose a 27 percent fee on linked purchases prior to January 16, 2024, correct? A. The decision was made that day. Q. It’s your testimony that up until January 16, 2024, Apple had no idea what fee it’s going to impose on linked purchases? A. That is correct.” “Another lie under oath:contemporaneous business documents reveal that on the contrary, the main components of Apple’s plan, including the 27% commission, were determined in July 2023. Neither Apple, nor its counsel, corrected the, now obvious, lies. They did not seek to withdraw the testimony or to have it stricken (although Apple did request that the Court strike other testimony). Thus, Apple will be held to have adopted the lies and misrepresentations to this Court.” “Apple deployed a warning message, referred to as a ‘scare screen,’ to deter users from using third-party payment options.” … “The screen on the right is called a ‘sheet,’ which is a full screen takeover after the user clicks on an externallink. Moving left to right, the warning level to the user increases. Again, Apple chose the most anticompetitive option, namely the full screen takeover.” … “Again, Apple decided on the most anticompetitive option, that is, the ‘even worse’ option of including the developer’s name rather than the app name. All of this was hidden from the Court and not revealed in the May 2024 evidentiary hearings.” “Few developers signed up for the link entitlement program (external purchase links).” “As of the May 2024 hearing, only 34 developers out of the approximately 136,000 total developers on the App Store applied for the program, and seventeen of those developers had not offered in-app purchases in the first place. In May 2024, Apple argued that it would take more time for developers to take advantage of the Link Entitlement and that the adoption rates could not be known.Apple attempted here to mislead.” “There are several issues with Apple’s argument. First, it is ludicrous to expect any court to repeat the contents of a 180-page order issued in conjunction with a simultaneously issued one-paragraph injunction. The latter flows from the former. To suggest otherwise strains credulity. Second, even limited to the four corners of the Injunction, Apple violated the literal text. Third, contrary to Apple’s position, other courts within this and other circuits will look to the spirit of the injunction when a litigant applies a dubiously literal interpretation of the injunction, particularly where that interpretation is designed to evade the injunction’s goals.” … “In short, Apple’s conduct lacks any justification: it does not comport with the text of the Injunction, requires a strained and questionable interpretation of that language, completely ignores this Court’s 180-page Injunction and the Ninth Circuit’s 91-page opinion, and prompted lies on the witness stand. The law requires that Apple be on notice of the scope of permissible conduct to hold Apple in civil contempt.” “Apple’s justifications for these requirements (set forth above) strain credulity. Most notably, and to underscore Apple’s meritless justifications, Apple does not require developers selling physical goods to apply for a link entitlement before deploying link-out transactions. Apple imposes these restrictions only for link-outs that compete with IAP.” “Apple’s conduct violates the Injunction. The non-compliance was far from ‘technical or de minimis.’ Apple’s lack of adequate justification, knowledge of the economic non-viability of its compliance program, motive to protect its illegal revenue stream and institute a new de facto anticompetitive structure, and then create a reverse-engineered justification to proffer to the Court cannot, in any universe, real or virtual, be viewed as product of good faith or a reasonable interpretation of the Court’s orders. The Court HOLDS Apple in civil contempt. Sanctions and relief with respect to Apple’s noncompliance are set forth infra Section IV.” … “Apple willfully chose not to comply with this Court’s Injunction. It did so with the express intent to create new anticompetitive barriers which would, by design and in effect, maintain a valued revenue stream; a revenue stream previously found to be anticompetitive. That it thought this Court would tolerate such insubordination was a gross miscalculation. As always, the coverup made it worse. For this Court, there is no second bite at the apple.” Topics Consumer News Editor Sarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

The tech giant is also adding more functionality to the feature, including the ability to pick up where you left off on a search. Google launchedAI Mode back in Marchas a way to take on popular services like Perplexity AI and OpenAI’s ChatGPT Search. The updates announced today are designed to allow AI Mode to better compete with the aforementioned services. With this expansion, Google is getting rid of the waitlist for AI Mode. Now anyone in the U.S. who is at least 18 years old can access the feature if they’re enrolled in Labs, Google’s experimental arm. Google is also going to make AI Mode accessible outside of Labs, as it’s testing an AI Mode tab in Google Search that will be visible to a small percentage of people in the U.S. As for the new functionality, Google is making it possible to go a step beyond asking detailed questions about places and products. Now you can use AI mode to do things like find a new restaurant or things you need for your next trip. You will now start to see visual place and product cards in AI Mode that you can tap on to get more details. When looking at local spots like restaurants or salons, you can quickly see info like ratings, reviews, and opening hours. For products, you will be able to see details like real-time prices and promotions, images, shipping details, and local inventory. For example, if you’re searching for the best vintage shops with midcentury modern furniture, AI Mode can highlight nearby stores, provide real-time details like how busy they are, and let you quickly call or get directions. Or, if you’re planning a camping trip, you try searching for something like “best foldable camping chair that would fit in a backpack for under $100.” AI Mode will then give you a breakdown of recommended products, alongside product details and links to retailers. Google is also making it possible to pick up where you left off when using AI Mode, which should be helpful in cases where you’re working on longer-running projects and tasks. On desktop, you can now click the new left-side panel in AI Mode to get to your past searches to see the information you were already given, and to ask follow-up questions.

OpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder andlongtime chief scientist Ilya SutskeverandCTO Mira Murati.OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits fromAlden Global Capital-owned newspapersalleging copyright infringement, as well asan injunction from Elon Muskto halt OpenAI’s transition to a for-profit.

The company has been trying to shore up itsrelationship with Washingtonas it simultaneouslypursues an ambitious data center project,and as itreportedly lays the groundworkfor one of the largest funding rounds in history. Below, you’ll find a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we’ve been updating throughout the year. If you have any other questions, check outour ChatGPT FAQ here. To see a list of 2024 updates,go here. OpenAIhas released a poston the recent sycophancy issues with the default AI model powering ChatGPT, GPT-4o, leading the company to revert an update to the model released last week. CEO Sam Altman acknowledged the issue on Sunday and confirmed two days later that theGPT-4o update was being rolled back. OpenAI is working on “additional fixes” to the model’s personality. Over the weekend, users on social media criticized the new model for making ChatGPT too validating and agreeable. It became a popular meme fast. An issue within OpenAI’s ChatGPT enabled the chatbot to create graphic erotic content for accounts registered by users under the age of 18, as demonstrated byTechCrunch’s testing, a fact later confirmed by OpenAI. “Protecting younger users is a top priority, and our Model Spec, which guides model behavior, clearly restricts sensitive content like erotica to narrow contexts such as scientific, historical, or news reporting,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. “In this case, a bug allowed responses outside those guidelines, and we are actively deploying a fix to limit these generations.” OpenAIhas added a few features toitsChatGPT search, its web search tool in ChatGPT, to give users an improved online shopping experience. The company says people can ask super-specific questions using natural language and receive customized results. The chatbot provides recommendations, images, and reviews of products in various categories such as fashion, beauty, home goods, and electronics. OpenAI leaders have been talking about allowing the open model to link up with OpenAI’s cloud-hosted models to improve its ability to respond to intricate questions,two sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch. OpenAIis preparing to launch an AI systemthat will be openly accessible, allowing users to download it for free without any API restrictions. Aidan Clark, OpenAI’s VP of research, is spearheading the development of the open model, which is in the very early stages, sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch. OpenAI released a new AI model called GPT-4.1 in mid-April. However, multiple independent tests indicate that the model is less reliable than previous OpenAI releases. The companyskipped that step— sending safety cards for GPT-4.1 — claiming in a statement to TechCrunch that “GPT-4.1 is not a frontier model, so there won’t be a separate system card released for it.” Questions have been raised regarding OpenAI’s transparency and procedures for testing models after adifference in benchmark outcomeswas detected by first- and third-party benchmark results for the o3 AI model. OpenAI introduced o3 in December, stating that the model could solve approximately 25% of questions on FrontierMath, a difficult math problem set. Epoch AI, the research institute behind FrontierMath, discovered that o3 achieved a score of approximately 10%, which was significantly lower than OpenAI’s top-reported score. OpenAI has launcheda new API feature called Flex processingthat allows users to use AI models at a lower cost but with slower response times and occasional resource unavailability. Flex processing is available in beta on the o3 and o4-mini reasoning models for non-production tasks like model evaluations, data enrichment, and asynchronous workloads. OpenAI has rolled out a new system to monitor itsAI reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, for biological and chemical threats. The system is designed to prevent models from giving advice that could potentially lead to harmful attacks, as stated inOpenAI’s safety report. OpenAIhas released two new reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, just two days after launching GPT-4.1. The company claims o3 is the most advanced reasoning model it has developed, while o4-mini is said to provide a balance of price, speed, and performance. The new models stand out from previous reasoning models because they can use ChatGPT features like web browsing, coding, and image processing and generation. Butthey hallucinatemore than several of OpenAI’s previous models. Open AI introduced a new section called “library” to make it easier for users to create images on mobile and web platforms, perthe company’s X post. All of your image creations, all in one place.Introducing the new library for your ChatGPT image creations—rolling out now to all Free, Plus, and Pro users on mobile andhttps://t.co/nYW5KO1aIg.pic.twitter.com/ADWuf5fPbj OpenAI said on Tuesdaythat it might revise its safety standards if “another frontier AI developer releases a high-risk system without comparable safeguards.” The move shows how commercial AI developers face more pressure to rapidly implement models due to the increased competition. OpenAIis currently in the early stages of developingits own social media platform to compete with Elon Musk’s X and Mark Zuckerberg’s Instagram and Threads,according to The Verge. It is unclear whether OpenAI intends to launch the social network as a standalone application or incorporate it into ChatGPT. OpenAIwill discontinue its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from its API even though it was just launched in late February. GPT-4.5 will be available in a research preview for paying customers. Developers can use GPT-4.5 through OpenAI’s API until July 14; then, they will need to switch to GPT-4.1, which was released on April 14. OpenAIhas launched three members of the GPT-4.1 model— GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and GPT-4.1 nano — with a specific focus on coding capabilities. It’s accessible via the OpenAI API but not ChatGPT. In the competition to develop advanced programming models, GPT-4.1 will rival AI models such asGoogle’s Gemini 2.5 Pro,Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet, andDeepSeek’s upgraded V3. OpenAIplans to sunset GPT-4, an AI model introduced more than two years ago, and replace it with GPT-4o, the current default model,per changelog. It will take effect on April 30. GPT-4 will remain available via OpenAI’s API. OpenAI may launch several new AI models, including GPT-4.1, soon, The Vergereported, citing anonymous sources. GPT-4.1 would be an update of OpenAI’s GPT-4o, which was released last year. On the list of upcoming models are GPT-4.1 and smaller versions like GPT-4.1 mini and nano, per the report. OpenAIstarted updating ChatGPTto enable the chatbot to remember previous conversations with a user and customize its responses based on that context. This feature is rolling out to ChatGPT Pro and Plus users first, excluding those in the U.K., EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland. It looks like OpenAI is working on a watermarking feature for images generated using GPT-4o. AI researcher Tibor Blahospotteda new “ImageGen” watermark feature in the new beta of ChatGPT’s Android app. Blaho also found mentions of other tools: “Structured Thoughts,” “Reasoning Recap,” “CoT Search Tool,” and “l1239dk1.” OpenAI is offering its $20-per-monthChatGPT Plussubscription tier for free to all college studentsin the U.S. and Canada through the end of May. The offer will let millions of students use OpenAI’s premium service, which offers access to the company’s GPT-4o model, image generation, voice interaction, and research tools that are not available in the free version. More than 130 million users have created over 700 million images since ChatGPT gotthe upgraded image generatoron March 25, according toCOO of OpenAI Brad Lightcap. The image generator was made availableto all ChatGPT userson March 31, and went viral for being able to create Ghibli-style photos. The Arc Prize Foundation, which develops the AI benchmark tool ARC-AGI, has updated the estimated computing costs for OpenAI’s o3 “reasoning” model managed by ARC-AGI. The organization originally estimated that the best-performing configuration of o3 it tested, o3 high, would cost approximately $3,000 to address a single problem. The Foundation now thinks the cost could be much higher,possibly around $30,000 per task. In aseriesof postson X, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company’s new image-generation tool’s popularity may cause product releases to be delayed. “We are getting things under control, but you should expect new releases from OpenAI to be delayed, stuff to break, and for service to sometimes be slow as we deal with capacity challenges,” he wrote. OpeanAIintends to release its “first” open language modelsinceGPT-2“in the coming months.” The company plans to host developer events to gather feedback and eventually showcase prototypes of the model. The first developer event is to be held in San Francisco, with sessions to follow in Europe and Asia. OpenAImade a notable change to its content moderation policiesafter the success of its new image generator in ChatGPT, which went viral for being able to createStudio Ghibli-style images. The company has updated its policies to allow ChatGPT to generate images of public figures, hateful symbols, and racial features when requested. OpenAI had previously declined such prompts due to the potential controversy or harm they may cause. However, the company has now “evolved” its approach, as statedin a blog postpublished by Joanne Jang, the lead for OpenAI’s model behavior. OpenAIwants to incorporate Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP)into all of its products, including the ChatGPT desktop app. MCP, an open-source standard, helps AI models generate more accurate and suitable responses to specific queries, and lets developers create bidirectional links between data sources and AI applications like chatbots. The protocol is currently available in the Agents SDK, and support for the ChatGPT desktop app and Responses API will be coming soon, OpenAI CEOSam Altman said. The latest update of the image generator on OpenAI’s ChatGPThas triggered a flood of AI-generated memes in the style of Studio Ghibli, the Japanese animation studio behind blockbuster films like “My Neighbor Totoro” and “Spirited Away.” The burgeoning mass of Ghibli-esque images havesparked concerns aboutwhether OpenAI has violated copyright laws, especially since the company is already facing legal action for using source material without authorization. OpenAI expects its revenue to triple to $12.7 billion in 2025, fueled by the performance of its paid AI software, Bloombergreported, citing an anonymous source. While the startup doesn’t expect to reach positive cash flow until 2029, it expects revenue to increase significantly in 2026 to surpass $29.4 billion, the report said. OpenAI onTuesdayrolled out a major upgrade to ChatGPT’s image-generation capabilities: ChatGPT can now usethe GPT-4omodel to generate and edit images and photos directly. The feature went live earlier this week in ChatGPT and Sora, OpenAI’s AI video-generation tool, for subscribers of the company’s Pro plan, priced at $200 a month, and will be available soon to ChatGPT Plus subscribers and developers using the company’s API service. The company’s CEOSam Altman said on Wednesday,however, that the release of the image generation feature to free users would be delayed due to higher demand than the company expected. Brad Lightcap, OpenAI’s chief operating officer, will lead the company’s global expansion and manage corporate partnershipsas CEO Sam Altman shifts his focus to research and products, accordingto a blog postfrom OpenAI. Lightcap, who previously worked with Altman at Y Combinator, joined the Microsoft-backed startup in 2018. OpenAI also said Mark Chen would step into the expanded role of chief research officer, and Julia Villagra will take on the role of chief people officer. OpenAIhas updated its AI voice assistant with improved chatting capabilities, according to a video posted on Monday (March 24) to the company’sofficial media channels. The update enables real-time conversations, and the AI assistant is said to be more personable and interrupts users less often. Users on ChatGPT’s free tier can now access the new version of Advanced Voice Mode, while paying users will receive answers that are “more direct, engaging, concise, specific, and creative,”a spokesperson from OpenAI told TechCrunch. OpenAI and Meta have separately engaged in discussions with Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries regarding potential collaborations to enhance their AI services in the country,per a report by The Information. One key topic being discussed is Reliance Jio distributing OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Reliance has proposed selling OpenAI’s models to businesses in India through an application programming interface (API) so they can incorporate AI into their operations. Meta also plans to bolster its presence in India by constructing a large 3GW data center in Jamnagar, Gujarat. OpenAI, Meta, and Reliance have not yet officially announced these plans. Noyb, a privacy rights advocacy group, is supporting an individual in Norwaywho was shocked to discover that ChatGPTwas providing false information about him, stating that he had been found guilty of killing two of his children and trying to harm the third. “The GDPR is clear. Personal data has to be accurate,” said Joakim Söderberg, data protection lawyer at Noyb, in a statement. “If it’s not, users have the right to have it changed to reflect the truth. Showing ChatGPT users a tiny disclaimer that the chatbot can make mistakes clearly isn’t enough. You can’t just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.” OpenAIhas added new transcription and voice-generating AI models to its APIs: a text-to-speech model, “gpt-4o-mini-tts,” that delivers more nuanced and realistic sounding speech, as well as two speech-to-text models called “gpt-4o-transcribe” and “gpt-4o-mini-transcribe”. The company claims they are improved versions of what was already there and that they hallucinate less. OpenAIhas introduced o1-proin its developer API. OpenAI says its o1-pro uses more computing than itso1 “reasoning” AI modelto deliver “consistently better responses.” It’s only accessible to select developers who have spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services. OpenAI charges $150 for every million tokens (about 750,000 words) input into the model and $600 for every million tokens the model produces. It costs twice as much asOpenAI’s GPT-4.5for input and 10 times the price of regular o1. Noam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI,thinks that certain types of AI models for “reasoning” could have been developed 20 years agoif researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in apost on X, that the company hastrained a “new model” that’s “really good” at creative writing. He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt “Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.” OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming.And it turns out that itmight not be that greatat creative writing at all. we trained a new model that is good at creative writing (not sure yet how/when it will get released). this is the first time i have been really struck by something written by AI; it got the vibe of metafiction so right.PROMPT:Please write a metafictional literary short story… OpenAIrolled out new toolsdesignedto help developers and businesses build AI agents— automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks — using the company’s own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI’s new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar toOpenAI’s Operator product. The Responses API effectively replacesOpenAI’s Assistants API, which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026. OpenAIintends to release several “agent” productstailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according toa report from The Information. One, a “high-income knowledge worker” agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting “PhD-level research,” are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It’s unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them. The latest version of the macOS ChatGPT appallows users to edit code directly in supported developer tools, including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers can use the feature now, and the company plans to roll it out to more users like Enterprise, Edu, and free users. According toa new reportfrom VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI’s AI chatbot, ChatGPT,experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024.It took ChatGPT nine months to increase its weekly active users from100 million in November 2023to 200 million in August 2024, but it only took less than six months to double that number once more, according to the report. ChatGPT’s weekly active users increased to300 million by December 2024and400 million by February 2025. ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities. ChatGPT usage spiked from April to May 2024, shortly after that model’s launch. OpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a “simplified” product offering. In apost on X, Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that “integrates a lot of [OpenAI’s] technology,” including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model. Acommonly cited statis that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI’s latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofitAI research institute Epoch AIfound the average ChatGPT queryconsumes around 0.3 watt-hours.However, the analysis doesn’t consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing. In response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicatesits step-by-step “thought” process.ChatGPT users will see an updated “chain of thought” that shows more of the model’s “reasoning” steps and how it arrived at answers to questions. OpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web searchwithout having to log in.While OpenAIhad previously allowedusers to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot’s last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in. OpenAI announced a new AI “agent”called deep researchthat’s designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the “agent” is intended for instances where you don’t just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources. OpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView tomeasure the persuasive abilitiesof its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects userposts from the subredditand asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user’s mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models’ responses to human replies for that same post. OpenAI launched a newAI “reasoning” model, o3-mini,the newest in the company’s o family of models. OpenAI firstpreviewed the model in Decemberalongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both “powerful” and “affordable.” A new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found thatover half of ChatGPT’s mobile usersare under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users. OpenAI launched ChatGPT Govdesigned to provide U.S. government agenciesan additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI’s corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI’s tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data. Younger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork,according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center.In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they’ve used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it’s acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm. OpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator,the company’s AI “agent” tool,for up to 90 days — even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days,which is 60 days shorter than Operator’s. OpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that cantake control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions.Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online. Operator,OpenAI’s agent tool,could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT’s code base suggest thatOperator will be available as an early research previewto users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren’t yet publicly visible, buta user on X who goes by Choispotted these updates in ChatGPT’s client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI’s website. OpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT userssign up with only a phone number— no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can’t upgrade to one of OpenAI’s paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn’t supported without a valid email. ChatGPT’s new beta feature, called tasks,allows users to set simple reminders. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week. OpenAI is introducing a new way for users tocustomize their interactions with ChatGPT.Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and “traits” they’d like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like “Chatty,” “Encouraging,” and “Gen Z.” However,some users reportedthat the new options have disappeared, so it’s possible they went live prematurely. ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startupOpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text. November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use. Both the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model isGPT-4o. There is a free version ofChatGPTthat only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version,ChatGPT Plus. Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies andsearch enginesare utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns. Multiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others maylimit the use of the AI-powered tool. Most recently,Microsoft announcedat its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating its ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startupLooking Glass utilizes ChatGPTto produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT.  And nonprofit organizationSolana officially integrated the chatbotinto its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space. GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer. A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn’t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they’ll give canned responses to questions. ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt. Yes. Due to the nature of how these models work, they don’t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That’s a problem when you’re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn’t commit, that may well at this point be libel. We will see howhandling troubling statements produced by ChatGPTwill play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry. Yes,there is a free ChatGPT mobile appfor iOS and Android users. It’s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words. Yes, it wasreleasedMarch 1, 2023. Everyday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc. Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc. It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can’t necessarily program an entire app’s worth of code. That’s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness — in other words, the generated code isn’t always appropriate for the specific context in which it’s being used. Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet. Yes. There aremultiple AI-powered chatbotcompetitors such asTogether, Google’sGeminiand Anthropic’sClaude, and developers arecreating open sourcealternatives. OpenAI has said that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling outthis form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”. The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request”. In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on “legitimate interest” (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “Seeherefor instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.” Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI’s technology into its bot named Clyde wheretwo users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine(meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm. An Australian mayor has publicly announcedhe may sue OpenAI for defamationdue to ChatGPT’s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service. CNET found itself in the midst of controversy afterFuturism reportedthe publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, wasaccusedof using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect. Several major school systems and colleges,including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim thatnot every educator agrees with. There have also been cases of ChatGPTaccusing individuals of false crimes. Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One isPromptBase. Another isChatX. More launch every day. Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in ourtests, they’re inconsistent at best. No. But OpenAIrecentlydisclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users’ conversations to other people on the service. None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI isinvolvedin at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT. Yes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Posted: According to a new, brow-raisingWSJ report, Tesla’s board quietly began searching for Elon Musk’s potential successor about a month ago, approaching executive search firms as the carmaker faced protests, plummeting sales, and shrinking profits while Musk waded into Washington to slash government spending. Board members reportedly met with Musk to express concerns about his divided attention, telling him he needed to spend more time on Tesla and to publicly commit to doing so; per the Journal report, Musk didn’t push back and subsequently told investors he would “allocate far more time to Tesla” starting in May. Tesla chair Robyn Denholmsaidin a statement released overnight that it was “absolutely false” that the company approached recruitment firms. She also claimed “this was communicated to the media before the report was published.” Musk shared the statement and argued it was an “EXTREMELY BAD BREACH OF ETHICS.” The WSJ has since said Teslanever responded to the reporters’ questions. Musk’s government work led to Tesla’s first annual sales decline in over a decade; it also tarnished the company’s brand image among some consumers due to his political alignment. The impact has been fast and furious: Tesla’s market value dropped from $1.5 trillion in December to about $900 billion currently. Despite these challenges, Musk sounded optimistic about Tesla’s future during last week’s earnings call, where the company reported a 71% profit decline and 9% revenue drop.”We’re not on the ragged edge of death,” Musk assured investors, “not even close.” The current status of the succession planning remains unclear, according to the Journal. It adds that it’s unclear whether Musk, who has run Tesla for nearly 20 years, was aware of the effort. This story has been updated to include statements from Tesla and the WSJ.

    "title": "When will we know the results?",
    "article_text": "Polls have closed in local council and mayoral elections across parts of England. These are the first local elections since the general election was held in July 2024. Elections are taking place in 23 councils across England. All seats will be contested in: Six mayoral elections are also happening: in the West of England, Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, North Tyneside, Doncaster and – for the first time – in Greater Lincolnshire and Hull and East Yorkshire. In addition, council elections are taking place in the Isles of Scilly. Voters in the Runcorn and Helsby constituencywill also elect their new MP. The former Labour MP Mike Amesbury announced he was standing down after his conviction for assaulting a constituent. No routine elections are taking place in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland. With polls closed, the wait now begins for results. Whether you're staying up through the night, or plan to set an alarm for a certain result, here's roughly when we're expecting calls to be made. But election results can come far later, or far earlier, than expected. Northumberland is the only council expected to declare its results overnight, with most councils beginning their counting on Friday morning. The full results for those councils won't come until the afternoon, with Durham expected to be the first to declare at 13:00. At around 14:30 we should find out who is the mayor for Hull & East Yorkshire. The pace of results will start to pick up from around 15:00, with the result due for the Cambridgeshire & Peterborough mayoral contest. The bulk of council results are expected by early evening, with the final declarations expected in Kent and West Northamptonshire at around 19:00. Different types of councils are responsible for a variety of local services. These include: Matt Chorley: Local elections might lack glamour - but they matter What is council tax and how much is it going up? Six mayors will be elected on 1 May: A single authority mayor is the political leader of the council. They are responsible for delivering local council services. Metro mayors are regional leaders who chair combined authorities, which are groups of several local councils. They set out plans to boost their local economy, and have some powers over housing and transport. Eighty-seven councillors are due to be elected across the county. Sixty councillors are due to be elected in 58 electoral divisions across the county. Polling station across Doncaster are open between 07:00 and 22:00 BST.",

    "title": "Tracking a smuggler behind deadly Atlantic migrant crossing",
    "article_text": "In January a migrant boat was rescued off the north African coast after 14 harrowing days lost at sea. Some 50 people died on the voyage, many of whom were lied to by people smugglers promising safe and legal routes to Europe. BBC Verify has tracked one of the traffickers responsible - documenting his activities across three continents. Punjabi rap music plays over a video showing three men at a beachside restaurant in Mauritania's capital Nouakchott. One after the other, they smile at the camera before casually turning to talk and laugh together. The three are clearly friends. Two of them, Sufian Ali and Atif Shahzad, are cousins from rural Pakistan. But it's the third man in particular who dominates the conversation. He's Fadi Gujjar, a people smuggler. The video - posted to Gujjar's TikTok account - is one of more than 450 clips analysed by BBC Verify that reveal clues about his activities and his close relationship to the other men. Within a month of this video being posted online, Ali and Shahzad were dead - beaten to death on the boat journey sold to them by Gujjar, who promised a safe route into Europe. Meanwhile, Gujjar found himself on the run,wanted by Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency (FIA)for his role in the tragedy. When BBC Verify contacted him on a phone number obtained from survivors, Gujjar said repeatedly in a series of voice notes his name had been \"misused\" by survivors in connection with the disaster and that he was leaving it all in the hands of Allah. Fadi Gujjar is from Jaurah in Pakistan's Punjab region. In his 30s, his real name is Khawar Hassan - though he also goes by Bishi Gujjar. Pakistani smugglersthe BBC has previously reported onhave tended to boastfully advertise illegal routes to Europe online. But Gujjar is careful. His online presence is limited to highly edited videos of his travels and almost all clients BBC Verify identified are local to Jaurah. Advertisements for his services seem to spread by word of mouth. His current location on Facebook is set to Istanbul, Turkey - an oasis for smugglers looking to make a quick buck. Videos posted to TikTok place him in the city since July 2022, showing the smuggler outside the iconic Hagia Sophia and a Pakistani supermarket. One other location stands out: Mauritania on West Africa's Atlantic coast - the nerve-centre of his operation and the place from which the migrant boat started its perilous journey. Since 2023, the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) says Mauritania has become a hub for people smuggling - spurred on by a crackdown on other routes. The route is deadly. IOM data shows that 170 people - including 14 children - have died or gone missing on it this year. Many Pakistanis seeking economic opportunities in Europe are willing to take the risk. Life there is glorified online by migrants already living on the continent. Smugglers like Gujjar, whose lucrative business is fuelled by people's aspirations, take advantage of this. These migrants are taking a gamble, using their families' savings or selling up to make the journey. The survivors we spoke to, on average, say they paid Gujjar $13,000 (£10,000). There are no direct flights from Pakistan to Mauritania, so some of the migrants transited through Ethiopia or the Middle East. From there, almost all of them went on to Senegal, before crossing into Mauritania, either by road or a short boat journey along the Senegal River. Gujjar's travel history - obtained by BBC Verify through a source - showed the smuggler followed a similar route, entering Dakar airport in Senegal on two occasions in 2024. Multiple videos also place him in the Mauritanian capital Nouakchott from October 2024 - though the date of upload could differ to when they were filmed. Further clips, posted to TikTok by Ali and Shahzad place Gujjar in Mauritania as early as August 2024. The trio are seen on the rooftops of Nouakchott's sand-coloured buildings and in restaurants around the city - a luxury other migrants couldn't afford. Videos from their accounts reveal the men were close, hailing from the same village. Their uncle, Ahsan Shahzad Chaudhry, confirmed to BBC Verify that his nephew Sufian Ali was friends with Gujjar. One survivor named Uzair Bhat said Gujjar falsely promised him safe and legal routes to Europe. He sent BBC Verify proof of funds transferred to a bank account under Gujjar's real name, Khawar Hassan. But when Uzair arrived in Mauritania, the smuggler backtracked. \"He said going by air will not work from here. I'll send you by a big ship,\" Uzair recalled. \"Please cooperate, your visa [to Europe] won't come through.\" Eventually Uzair relented. As well as Ali, Shahzad and Uzair, BBC Verify identified two other migrants who bought journeys from Gujjar. Once they arrived in Nouakchott they say they were placed in \"safe houses\" - a term used for buildings tucked away in obscure alleys where migrants are held illegally by smugglers. One person who used a different agent said he also stayed in safe houses run by Gujjar. BBC Verify confirmed the location of one to an area near the port of Nouakchott, which survivors say Gujjar occasionally visited. Survivors BBC Verify spoke to say they set off from Nouakchott in a small fishing boat in the early hours on 2 January. Most of those onboard bought passage from smugglers in their hometowns in Pakistan. But the three day trip turned into a deadly two-week journey adrift at sea. Uzair said that from the day they left port the migrants \"were constantly scooping water out of the boat\". Another man, Bilalwal Iqbal, recalled that passengers soon began \"drinking sea water and after drinking it, people became delirious\". According to the survivors, the crew onboard - West Africans employed by the smugglers - starved the Pakistani migrants of food and water, and beat them daily. \"I tried to take one of their bottles of water so they hit me on the head with a rope and the impact just made me fall back,\" Iqbal told BBC Verify. \"Then they pummelled my thumbs with a hammer. I still have those wounds.\" Sufian Ali and Atif Shahzad died after being beaten to death by the crew, their uncle said. He was informed of the circumstances surrounding their deaths by survivors. Others died of starvation, dehydration and hypothermia. Those still alive, including the crew, had given up until they saw a much larger fishing vessel come into view. Uzair Bhat jumped into the ocean and swam towards it for help. The coastguard instructed the vessel to take the migrant boat to Dakhla port - 60 miles away. According to the IOM, 15 dead bodies were found onboard while 35 people remain missing at sea and presumed dead. Pakistani authorities have named Gujjar as one of ten smugglers involved in the tragedy. Some have been arrested, but not Gujjar. BBC Verify geolocated his most recent TikTok posts to Baku, Azerbaijan - though we cannot say for certain if he is still there. Since news of the rescue broke, his mother and one of his brothers have been detained in Pakistan, accused of collecting money on Gujjar's behalf from people buying routes to Europe. BBC Verify has also seen six police reports filed in Punjab by the families of those on the boat journey. They allege Gujjar collected $75,000 (£56,000) for his role in the January disaster. Three people paid in full, while the remaining three had only paid deposits, the police reports said. We believe Gujjar was still facilitating journeys to Europe after the boat disaster in January. Contacted by an undercover BBC reporter in March using a phone number obtained from survivors, Gujjar said he \"knew someone\" who would help arrange a journey, but did not directly offer to get involved himself. Additional reporting by Dilay Yaçin, Javed Sumroo and Joshua Cheetham. What do you want BBC Verify to investigate? It is unclear how they died - the police had referred to a possible kidnapping but now suggest an accident. The attack on a Catholic priest comes amid rising political tensions ahead of October's elections. He is accused of backing M23 rebels in the east but he has previously denied links to the group. The opposition legislator had just left parliament when he was attacked by gunmen on a motorcycle, police say. One man's struggle to save Uganda's once-profitable trees that produce shea butter.",

    "title": "Streeting accused of 'betrayal' over maternity funding plan",
    "article_text": "Campaigners have questioned Health Secretary Wes Streeting's commitment to maternity safety after his department watered down funding levels. Almost £100m was invested into improving maternity safety annually following the publication of an interim report into poor care at the Shrewsbury and Telford NHS trust. But changes by the Department of Health mean that just £2m of the funding is guaranteed to be spent on maternity care this year. Rhiannon Davies, who lost her daughter due to poor care at the trust, called the decision \"an absolute betrayal by Wes Streeting\". The Department of Health said local health leaders would be given the money to decide how best to spend it. The Royal College of Midwives described the funding decision as taking \"a wrecking ball\" to maternity safety. The review into maternity care at the Shrewsbury and Telford trust, published in 2022, found that at least 201 babies and nine mothers could have survived with better care. Following the publication of an interim report, in March 2021, NHS England said it would increase spending on maternity care by £95m a year. At the time, it said the money would be used to hire as many as 1,000 midwives and around 80 consultant obstetricians. Some of the money was also to be spent on allowing consultants and midwives to train together - a key recommendation of the initial report, by senior midwife Donna Ockenden - as well as allocating money for the NHS to recruit from overseas. But analysis of NHS funding for this year,carried out by the Health Service Journal, showed that just £2m of the £95m was to be ringfenced for 2025/26. The rest of the money will be given to the 42 Integrated Care Boards (ICBs) that decide how the health service funding is allocated locally across England. Responding to the change,Ms Ockenden posted on social media: \"How has this happened? So disappointed. Talking to colleagues across perinatal services, the sense of disappointment is profound.\" If the ICBs decide to spend the money they've been allocated on maternity care, there won't be a funding cut. But some maternity staff have labelled the change as disastrous, fearing that taking away the funding protection will mean maternity budgets will be cut. \"Removing the ringfencing will take us back years,\" said a senior midwife. The Royal College of Midwives said it was \"utterly shocked\" by Streeting's decision, adding it was \"short-sighted\" and \"utterly unacceptable\". \"These budget cuts… will rip the heart out of any moves to improve maternity safety,\" said chief executive Gill Walton. \"The government has taken a wrecking ball to the work that's being done up and down the country to improve maternity safety, something which is desperately needed.\" Rhiannon Davies, who alongside Kayleigh Griffiths was instrumental in getting the Shrewsbury inquiry commissioned, was also strongly critical of the health secretary. The money,she wrote, \"was to ensure others avoided the lifelong pain we have to endure without our children\". The Department of Health and Social Care said maternity care remained a top priority for the health service. In a statement, it said: \"The same level of funding is still being delivered as part of wider ICB allocations, giving local healthcare leaders - who are best placed to decide how to serve their local community - more flexibility. \"We are clear that too many women are not receiving the safe, personalised and compassionate maternity care they deserve, but through our Plan for Change, this government is determined to change that.\" The department said it would help hospital trusts to make rapid improvements and train thousands more midwives. Nicola Packer tells a court she had shown no signs of pregnancy and didn't think she could conceive. The temporary registration suspensions have been imposed by Ofsted on the Black Country nurseries. The proposed law requires all new maternity wards to include dedicated bereavement facilities. University of Oxford researchers analysed data from 16,500 mothers as part of the study. The group aims to help mums-to-be in Worcestershire get answers to their pregnancy questions.",

    "title": "Lynx could be first UK zoo-born cat freed into the wild",
    "article_text": "A lynx born in a zoo in Cornwall could become the first UK zoo-born cat to be successfully released into the wild. Animals born and raised in zoos are rarely considered for release because they either don't have the survival skills or have become too used to human interaction. But a shortage of female lynxes in the European breeding programme led to the unusual request being made for the cat from Newquay Zoo. It has been moved to Germany's Black Forest where it will spend the next few months being monitored in an enclosure to see if it's up to the challenge. This week the BBC watched on as, with the help of some judicious prodding with a broom, the Newquay lynx was loaded onto a truck headed for southwestern Germany. Two days later we were in Germany as it was cajoled into a 1,200-sq-metre enclosure. John Meek from Newquay Zoo was also on hand to see the lynx gingerly stroll out into its new home. \"I'm a big boy but I had a few tears in my eyes,\" he said. \" Nowadays, zoos are not here to keep animals in cages. They're there for conservation. And this is it, conservation in action.\" Thousands of lynx already roam wild in European forests but efforts are being made to introduce new cats to increase their genetic diversity particularly in central Europe. Though not officially classed as a \"big cat\" Eurasian lynx can weigh up to 30 kilos and hunt deer for food. Once native to the UK they were driven to extinction hundreds of years ago and with British deer populations at record levels there have been calls for their re-introduction. \"Basically I'm Tinder for the zoo-born lynx,\" says Dina Gebhardt from Bern Animal Park with a smile when I speak to her on Zoom. It was her who sent out the SOS for the Newquay lynx. The lynx-breeding coordinator for the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP), she matches females and males from across the continent as well as finding new homes for their offspring. \"Our nature is very fragmented, due to railways and streets and cities. And this means we created a lot of barriers for the lynx, which leads to inbreeding,\" Dina says. To combat that Dina finds captive young lynx that can be introduced into the wild to increase numbers and improve the genetic mix. Usually Dina's lynxes have been raised from birth with the minimum of human contact, specifically with release in mind. But last year, much to Dina's frustration, there was a particularly high number of male lynxes born. And a successful rewilding programme needs females much more  than males. So Dina reached out to Newquay Zoo to ask them if their one year old female might be available. \"Of course we said yes straight away, that's something that we'd love to do,\" says John Meek, the curator of plants and animals at Newquay Zoo. Over the next few months the lynx will be monitored to see if it has the necessary skills to survive in the wild. Catching and killing prey is not expected to be a problem. \"If you know your cats, you know that even a cat that has lived in a room its whole life, once it gets out is able to kill a bird or a mouse,\" Eva Klebelsberg who runs the lynx reintroduction programme for Baden-Württemberg told us. We're standing over the carcass of a Roe Deer in the Black Forest just outside Karlsruhe. There is a small population of lynxes already living in the forest and this is one of their kills. There are puncture marks on its throat – a sure sign. \"Our ecosystems in Europe are missing large predators,\" Eva says, explaining that the lynx helps control populations of deer as well as ensuring that they keep moving and don't strip forested areas. The key question in relation to the Newquay lynx is likely to be its relationship with humans. Having spent its entire life looking through bars at visitors and being fed by keepers it will need to show that it is not going to seek out more human interaction. \"Central Europe is very crowded and we don't have many places where there is enough space for larger animals.\" says Dr Marco Roller from Karlsruhe zoo, who manages the enclosure. \"We don't want human animal conflicts. So for us it's important we don't have aggressive animals or curious animals which may walk through cities or close to human settlements.\" The final decision on the Newquay lynx's fate will be taken later in the summer after several months of close monitoring.",

    "title": "Apple says most US-bound iPhones no longer made in China",
    "article_text": "Apple says it is shifting production of most iPhones and other devices to be sold in the US away from China, which has been the focus of President Donald Trump's tariffs. The majority of the iPhones bound for the US market in the coming months will be made in India, while Vietnam will be a major production hub for items like iPads and Apple Watches, chief executive Tim Cook says. It comes as the technology giant estimated that US import taxes could add about $900m (£677.5m) to its costs in the current quarter, despite Trump's decision to spare key electronics from the new tariffs. The Trump administration has repeatedly said it wants Apple to move production to America. The estimate comes as firms around the world are scrambling to respond to the huge shifts in global trade triggered by Washington's trade policies. On a call with investors on Thursday to discuss the firm's financial performance, the Apple boss seemed keen to draw attention to its investments in the US. Mr Cook opened the discussion with a reminder of the company's plans to invest $500bn across several US states over the next four years. He also said Apple is shifting its supply chain for US-bound products away from China, but it is India and Vietnam that are poised to be major beneficiaries of that move. \"We do expect the majority of iPhones sold in US will have India as their country of origin,\" Mr Cook said. Meanwhile, Vietnam will be the chief manufacturing hub \"for almost all iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and AirPods product sold in the US.\" China will remain the country of origin for the vast majority of total products sold outside the US, he added. Apple shares had plummeted after Trump announced his administration would levy \"reciprocal tariffs\" on products imported to the United States, with the aim of persuading companies to manufacture more in the US. But his administration faced significant pressure to moderate its plans. Shortly after the tariffs went into effect, it announced that certain electronics, including phones and computers, would be exempted. For now, trade turmoil has left Apple's sales unscathed. The company said revenues for the first three months of the year rose 5% from the same period last year, to $95.4bn. Amazon, another tech giant whose results were being closely watched for signs of tariff damage, likewise said sales were holding up, rising 8% year-on-year in its North America e-commerce business in the most recent quarter. It forecast similar growth in the months ahead. \"Obviously no one of us knows exactly where tariffs will settle or when,\" said Amazon boss Andy Jassy, while noting that the firm has emerged from periods of disruption – like the pandemic – stronger than before. \"We're often able to weather challenging conditions better than others,\" he said. \"I'm optimistic this could happen again.\" The shift of the iPhone supply chain to India was \"impressive\" according to Patrick Moorhead, chief executive of Moor Insights & Strategy. \"This is a marked change from what [Cook] said a few years back when he said that only China can build iPhones,\" Mr Moorhead said. \"There is lots of progress that Apple must show here but it's a pretty good start,\" he said. Amazon is also repositioning itself to increase resilience in the face of the tariffs. The company said it working to make sure it had a diversity of sellers and Mr Jassy said he felt the firm was well-positioned for the months ahead, pointing to the firm's scale and its role supplying everyday essentials. For now, it said sales had not been hurt by the tariff turmoil. If anything, executives said the business may have benefited from some customers starting to stockpile. Overall sales jumped 9% to $155.7bn in the first three months of 2025, compared with the same period last year, while profits surged more than 60% year-on-year to roughly $17bn. The de minimis exemption was key to the huge growth of sales seen by the Chinese online retailers. Donald Trump and Xi Jinping are locked in a game of chicken - despite wanting the same outcome. Chinese Australians are a crucial group that deserted the conservative Liberal-National coalition in the last election. Foreign policy is rarely a big factor in Australia's poll - but the US president has changed that. The firm told the BBC it had restricted internet access in its stores following an attempted cyber attack.",

    "title": "Harrods latest retailer to be hit by cyber attack",
    "article_text": "The luxury department store Harrods says it is the latest retailer to have been targeted by a cyber attack. The firm said it had \"restricted internet access at our sites\" following an attempt to gain access to its systems. It comes the day after the Co-op shut down parts of its IT systems to fend off a hack, while Marks & Spencer continues to deal with a cyber attack that has cost it millions of pounds in lost sales. Harrods said its flagship store remained open, and it continues to operate its online sales. Harrods did not clarify what the scale of the impact on its network was, but said customers were being asked to \"not do anything differently at this point\". A statement from Harrods read: \"We recently experienced attempts to gain unauthorised access to some of our systems. \"Our seasoned IT security team immediately took proactive steps to keep systems safe and as a result we have restricted internet access at our sites today. \"Currently all sites including our Knightsbridge store, H beauty stores and airport stores remain open to welcome customers. Customers can also continue to shop via harrods.com. Harrods' online store appeared to be operating normally on Thursday evening. Richard Horne, chief executive of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the UK government body responsible for supporting organisations facing cyber threats, said the spate of attacks should serve as a \"wake-up call\" for Harrods, the Co-op and M&S. He said the NCSC was working closely with the companies that had reported incidents, \"to fully understand the nature of these attacks and to provide expert advice to the wider sector based on the threat picture\". Cody Barrow, former cyber chief at America's National Security Agency, now chief executive of cybersecurity firm EclecticIQ, said the incident exposed the sector's \"mounting vulnerability to cyber threats\". He said retailers should assume that they are targets for cyber attackers, due to the volume of customer data and the high impact that disruption can cause. \"For consumers, vigilance is crucial: update passwords, monitor financial activity, and watch for scams exploiting recent breaches,\" he added. Marks and Spencer has seen its operations severely hampered by a cyber attack, the firm disclosed last week. Customers are still unable to place online orders and shelves have been left empty in some stores. The police are investigating. Meanwhile, the Co-op said on Wednesday it had shut down parts of its IT systems in response to hackers attempting to gain access. On Thursday, it emerged staff at the Co-op were being ordered to keep their cameras on during remote work meetings, and verify all attendees. Experts say that indicates the company suspects hackers may be lurking in calls. It is not known if the three incidents are connected. Toby Lewis, Head of Threat Analysis at cybersecurity firm Darktrace, said it was possible that the three incidents impacting M&S, the Co-op and Harrods were a coincidence. But he suggested two other possibilities: that all three retailers share a common supplier or technology that has been compromised and used as an entry point for hackers. Or the scale of the attack on M&S had prompted security teams at other retailers to look more closely at their safety logs and act on activity they would not have previously judged a risk. \"It's a lesson again in the growing difficulty large organisations have in securing against threats in their supply chain, particularly as those threats grow in volume and sophistication,\" he said. It is believed the disruption at M&S was a ransomware attack. This is a type of malicious software used to scramble important data or files after gaining access to computer systems, essentially locking them away unless a ransom is paid. Security experts told the BBC on Tuesday a ransomware group which goes by the name \"DragonForce\" was behind the attack. The Co-op has not given any details of the nature of cyber attack made against it. The chair of Parliament's Business and Trade Committee, Liam Byrne, has written to Marks and Spencer's chief executive, Stuart Machin, requesting further information about M&S's cybersecurity defences, and whether it had adhered to the guidance given by the NCSC. Chinese Australians are a crucial group that deserted the conservative Liberal-National coalition in the last election. The technology giant says US tariffs will add around $900m to its costs this quarter. About £80,000 worth of suspected fake and unsafe goods are seized at an  Oxford Street sweet shop. The regulator is considering a range of measures to limit vets bills including price caps. Nicola Packer tells a court she had shown no signs of pregnancy and didn't think she could conceive.",

    "article_text": "The husband of a British-South African woman found dead at her house in France has said he cannot imagine \"the terror and the fear she must have gone through\". Karen Carter, 65, was found by her friend lying near her car with stab wounds in the village of Trémolat in the Dordogne on Tuesday evening, the state prosecutor said. Mrs Carter's husband, Alan, who is in South Africa, said she was \"such a decent, lovely person\", and spoke of the family's shock. A 69-year-old local woman has been arrested as part of an investigation into the mother-of-four's death. A friend who discovered Mrs Carter's body was questioned by police and later released without charge, the state prosecutor, Sylvie Martins-Guedes, said. \"At this stage, no hypothesis is being favoured,\" she added. Mrs Carter had lived in Trémolat for more than a decade, where she ran two holiday rental homes. \"Particularly since Covid, my wife has spent more time there running the gîtes (holiday homes). It's been very busy, it's been very successful,\" Mr Carter said. \"She was very good at her job and marketing it and getting bookings throughout the year.\" Mr Carter said his cousin, who lives in Trémolat, called him after seeing a post about Mrs Carter's death on a local community Facebook page. \"She phoned me...to say she's sorry to tell me and that she thinks Karen has died. That was the first I heard about it,\" he said. \"No one had got in touch with me at all to let me know what had happened. I found out through my cousin who happened to see it on a Facebook page.\" He said he got confirmation of Mrs Carter's death after his assistant phoned local police. \"She managed to get through to the right person. I don't know how she managed that, but she did. \"He confirmed it, but he didn't give any details of what happened,\" he said, adding that he has relied on news reports for information. Mr Carter said the village is in shock over her death, adding: \"It's terrible. Such a small village where nothing like this ever happens.\" He described Mrs Carter as an outgoing, friendly person who \"wouldn't hurt a fly\", and said her death has been \"traumatic\" for his family. \"I'm an introvert, and she's the exact opposite. She's an extrovert, she loves people, she loves to have fun. People love her, she has a good heart,\" he said. \"She's the one who would bring home the lost dog, or cat, or whatever. She's that sort of person. Everyone liked her. That's why I married her. She's just lovely.\"",

    "title": "What you need to know about the Runcorn and Helsby by-election",
    "article_text": "Polls have closed in the Westminster by-election in Runcorn and Helsby on the same day as local elections in parts of England. The by-election was triggered by the resignation of Mike Amesbury, who was convicted earlier this year of assaulting a constituent. On 27 February, Amesbury was given a 10-week prison sentence and taken straight to HMP Altcourse in Liverpool. After three nights behind bars, a judge agreed to suspend Amesbury's jail term for two years. Under concerted pressure to quit the House of Commons, Amesbury - who lost the Labour whip after he was arrested last autumn and has since been sitting as an independent MP - agreed to stand down. Runcorn and Helsby includes the towns of Runcorn, Frodsham and Helsby, as well as various villages and a significant rural area. In total, 22% of the constituency is classed as a built-up area, 60% rural and 14% as water or wetland. It has a population of 93,520, with 21% of residents under 18, 57% aged 18-64 and 21% over 65. Runcorn and Helsby is a new constituency that was only created in time for the general election in July 2024. More than half of it (51.2%) came from the former constituency of Weaver Vale, with 37.1% from Halton and the remainder from three other former constituencies - Ellesmere Port and Neston, Eddisbury, and City of Chester. At the 2024 general election, Amesbury won Runcorn and Helsby for Labour with 52.9% of the vote, a majority of 14,696. Reform UK came second with 18% of the vote, ahead of the Conservatives on 16%, the Green Party with 6.4%, and the Liberal Democrats with 5.1%. Two smaller parties received 1.4% between them. Amesbury was the Labour MP for Weaver Vale from June 2017 until the seat was abolished before the general election. He gained the seat from Conservative Graham Evans, who had been the constituency's MP since 2010. Meanwhile, from its creation in 1983, Halton was always held by Labour. Derek Twigg - who is now the MP for Widnes and Halewood - held it from 1997. This will be Sir Keir Starmer's first by-election as prime minister. A lot has happened in the nine months since Labour swept to power, with several tax rises announced in the Budget, and ongoing negotiations with President Trump about world trade and the war in Ukraine. University of Liverpool Professor Jon Tonge recently told BBC Politics North West that, as one of the safest Labour seats in the country, it would be \"quite some feat\" if another party were to take Runcorn and Helsby. If recent opinion polls are anything to go by, though, Reform UK may well be confident heading into the by-election, not least because they came second there in July. The Conservatives will be hoping for signs of a recovery too. They came third in Runcorn and Helsby last time around, and they were not far behind Reform. There is a lot at stake for everyone. A total of 15 candidates are standing in the by-election. Listed alphabetically, they are as follows: Read morestories from Cheshire on the BBCand follow BBC North West onX.

    "title": "Four ways the film Conclave sheds light on the secretive way popes are chosen",
    "article_text": "The 2024 film Conclave - a box office hit and Oscar winner - tells the story of a papal election in which there are no obvious favourites. For many people, it was a glimpse into the rarefied world of the Vatican, and the highly secretive process of choosing a leader for the Roman Catholic Church. On Wednesday 7 May, life follows fiction when 134 cardinals begin the process of electing a successor to Pope Francis. As viewers of the film will know, the papal conclave will take place entirely behind the closed doors of the Sistine Chapel, beneath its world-famous Michelangelo frescoes. Nobody outside the confines of the Vatican will know the outcome until a plume of white smoke curls from its chimney, signifying that the Roman Catholic Church has a new leader. But what does the film tell us about how the conclave could unfold, and why do people find the process so fascinating? Adapted from the bestselling novel by Robert Harris, Conclave shows the cardinal-electors isolating themselves within the confines of the Vatican during the process of the election. They are not allowed communication with anyone outside the conclave -  although given the practicalities, they are not entirely cut off. \"They all need feeding, they're not totally hermetically sealed off from the world,\" says Stephen Bullivant, professor of theology and the sociology of religion at St Mary's University, Twickenham. This self-imposed isolation is a tradition which stretches back hundreds of years. In part, it is aimed at preventing the electors being influenced by external factors, although the idea of a process that happens behind closed doors may seem at odds with the modern world's \"focus on transparency, visibility and scrutiny\", according to Anna Rowlands, professor of Catholic social thought and practice at the University of Durham. The film invokes an \"incredible, introspective atmosphere\" and sense of withdrawal from the world, she says. \"I struggle to think of a more intense responsibility and feeling than being locked away in conclave.\" On the screen, claustrophobic and intense deliberations, strategic huddles and tactical moves abound. One cardinal undermines a frontrunner to improve their own chances. Others with unlikely prospects urge their supporters to change their vote. This conflict of interests and competing ideologies provides much of the film's drama. \"It's essentially about the political machinations that go on,\" Nick Emerson, the film's editor,told the BBC earlier this year. While some cardinals will think the most important part is following divine guidance, others will have anxiety over making a quick decision, says Tina Beattie, professor emerita of Catholic studies at the University of Roehampton. Given that Pope Francis's health had been poor for a while, it is likely that, even before the conclave, \"there will have been lots of politicking and jostling for position already behind the scenes\", she adds. \"There will be all those tussles going on and [the cardinals] won't all be of one mind.\" Although in the film, some of the tensest scenes are focused on the act of voting, in reality, much of the drama may come in meetings in the days before conclave officially begins. During this time, the participants will be \"getting to know each other, working out what the priorities are and learning how to work together as a body so they can come up with a unified decision\", says Prof Rowlands, who is nearing the end of a two-year secondment to the Vatican. In the film, an unknown cardinal - secretly appointed by the late pope - is catapulted into the fray. In real life, this would not be possible. Although any baptised Roman Catholic male is theoretically eligible to be made pope, all cardinals voting in the conclave would need to have been appointed publicly by a previous pope. Having said this, the imminent election may beone of the most unpredictable there has ever been. About 80% of the cardinals eligible to vote have been appointed in the past 12 years by Pope Francis. He consciously chose people from across the globe and with diverse political backgrounds. Many of Francis's appointees are from the developing world - \"places and contexts which are not normally given a red hat\", says Prof Rowlands. This adds a level of uncertainty as to their priorities and the ultimate decision. The film presents the cardinals as fallible human beings jostling for power. Director Edward Bergertold the BBC last yearthat while the conclave was thought of as \"an ancient spiritual ritual\", he wanted to bring the participants \"into modernity\". \"We put them on this pedestal, and when you look closer, they're going to have cell phones, they're going to smoke, they have the same problems and vices and secrets as we do.\" Prof Rowlands says the film provides a peak behind a process, with all elements of human nature and human life in it: \"Loss. grief, ambition, fear, temptation, courage.\" She adds: \"It's a very, very human thing, a conclave... It's got a divine purpose to it, but it's a very human thing.\" \"I don't know what the big deal is,\" says the US Hollywood actor. The Alchemy Festival in Hawick includes a film looking at the role of textiles in the Borders. As cardinals prepare to elect Pope Francis' successor on 7 May, a number of names are being seen as potential candidates. Instead the Right Reverend Dr Michael Volland will don his running gear for Birmingham Half Marathon. The Irish band have a reputation for provocation, but a new row has led to rising scrutiny and anger.",

    "title": "Donald Trump is looming over Australia's election",
    "article_text": "In Western Sydney, an audience of Stetson-wearing Australians are sitting in their fold-up camping chairs, swigging beers and eating a spiralled fried potato on a skewer known as a 'chip on a stick'. People here are enjoying bull rides, barrel racing and bucking broncos. It feels like a slice of Americana in New South Wales perhaps - but that would miss the point that here, rodeo has become very much an outback Australian tradition in its own right. In recent months, politics here in Australia could be compared to watching a rodeo. Between conflict in Europe, the Middle East and more recently US President Donald Trump and his threat of global trade wars, every day has brought with it a sharp jolt that changes the dynamics of the campaign trail. Politicians, like these cowboys, have been thrown off course despite their best efforts. \"Tariffs are great,\" exclaims rodeo fan Guy Algozzino, who's dressed in a cowboy hat, a waistcoat and a Western-style bolo tie with an engraved image of a cowboy riding a bull. \"We should have had tariff protection many years ago - it looks bad now [but] America's fantastic … Trump's the best thing America ever had.'' Other spectators are more nuanced. \"It's going nuts,\" admits Jared Harris, when asked about world politics. \"I'm just sitting back and watching. It's a bit like a show. It's quite interesting to watch, it's entertaining. It probably affects me more than I realise, but I just choose to ignore it.\" Australia didn't worry too much about President Trump's second coming when he won power back in November. The country had already witnessed a Trump presidency – and weathered it. Australia felt far removed from the shores of America. But Trump's second term is panning out very differently. Tariffs - imposed on ally and adversary alike - have travelled the whole world. Trump doesn't care about making enemies. But Australia does. People here pride themselves on 'mateship' – a value that embodies friendship and loyalty – and that extends to politics too. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said as much when Trump initially announced tariffs without exemptions. This was not \"the act of a friend,\" said Albanese, while he also committed to not responding in kind. All of this comes as the country heads to a federal election on 3 May. Candidates would rather focus on domestic issues they can control: cost-of-living, housing and healthcare. Instead, they are forced to grapple with a question that goes right to the heart of Australia's role in the world: how to deal with a US president as unpredictable as Trump? In the final few days of campaigning before up to 18 million Australians go to the polls, the Labor Party's Albanese, who entered power three years ago after promising to invest in social services and tackle climate change, went on a speedy tour of six states. That effort appears to be paying off, with the latest YouGov poll putting Labor on 54 per cent of the two-party vote, versus 47 per cent for the opposition Coalition (an alliance of the Liberals and Nationals). This is a modest turnaround from the beginning of the year, when Labor was consistently lagging the Coalition in polls. \"It's not the campaign either party thought they would be having,\" says Amy Remeikis, chief political analyst at the Australia Institute think tank. \"The looming figure of Trump is overshadowing the domestic campaign but also forcing Australia's leaders to do something they haven't had to do in a long time - examine Australia's links to the US.\" The US-Australia relationship has perhaps been taken for granted in these parts. Australia likes the fact the US has long been a dominant military force in the Pacific. Australia relies on its funding and benefits from being part of alliances like Aukus - the far-reaching defence pact between Australia, the UK and the US, designed to counter China – and the Anglo-intelligence alliance Five Eyes. The rise of China has made Australia even more conscious about having the US on its side. Beijing has expanded its military presence in the Pacific, launching various military exercises in recent years - including one live-fire drill in February that saw Chinese naval vessels just 340 nautical miles from the New South Wales coast. Australia recently announced efforts to expand its navy and now hosts four US military bases - decisions fuelled in part by the rise of China. It's all placed extra value on Canberra's alliance with Washington DC - one that Trump may be throwing into doubt. Back in February, Trump held a meeting with the UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. He was asked whether they would be discussing Aukus. \"What does that mean?\" Trump asked the reporter. After being given an explanation of Aukus, he continued. \"We'll be discussing that … we've had a very good relationship with Australia.\" Australia collectively held its breath, then let it out in a big sigh of relief. A blip maybe - but an indication perhaps of how little Trump thinks about Australia right now. However, Australia, like much of the world, is thinking about the US. \"We don't have anywhere else to turn,\" says David Andrews, senior policy advisor at the National Security College, which is part of the Australian National University in Canberra. \"We are physically isolated from everyone. As long as we've had European settlement here, we've always been concerned about the distance [and] isolation, which is why we've always maintained such a strong relationship with first Britain and then the US as the dominant maritime power.\" While only 5% of Australia's exports go to the US (China is by far Australia's biggest trading partner), the US still dominates the conversation here. \"This isn't a time to end alliances,\" says Justin Bassi, director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a think tank. \"That would be cutting off our nose to spite our face.\" And, perhaps counter to the majority view here, Bassi thinks that Australia should support Trump's moves. \"We should continue to make it clear that any measures the US takes against Australia are unjustified but we should welcome and support American measures to counter Beijing's malign actions - or for that matter Russia,\" he says. \"Not to keep Trump happy but because it is in Australia's interests to constrain the adversary that is undermining our strategic interests.\" A poll published by the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper last month found that 60% of Australians felt Trump's victory was bad for Australia. That was up from last November when it was just 40%. And a Lowy Institute poll published two weeks later showed almost two in three Australians held 'not very much' or no trust 'at all' in the US to act responsibly. Big questions on transnational alliances are not part of normal campaigning. But when Albanese and opposition leader Peter Dutton faced each other in their first televised debate, the first question asked by the audience was one on Trump. Dutton has long stressed that he would be the politician best suited to dealing with the US President. He often cites his experience as a cabinet minister during tariff negotiations in Trump's first term. But that strategy doesn't always serve him well. \"He went into the election telling people he and Trump were similar enough that they would get on better, that he was the sort of personality Trump liked,\" says Remeikis. \"He's not repeating that now because people don't want someone to get on with Trump - they want someone who will stand up to him.\" Dutton has had to do some back-pedalling on comments he made earlier in the year. Back in February, after Trump said he had plans to eject Palestinians from Gaza, Dutton called the US president \"a deal-maker … a big thinker.\" And he has come in for some criticism amid accusations of copying the US president. He's talked about cutting public sector jobs, for example. And his Liberal party appointed Jacinta Nampijinpa Price as shadow minister for government efficiency, not too dissimilar to the Doge. But when Senator Price recently started talking about wanting to 'Make Australia Great Again' on the campaign trail, Dutton avoided questions over the comments. Albanese of course has to tread a careful line too. In a world that's being turned upside down, he's trying to reassure people he's a safe pair of hands; that those alliances remain. That may turn out to be in his favour. Indeed, some analysts say that Trump's conduct may be helping Albanese, with voters rushing to support the incumbent during a time of perceived crisis. Just a few months ago, Labor's re-election was thought unlikely as it consistently polled behind the Coalition. But the final YouGov polling model of the election, published a few days ago, predicted that Labor will win 84 of the 150 seats in the House of Representatives - an increased majority. For Professor Gordon Flake, CEO at Perth USAsia Centre, a think tank, it paints a stark parallel with this week's election result in Canada - in which the Liberal Party won re-election by riding a backlash of anti-Trump sentiment. \"What we have seen in Canada has been a dramatic shift back towards the incumbent government and that is a rallying around the flag based on attacks on that country,\" he says. \"The attacks on Australia haven't been as severe so it's not the same degree, but at the same time you're also seeing a rallying around the current Labor government. Six months ago you thought their re-election would be unlikely; today on the cusp of the election here in Australia, it seems more likely than not - and one of the important factors in that has been developments in Washington DC. \" But whoever wins, they will have a big job on their hands to navigate Australia's future with its allies. \"We have to make do with the hand we've been dealt,\" says Andrews. \"I expect that we are going to have to be much more ruthlessly self-interested and that's not comfortable because our foreign policy has generally been based around cooperation, collaboration and multilateralism – so that shared sense of threat that middle powers have of working together to maximise their output.\" Back at the rodeo, the sun's gone down, the cheerleaders are out and the audience gets ready to watch bucking broncos – the riders shortly afterwards holding on to their steer for as long as possible before being violently thrown to the ground. Flying above the arena are the flags of Canada and the US, alongside Australia, New Zealand and Brazil. There may not be much of a team spirit among allies right now - but voters here will be keen to see how their next leader rides out the storm.

    "title": "Charles Darwin to Doctor Who: Famous faces come to life in art show",
    "article_text": "From Winston Churchill to Amy Winehouse, Charles Darwin to Doctor Who star Ncuti Gatwa, portraits of a host of British icons feature in the first immersive exhibition to use one of Britain's national art collections. The National Portrait Gallery (NPG) has combined digital versions of portraits from its collection with animated graphics and voiceovers to tell the stories of 19 celebrities and historical figures. It is the latest in a wave of increasingly popular immersive art shows, which fill gallery walls with large-scale projected visuals. The show launches in Salford on Friday before going on a UK tour. But while access to see the original portraits in the NPG in London is free, entrance to the Stories Brought To Life exhibition costs up to £35. NPG director Victoria Siddall told BBC News: \"The main driver of this is taking the collection to new audiences outside of London. \"But there is another element to that, of course, which is raising revenue, which is absolutely crucial for museums to thrive. \"Obviously we're always looking at new innovations that can help engage audiences. And if that brings us revenue too that's wonderful.\" All national galleries charge for admission to special exhibitions, she added. The gallery has forecast an operating deficit for the latest financial year. The use of the striking paintings and photos with animated graphics, music and narration was a \"powerful combination\", Siddall said. The exhibition is being held in a pop-up venue at MediaCity in Salford until August and will then tour to five more locations, but they have not been announced. The venue's walls are filled with about 40 giant picture frame-style boxes, which the portraits and animations are projected onto. Some of the chosen personalities, such as Malala Yousafzai, Churchill and Audrey Hepburn, tell their stories in their own words; while actors narrate the sections about others, including William Shakespeare and Emmeline Pankhurst. It's a whistlestop guide to selected slices of history, with each person's story told in two or three minutes, and the entire show taking about 45 minutes. It ends with Queen Elizabeth II. Standard adult tickets cost between £22 and £30, with an extra £5 for a flexible ticket, and some \"affordable\" £10 tickets available on Mondays. Joy Coker, editor of arts outlet Alt A Review, said she thought it was worth it, but that the price could exclude some people. \"Right now with the cost of living it might not be something everybody can afford,\" she said. \"It's thought-provoking and it actually makes you think about each individual subject again, and takes you back to those moments in time, which you're not necessarily going to get from a looking at a portrait on its own.\" In recent years, artists from Vincent van Gogh to David Hockney have successfully been given the immersive treatment. This weekend, LS Lowry will also be added to the list when a new, free immersive experience brings his trademark matchstick men to life at Salford's Lowry arts centre. The walls, floor and ceiling of one gallery become the canvas for projections of the artist's 1953 painting Going To The Match. The crowds flocking to watch Bolton Wanderers FC are animated, zooming in on sections of the artwork. The six-minute experience is narrated by Bolton comedian and actress Sophie Willan, and visitors can then see the real painting in the next gallery. \"People are going and standing in front of the painting and then looking for elements that have come to life, and that is a different way for them to be able to engage with the real artwork,” The Lowry chief executive Julia Fawcett explained. The venue bought the painting for almost £8m in 2022 and has spent two years working on the immersive version. Fawcett said she did not consider charging for entry. \"Our galleries are free and this is part of our gallery offer,\" she said. \"For us, it was about making sure we reached the widest possible audience. \"We know immersive [art] is popular but we know also that price can be a barrier, and it would be counter-intuitive, when you have a project that is about reaching more audiences and deepening people's love and appreciation of the artist, to put a barrier in place.\" An exploratory drilling site in Salford where police and protesters clashed in 2014 is to fully close. The lion at the gates to Weelsby Wood in Grimsby has had its face changed to match its partner. John Rudd came up with the idea to help his son who was diagnosed with autism when he was nine.

    "title": "Are we set for Man Utd v Tottenham final in Europa League?",
    "article_text": "Manchester United and Tottenham both celebrated Europa League semi-final first-leg wins Manchester United and Tottenham both took huge strides towards reaching the Europa League final with semi-final first-leg wins on Thursday. United won 3-0 at Athletic Bilbao,who incidentally host the final on 21 May, whileTottenham saw off Bodo/Glimt 3-1in London. Statisticians Opta give United a 97% chance of reaching the final - with 91% for Spurs - meaning an 88% likelihood of both being there. That would create just a sixth all-English final in any major European competition - with half of them involving Spurs. It would also mean six English teams in next season's Champions League. Opta's data gives only a 12% chance of it not being an all-English final. United's 3-0 win over Athletic, who sit fourth in La Liga, was hugely impressive - and they will hope home advantage next week means they will get over the line. Spurs may feel like the job is not quite as done. Norwegian Arctic side Glimt's win rate at home in the Europa League since 2022-23 is 70%, compared to 9% on the road. Neither Manchester United nor Tottenham have any hope of finishing anywhere near the domestic European places The winners of the Europa League go into the following season's Champions League, regardless of where they finish domestically. So a United v Spurs final would guarantee them a return to the mega-riches of European football's top table. That rule is handy for United - who sit 14th - and Spurs - who are 16th - both more than 20 points behind fifth place. Without winning the Europa League, neither of them will be in any European competition next season. It would not have any knock-on effect on any other English teams - with the top five guaranteed a Champions League spot through the league. That fifth spot came as a result of English clubs' performances in Europe this season. No country's teams have ever won the Champions League, Europa League and Conference League in the same season (albeit the latter is only in its fourth year). But it could yet happen for England this term - with teams in all the semis. The smallest chance (12.1% say Opta) is for Arsenal, who lost 1-0 at home to Paris St-Germain in the Champions League first leg on Tuesday. In the Conference League, Chelsea have looked like likely winners all season. They won4-1 at Djurgardenin their semi-final first leg. Tottenham have won the 1972 Uefa Cup and lost the 2019 Champions League final against English teams The first ever Uefa Cup, in 1971-72, sawTottenhamandWolvesmeet in the two-legged final. Spurs won the first leg 2-1 at Molineux, with Martin Chivers scoring twice, and drew 1-1 at White Hart Lane two weeks later. It would take 36 years for the next English final, which came in the 2007-08 Champions League asManchester UnitedbeatChelseaon penalties in Moscow. Cristiano Ronaldo and Frank Lampard traded goals before a shootout best remembered for John Terry's miss after slipping. There were two all-English finals in 2018-19. LiverpoolbeatTottenham2-0 in the Champions League in Madrid, with goals from Mohamed Salah and Divock Origi.

    "title": "Two Gazan girls first to arrive in UK for medical treatment",
    "article_text": "Two Palestinian girls with serious health conditions have been brought to the UK for private medical treatment. The Gazan children are the first to be granted temporary UK visas since the war between Hamas and Israel broke out in October 2023. Ghena, five, and Rama, 12 arrived in the UK from Egypt on Saturday to be treated for conditions which cannot be dealt with in war torn Gaza, Project Pure Hope (PPH) said. Ghena's mother said she hoped other children \"would get the chance\" to benefit from the chance to receive medical care overseas. Both suffer from pre-existing conditions which require specialist treatment not available in Gaza, where the healthcare system has come under huge pressure during the war between Hamas and Israel. Rama - who has a lifelong bowel condition - described her life in Khan Younis, where her family home was destroyed, and spoke about her hopes for the future. She told BBC News: \"We were so scared. We were living in tents and shrapnel from airstrikes used to fall on us. \"Mum used to suffer so much going to hospitals while bombs were falling and would stand in long queues just to get me a strip of pills. \"Here I'll get treatment and get better and be just like any other girl.\" Her mother Rana said: \"I'm very happy for Rama because she'll get treatment here. \"As a mother, I felt so sorry in Gaza because I couldn't do anything to help her. \"To see your daughter dying in front of your eyes, day by day, watching her weaken and get sicker – it pained me.\" Ghena has fluid pressing against her optic nerve, which could lead to her losing the sight in her left eye if she does not have an operation. Her mother Haneen told the BBC: \"Before the war, Ghena was having medical treatment in Gaza, in a specialised hospital. \"She was getting tests done every six months there and treatment was available.\" But the hospital was destroyed a week after the war began, she said, and Ghena was no longer able to get the care she needed. \"She began complaining about the pain,\" Haneen continued. \"She would wake up screaming in pain at night.\" \"I hope she gets better here,\" Haneen added. \"In Gaza there are thousands of injured and sick children who need medical treatment. I hope they get a chance like Ghena.\" PHP and PCRF worked with the World Health Organization (WHO) to secure their temporary stay in the UK and private funding for their healthcare. PCRF chairwoman Vivian Khalaf told the BBC: \"We came across these cases through an ongoing list that is getting longer and longer of children who need urgent medical treatment outside of Gaza. \"The current physicians and hospitals that continue to be operating to whatever extent have determined that the treatment isn't available within Gaza.\" Khalaf said 200 children had been relocated for medical treatment via the initiative, including to the US, Jordan and Qatar, as well as several European countries. She was unable to say how many children in total had been identified as needing to be moved to the care of international health services in the future. The World Health Organization (WHO) said earlier this month that conditions at Gaza's hospitals - several of which have been damaged during the fighting - are \"beyond description\". The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 50,980 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Campaigners say the move will  “rip the heart out of any moves to improve maternity safety”. They are calling on the government to take immediate action to protect babies and children from sugar-laden food. University Hospital Southampton NHS Trust say the cuts will \"protect frontline services\". Linzagolix will only be available for patients whose previous medical or surgical treatments have been unsuccessful.

    "article_text": "A woman from the UK has become the oldest person in the world, at the age of 115 and 252 days. Ethel Caterham, who lives at a care home in Lightwater, Surrey, reached the milestone following thedeath of Brazilian nun Sister Inah Canabarro Lucas, aged 116 on Wednesday. Ms Caterham was born on 21 August 1909 and is the last surviving subject of Edward VII. Celebrating her 115th birthday in August 2024, she said she \"didn't know why there was all the fuss\". She said the secret to her longevity was \"never arguing with anyone, I listen and I do what I like\". The new record has been confirmed by Guinness World Records and LongeviQuest, a database of the world's oldest people. On her 115th birthday, Ms Caterham received a letter from the King congratulating her on a \"truly remarkable milestone\". The King conveyed his \"warmest good wishes\" and \"hoped that Ethel enjoys her incredibly special day\". The letter stated that His Majesty was \"heartened to learn about Ethel's fascinating personal history\". Ms Caterham was born in Shipton Bellinger, in Hampshire, and was raised in nearby Tidworth in Wiltshire. She was the second youngest of eight children. At the age of 18, she was employed as an au pair to a military family in India. She returned to the UK in 1931 and met her future husband, Norman Caterham. They married at Salisbury Cathedral in 1933. Mr Caterham became a lieutenant colonel in the army, and the couple were stationed in Hong Kong and Gibraltar. In Hong Kong, Ms Caterham set up a nursery. She has lived through the sinking of the Titanic, World War One, the Russian Revolution, the Great Depression and World War Two. She has spent the last 50 years living in Surrey and continued driving until she was 97. One of her sisters, Gladys, lived to be 104. She has three granddaughters and five great grandchildren. A spokesperson for Hallmark Lakeview Luxury Care Home, where Ms Caterham is a resident, said: \"What an incredible milestone and a true testament to a life well-lived. \"Your strength, spirit and wisdom are an inspiration to us all. Here's to celebrating your remarkable journey.\" Ms Caterham is also one of the oldest people to survive Covid-19, after contracting it in 2020 at the age of 110, according to Guinness World Records. Mark McKinley, director of records at Guinness World Records,told the BBC:  \"Ethel never set out to be a record breaker. \"But we're hoping to meet her some time soon and present her with her certificate.\" Follow BBC Surrey onFacebook, onX.

    "title": "Hottest ever start to May in UK as temperatures hit 29C",
    "article_text": "A new record was set for the hottest start to any May on record on Thursday, with temperatures reaching 29.3C (84.7F) in London. That high, which was recorded at Kew Gardens, beat the previous record of 27.4C (81.3F), which was set in Lossiemouth, Scotland, in 1990, the Met Office said. Much of the UK basked in heat well above the average for the time of year, though conditions were cooler in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The spell of hot weather was triggered by an area of high pressure which had become blocked over the UK, leading to a sustained south-easterly air flow bringing warm conditions. Thursday was also the hottest day of the year so far, beating the previous high of 26.7C recorded in Wisley, Surrey earlier this week. Temperatures in London soared above several European cities, including Athens and Rome. The capital was also hotter than Cairo (27C), Marrakesh (27C) and Los Angeles (21C). While not expected to hit the same sort of peaks as Thursday, temperatures are on course to remain high for many on Friday. However, conditions are forecast to return to closer to seasonal averages across the Bank Holiday weekend. Temperatures are expected to reach the low twenties in the south of England, with highs only reaching the mid-teens further north and in Scotland. When we see heat records challenged in the UK, there is often an influence of air coming from Iberia or north Africa involved. This is not the case this week - instead, we have seen a large area of high pressure sitting across the UK. High pressure is essentially a huge zone in the atmosphere where air is actually descending towards the ground and warming as it travels towards us, which has been happening cumulatively over a number of days. There are a number of other factors at play which have contributed to this record-setting day. The area of high pressure has also come with clear and sunny skies, which helps to warm the ground. A lack of rain has left the ground very dry, meaning it can warm more quickly. To break that cycle of warming, the UK will need either strong winds, a change in wind direction or the arrival of cloud and rain. While it looks set to remain dry for the vast majority of the UK across the Bank Holiday weekend, we are expecting to see those wind conditions change, which will push temperatures down.",

    "title": "Vets may face caps on cremations and other charges",
    "article_text": "British vets could face price caps on medicines, prescriptions and other services like cremations, the regulator has indicated, as it outlined changes it is considering to the way the UK's £2bn veterinary sector operates. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has been investigating the sector, looking at whether a lack of competition in the sector has contributed to soaring prices. Prices for treatments grew by 60% between 2015 and 2023, compared with inflation of 35% for other general services, according to CMA research. The regulator is also pushing for more transparency as part of the overhaul due to be finalised in the coming months. In addition to the price caps, the CMA is looking into a ban on bonuses linked to offering specific treatments. It said on Thursday that it would look into a ban on any policies that would curtail vets' \"clinical freedom\". The watchdog also found there was a lack of transparency around the cost of treatments and what choices were available. It found that businesses were marking up medicineprices, sometimes by as much as four times the purchase cost. In a list of potential remedies, the CMA said vets could be forced to create a clear online display of prices for medicines, surgeries, treatments and out-of-hours help. The working paper also suggested that the mark-up charged on pet cremations, sold to customers at a \"vulnerable moment\", might be capped. The watchdog has also suggested a comparison website making it compulsory for clinics to inform owners if cheaper options are available. Last month,a BBC investigation found that some vets felt they were under pressure to \"generate income\". The BBC spoke to vets working for IVC, which owns more than 900 surgeries, who all say they are monitored and set targets by the company. IVC said the interests of the pets was always the first priority. The CMA expects to release a provisional report on what measures it will take in the summer months, with a final decision by November. The CMA said basic local vet services are worth £2bn-£2.5bn a year, but when other aspects such as cremation, specialist treatments and medicines are taken into account, the overall value of the industry is estimated at £5.7bn a year. The competition body highlighted how the sector was increasingly being dominated by larger firms and how this might be reducing consumer choice. There are about 5,000 vet practices in the UK, it said, but since 2013, approximately 1,500 of these have been acquired by six large corporate groups. They are CVS, Independent Vetcare Ltd, Linnaeus, Medivet, Pets at Home and VetPartners. Four of these six tend to retain the name and branding of an independently-owned practice when they buy it, which the CMA said may create an \"illusion of competition\" for consumers if they are trying to shop around to find alternative practices. The firm told the BBC it had restricted internet access in its stores following an attempted cyber attack. Experts say the instruction suggests the company fears hackers could be lurking on calls. Online orders paused, food items missing from shelves - here's what we know about the chaos at M&S. The retailer says it's disabled parts of its IT systems in response to the incident. There is no data on how widely cash is accepted which puts the UK at risk of becoming cashless, a report warns.",

    "title": "'Nobody expected this' - was win in Bilbao best of Amorim's Man Utd reign?",
    "article_text": "Ruben Amorim has overseen just six wins in 23 Premier League games but has guided Manchester United to the cusp of the Europa League final Was this the night it all came together for Ruben Amorim at Manchester United? The former Sporting boss has endured an uneasy start to life at Old Trafford since his appointment, particularly domestically where he has overseen just six wins in 23 Premier League games. But European football is looking like being his and United's salvation this season andThursday's 3-0 win at Athletic Bilbaoin their Europa League semi-final first leg ensures they have one foot firmly planted in the final. Granted, the Spanish hosts played much of the game with 10 men but this was nevertheless an impressive display against a side that boasts the best defensive record in La Liga. \"That was the best that I have seen Manchester United play under Ruben Amorim,\" former Leeds, Tottenham and Blackburn goalkeeper Paul Robinson said on BBC Radio 5 live. \"They were excellent - granted they were playing against 10 men, but they still had to do a job.\" Former Manchester United midfielder Robbie Savage said on TNT Sports: \"People will look at the result and say Athletic Bilbao were down to 10 men but this has been a magnificent performance. \"They concede hardly any goals, one of the best [defences] in Europe but to come here and score three goals, magnificent Manchester United performance.\" There have been plenty of poor performances and disappointing losses for United under Amorim but there has also been the odd eye-catching result. They won 2-1 at rivals Manchester City in December, drew 2-2 with Liverpool and knocked Arsenal out of the FA Cup in January and thrashed Real Sociedad 4-1 in Europe. But for Amorim this was the most impressive of the lot, saying: \"I think best result because nobody expected this.\" Are we set for Man Utd v Tottenham final in Europa League? Defender, striker... winger? How 'Harrydinho' inspired Man Utd Harry Maguire, centre, followed up his late winner against Lyon with the cross for Manchester United's first at Athletic Bilbao Few would have predicted such a win for United at San Mames Stadium - which will host the Europa League final on 21 May. Indeed, initially it did not look likely with some of the visiting players appearing nervous. Manuel Ugarte was often caught in possession in the opening 15 minutes, while a static defence was almost embarrassed when Inaki Williams rose highest to glance a header over. Patrick Dorgu was caught way up the pitch to allow Inaki Williams space to attack and deliver a cross for Alex Berenguer, whose shot was blocked on the line by Victor Lindelof. The loud atmosphere created by the home fans undoubtedly contributed to those nervous displays from United's younger players but their senior players stepped up to ultimately settle them. Brazil midfielder Casemiro rolled back the years with a display reminiscent of his Real Madrid days, sitting deep to break up attacks, offering composure and creativity on the ball while also providing an aerial threat. Harry Maguire, criticised previously for being past his best, scored the late winner against Lyon in the quarter-finals, and popped up on the right wing this time to deliver the cross that led to Casemiro's the opener. Then there was captain Bruno Fernandes, who was coolness personified to shut out the noise of the stadium and convert the penalty that put United in control, before dinking home a second when played through on goal. Amorim was full of praise for his senior players for providing the calming influence. He told TNT Sports: \"You can feel especially in the beginning player like Ugarte with a lot of experience was a bit nervous, also Patrick Dorgu. \"These kind of players like Casemiro, Harry Maguire and Bruno Fernandes help a lot.\" Comfortable first-half displays in Europe for Manchester United don't come around often. This was the first time they have scored three first-half goals in a major European game since November 2020 against Istanbul Basaksehir, and also the first time away from home since September 2017 against CSKA Moscow. Both of those were in the Champions League. For Bilbao to go to Old Trafford next week and score at least four goals seems a tall task and instead an all-English Europa League final between United and Tottenham is looking very like, after Spurs beat Bodo/Glimt 3-1 in their semi-final first leg. Another performance like this in the second leg and that will surely be enough to secure United's return to the San Mames in three weeks. \"We want our fans to travel twice to Bilbao,\" Fernandes told TNT Sports. \"The result for us was unbelievable. We should push a bit more in that second half, but we controlled the game and that is good.\" Amorim, however, is looking no further than the next game. \"Of course we are have an advantage,\" he said. \"We have our fans, but again this could change. \"Anything can happen in one game.\" Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "Littler wins record fifth Premier League night",
    "article_text": "Luke Littler is the reigning Premier League champion after winning the tournament in his debut year in 2024 Teenager Luke Littler created more history by becoming the first player to win five nights in a Premier League season with a 6-4 victory over Michael van Gerwen in Birmingham. The 18-year-old, who is the youngest world darts champion after his success in January, has also secured his place in the season-ending play-offs at O2 Arena on 29 May. He won four nights in the opening eight weeks but had failed to reach the final in the past four weeks. No player has won more than four nights since the 16-week league phase was introduced in 2022 with Jonny Clayton (2022), Gerwyn Price and Michael Smith (2023) and Littler, Luke Humphries and Van Gerwen (2024) all achieving that mark. Littler spoke at the start of the evening about wanting to finish top of the league in order to secure the first semi-final at the play-offs, so that he would have a break before the final, and is now on track to achieve that. He needed last-leg shootout wins over Stephen Bunting and Nathan Aspinall to reach the final but improved as the evening went on. The world number two missed two darts at tops in the opening leg and that allowed seven-time Premier League Van Gerwen to break, before he missed double 16 in leg two after two stunning darts at bullseye. Littler kept pace with Van Gerwen, who was in his second final of the year, though and recovered the break in leg six, before breaking again in leg 10 to secure the win and avoid a final-leg decider. He averaged 102.5 to Van Gerwen's 94.31 and was six from 13 on the checkouts. \"I'm very happy. The fifth nightly win was going to come at some point but it's been a few weeks since I actually won on a Thursday,\" Littler told Sky Sports. \"I'm nine points clear, so I'm very happy and very confident I'll stay at number one.\" On the importance of topping the league phase, Littler added: \"It's something I've always thought in my head, playing the first semi-final is so crucial because there is not that big of a turnaround.\" Relive all the action from night 13 in Birmingham Premier League Darts schedule, results, prize money Jenkins given 11-year ban for darts match-fixing Luke Humphries lost to Luke Littler in the 2024 Premier League Darts final World number one Humphries won two of the opening four weeks but has failed to win a night since. He has lost in the final on four occasions since but he has also suffered five quarter-final exits and a 6-5 defeat against Gerwyn Price was the latest. It was a scrappy affair at times, but 2024 world champion and Premier League runner-up Humphries still averaged 107.46 and had darts to win the first nine legs. However, he struggled on the checkouts, taking out just five of 15 attempts, and that proved to be the difference as Humphries lost to Price again, havingsuccumbed to the Welshman in the Liverpool finallast week. Bunting is still rooted to the bottom of the table after losing 6-5 to Littler in the quarter-finals. The Liverpudlian led 4-2 with Littler averaging in the mid-80s as he used some new equipment. However the teenager improved as the match went on and broke back in leg eight before seeing out the game with a last-leg shootout win. Chris Dobey and Rob Cross' chances of reaching the play-offs were also dented with the pair losing 6-3 and 6-4 to Aspinall and Van Gerwen respectively. Final Luke Littler 6-4 Michael van Gerwen Semi-finals Luke Littler 6-5 Nathan Aspinall Gerwyn Price 3-6 Michael van Gerwen Quarter-finals Luke Littler 6-5 Stephen Bunting Nathan Aspinall 6-3 Chris Dobey Luke Humphries 5-6 Gerwyn Price Rob Cross 4-6 Michael van Gerwen Premier League Darts is played across 16 initial weeks in the league stage with quarter-finals, semi-finals and a final each night. Each of the eight players is guaranteed to face the other seven in the quarter-finals in weeks one to seven and 9-15, with week eight and week 16 fixtures done off the table. It means we will get fourth v fifth in Sheffield on the final league-stage night, with the play-off spots potentially on the line. Players earn two points per quarter-final win, an additional point if they win their semi-final and five for winning the night. The top four players after the group stage progress to the play-off night at London's O2 Arena on 23 May, with first facing fourth and second against third in a best-of-19-leg match. The final, which is the best of 21 legs, follows. If players are level on points after the 16 weeks then places are decided by nights won and then matches won.

    "article_text": "This video can not be played 'Balls all over the Crucible floor' as pocket breaks during semi-final Seven-time champion Ronnie O'Sullivan is level at 4-4 with Zhao Xintong after an entertaining opening session to their World Championship semi-final. China's Zhao, 28, a former UK champion who is competing as an amateur, showed few signs of nerves having reached the single table set-up for the first time, racing into a 2-0 lead with breaks of 60 and 62. However, O'Sullivan, 49, appearing at this stage for the 14th time, clicked into gear and responded with three consecutive half centuries of his own as he took the next three frames to lead 3-2. The players then traded frames, with Zhao breaking the right corner pocket potting the black while crafting an 86 to draw level at 4-4. On Thursday evening, world number one Judd Trump opened up a 5-3 advantage over three-time winner Mark Williams in their first meeting at the Crucible since their thrilling semi-final in 2022. The 50-year-old Welshman, who is the oldest player to reach the last four since his compatriot Ray Reardon featured as a 52-year-old in 1985, compiled breaks of 73 and 116 as he shared the opening four frames with 2019 champion Trump. Trump, who has won three tournaments this season including the Saudi Arabia Masters, where he pipped Williams in a decider, took the first frame following the mid-session interval after making 52. And while his opponent again responded, the 35-year-old Englishman won an edgy seventh frame and punished Williams for missing a black off its spot to claim a two-frame cushion overnight by knocking in his 105th century of the season. O'Sullivan and Zhao resume their best-of-33 frame match, due to be played over four sessions, on Friday at 10:00 BST, with Trump and Williams scheduled to get back under way at 14:30. Ronnie O'Sullivan is playing in a 14th semi-final at the Crucible Both O'Sullivan and Zhao received a standing ovation as they left the auditorium after a hugely promising opening to a contest between opponents with a shared mutual respect, who are both seeking some sort of restoration. Widely regarded as the greatest player of all-time, O'Sullivan is bidding for a record eighth Crucible crown in the modern era. However, it comes against a backdrop of arriving in Sheffield without any competitive action since breaking his cue in frustration at the Championship League in January. After Wednesday's quarter-final 13-9 win over Si Jiahui there was also an open admission that he has only reached the last four due to the shortcomings of his opponents so far. Zhao, who he has mentored at times, is only the third player from mainland China to reach a world semi-final and is on a run of 45 wins from 47 matches since returning from a 20-month ban. He was one10 players from China sanctioned in a match-fixing scandaland while he did not directly throw a match, he accepted charges of being a party to another player fixing two matches and betting on matches himself.

    "title": "Ugandan opposition accuses president of using military courts to quash dissent",
    "article_text": "Ugandan opposition politicians have accused the president,Yoweri Museveni, of attempting to quash dissent by prosecuting opponents on politically motivated charges in military courts in the run-up to presidential and legislative elections next year. The government is pushing to introduce a law to allow military tribunals to try civilians despite a supreme court ban on the practice. In November, the opposition politician Kizza Besigye wasdetained in Nairobi, Kenya, alongside his aide Obeid Lutale and taken to Kampala where they were charged before a military tribunal with offences including illegal possession of firearms, threatening national security, and later treachery, which carries the death penalty. His lawyers say the charges are politically motivated. Besigye, a four-time presidential candidate and longtime opponent of Museveni, is one of more than 1,000 civilians, including activists and other politicians, who have been charged in military courtssince 2002. In January, Uganda’s supreme court ruled that trying civilians in military courts was unconstitutional and ordered the transfer of trials involving civilians to ordinary courts. Museveni rejected the ruling as the“wrong decision”and vowed to continue using military courts. After a 10-day hunger strike by Besigye in February, authorities moved his trial to a civilian court. But theUgandaLaw Society says the government has not transferred other people’s cases. In the latest twist, the government is planning to introduce a law to allow military tribunals to try civilians for some offences. Norbert Mao, the minister for justice and constitutional affairs, told parliament on 17 April that the draft legislation was awaiting cabinet approval before introduction in parliament. Paul Mwiru, a politician with Bobi Wine’s National Unity Platform party, said Museveni’s administration was using state institutions to instil fear and had “made the judicial system to be inclined” in its favour. Mwiru, a former MP, was charged in a civilian court with treason in 2018 alongside Wine and 31 other people for allegedly throwing stones at Museveni’s motorcade during chaos at a byelection campaign. Mwiru said people who went through botched court processes “come back weakened”. Their case was adjourned indefinitely after about two years. He said amending the law to allow military prosecution of civilians would allow the government “to charge you and arraign you in the court if they have a disagreement with you”. Uganda will go to the polls in January 2026 in what will be a seventh election featuring Museveni. The events of the past few months have turned the spotlight on what critics deem intolerance and authoritarianism by Museveni’s administration and ignited fears of an election that may not be free and fair. “Sooner rather than later, they’ll be able to arrest any of us. If they want to deny you the opportunity to participate in the electoral process, they can do that,” said Mwiru, who plans to contest for a parliamentary seat again next year. November was not the first time Besigye, a former army colonel, had been tried in a military court. In 2005, four years after retiring from the military and running for the first time as a presidential candidate, he was charged with terrorism and possession of firearms. Other civilians who have been prosecuted in military courts include Wine, themusician-turned-politicianwho has said he will stand again next year, former opposition MP Michael Kabaziguruka and Besigye’s lawyer Eron Kiiza. The list also includes opposition supporters, as well as other political opponents and government critics. Critics say repression extends to civilian courts too, with dissidents and government critics charged there being subjected to lengthy trials, denial of bail and detentions without trial. Besigye and Lutale were this month denied bail for their case. They remain in custody. Government and military spokespeople have been approached for comment. Museveni has repeatedly defended using military courts for civilians, saying it was necessary for the east African country’s peace and stability. He claims civilian courts were failing to convict those accused of violent crimes. Sign up toThe Long Wave Nesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the world after newsletter promotion Trials of civilians in military court go back to 2002 when Museveni created an autonomous, ad-hoc law enforcement unit to combat armed crime in reaction to the alleged failure of the civilian judicial system to prosecute and punish crimes. Later, in 2005, the state amended legislation regulating the military to create a legal framework to allow the military to court martial civilians. Human rights activistssay the practice isunjust and unlawfuland frequently violates the right of accused people to a fair trial. In many instances over the years, Ugandan courts have ruled against the practice, but the process has continued. The latest ruling by the supreme court, arising from Kabaziguruka’s challenge of his trial in military court in 2016, is a litmus test. The government is fighting back with the planned introduction of the draft law that Mao, the justice minister, told lawmakers would define “exceptional circumstances under which a civilian may be subject to military law”. Museveni became president in 1986 after leading rebels in a six-year guerilla war to removePresident Milton Obote. He led the country to economic growth and democratic change after years of political decay. But critics say judicial independence has eroded in the country over the years. They have also condemned his long stay in office using what they say are strongman tactics to extend it indefinitely, including by amending the constitution twice to remain in power. The Museveni administration’s military roots influence the government’s operations, said Gerald Walulya, a senior lecturer at Makerere University in Kampala and a political analyst. “Because of their background as a government that came to power through a military kind of route, they tend to approach every aspect in a military manner,” he said. Mwambutsya Ndebesa, a historian, said Uganda was experiencing“the curse of liberation”, which he said made leaders feel entitled to power. “Those who have liberated people from repressive regimes in Africa have taken it upon themselves that they are entitled to rule,” he said. Ndebesa said the administration was “weaponising the justice system for political ends” to suppress political dissent, and that suppression had a “chilling effect” of creating fear in the political space. “The purpose is not only to suppress that very individual, but also to send a message to the political sphere.” he added.",

    "title": "Trump officials ask supreme court to help strip legal status from Venezuelans",
    "article_text": "TheTrump administrationasked theUS supreme courton Thursday to intervene and assist in its attempt to strip temporary protected status (TPS) from more than 300,000Venezuelanmigrants in the US, a move that would clear the way for their deportation. The justice department asked the supreme court justices to put on hold a federal judge’s order from March that halted the decision of the homeland security secretary,Kristi Noem, to terminate the temporary legal status that previously was granted to some Venezuelans. “So long as the order is in effect, [Noem] must permit hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan nationals to remain in the country, notwithstanding her reasoned determination that doing so is ‘contrary to the national interest’,” justice department lawyers wrote in court papers. A federal appeals court had on 18 April declined the administration’s request to pause the judge’s order. According to theorder, which US district court judge Ed Chen issued in March,he said: “[T]he secretary’s action threatens to: inflict irreparable harm on hundreds of thousands of persons whose lives, families, and livelihoods will be severely disrupted, cost the United States billions in economic activity, and injure public health and safety in communities throughout the United States. “At the same time, the government has failed to identify any real countervailing harm in continuing TPS for Venezuelan beneficiaries,” Chen added. Chen also wrote that the plaintiffs “will likely succeed in demonstrating that the actions taken by the secretary are unauthorized by law, arbitrary and capricious, and motivated by unconstitutional animus”. During his presidency, Joe Bidenextendedtemporary protected status to Venezuelans due to the ongoing political and economic crisis in Venezuela. The country’s president,Nicolás Maduro, has widely and violentlypersecutedmembers of civil society, including lawyers and journalists, and life varies from precarious to dangerous for many ordinary citizens, millions of whom have fled elsewhere in South America and to Central America, Mexico and the US. Yet sinceDonald Trumptook office for the second time in January, his administration has carried out sweeping crackdowns on legal and illegal immigration. Over the last few months, many Venezuelans have been unlawfully arrested and illegally detained by federal immigration authorities,according totheir lawyers. The pre-emptive arrests of many still under the shelter of TPS have been carried out despite the lawsayingthat such people “shall not be detained” based on their immigration status. Speaking tothe Guardian last month, Sirine Shebaya, the executive director of the National Immigration Project, said: “I’ve seen a lot of terrible policies, and a lot of mistreatment, and government abuses and misconduct and, you know, even wrongful deportations.” Shebaya added: “But this level of impunity and lack of even a pretense of following legal standards or thinking about the facts of someone’s situation before targeting them is something that I truly have never seen before.” Reuters contributed reporting",

    "article_text": "Police in the Japanese city of Osaka have arrested a man on suspicion of attempted murder after he drove his car into seven schoolchildren, according to local media. The children were walking home from school when the suspect appeared to deliberately drive the car at them on a quiet residential street at about 1.30pm local time, the public broadcaster NHK reported. A seven-year-old girl suffered a broken jaw and the other children – boys and girls aged seven and eight – are reported to have relatively light injuries. All appeared to be conscious as they were taken to hospital. Police arrested Yuki Yazawa, 28, an unemployed man from Higashimurayama city in Tokyo, at the scene. It is not clear why he was in Osaka. “I was just sick of everything so I decided to drive my car into the elementary school students to kill them,” Yazawa told police, according to NHK. Teachers from the primary school are reported to have pulled the suspect out of the car, where he had remained after driving into the children. A mother in her 20s who had come to pick up her son, and who saw the attack, told NHK: “The car was being driven erratically, and it seems that it continued to move forward even after it had hit the children. “My son was very shocked and has been crying the whole time. He only just started elementary school last month, and then something like this happened. It’s scary. I saw the man who had been driving the car. He was very quiet and appeared to be in a daze.” Another witness told NHK that the car reversed back into the children after crashing into them. An elementary school pupil told another news outlet, MBS News, that the man in the car had been “driving unsteadily”. “I was walking along the side of the road and the car and suddenly it almost drove into us.

    "title": "Snake on a train line: Japan’s busiest bullet train route brought to a halt",
    "article_text": "Japan’s busiest bullet train line was brought to a halt on Wednesday after a metre-long snake wrapped itself around a power line, shorting the electricity supply and stranding hundreds of passengers. Shinkansen trains running between Tokyo and Osaka were brought to a standstill by the snake, with news reports showing footage of people inside trains waiting for services to resume. Power did not appear to have been cut inside trains, with lights and air conditioning still functioning, according to passengers. The outage happened at 5.25pm between Maibara and Gifu-Hashima stations, after the snake appeared to have climbed an electricity pole, meeting its demise as it attempted to slither along the overhead line. Power was not restored until after 7pm. The Golden Week series of national holidays began on Wednesday, with millions on the move acrossJapan, returning to home towns and taking family vacations. In addition, the Osaka Expo 2025, which opened mid-April and runs until October, is attracting even more people than usual to the city. “I use the shinkansen several times a month, but this is the first time I have experienced suspensions due to a power outage,” Satoshi Tagawa, 46, who was returning to Tokyo, told Kyodo News. The line connects Tokyo, Nagoya and Osaka with more than 370 trains daily carrying an average of 430,000 passengers. Reaching speeds of up 285km per hour, it takes less than two and a half hours to Osaka from the Japanese capital. More than 7 billion passengers have ridden the tokaidoshinkansensince it opened as Japan’s first high-speed rail line just before the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. It has an exemplary safety record, with not a single injury or accident recorded, and trains running to within an average of 1.6 minutes of their scheduled times, according to operator Central Japan Railway Co. (JR Tokai). However, it is not the first time reptiles have delayed shinkansen. A 40cm snake inside a carriage on a Nagoya to Tokyo service in April last year caused consternation among passengers. Staff were unable to find the creature, and the carriage was replaced, resulting in a 17-minute delay. In 2009, an electricity outage was also caused by a snake climbing on to power lines, stopping trains between Tokyo and Fukushima.",

    "title": "Soviet-era spacecraft expected to plunge uncontrolled to Earth next week",
    "article_text": "A Soviet-era spacecraft meant to land on Venus in the 1970s is expected to soon plunge uncontrolled back to Earth. It’s too early to know where the half-ton mass of metal might come down or how much of it will survive re-entry, according to space debris-tracking experts. Dutch scientist Marco Langbroek predicts the failed spacecraft will re-enter about 10 May. He estimates it will come crashing in at 150mph (242km/h), if it remains intact. “While not without risk, we should not be too worried,” Langbroek said in an email. The object is relatively small and, even if it doesn’t break apart, “the risk is similar to that of a random meteorite fall, several of which happen each year. You run a bigger risk of getting hit by lightning in your lifetime,” he said. The chance of the spacecraft actually hitting someone or something is small, he added. “But it cannot be completely excluded.” The Soviet Union launched the spacecraft known as Kosmos 482 in 1972, one of a series of Venus missions. But it never made it out of Earth orbit because of a rocket malfunction. Most of it came tumbling down within a decade. But Langbroek and others believe the landing capsule itself — a spherical object about 3ft (1 metre) in diameter — has been circling the world in a highly elliptical orbit for the past 53 years, gradually dropping in altitude. It’s quite possible that the 1,000lb-plus (nearly 500kg) spacecraft will survive re-entry. It was built to withstand a descent through the carbon dioxide-thick atmosphere of Venus, said Langbroek of Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. Experts doubt the parachute system would work after so many years. The heat shield may also be compromised after so long in orbit. It would be better if the heat shield fails, which would cause the spacecraft to burn up during its dive through the atmosphere, Jonathan McDowell at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics said in an email. But if the heat shield holds, “it’ll re-enter intact and you have a half-ton metal object falling from the sky”. The spacecraft could re-enter anywhere between 51.7 degrees north and south latitude, or as far north as London and Edmonton in Alberta, Canada, almost all the way down to South America’s Cape Horn. But since most of the planet is water, “chances are good it will indeed end up in some ocean”, Langbroek said. In 2022, a Chinese booster rocket made an uncontrolled return to Earth and in 2018 the Tiangong-1 space station re-entered the Earth’s atmosphere over the south Pacific after anuncontrolled re-entry.",

    "title": "Trump administration readies first sale of military equipment to Ukraine",
    "article_text": "The Trump administration will approve its first sale of military equipment to Ukraine since Donald Trump took office, in an indication that theminerals deal signed by the two countries this weekmay open a path to renewed weapons shipments. The state department has certified a proposed licence to export “$50m or more” (£37.6m) of defence hardware and services toUkraine, according to a communication sent to the US committee on foreign relations. It would mark the first permission of its kind since Trump paused all Ukraine-related military aid shortly after taking office. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said on Thursday evening that the signing of the long-discussed minerals deal – on much better terms for Ukraine than had previously been expected – was a result of the meeting he held with Trumpon the sidelines of the pope’s funeralon Saturday. “Now we have the first result of the Vatican meeting, which makes it really historic. We are waiting for other results of the meeting,” he said, in his nightly video address. Zelenskyy hailed the deal as “truly equal”, saying it created “an opportunity for quite significant investment in Ukraine”. A senior aide saidKyivhoped that weapons deliveries would resume swiftly. “There is no direct link where it’s written that ‘you will receive these particular weapons’, but it opens the possibility for parallel talks on the purchase of weapons,” said Mykhailo Podolyak, an aide to Zelenskyy, during an interview in Kyiv. “The American side is now open to these discussions,” he added. Ukraine’s first deputy prime minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, signed the agreement in Washington on Wednesday, along with the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent. Senior US officials told reporters that they expected Ukraine’s parliament to ratify the deal within a week. The agreement will see a joint fund set up by the two countries, to be financed from new licenses to exploit deposits of critical minerals, oil and gas. After several weeks when Trump appeared to be soft onRussiaand harsh towards Ukraine, authorities in Kyiv hope the dynamic may be changing. Zelenskyy said on Thursday the minerals agreement had “changed significantly during the process” and that it was “now a really equal agreement which allows for investment in Ukraine”. Most notably, it excludes from its remit money previously sent to Ukraine as military and humanitarian aid, which Trump had repeatedly said he hoped to recoup. It also explicitly states that it should be implemented in a way that does not hamper Ukraine’s integration with the EU and that US companies will not have a monopoly on deals in Ukraine, but merely obtain the right to take part in competitive bids on fair terms. The final document followed almost three months of back-and-forth negotiation, after the first outline was brought to Kyiv by Bessent and rejected by Zelenskyy as far too punitive to sign. A later signing ceremony was planned at the White House in February, but broke down afterTrump and JD Vance turned on Zelenskyy in the Oval Office, prompting an abrupt conclusion of talks and the Ukrainian president being asked to leave. Asked how Kyiv had been able to improve the terms of the minerals deal, Podolyak claimed that the actual discussions had proceeded in a very different tone to some of Trump’s public statements. “That’s just the style of this [US] administration, it’s very aggressive with communications. They will allow leaks of the most horrible conditions and so on, but then in reality they negotiate normally and you can achieve a result,” he said. “They just use this aggression to try to improve their starting position,” he added. Podolyak said that because US weapons supplied would now need to be bought, Kyiv would need to be more selective about what it requested from the US. “I think fairly quickly we will understand which types of weapons, to carefully select the unique weapons the US has. Because if we can produce our own drones, for example, then we will do that here. But there are some critical weapon types which only the US produces and nobody else,” he said. Sign up toThis is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion Zelenskyy has previously expressed interest in spending tens of billions of dollars on buying Patriot air defence systems from the US, suggesting this could be done either through financing from European allies or through the planned minerals fund. It was not immediately clear what weapons or services the more modest $50m now on the table referred to. The state department is required to notify Congress of significant sales of armaments and military services under the Arms Export Control Act. Authorisation was sought for a direct commercial sale, which authorises the transfer of “defense articles or defense services made under a Department of State issued license by US industry directly to a foreign buyer”. The intended sale wasfirst reported by the Kyiv Post. The last aid package to Ukraine came under the Biden administration, when Congress authorised $1bn in spending as the outgoing administration sought to fast-track military aid before Trump took office. Russia’s reaction to the minerals deal has been muted, with the exception of the hawkish former president Dmitry Medvedev who claimed it was a disaster for Zelenskyy. “Trump has broken the Kyiv regime to the point where they will have to pay for US aid with mineral resources,” he wrote on Telegram. “Now they [Ukrainians] will have to pay for military supplies with the national wealth of a disappearing country.”",

    "article_text": "This live blog is now closed. You can read the full report here: Donald Trump has approved the first export of American military equipment to Ukraine since assuming the presidency, The Times has reported, following the signing of the long-anticipated minerals deal between Washington and Kyiv. The Trump administration informed the US congress that it plans to export defence-related products to Ukraine through direct commercial sales (DCS) of $50m or more, theKyiv Postsaid. The notification, issued on Tuesday, came just a day before the minerals agreement was formally signed. A source close to the Ukrainian government toldThe Times: I think it’s significant as a first step of goodwill from Trump after we did what he wanted from us. Here’s a wrap-up of the day’s key events: Ukrainehas signed a deal to share revenues from the future sale of minerals and rare earths with the US after months of fraught negotiations.The agreement “signals clearly to Russia that the Trump administration is committed to a peace process centered on a free, sovereign, and prosperousUkraineover the long term,” US treasury secretary Scott Bessent said in announcing it. Donald Trump said the minerals deal may give US ‘much more’ than Washington spent on Ukraine aid.Speaking over the phone, the US president said: “We made a deal where we get much more in theory than the $350bn.” Ukrainian foreign minister Andrii Sybihasaid in a social media updatethat he spoke with the EU’s foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas about the Ukraine-EU agenda and the minerals deal signed last night.He said the agreement “marks an important milestone in Ukraine–US strategic partnership aimed at strengthening Ukraine’s economy and security.” Ukrainian and Russian civil society leaders have called for the unconditional release of thousands of Ukrainian civilians being held in Russian captivity, pushing for world leaders to make it a central part of any peace deal.Oleksandra Matviichuk, head of the Kyiv-based Centre for Civil Liberties, whichwon the 2022 Nobel peace prize, said most of the discussion on ending the conflict, led by Donald Trump’s administration, focused solely on territories and potential security guarantees. Ukrainian emergency services reported that a Russian drone attack on the Black Sea port city of Odesa killed two people and injured 15 others.AP reported local authorities saying the barrage struck apartment buildings, private homes, a supermarket and a school. Responding to the Odesa attack, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy reiterated his call to put more pressure on Russia to stop continuing attacks onUkraine.Writing on Telegram, he said: “There were also our proposals – at the very least, to refrain from striking civilian infrastructure and to establish lasting silence in the sky, at sea, and on land. Russia has responded to all this with new shelling and new assaults,” he said.

There is cautious optimism in Kyiv over the terms of the long-discussed US-Ukraine minerals deal,signed on Wednesday, which appear to be more advantageous for Ukraine than most had expected. Many details are still to be finalised and will be written into a yet-to-be-signed further technical agreement, suggesting that the long saga over the deal may not be quite over. But Ukrainian analysts have noted that Kyiv has apparently been able to extract some major concessions, despite Donald Trump’s repeated claim thatUkraine“has no cards” to play. “Ukraine held the line. Despite enormous pressure, every overreaching demand from the other side was dropped. The final deal looks fair,” Tymofiy Mylovanov, president of the Kyiv School of Economics, wrote on X. For the full story, click here: Here are some details released by the White House on the latest mineral deal struck between the US andUkraine. The White House, which described the deal as a “first-of-its-kind partnership for the reconstruction and long-term economic success of Ukraine,” said that: The deal establishes a fund that will receive 50% of royalties, license fees and other similar payments from natural resource projects in Ukraine The natural resource projects will include minerals, hydrocarbons and related infrastructure development If the US decides to acquire these resources for itself, it will be given “first choice to either acquire them or designate the purchaser of our choice” The money will be invested in new projects in Ukraine which will “generate long-term returns for both the American and Ukrainian peoples” The deal will be controlled by a company with equal representation of three Ukrainian and three American board members According to the White House readout, “No state, company, or person who financed or supplied the Russian war machine will be allowed to benefit from the reconstruction of Ukraine, including participation in projects supported by fund resources.” US secretary of state Marco Rubio hailed France for rallying support for aUkrainepeace deal but said that European allies need to step up with real resources and political will to help the war, Reuters reports, citing the US state department. In a statement on Thursday following Rubio’s phone call with his French counterpart Jean-Noël Barro, the US state department said: “Secretary Rubio commended France’s leadership in rallying European and Ukrainian support for a sustainable deal but made clear that words are not enough.” President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday hailed a minerals deal with the US as a truly equal and fair agreement, and the first result of his Vatican meeting with US presidentDonald Trumpon the sidelines of the funeral of Pope Francis. Zelenskiy said the minerals deal opens the way for the modernisation of industries inUkraine. Zelenskyy has been under pressure to show results from courting Trump, who has shifted US policy towards supporting Russia’s account of the war in Ukraine and has frequently criticised the Ukrainian leader. Donald Trump has approved the first export of American military equipment to Ukraine since assuming the presidency, The Times has reported, following the signing of the long-anticipated minerals deal between Washington and Kyiv.

A source close to the Ukrainian government toldThe Times: I think it’s significant as a first step of goodwill from Trump after we did what he wanted from us. Moscow on Thursday accused Kyiv of attacking a busy market in Russian-controlled southernUkrainein a drone strike it said had killed at least seven civilians and wounded more than 20, while Kyiv said the attack had killed only military personnel. Reuters could not verify either side’s assertions. Vladimir Saldo, the region’s Russian-installed governor, said the drones had struck a market in the town of Oleshky at about 9.30am local time on what was a public holiday. He and two social media users released videos purporting to show some of the incident. Reuters confirmed the location as Oleshky, but could not independently verify when they were filmed. One of the videos showed an explosion going off beside one in a group of low-slung buildings. Another video shows at least two bodies lying on the ground beside the structure; it was not possible to tell who they were. Vladyslav Voloshyn, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian military, said Kyiv had targeted Russian troops in part of Kherson region controlled by Moscow and that only military personnel, and not civilians, had been killed. Russia’s foreign ministry called on the international community to condemn what it said was an act of terrorism. Ukraine’s parliament is expected to ratify the US-Ukraine minerals deal, which was signed on Wednesday, within a week, senior Trump administration officials told reporters on Thursday. They added that the Ukraine deal could be a model for other international agreements going forward, Reuters reported. The general partnership overseeing the deal is domiciled in Delaware, they said. The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said the US-Ukraine minerals deal was the “first of its kind, economic partnership for the reconstruction and long-term economic success of Ukraine”. The Ukrainian military said on Thursday it had carried out an attack on Russian troops in a Russian-occupied part of the Kherson region in southernUkraine, and that the strike killed only military personal and not civilians. The region’s Russian-installed governor said earlier on Thursday that at least seven people had been killed and more than 20 wounded in a Ukrainian drone attack on a busy market in the town of Oleshky.",

    "title": "Second Italian journalist allegedly targeted with ‘mercenary spyware’",
    "article_text": "A second Italian journalist whose news organisation exposedyoung fascistswithin the prime minister Giorgia Meloni’s far-right party was targeted with sophisticated “mercenary spyware”, according to an Apple notification received by the reporter. Ciro Pellegrino is the second reporter at the investigative news outlet Fanpage to fall victim to an alleged spyware attack, after his editor-in-chief,Francesco Cancellato. Cancellato revealed in January that he had received a notification that he had been targeted with software produced by the Israel-based Paragon Solutions, a company that had a client relationship with the Italian government at the time. Pellegrino is the sixth individual inItalyto have been subjected to spyware allegedly deployed by state actors, after Cancellato and four other civil society members and activists. The others areLuca Casariniand Beppe Caccia, the Italian founders of the NGO Mediterranea Saving Humans, who are vocal critics of Italy’s alleged complicity in abuses suffered by migrants in Libya;Father Mattia Ferrari, a chaplain on a migrant rescue ship owned by the NGO, who had a close relationship with Pope Francis; andDavid Yambio, an Italy-based human rights activist. Pellegrino told the Guardian: “On Tuesday evening I received a notification from Apple informing me that it had detected a mercenary spyware attack targeting my device. I couldn’t believe it. I thought it was a prank. It’s the first time anything like this has happened to me. It’s a horrible feeling. “Why have I been targeted? I’ve been asking myself that ever since the notification arrived. I will – and we will – ask that question publicly of anyone who has the authority and the duty to answer. An answer is owed … to everyone who has an interest in knowing who, in this country, has torn to shreds the clear boundary between security and surveillance, between legality and abuse.” Pellegrino, who has been critical of Meloni’s government on social media, contacted researchers at the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab, which tracks digital surveillance of civil society actors and helps to identify the kinds of spyware used in such attacks. Cancellato, Casarini, Caccia, Ferrari and Yambo were allegedly targeted with the military-grade Paragon software. Citing a person familiar with the matter, the Guardianreported in Februarythat Paragon had terminated its client relationship with Italy. It is not yet clear when Pellegrino’s mobile phone was attacked and whether Paragon was used in his case. Like other spyware vendors, Paragon sells its cyberweapon to government clients who are supposed to use it to prevent crime. The company has said that under its terms of service, government clients are not permitted to target journalists or other members of civil society. A Paragon spokesperson said: “Paragon requires all users of our technology to adhere to terms and conditions that preclude the illicit targeting of journalists and other civil society leaders. While we are not able to discuss individual customers, we have a zero-tolerance policy for violations of our terms of service.” In March during a classified meeting with Copasir, the Italian parliamentary committee for national security, Alfredo Mantovano, a cabinet undersecretary, admitted his government had approved the use of Paragon to spy on members of a humanitarian NGO because they were allegedly deemed a possible threat to national security. Copasir is investigating whether the secret services breached the law in using Paragon Solutions to monitor activists and journalists, and is expecting to report on its findings soon. John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the Citizen Lab, said he believed the Italian government, a confirmed former Paragon user, was “in a good position” to know whether the spyware had been used to target Pellegrino because it would have kept logs of deployments. “The Paragon affair is not over for Italy, and now is a critical moment for clear and transparent official communication,” Railton said.",

    "title": "Children under six should avoid screen time, French medical experts say",
    "article_text": "Children under the age of six should not be exposed to screens, including television, to avoid permanent damage to their brain development,French medical experts have said. TV, tablets, computers, video games and smartphones have “already had a heavy impact on a young generation sacrificed on the altar of ignorance”, according to an open letter to the government from five leading health bodies – the societies of paediatrics, public health, ophthalmology, child and adolescent psychiatry, and health and environment. Calling for an urgent rethink by public policies to protect future generations, they said: “Screens in whatever form do not meet children’s needs. Worse, they hinder and alter brain development,” causing “a lasting alteration to their health and their intellectual capacities”. Current recommendations inFranceare that children should not be exposed to screens before the age of three and have only “occasional use” between the ages of three and six in the presence of an adult. The societies suggest the ban on screens should apply at home and in schools. They wrote: “Neither the screen technology nor its content, including so-called ‘educational’ content, are adapted to a small developing brain.Childrenare not miniature adults: their needs are different needs.” They add that every day health professionals and infant school teachers “observe the damage caused by regular exposure to screens before they [children] enter elementary school: delayed language, attention deficit, memory problems and motor agitation”. The experts suggest regular exposure to screens – however brief – has also had a negative effect on children’s social and emotional development. They suggest the problem affects all social groups, but particularly disadvantaged households leading to greater “social inequalities”. Alternatives including “reading aloud, free play, board games or outdoor games, physical, creative and artistic activities”. The letter says: “It would occur to no one to let a child of under six cross the road on their own. Why then expose them to a screen when this compromises their health and their intellectual future?” Last year, a report commissioned by France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, found that French three- to six-year-olds spent an average of 1 hour 47 minutes a day in front of a screen in 2014-15, the latest available research. Since then, however, only one of the commission’s recommendations, concerning the exposure of under-threes to screens, has been implemented. Former prime minister Gabriel Attal has gone further, proposing to ban children under 15 from social media, with an online “curfew” for 15- to 18-year-olds halting their access to social media at 10pm.",

Despite enormous pressure, every overreaching demand from the other side was dropped. The final deal looks fair,” Tymofiy Mylovanov, president of the Kyiv School of Economics, wrote on X. Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said on Thursday that his country would retain “full control over its subsoil, infrastructure and natural resources”. Notably absent from the final text was the insistence that Ukraine should repay previous military US assistance via the deal, something Trump has previously repeatedly demanded. Volodymyr Zelenskyy had rejected signing something that would obligate “10 generations” of Ukrainians to repay. Future potential military assistance to Ukraine, however, will count as investments. The signed agreement also makes it clear that its terms will not jeopardise Ukraine’s potential future integration with the EU, and also does not subject Ukraine to US legal jurisdiction. It does not lock Ukraine in to partnering only with the US on projects in future, and guarantees only access to bidding processes for US companies on fair terms. “There’s no requirement to sell everything to the US, or to channel all investment through the fund. The obligation is to give the fund fair market access to future projects,” wrote Mylovanov. The original idea of some kind of “rare earths” deal was thought up by Zelenskyy’s team. It was part of a “victory plan” unveiled before the US election last year, with the specific goal of interesting Trump in an economic partnership, amid fears that a potentialTrump administrationwould not be as amenable to a values-based argument to support Ukraine as the Biden administration had been. However it seemed that the gambit had backfired when, soon after taking office, Trump dispatched the US Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, to Kyiv with the draft of an agreement that “looked like it had been written on the train”, according to one source. The plan appeared to lock Ukraine into all kinds of obligations, while offering Kyiv nothing in return by way of security guarantees, save the rather thin claim that Washington taking a stake in Ukraine’s economy was itself a kind of security guarantee. Since then, there have been various attempts to revise and revisit the terms of the deal. In late February, Zelenskyy was meant to sign it duringa meeting in Washington, but after the vice-president, JD Vance, goaded him into an argument in front of the cameras in the Oval Office, Ukraine’s president was kicked out of the White House without signing. Earlier this month, it transpired that the Ukrainian justice ministry had hired the US law firm Hogan Lovells to advise on the deal, according to filings with the US Foreign Agents Registration Act registry. The deal will need to be ratified by Ukraine’s parliament, while discussions will continue over the “technical agreement” that also needs to be finalised and signed. The overall agreement is unlikely to have a huge impact in terms of contracts signed as long as fighting between Ukraine and Russia continues, but the Zelenskyy team hope that getting it signed will increased goodwill towards Kyiv in the Trump administration. The US president in recent days has continued to paint Zelenskyyas a bigger obstacleto a peace deal than Vladimir Putin – although he has gradually inched towardscriticism of the Russian leader. The first rhetorical noises from Washington on the deal were positive. After signing the agreement, Bessent called it the start of a “historic economic partnership” and claimed it showed that the US remained committed to Ukraine as an ally. “This agreement signals clearly to Russia that the Trump administration is committed to a peace process centred on a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine over the long term,” said Bessent.",

    "title": "Israel declares national emergency as wildfires force evacuations",
    "article_text": "Wildfires continued to threaten swaths of forest and fields in Israel on Thursday, though firefighters successfully reopened the main road linking the country’s two principal cities. Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, declared a national emergency after the fires broke out on Wednesday along the main Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway, prompting police to shut the route and evacuate thousands of people from nearby communities. Hundreds were forced from their homes about 19 miles (30km) west of Jerusalem, and Israel’s most-watched television network, Channel 12, had to break off from broadcasting via its studio about 10 miles from the city during a news bulletin. High winds that have fanned the fires led to the cancellation of many events celebrating Israel’s foundation in 1948. A prerecorded rehearsal of a torch-lighting ceremony was screened instead of the planned event. The Times of Israel newspaperdescribed“a surreal, fraught evening in which Israel is starting to mark its 77th Independence Day while firefighters battle some of the worst wildfires in its history”. In a speech at one ceremony, Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, said the wildfires were “part of a climate crisis that we must not ignore”. The anniversary celebrations had already caused controversy after government ministers were heckled at some events for failing to bring back all the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, and on Tuesdayrightwing activists attackeda synagogue where a joint Arab-Israeli memorial event was being screened. Political tensions are high after a turbulent few weeks with waves of protests anda public clashbetween Netanyahu and the head of the Shin Bet internal security service. Herzog called for an end to “polarisation” in Israel. Israel’s military said troops were helping in Jerusalem and other central districts. “Overnight dozens of engineering vehicles started operating throughout the country to form lines to prevent the fire from spreading into other trees,” it said in a statement. “The IAF [air force] continues assisting in the effort to extinguish the fires.” Israel’s firefighting service said 163 ground crews and 12 aircraft were working to contain the flames. Military planes have dropped hundreds of tonnes of retardant in an effort to stop the spread of the blaze. Magen David Adom, Israel’s medical rescue service, said it treated 23 people on Wednesday, mostly for smoke inhalation and burns. Seventeen firefighters were injured, according to the public broadcaster Kan. Witnesses described “walls of flame” surging across woodland on the slopes of the foothills west of Jerusalem, though the situation appeared to have improved on Thursday as winds dropped and a light rain fell. There has been some criticism of the response of emergency services. Speaking from near the city of Modiin as fires burned on a nearby hillside, Yuval Aharoni, 40, said: “It’s just very sad because we knew the weather, we kind of knew that would happen, and still we feel like they weren’t ready enough with the big planes that can drop large amounts of water.” Late on Wednesday, the foreign ministry said firefighting aircraft were expected to arrive from Croatia, France, Italy, Romania and Spain to join the operation. The fire and rescue service’s Jerusalem district commander, Shmulik Friedman, described “a very large wildfire, maybe the largest there has ever been in this country” and said the effort to contain the blaze would continue for “a very long time”. Itamar Ben-Gvir, the far-right national security minister, hinted that the fires may have been deliberately started, though authorities have not presented any evidence to support such claims.

    "title": "MPs urge David Lammy to intervene as British man remains in jail in India",
    "article_text": "Hopes that Jagtar Singh Johal, a British Sikh man held in an Indian jail for seven years, would be released on bail were dashed on Thursday when his case was deferred by the Indian supreme court possibly until after the summer, prompting calls from MPs for the UK to intervene. The foreign secretary,David Lammy, is due to meet Johal’s brother again next week. There had been hopes Johal would finally be released, at least on bail, after in March he wascleared of all chargesin a case in Punjab that exactly parallels the charges laid against him in the federal courts. He has not been convicted of any crime since his arrest in November 2017. Johal, from Dumbarton inScotland, is accused of being a member of a terror group, the Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF), which has carried out attacks in Indian Punjab. The charges against him include that he travelled to Paris in 2013 to give £3,000 to other KLF figures, with the money buying weapons that were used in a series of murders and attacks against Hindu nationalist and other religious leaders in 2016 and 2017. He has denied the charges. Johal claims he was forced to make a confession at the outset of his detention by signing a blank sheet of paper after police tortured him with electricity and brought petrol into his cell and threatened to burn him alive. A UN working party has claimed he is being held under arbitrary detention. A new letter to Lammy, signed by 117 cross-party MPs and peers, calls for urgent British diplomatic pressure. It says there is a “window of opportunity” to secure Johal’s release following his acquittal in the March case. The letter says: “The judgment on the evidence led is crucial and relevant to securing his release, because it is the same evidence that exists in the other outstanding federal court cases.” The campaign group Reprieve, which has been backing calls for his release, said it understood bail had been deferred because his case had become enmeshed in a broader consideration of the length of pre-trial detention in cases brought under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, a law human rights defenders claim has been abused to shut down civic freedoms in India. Reprieve said Johal’s continued detention on the same charges in a different court after his acquittal challenged the principle of double jeopardy, a risk recognised in Indian and international law. The Indian authorities do not claim Johal was directly involved in any of the attacks. All the cases are based on the same alleged confession. Johal’s brother Gurpreet Singh Johal, a Labour councillor in West Dunbartonshire, said: “I’m glad the foreign secretary is meeting me again, as it shows he recognises that this is a make-or-break moment for Jagtar. “The case against my brother has been tested in court and rejected, but the Indian authorities will keep him in prison for decades if the UK government doesn’t act to secure his release. “We’ve seen that today at the supreme court – just the latest in an endless series of delays. This is the moment of truth for David Lammy: will he live up to his promises, or will he fail Jagtar like the last six foreign secretaries did?” Dan Dolan, the deputy executive director of Reprieve, said: “This is a politically motivated prosecution of a young British human rights defender, and the process is the punishment. Jagtar has been found not guilty once, after prosecutors failed to present any credible evidence against him in seven years. For him to remain imprisoned for decades, as duplicate trials drag on in defiance of the principle of double jeopardy, would be an obscene injustice. It is time for the government to act on its strong statements in opposition and do what it takes to bring Jagtar home.”",

    "article_text": "People in the most deprived areas ofEnglandare almost twice as likely to be admitted to hospital as a result of infectious diseases than their least deprived counterparts, according to a major study. The report, by the UKHealthSecurity Agency (UKHSA), analysed NHS and government data to look at the state of health inequalities in England due to infectious diseases and environmental health hazards. The analysis found a stark regional divide across England: those living in the north-west of the country were 30% more likely to be admitted to hospital for an infectious disease, with 3,600 admissions for every 100,000 people between September 2023 and August 2024, compared with the average for England, which stood at 2,800 for every 100,000. The study found that inequality was highest in the case of respiratory infections, with an estimated additional 260,000 admissions due to inequalities associated with deprivation. People living in the 20% most deprived areas of England were twice as likely to be admitted to hospital for respiratory diseases, seven times as likely for tuberculosis and six times for measles, than their counterparts from the least deprived areas. The analysis also revealed stark ethnic inequalities. Although admission rates were low overall for tuberculosis, emergency hospital admissions for the disease were 15 times higher for people from a black African background compared with those categorised as white British. It was also estimated that these inequalities in emergency admissions for infectious diseases cost theNHSin England between £970m and £1.5bn in 2022-23. Prof David Taylor-Robinson, an academic co-director at Health Equity North and professor of public health and policy at the University of Liverpool, said: “This report echoes past research showing that deprived communities, typically in the North of England, bear the brunt of health inequalities. “It is particularly troubling to see the high number of hospital admissions due to infectious diseases, especially as some of these are preventable diseases.” He added: “Our previous analysis has shown that childhood vaccine uptake in England has plummeted among the most disadvantaged families. This is against a backdrop of cuts to local government, pressures on the NHS, and the growing number of children living in poverty. “Protecting children from vaccine-preventable diseases should be a public health priority, otherwise we will see more hospitalisations and deaths from these entirely preventable diseases.” Dr Leonora Weil, the interim deputy director for health equity and inclusion at UKHSA, said the report revealed some “stark” facts on the state of inequalities in health security faced by some people, “in particular those living in the most deprived communities and certain areas of the country, some ethnic groups, as well as excluded groups such as those experiencing homelessness. “These health-protection inequalities – where there are poorer health outcomes based on where you live, your socioeconomic status or ethnicity – are avoidable, pervasive and preventable. That is why it is so important to shine a light on these findings to increase action to support communities to live longer and in better health.” She added: “This report is just the start. We need to build on these insights, as only through persistent and dedicated effort across all health organisations will we make a real difference to helping all people live longer and in better health.” A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “This shocking report shows the appalling healthcare inequalities this government inherited. “Our Plan for Change is reforming the NHS to get it back on its feet so it is there for everyone, regardless of who they are or where they live. We have hit the ground running, delivering an extra 3 million appointments since July to cut waiting lists.",

    "article_text": "Members of the public captured a bulldog which was trying to bite the legs of two police horses while they were out on patrol inLondon. Metropolitan police horses Yvonne and Snaffles were being ridden by officers when the out-of-control canine began nipping at their legs. The incident in Shepherd’s Bush Green, west London, on Monday morning was captured on the body-worn camera of one of the police riders. The footage shows 13-year-old Yvonne moving in circles to escape the dog, which ran back and forth between the horses as the owner struggled to get it under control. The bystanders eventually stepped in to seize the dog, which was then returned to its owner. Investigations are under way and no arrests have been made. Sgt Leon Astley, who was riding with PC Grace Miller-McCormack when they were attacked last Monday, said: “What should have been a routine patrol turned out to be unexpectedly eventful, where our hard-working police horses were sadly injured in the course of their duty. “Fortunately Yvonne and Snaffles are recovering well and being looked after in their stables. “We know horses are not a common sight in the capital but we urge all owners to keep their dogs under control to prevent this happening again.” The Met is appealing for any witnesses to come forward. Yvonne, 13, recognisable by her big ears, has been a police horse since October 2020. Snaffles, 15, has previously starred in Activity Ride, the Mounted Branch’s performance at Olympia, and has been involved in public order policing in central London. A person can receive an unlimited fine and be sent to prison for up to six months for having a dog seriously out of control, the Met said. If the dog injures someone this can increase to up to five years in prison.",

    "article_text": "Polls have closed acrossEnglandfor local and mayoral elections, as well as a key parliamentary byelection, with the first results due to be announced within hours. It is the first full-scale electoral test for Keir Starmer since the general election, and could have notable repercussions for Nigel Farage and Kemi Badenoch, as well as to a lesser extent for the Liberal Democrats and Greens. The elections cover 24 councils across England, as well as six mayoralties and a byelection in the formerly Labour-held seat ofRuncorn and Helsby in Cheshire, which is being closely contested by Reform UK. The first results, expected at about 2am, will be for two of the mayoral races: North Tyneside, which Labour is expected to hold, and West of England, which was previously held by Labour but is seen as being a close race between Labour, the Greens and Lib Dems. About an hour later will be perhaps the key result of the night, with voters in Runcorn and Helsby deciding who will succeed Mike Amesbury, the former Labour MP whoresigned afterbeing given a suspended prison sentence for punching a man. Bookmakers have Reform as the favourites to overturn Labour’s near-15,000 majority. Labour officials in the constituency on Thursday said the contest appeared too tight to predict. Other overnight results will include the mayoralties in GreaterLincolnshire, where Reform is hopeful of taking the newly created post, and Doncaster, which is Labour-held and where the party believes it can win again. However, the bulk of the council votes will not be counted before Friday morning, with many results not finalised until well into the afternoon. Results are seen as particularly hard to predict given the atomised polling figures, with Reform, Labour and the Conservatives each recording national support generally between 20% and 25%, and the Lib Dems and Greens not notably far behind. One thing that does seem certain is that the Conservatives will lose many hundreds of council seats, in part because they did so well in 2021 when the same seats were last contested, amid the brief fillip of Boris Johnson’s “vaccine bounce”. Sign up toHeadlines UK Get the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning after newsletter promotion A particularly bad night could put new pressure on Badenoch’s leadership of the party, but Conservative MPs say there is minimal chance of any formal challenge to her for now, not least because so many voters expressed distaste at the Tories’ internal divisions in the run-up to last year’s general election. Starmer can most likely gloss over a modest night in council results, but a Reform win in Runcorn, and in a couple or several of the mayoral races, would set off new jitters in Downing Street. The Lib Dems and Greens will be hopeful of making gains, but also wary about potential ingress by Reform.",

    "title": "Harrods is latest retailer to be hit by cyber-attack",
    "article_text": "Harrods has been hit by a cyber-attack, just days after Marks & Spencer and the Co-op were targeted. The luxury department store is understood to have been forced to shut down some systems, but said its website and all its stores, including the Knightsbridge flagship, H beauty and airport outlets, continued to operate. It is understood the retailer first realised it was being targeted earlier this week. Harrods said in a statement: “We recently experienced attempts to gain unauthorised access to some of our systems. Our seasoned IT security team immediately took proactive steps to keep systems safe and as a result we have restricted internet access at our sites today.” The retailer said it was not asking customers to take any action, indicating that it did not suspect data had been accessed. It added: “We will continue to provide updates as necessary.” The problems at Harrods, first reported by Sky News, emerged as M&S continues to battle problems caused by a cyber incident that has beenlinked to the hacking collective Scattered Spider. More than £650m has been wiped off the stock market value of the company as its website has been forced to stop orders for almost a week. There are also gaps on shelves in stores as the company’s automated stock systems are not working and its loyalty scheme and gift card payments have been disrupted. On Thursday it emerged that M&S has been forced topause hiring new workers. The company said it had pulled all online job postings from its website as its recruitment systems were on hold while tech experts deal with the consequences of a hack which has also forced M&S to close its online shop. A message on M&S’s jobs website said: “Sorry you can’t search or apply for roles right now, we’re working hard to be back online as soon as possible.” The company, which employs about 65,000 people in its stores and London head office, had no jobs listed anywhere across its UK business on Thursday despite having more than 200 job openings the previous week. A spokesperson said: “While we proactively manage the cyber incident, we are temporarily pausing some of our normal processes so we can continue to work hard on offering the best M&S for our customers and colleagues. Job adverts will be up again in due course.” The Co-op has also had toshut down some internal systemsand warned staff to keep cameras on during online conferencing after detecting an attempted hack. Stores and online business continue to operate as usual. Retailers are on high alert as many use the same systems as M&S and the Co-op, SAP, so potential hackers could try to use the same methods in many businesses. Sign up toBusiness Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion It is unclear whether the cyber-attacks on the three retailers are coordinated or carried out by the same group. The National Cyber Security Centre said it was working with M&S and the Co-op to understand the nature of both incidents, and is expected to examine any potential links. The Metropolitan police confirmed on Wednesday that detectives from its cybercrime unit, assisted by colleagues from the National Crime Agency, were investigating the attack on M&S. Richard Horne, chief executive of the NCSC, said the cyber incidents should “act as a wake-up call to all organisations”. He urged businesses “to ensure they have appropriate measures in place to help prevent attacks and respond and recover effectively”.He added: “The NCSC continues to work closely with organisations that have reported incidents to us to fully understand the nature of these attacks and to provide expert advice to the wider sector based on the threat picture.” Retailers and their suppliers have faced a series of cyber-attacks in recent years including Morrisons,which was affected by an incident at its tech supplier, Blue Yonder, in the run-up to Christmas last year. In 2023 WH Smith washit by an attackin which company data was accessed illegally, including the personal details of current and former employees. That came less than a year after a cyber-attack on WH Smith’s Funky Pigeon website forced it tostop taking ordersfor about a week.",

    "title": "Assisted dying impact assessment to put price on enacting change in England and Wales",
    "article_text": "A long-awaited assessment of the impact of assisted dying legislation will put a price on administrating the procedure for the first time and is expected to conclude it will save parts of theNHSmoney by accelerating the deaths of terminally ill people. The Whitehall document, which is expected as soon as Friday, is likely to make difficult reading for both sides of the campaign, government sources have suggested. One warned the language used in the impact assessment could be dehumanising as it set out to quantify the costs and savings of the state helping people to end their lives inEnglandand Wales. It is expected to put a figure on the costs of enacting the change, including a tribunal-style system for assessing requests for an assisted death and potential costs to the health service. But it will also assess if there will be savings from allowing people with intensive care needs to end their lives more quickly. The bill would only allow terminally ill people with fewer than six months to live to end their lives. The document, which has been prepared by civil servants, will also assess equality and human rights issues. The timing of the release has caused some anger among MPs who suggested the report was being deliberately released to coincide with the aftermath of the local elections. But one government source denied it was a deliberate comms ploy. “When something like this is ready, you can’t sit on it,” they said. The Labour MP Meg Hillier, whovoted against the bill, said: “Releasing this long-delayed impact assessment while MPs are focused on local election counts far from Westminster and only weeks before the bill comes back to parliament is another example of the failure of this process to live up to the promises made to MPs at second reading. “This is a weighty piece of legislation, with significant changes from second reading, such as theremoval of the high court judge. It’s essential that MPs have a real opportunity for proper scrutiny and improvement to do justice to a bill of such consequence and to all those potentially impacted by it.” MPs will vote again on the private member’s bill, sponsored by the Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, on 16 May after it was delayed by three weeks to avoid a clash with local elections and allow more time for the impact assessment to be prepared. The Commons speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, is said to have resisted calls for the final Commons stage to be wrapped up that day and – should the bill pass in May – a final vote is expected on 13 June. Campaigners who oppose the change have stepped up efforts in recent weeks to get wavering MPs to change their minds and vote against the bill in a fortnight’s time. Labour MPs organised a “committee of the unheard” with campaigners against the bill who were not among those experts chosen to give evidence to the bill’s scrutiny committee. The bill had a majority of 55 at the last parliamentary vote, needing 28 MPs to change sides. But those in favour of the bill believe there are few who are changing their minds – just two have gone public so far. “Every media outlet that is looking to run ‘support draining away’ stories has so far failed to identify a single MP other than two from Reform who have switched to opposing the bill,” one of those backing the bill said. “MPs now have the chance to examine a bill that has been made even stronger and safer when it returns to the Commons on 16 May. They will make their own minds up and not be influenced by opponents who claim to know what they think but don’t.” The government has taken a neutral position on the bill, with MPs voting according to their conscience. Plans are being drawn up in the Department ofHealthand Social Care for the care minister, Stephen Kinnock, to take over the implementation of the bill should it pass the Commons. The health secretary, Wes Streeting, has said he opposes the bill. Since the initial vote, the high court’s role in approving assisted deaths has been scrapped and replaced by a panel of experts. Additionally, the implementation period has been doubled to a maximum of four years for an assisted dying service to be in place. The legislation argues that someone in England andWaleswho is terminally ill, with fewer than six months to live, should be legally allowed to end their life, as long as it has been approved by two doctors and an expert panel.",

    "title": "Dozens of homeless people living in national forest evicted by US Forest Service",
    "article_text": "Dozens of homeless people who have been living in a national forest in centralOregonfor years were being evicted on Thursday by the US Forest Service, as it closed the area for a wildfire prevention project that will involve removing smaller trees, clearing debris and setting controlled burns over thousands of acres. The project has been on the books for years, and the decision to remove the encampment in the Deschutes national forest comes two months after theTrump administrationissued an executiveorder directingfederal agencies to increase timber production and forest management projects aimed at reducing wildfire risk. It wasn’t immediately clear if the evictions were a result of that order, but homeless advocates seized on the timing on Thursday, as US Forest Service officers blocked the access road. “The fact that they are doing this with such vigor shortly after they announced that the forests would be opened up for logging I don’t think is a coincidence,” said Jesse Rabinowitz, a spokesperson for the NationalHomelessnessLaw Center. The US Department of Agriculture, which oversees the US Forest Service, and the service’s Pacific Northwest Region did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment. “The closure does not target any specific user group and will restrict all access, including day use and overnight camping, while crews operate heavy machinery, conduct prescribed burns, and clean up hazardous materials,” Deschutes national forest spokesperson Kaitlyn Webb said in an email. “It’s not safe for the public to be in the area while heavy machinery is operating, trees are being felled, mowing operations are active, and prescribed burning is occurring.” Campers who had set up trailers, recreational vehicles and tents amidst the ponderosa pines in the Deschutes national forest scrambled in the darkness Wednesday night to pack up and get their engines working again. Authorities closed the two-lane road in the early hours of Thursday morning, and it was not immediately clear how many people were left in the forest by the afternoon, though some were unable to leave. The US Forest Service has been working for years on plans to close part of the Deschutes national forest near Bend for forest restoration and wildfire mitigation. But the number of people living in that part of the forest has grown, with many losing homes during the coronavirus pandemic due to job losses and high housing costs, Rabinowitz said. Donald Trump’s administration has acted toroll back environmental safeguardsaround future logging projects on more than half of US national forests, under an emergency designation that cites dangers from wildfires. Whether the administration’s move will boost lumber supplies as Trump envisioned in an executive order he signed in March remains to be seen. Joe Biden’s administration also sought more logging in public forests to combat fires, which have become more intense amid drier and hotter conditions linked to the climate crisis, yet US Forest Service timber sales stayed relatively flat under his tenure. The Cabin Butte Vegetation Management Project, a wildfire mitigation treatment on some 30,000 acres (12,000 hectares), is prompting the closures in the Deschutes national forest. The goal of the work is to reduce wildfire risk and restore damaged habitats where development encroaches on natural areas near Bend, Deschutes national forest officials said in a statement. Recreation sites and trails in that area will be closed through April next year. Multiple US Forest Service officials and vehicles were stationed at the Deschutes national forest road closure on Thursday. A sign on the metal gate blocking the road said the temporary emergency closure will last at least one year. Violators could face up six months in jail, fines up to $5,000, or both. On Wednesday night, Mandy Bryant, who said she had lived in the encampment for about three years, was cleaning up her site and trying to get a trailer to start so she could move it. “You could feel the heaviness in the air and just the stress and depression that people are feeling,” she told the Associated Press. “We’re up there on the list of groups of people that society doesn’t really care for.” Four people living in the encampment including Bryant, along with two homeless advocates, filed for a restraining order to stop the closure earlier this month. The claim argued it would cause irreparable harm to more than 100 people who were living there, many of whom have disabilities. The government responded in court filings that US Forest Service staff in January began notifying homeless people living in the area of the upcoming closure. Original plans for the project were published in 2019 and were authorized by the US Forest Service in 2023, the court filings said. US district court judge Michael McShane denied the restraining order on Tuesday and issued a written opinion on Thursday. “The public’s significant interest in restoring natural habitats, preventing catastrophic wildfires, and preserving the overall health of Deschutes National Forest is not outweighed by the interest of 150 or so individuals in residing on this particular plot of land,” he wrote in his ruling. Webb, a Deschutes national forest spokesperson, told the Oregonian/OregonLive that the government’s goal is “voluntary compliance”, but Forest Service officers and staff will patrol and “enforce the closure and ensure public safety”.",

    "title": "Apple quarterly earnings beat Wall Street expectations amid Trump trade policy chaos",
    "article_text": "Apple’s second-quarter financials came in slightly higher than Wall Street’s expectations on Thursday. The tech giant reported revenue of $95.4bn, up more than 4% over last year, and earnings-per-share of $1.65 per share, up more than 7%. Analysts had predicted revenue of $94.5bn and earnings of $1.62. The company, worth $3.2tn, has beaten Wall Street’s expectations for the previous four quarters. Investors have been keepingtheir eyes on Apple as it prepared to report its financial results . The tech giant has been working to calm nervous analysts afterDonald Trumplevied sweepingtariffson countries around the world that are likely to complicate supply chains for consumer electronics. Since the beginning of the year, Apple’s stock has slumped 16%. During a call with investors on Thursday,AppleCEO Tim Cook said that he expects the tariffs to add $900m to its costs for the upcoming quarter that ends in June. That’s assuming, he said, that the global tariff rates don’t change again. Cook declined to speculate further into the future, saying,:“I’m not sure what will happen with the tariffs … It’s very difficult to predict beyond June.” In after-hours trading, the company’s stock dropped by more than 4%, likely due to the tariffs news and its services division reporting revenue that missed Wall Street’s expectations, despite growth over last year. The division covers iCloud subscriptions and revenue from various licensing deals. Sales inChinaalso missed estimates. Cook, remained positive, however, saying that the company was reporting “strong quarterly results” and “we’re very engaged on the tariff discussions”. The iPhone maker is heavily reliant on Chinese manufacturing for its phones, tablets and laptops. Days after Trump instituted soaring tariffs on China, at one pointas high as 245%, the president said he wouldmake an exceptionfor consumer electronics. Cook spoke to senior White House officials around this time, according to theWashington Post. It was after these conversations that Trump announced his exception for consumer electronics. Apple’s stock rose 7% in the days after the announcement. However, it is unclear how lasting the reprieve may be. Howard Lutnick, the US commerce secretary, hascalled the exemption “temporary”, and even Trump later said on social media that there’s been no “exception”. The president has repeatedly said he wants to see more manufacturing in the US. In February, he met with Cook to discuss investing in US manufacturing. “He’s going to start building,” Trump said after the meeting. “Very big numbers – you have to speak to him. I assume they’re going to announce it at some point.” JP Morgan estimates costs would skyrocket for Apple if it moves production to the US, saying in a note this week that it could “drive a 30% price increase in the near-term, assuming a 20% tariff on China”. JP Morgan and other analysts have said Apple could continue to move more of its manufacturing to India, which only faces a 10% tariff. Sign up toTechScape A weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives after newsletter promotion Apple chartered jets toairlift some $2bn worth of iPhones from Indiato the US earlier this month to boost inventory in anticipation of price hikes from Trump’s tariffs and panic-buying by worried consumers. This comes as investors have expressed concerned about decreasing iPhone sales in China, the world’s biggest smartphone market. During its last earnings in January, Apple reported thatiPhone sales fellby 11.1% in China in the first quarter and missed Wall Street’s expectations for iPhone revenue. Cook said during the investor call that China would continue to be a major manufacturer for the company, but that for the June quarter India would be producing more iPhones for Apple and Vietnam would make more iPads and Macs. “The existing tariffs that apply to Apple today depend on products’ country of origin,” he said. India and Vietnam have lower tariffs than China. In the short term, analysts say the tariff confusion could benefit Apple as people rush to buy more of its products in fear that prices will rise.“What remains to be seen in the longer term is how much of any increased cost will be passed on to consumers,” said Dipanjan Chatterjee, principal analyst for Forrester. “And if [consumers] will absorb these price increases without pulling back on demand for Apple products.”",

    "title": "Syrian Druze leader condemns government over sectarian violence",
    "article_text": "A leader of Syria’s Druze minority has condemned attacks against his community after dozens of people were killed in two days of sectarianclashes south of Damascus. Sheikh Hikmat al-Hijri on Thursday denounced the violence in Jaramana and Sahnaya near Damascus earlier this week as a “genocidal campaign” against the Druze community in Syria. Syria’s Ministry of Information said 11 members of the country’s security forces were killed in two separate attacks. The United Kingdom-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a war monitor, said at least 101 people were killed in fighting between security forces, allied fighters and local Druze groups. The SOHR, which relies on a network of sources in Syria, said the death toll included 30 government loyalists, 21 Druze fighters and 10 civilians, including Sahnaya’s former mayor, Husam Warwar. In the southern province of Sweida, heartland of the Druze minority, it said 40 Druze fighters were killed, 35 in an “ambush” on the Sweida-Damascus road on Wednesday. The clashes broke out around midnight Monday after an audio clip circulated on social media of a man criticising Islam’s Prophet Muhammad. The audio was attributed to a Druze scholar. But the scholar, Marwan Kiwan, said in a video posted on social media that he was not responsible for the audio, which angered many Sunni Muslims. On Wednesday afternoon, theSyrian governmentsaid a deal was reached between Druze dignitaries and official representatives after which security forces and pro-government fighters entered Sahnaya and Druze gunmen withdrew from the streets. Videos on social media showed what appeared to be pro-government armed groups beating Druze men they had captured in Sahnaya and making offensive sectarian remarks. “This collective killing is systematic, clear, visible, and documented,” read al-Hijri’s statement. “We no longer trust a group that calls itself a government, because the government doesn’t kill its own people through extremist gangs that are loyal to it, and after the massacre claims they are loose forces.” The violence poses a serious challenge to the country’s new authorities, who toppled longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in December. It comes after a wave of massacres in March in Syria’s Alawite heartland on the Mediterranean coast in which security forces and allied groups killed more than 1,700 civilians, mostly Alawite, according to the SOHR. Israeli officials have expressed support for the Druze, with Defence Minister Israel Katz warning his country would respond “with significant force” if Syria’s new authorities fail to protect the minority community. In a later statement, Katz said, “Should the attacks on the Druze resume and the Syrian regime fail to prevent them, Israel will respond with significant force.” Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani on Thursday reiterated Syria’s rejection of demands for international intervention, posting on X that “national unity is the solid foundation for any process of stability or revival”. “Any call for external intervention, under any pretext or slogan, only leads to further deterioration and division,” he added. Most Druze spiritual leaders and factions have opted to air their grievances in closed communication with the new government, but concerns have heightened after a crackdown on al-Assad loyalists in Syria’s coastal province turned into a series of targeted revenge attacks against the Alawite minority group. Videos widely circulated of houses burned down and bloodied bodies of Alawite on the streets. Tens of thousands of Alawite fled south to neighbouring Lebanon, and many are too scared to return. The Druze have since becomereluctant to lay down their arms, which they say they need for protection.",

    "title": "Manchester United, Fernandes beat Athletic Club in Europa League semifinal",
    "article_text": "Three first-half goals helped Manchester United put themselves on the cusp of the Europa League final, with the Premier League side earninga 3-0 semifinal first-leg winaway at Athletic Bilbao. In a raucous San Memes atmosphere on Thursday, with supporters dreaming of a first-ever European trophy, veteran midfielder Casemiro arrived at the back post to give the visitors the lead 30 minutes in. United, who are having a miserable season domestically, were given another boost five minutes later as Bilbao defender Daniel Vivian was sent off for fouling Rasmus Hojlund in the penalty area and Bruno Fernandes converted the resulting spot kick. The United fans high in the top tier were in dreamland moments later as captain Fernandes raced through to put the seal on a victory, and perhaps even the tie, before the interval. Bilbao, who have the added incentive that the final will be hosted at their own stadium on May 21, could not muster a response in the second half with depleted numbers, leaving United to coast to the most unlikely first-leg success. “Of course it’s a great start, to get a victory here and score three goals and with a clean sheet,” United defender Harry Maguire told TNT Sports. “All the pressure will be on us, everyone will be expecting us to go through. We need to prepare properly, and if we do that, we’ll give ourselves a great chance. “One foot in the final, but it’s not done.” The Europa League has been somewhat of a safe haven for United this term, where they can forget the fact that they are on course for their worst-ever Premier League points haul this term. United travelled to Bilbao as the only unbeaten team in any European competition, but were up against their toughest challenge yet, with Bilbao sitting fourth in LaLiga, possessing the meanest defence in the division. The Bilbao players fed off the crowd’s energy early on, creating the better of the initial chances. Inaki Williams should have scored from a close-range header, while Victor Lindelof came to United’s rescue with a timely block on the line. Casemiro, however, arrived right on cue to swing the momentum in United’s favour. Norwegian referee Espen Eskas, after consulting the pitch-side monitor, adjudged that Vivian had denied Hojlund a clear goal-scoring opportunity and thus branded a red card and pointed to the spot. The composure shown by Bruno Fernandes as he calmly stroked home the penalty, despite the ear-splitting whistles from the cantankerous crowd, was astounding. The whistles had barely died down when the United skipper raced onto Manuel Ugarte’s flick to add a game-clinching third. To highlight the contrast between United’s domestic and continental campaigns, they have now scored more goals in their seven Europa League games in 2025 than they have in their 15 Premier League games this calendar year. They have also won more games in the Europa League since Ruben Amorim took over as coach, than they have in the Premier League. Casemiro could have even added a fourth, but saw his second-half header come out off the post. The job, however, was done. United’s success means 133 teams have won the first leg of a UEFA Cup or Europa League knockout stage tie by three or more goals away from home, and all 133 have won the tie.",

    "title": "Court rules against Trump’s use of Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans",
    "article_text": "A United States judge has issued a permanent injunction preventing the administration of President Donald Trump from using the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 (AEA) to deport Venezuelans from South Texas. Thursday’s ruling is the first of its kind — and is likely to be swiftly appealed. It follows similar, if temporary, orders barring the government’s use of the law, as Trump seeks the rapid removal of undocumented immigrants from the country. In his 36-page decision, US District Court Judge Fernando Rodriguez Jr ruled that the Trump administration had “exceeded the statutory boundaries” of the Alien Enemies Act, a wartime law. Trump had issued an executive proclamation on March 15 to invoke the law against members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. He argued that Tren de Aragua was “perpetrating an invasion of and predatory incursion into the United States”, thereby justifying such extreme measures. The Alien Enemies Act, after all, had been invoked only three times before, most recently during World War II. But Judge Rodriguez said the threat of Tren de Aragua fell far short of the standards necessary to use the Alien Enemies Act, though he did concede the gang participated in activity that “unambiguously is harmful to society”. “The Court concludes that [Tren de Aragua’s activities] do not fall within the plain, ordinary meaning of ‘invasion’ or ‘predatory incursion’ for purposes of the AEA,” the judge wrote. “The Court concludes that the President’s invocation of the AEA through the Proclamation exceeds the scope of the statute and, as a result, is unlawful.” Since the Trump administration did “not possess the lawful authority under the AEA”, Judge Rodriguez ruled it could not use the law to “detain Venezuelan aliens, transfer them within the United States, or remove them from the country”. Judge Rodriguez is a Trump-appointed judge who assumed his current post under the Republican leader’s first term in 2018. His decision applies to the Southern District of Texas, including cities like Houston. But while it is the most sweeping ruling of its kind, it joins an array of legal cases and court decisions weighing the Trump administration’s use of the Alien Enemies Act. The law allows the US government to detain and deport citizens of an enemy country in times of war or invasion. Its usage, however, has been highly controversial, with critics calling it unconstitutional. The Alien Enemies Act was used as justification, for example, to incarcerate tens of thousands of Japanese Americans and other foreign nationals in camps during World War II. That incident resulted in the US formally apologising and offering compensation to Japanese American survivors decades later. Trump is believed to be the first president to invoke the Alien Enemies Act outside of wartime. Using nativist rhetoric, hehas sought to frameundocumented migration to the US as an unbridled “invasion” of criminals, threatening US communities with violence. Since taking office for a second term, Trump has designated criminal groups like Tren de Aragua as foreign terrorist organisations, a category that makes non-citizen members inadmissible to the US. But the Supreme Court has ruled (PDF) that, for removals made under the Alien Enemies Act, foreign nationalsare entitled to a judicial reviewof their cases. Lower courts have also questioned whether the Trump administration’s use of the Alien Enemies Act violated that right to due process. Judges in Colorado, Manhattan and Pennsylvania have issued temporary injunctions against the law’s use, and in Washington, DC, Judge James Boasberg has overseen a high-profile case where three planes of deportees were sent to prison in El Salvador under the law, despite an injunction against its use. Last month, Boasberg ruledthere was “probable cause”to find the Trump administration in contempt of court for violating his order. Hearings in that case are continuing, but Trump and his allies have argued that Boasberg has overstepped his judicial authority by interfering in matters of foreign policy. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has been among the plaintiffs fighting the Alien Enemies Act’s use in court, and on Thursday, it applauded Judge Rodriguez’s decision. “The court ruled the president can’t unilaterally declare an invasion of the United States and invoke a wartime authority during peacetime,” ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt said in astatement. “Congress never meant for this 18th-century wartime law to be used this way.” Adriana Pinon, the legal director of the ACLU’s Texas branch, also framed the decision as a win for immigrant rights. “This permanent injunction is a significant win for preventing unlawful, unilateral executive action that has been stoking fear across Texas, especially within border communities,” she said. “Immigrants are, and always have been, an integral part of this state and nation. They, too, are protected by US laws and the Constitution.” Top Democrats like Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer also weighed in, calling Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act unconstitutional. “The Trump administration is patently breaking the law, trying to use the Alien Enemies Act to deport people without due process,” Schumerwroteon social media. “Americans reject this. The courts are taking them to task. We won’t stop fighting for our Constitution.” The Trump administration is expected to appeal Thursday’s decision to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, a conservative-leaning court.",

    "title": "How activists and immigrants in the US can protect their privacy",
    "article_text": "Civil liberties have come under threat since United States President Donald Trump took power in January. The Trump administration has primarily targeted more vulnerable groups, such as immigrants, tourists and non-American activists, as US law does not grant them the same protections as US citizens. Some immigrants and tourists have found themselves trapped at the border for long periods of time. In some cases, they have been held due to social media posts critical of Trump. That has raised the question – what should a person be prepared for when they’re going to encounter US immigration agents? Crossing the US border is a point of particular vulnerability for targets of Trump’s crackdown. US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) detained Lebanese physician and assistant professor at Brown UniversityRasha Alawieh, as she attempted to re-enter the United States in March, and eventuallydeportedher after agents allegedly discovered images related to Hezbollah on her phone. The agency provided no evidence that she had any connection to the paramilitary group, and she tried to explain that she did not support them before she was eventually sent to Lebanon. Tom Bowman, policy counsel at the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), says crossing the US border raises “distinct privacy concerns,” because Customs and Border Protection has more authority to search people than regular law enforcement. They are allowed to search people’s electronic devices “without a warrant or probable cause,” he says. “If you are a citizen, they cannot deny you entry into the country on the basis of refusing to unlock your phone. They may confiscate the phone, but they can’t deny you entry,” says Bill Budington, a senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). “If you are at risk of deportation, then it might be advisable to comply with any requests by customers and border enforcement, but that doesn’t mean you can’t minimise the amount of data you’re carrying with you.” “Some travellers choose to limit what data they carry across the border,” says Bowman. “That may involve using a travel-only device, storing essential information in the cloud and logging out of all accounts, or removing sensitive apps and files entirely. Others opt to shut down devices completely before arriving at the border, relying onfull-disk encryptionto protect their contents.” The ICE has been targeting student protesters who support Palestine, and it often surveils social media to do so. Badar Khan Suri, a postdoctoral fellow at Georgetown University, wasseizedby Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in March as he returned to his home following a Ramadan iftar. ICE alleged Suri, who was born in India and was in the US on a student visa, was “spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media”, which his lawyers have denied. Two days earlier, US Citizenship and Immigration Services had announced that it would screen the social media accounts of people applying for permanent residence and non-citizens affiliated with educational institutions for evidence of “antisemitic activity”. While the Trump administration has not yet invoked the Insurrection Act, it is punishing people for protesting – non-citizens, for now. The administration hasnotablybeen trying to deport a student activist at Columbia University named Mahmoud Khalil because of his involvement in pro-Palestinian protests, and his is just one of several similar cases. “I think people should be very concerned,” says Daniel Solove, a professor of intellectual property and technology law at George Washington University. “We’re living in a surveillance society, and the government can use facial recognition technologies and AI-assisted surveillance technologies to systematically identify and track protesters. We’re already seeing the government go after protesters.” Cornell University student and activist Momodou Taal had his student visa revoked and recently decided to leave the US to avoid deportation. Yunseo Chung, a Columbia student and activist and a legal permanent resident who moved to the US from South Korea at age 7, has also been targeted by ICE. Federal agents might use video surveillance, social media monitoring, facial recognition or geolocation data to identify who is participating in protests, Bowman says. He says people documenting protests with photos and videos can also unintentionally identify who participated in a particular demonstration, so people should be careful about how they’re using their devices. “One basic protection is to turn your phone on airplane mode when you’re going to a protest. That will ensure that you’re not sending your data in real time,” says Budington. “You can still navigate streets with offline maps. Both Google Maps and Apple Maps have a way to do that.” Protesters can also use messaging apps like Signal to communicate during protests, because then their messages can be encrypted. Some might recommend just leaving your phone at home, but you might want to have it in case of an emergency or if you want to document wrongful police actions. It is essentially impossible to avoid all government snooping and keep one’s data completely secure 100 percent of the time, but there are actions people crossing the border or attending protests can take that will help reduce the risk of them being targeted by the government. Americans are becoming more aware of their need for privacy, and they’re looking for ways to protect themselves. Buddington says people seem to be a lot more concerned about privacy than they were five or 10 years ago. “The government already has massive troves of personal data and is using it improperly. The government already has countless surveillance technologies and is using them,” Solove says. “We’re already in a Constitutional crisis. It seems that this administration will push as far as they can until they are stopped.”",

    "title": "Global health funding faces worst crisis ‘in memory’, WHO chief says",
    "article_text": "The head of theWorld Health Organization(WHO) has warned that global health is at serious risk as donor support dries up and severe budget cuts loom. WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Thursday that the agency is facing “the greatest disruption to global health financing in memory” as contributions fall sharply across the board. The crisis deepened after the United States, formerly the organisation’s biggest funder,pulled outin January, saying the health agency had mishandled the COVID-19 pandemic and other international health crises. The US had previously covered nearly a fifth of the WHO’s budget. In response, the WHO has revised its financial plans, scaling back its current spending and proposing a 21 percent cut for the2026-2027 budget cycle. An internal memo seen by the news agency Reuters outlines a reduction from $5.3bn to $4.2bn as well as significant staff cuts. “It is of course very painful,” Tedros said, warning that slashing the budget will directly impact healthcare systems around the world, particularly in the most vulnerable countries. The WHO plans to make cuts across all levels of its operations, including its headquarters in Geneva and regional and country offices. Some offices in wealthier nations may be closed entirely. Assistant Director General for Business Operations Raul Thomas said about 25 percent of the WHO’s salary budget remains unfunded over the next two years, adding that it’s too early to say how many roles will be lost because that would depend on staffing levels and locations. While the US exit added pressure, Tedros pointed to deeper structural problems. The WHO currently relies on a handful of countries for 80 percent of its budget through voluntary contributions. He said the agency must diversify its funding sources to survive long term. Tedros told reporters he remains in contact with US officials and continues to provide them with information although he has had no direct communication with President Donald Trump. With a shortfall of nearly $600m this year alone, WHO officials are urging donors to act swiftly. Without renewed support, they warned, the ability to respond to international health emergencies and sustain basic services could collapse.",

    "title": "Why are relations between Algeria and France so bad?",
    "article_text": "Relations between Algeria and its former coloniser, France, have rarely been straightforward. After hitting a low point in July when France supported Algeria’s regional rival Morocco over its claim to the disputed territory of the Western Sahara, relations appeared to be recovering. But then the April arrest in France of an Algerian consular official along with two other men for alleged involvement in the kidnapping near Paris of Algerian government critic Amir Boukhors has triggered a new wave of tensions. So why arediplomats now being expelled, and what does this mean for relations between Algeria and its former coloniser? Let’s break it down: Boukhors, or Amir DZ,  is an Algerian online influencer and critic of Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune with more than 1 million subscribers on TikTok. The French government gave Boukhors political asylum in 2023. But as far as the Algerian government is concerned, he’s a fraudster and a “terrorist”, who they’ve been seeking to extradite from France since 2016. Algeria has tried to extradite Boukhors nine times. All attempts have been declined by France. Speaking to the newspaper Le Parisien in an interview published on April 9, Boukhors said that on returning to his home in Val-de-Marne near Paris during the evening of April 29, 2024, he was stopped by an unmarked car with flashing lights. Four men in civilian clothes handcuffed him and threw him into the vehicle. “They first told me that an Algerian official wanted to talk to me, that that was why they were taking me. Then they told me the plan had changed and that I was going to Amsterdam,” Boukhors told the newspaper. Boukhors said he was then forced to swallow sleeping pills and was held in a “container” for more than 27 hours before being released without explanation. A subsequent investigation by France’s counterespionage agency uncovered information leading to the arrest on April 11 of three men with a fourth still reportedly at large. No information has been released about two of the men. However, the third was an Algerian consular employee, French officials said. Algeria issued a statement the following day strongly denying its official’s involvement and protesting the person’s arrest “in public … without notification through the diplomatic channels”. The statement denounced what it charged was a “far-fetched argument” based “on the sole fact that the accused consular officer’s mobile phone was allegedly located around the home” of Boukhors. All three suspects were later charged with “kidnapping or arbitrary detention … in connection with a terrorist undertaking”. On April 14, Algeria announced that 12 French consular officials had 48 hours to leave the country. The statement, read on public television, confirmed the expulsions had been ordered in response to France’s arrest of the Algerian official. According to the statement, the arrest had been intended to “humiliate Algeria, with no consideration for the consular status of this agent, disregarding all diplomatic customs and practices”. France responded in kind the following day,expelling 12 Algerian consular officialsfrom its territory and recalling its ambassador from Algiers. A statement from the office of French President Emmanuel Macron described the Algerian decision as “incomprehensible and unjustified” and said Algiers should “resume dialogue” and “take responsibility for the degradation in bilateral relations”. France colonised Algeria for 132 years, killing Algerian civilians and creating a class structure in which European settlers and their descendants were on top. The Frenchrefused to leave Algeria, considering it an integral part of France. It was only after a war of independence that France finally left in 1962. Algeria is still referred to as the “country of a million martyrs” because of the number of people killed by France during the fight for independence. But the dispute has not ended there. The issue of the Western Sahara is also causing tension, not just between France and Algeria but also across North Africa. Western Sahara – a disputed territory in northwestern Africa – is at the centre of the poor relations between Algeria and Morocco. Rabat claims the territory as its own and occupies the majority of it while Algeria supports the pro-independence Polisario Front and has taken in tens of thousands of Sahrawi refugees. France has largely backed Morocco – despite the United Nations not recognising Rabat’s sovereignty over the Western Sahara. And last year, Macron said France’s position was that it supported Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara. At the time, Algeria voiced its “deep disapproval” of France’s “unexpected, ill-timed and counterproductive” decision to endorse Morocco’s autonomy plan for Western Sahara and recalled its ambassador. However, relations between the two were thought to be improving since then. Speaking in early April after a series of talks intended to restore relations after the rift, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said: “We are reactivating as of today all the mechanisms of cooperation in all sectors. We are going back to normal and to repeat the words of President Tebboune: ‘The curtain is lifted.'” But the Boukhors case and the diplomatic expulsions that have followed it have made it clear that the curtain has fallen right back down.",

    "article_text": "Al Jazeera Media Network has been honoured with two prestigious Peabody Awards, one of the most esteemed accolades in broadcast storytelling. The awards recognise the Al Jazeera EnglishFault LinesdocumentaryThe Night Won’t Endin the News & Documentary category, and the Al Jazeera English Digital filmOne Day in Gazafrom the seriesClose Up, in the Interactive & Immersive category. The 85th annual Peabody award winners were announced on May 1, 2025, in advance of its annual ceremony in Los Angeles on June 1, 2025. The awards honour intelligent, powerful and moving stories told in broadcast and digital media. Al Jazeera English’sFault Linesdocumentary The Night Won’t End uncovers the tragic human cost of war. It depicts the realities of the unrelenting Israeli bombing campaign on Gaza, the unsafe “safe zones,” and arbitrary executions through the eyes of three families during the initial 15 months of the war. The film investigates the death of five-year-old Hind Rajab, who was waiting to be rescued from a car where her family members had already been shot dead. Two medics dispatched to rescue her were also killed, as verified by a forensic watchdog agency. Laila Al-Arian, executive producer ofFault Lines, stated, “No single piece can fully capture the scale of the atrocities in Gaza, but we aimed through investigative journalism and on-the-ground storytelling to offer a glimpse of what life has been like. We are honoured by this recognition because it helps bring more attention to a continuing story the world needs to see. Though we filmed this over a year ago, the horrors we documented remain a daily reality for more than 2 million Palestinians in Gaza.” To date, The Night Won’t End has garnered multiple awards, including in the coveted International Current Affairs category at the Royal Television Society Awards in the United Kingdom, the Overseas Press Club prize for best TV, video or documentary about international affairs, and the long-form award from the Centre for Information Resilience Open-Source Film Awards. The One Day in Gaza film from the seriesClose Upis a compilation of videos recorded by 10 individuals in Gaza, who were asked to document moments throughout their day, thereby helping viewers understand the immense hardships and constant dangers faced by Palestinians living under the constant bombardment in Gaza. Juan Carlos Van Meek, director of digital innovation and programming, expressed his gratitude for awarding the team the Peabody Award, stating, “I am immensely proud of our team’s relentless efforts in amplifying the humanity of Palestinians living in Gaza under constant bombardment. Through the brave voices of people on the ground, we have captivated millions of viewers and helped sustain global attention on the ongoing genocide, ensuring their stories are not forgotten.” The recognition of these documentaries underscores Al Jazeera’s commitment to highlighting the profound human experiences amid conflict. As the situation in Gaza continues to unfold, The Network remains dedicated to shedding light on the stories that matter, ensuring that the voices of those affected are heard on a global platform.",

    "title": "Trump replaces Mike Waltz with Marco Rubio as national security adviser",
    "article_text": "United States President Donald Trump has announced he plans to reassign Mike Waltz, removing him from his current role as his national security adviser and nominating him instead to be ambassador to the United Nations. The revelation on Thursday comes after a morning of intense speculation that Waltz and his second-in-command, Deputy National Security Adviser Alex Wong, had been pushed out of their roles. “I am pleased to announce that I will be nominating Mike Waltz to be the next United States Ambassador to the United Nations,” Trumpwroteon his social media platform Truth Social. “Mike Waltz has worked hard to put our Nation’s Interests first. I know he will do the same in his new role.” Trump said that Secretary of State Marco Rubio would instead step into the role of national security adviser, while continuing in his role as the country’s top diplomat. “Together, we will continue to fight tirelessly to Make America, and the World, SAFE AGAIN,” Trump said. The president’s message seemed to confirm the first major staffing shake-up of his second term. Earlier in the day, anonymous sources had told major US news outlets that Waltz had been forced out, after his relationship with Trump cooled. Waltz’s reputation has suffered from an incident in which he appears to have added a journalist to a private chat on the app Signal wheredetails of US military attackswere shared. But Trump has publicly stood by Waltz and refused to mete out punishment for the Signal scandal. During his first term, Trump also made a habit of cycling through national security advisers. Over his four years in office, he had four different national security advisers,starting with retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, who lasted only four weeks. Waltz was a former US Congress member, who represented Florida’s 6th district starting in 2019. Although he was re-elected to his seat in 2024, he stepped down from his congressional role in January to join the Trump administration. Previously, he had served in the US army as a Green Beret, a branch of the special forces. “Mike has been a strong champion of my America First Foreign Policy agenda, and will be a tremendous champion of our pursuit of Peace through Strength,” Trumpwroteon November 12,when he first announced Waltzas his pick for national security adviser. But Waltz’s foreign-policy background has been a source of scrutiny. While Trump has positioned himself as a “peacemaker and unifier” during his second term, promising to end world conflict, critics point out that Waltz has historically taken a more hawkish stance. He served as a counterterrorism adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney under the administration of former President George W Bush, and he opposed the large-scale withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan without concessions from the Taliban. That made Waltz and his staff a target for some among Trump’s “Make America Great Again” (MAGA) base. At a White House meeting in April, far-right social media personality Laura Loomer reportedly criticised national security officials, including Waltz. After that meeting, Trump fired six National Security Council (NSC) officials, although Waltz and Wong were not among them. On Thursday, Loomer appeared to celebrate Waltz’s and Wong’s departures on social media. “Hopefully, the rest of the people who were set to be fired but were given promotions at the NSC under Waltz also depart,” shewrote. But Waltz’s standing in the White House was particularly weakened after the revelation that editor Jeffrey Goldberg from The Atlantic magazine was added to a private chat in which top officials discussed a bombing campaign in Yemen. In hischronicle of the incident, Goldberg said he received an unexpected invitation from a Signal account identified as Waltz’s. At first, Goldberg questioned whether the invitation was real. But after accepting, he found himself in the midst of a conversation with individuals including Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Rubio. They appeared to be discussing upcoming plans to bomb targets associated with the Houthis, a Yemen-based armed group. Those details, shared by Hegseth, included theprecise timings and aircraftused in the bombing campaign. Waltz has admitted his role in the scandal, and the White House has since said the issue was “case closed”. “I take full responsibility. I built the group,” Waltz told Fox News in March. Of Goldberg, he added: “We’ve got the best technical minds looking into how this happened. But I can tell you for 100 percent: I don’t know this guy.” To take up his new role as UN ambassador, Waltz will face a Senate confirmation hearing — a process he did not have to undergo as a national security adviser. His involvement in the “Signalgate” scandal is likely to take a central role in his Senate questioning. The UN ambassador’s position has been open since Trump yanked the nomination of Representative Elise Stefanik on March 27, on the premise that her seat in Congress was too valuable — and too vulnerable — to be put up for grabs in a special election. Waltz acknowledged his nomination to the ambassadorship in a one-line social media post on Thursday. “I’m deeply honored to continue my service to President Trump and our great nation,” hewrote.",

    "title": "Canelo Alvarez vs William Scull: Fight start time, undercard, stream, purse",
    "article_text": "Saul “Canelo” Alvarez, one of the most popular and highest-paid athletes, is set to face an unbeaten challenger, William Scull, in a highly anticipated boxing fight that will crown the men’s undisputed super middleweight champion of the world. The bout will take Alvarez to Saudi Arabia for the first time as part of his deal with Riyadh Season and will present him with a chance to regain his IBF belt. Here’s what you need to know about the fight: The fight is scheduled for Saturday, May 3. The ANB Arena in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, will host the fight. The pre-fight events, followed by the undercard fights, will get under way at 18:00 GMT. Ring walks for the main fight are not expected to begin before 22:00 GMT. Al Jazeera Sport’s live coverage of the pre-fight build-up and undercard results will begin at 17:00 GMT, followed by a comprehensive text and photo blow-by-blow account of the main fight at 22:00 GMT. The fight will be streamed live on DAZN pay-per-view. The fight night, titled “Fatal Fury”, boasts a strong undercard with a rematch between Bruno Surace and Jaime Munguia the pick of the fights. Marco Verde, Mexico’s silver medallist at the Paris Olympics 2024, will also make his professional debut on the night with his light middleweight fight against compatriot Michel Polina. Here’s what the undercard looks like: While the official fight purse has not been announced, Canelo is set to earn $80m from the fight, according to Spanish sports newspaper Marca. One of the most famous fighters of the current era, Alvarez is a professional boxer from Guadalajara, Mexico. Better known as simply Canelo, the 34-year-old began fighting, aged 15, in 2005 and turned pro five years later. Coming from a rural background, the Mexican has built a reputation as one of the world’s best boxers, with a worth of $275m, according to Forbes magazine. Alvarez has fought in multiple weight classes – from welterweight to light heavyweight – and has held belts in four of these divisions. At a height of 1.75 metres, an orthodox stance and a reach of 70.5 inches, Alvarez has pummelled many famous opponents in his 15-year professional career. He’s currently the world’s top-ranked super middleweight boxer and in possession of the World Boxing Association (WBA), World Boxing Council (WBC) and World Boxing Organisation (WBO) belts. In his last professional fight in September 2024, Alvarez beat challenger Edgar Berlanga by a unanimous points decision in three rounds. Born in Matanzas, Cuba, Scull turned professional at the age of 24 and enjoys an unbeaten record in his pro career. The 32-year-old became the International Boxing Federation’s super middleweight champion in 2024 when Alvarez relinquished his belt. Scull fights with an orthodox stance and with a reach of 73 inches, the Cuban is a formidable figure in the ring. His last fight, against Vladimir Shishkin, in October 2024, earned him the vacant IBF super middleweight belt. The fight is set to unify the WBC, WBA and WBO super middleweight titles held by Alvarez with Scull’s IBF belt, which was relinquished by Alvarez. The fighters have exchanged indirect words on what to expect from the bout on Saturday, with Alvarez dismissing Scull’s claims of eating the Mexican. “He’s going to eat punches, that’s what he’s going to eat,” Alvarez told iFL TV on Wednesday. The famous boxer has previously said he will treat the bout with importance, as it presents him with the opportunity to fight in a different country. “That motivates myself – fighting in another country. I feel great about it. This fight is very important to me. I never take anything easy.” Meanwhile, Scull has said he doesn’t want to be disrespectful towards his opponent but will “eat him” in the ring. “I’m here to win and that’s it,” the challenger said on Tuesday. “I’m going to eat him. Now, I’m focused on what I have to do. I’m very excited because I’m here to shut some mouths and do what I have to do.” When the Mexican boxing icon passed up a speculated bout with the YouTube personality and boxer Jake Paul in favour of a deal with Riyadh Season in February, Paul termed him “a money-hungry squirrel” chasing his “next nut”. Alvarez signed a four-fight deal with Riyadh Season, with his upcoming bout against Scull being the first one. Alvarez would have been an astronomical favourite to beat Paul, who beat Mike Tyson in November 2024.",

    "title": "DRC seeks to lift ex-President Kabila’s immunity over alleged war crimes",
    "article_text": "Authorities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) have asked the Senate to lift the immunity of former President Joseph Kabila so he could face trial oncharges of supporting a rebel uprisingin the country’s east, the justice minister says. Constant Mutamba told reporters in the capital, Kinshasa, on Wednesday evening that authorities have amassed clear evidence implicating the former president in “war crimes, crimes against humanity and massacres of peaceful civilians and military personnel” in the east. Mutamba said the attorney general of Congo’s army has asked the Senate to revoke the lifetime immunity from prosecution that Kabila enjoys as a former president and senator. The former president is accused of “treason, war crimes, crimes against humanity and participation in an insurrectional movement”, the justice minister added. His successor, President Felix Tshisekedi, last year alleged Kabila was supporting the M23 rebels and “preparing an insurrection” in the eastern DRC with them, a claim Kabila denied. Kabila led the DRC from 2001 to 2019, taking office at the age of 29 and extending his mandate by delaying elections for two years after his term ended in 2016. His father, former President Laurent Kabila, was assassinated in 2001. Last month, he returned to the DRC after having left in 2023 in part due to deteriorating relations with the government of Tshisekedi. He arrived in the rebel-held eastern city of Goma, where he planned to “participate in peace efforts”, according to one of his associates. Fighting in the eastern DRC surged once again in January, and the M23 have captured the key cities of Goma and Bukavu, leaving devastation in their wake. The fighting has killed about 3,000 people and worsened what was already one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises with about seven million people displaced. M23 is one of about 200 armed groups vying for a foothold in the mineral-rich eastern DRC near the border with Rwanda. The rebels are supported by about 4,000 soldiers from neighbouring Rwanda, according to UN experts. Despite the DRC’s army and M23 having agreed towork towards a trucethis month, fighting continues in the eastern province of South Kivu. Ferdinand Kambere, the deputy secretary-general of Kabila’s People’s Party for Reconstruction and Democracy, said the justice minister’s actions amount to “relentless persecution”. “For us, these mistakes that those in power keep making against the former president, thinking they are humiliating or intimidating him, actually show that the regime is nearing its end. They have nothing left to use against Kabila,” Kambere told The Associated Press news agency.",

    "title": "Israeli attacks kill dozens as UN demands lifting of ‘cruel’ Gaza blockade",
    "article_text": "Israeli air attacks on the Gaza Strip have killed at least 29 people, Gaza’s civil defence agency said, as the United Nations demanded that Israel lift its blockade of the Palestinian territory and allow humanitarian aid to enter. At least eight people were killed in an Israeli attack that hit the Abu Sahlul family home in Khan Younis refugee camp in southern Gaza, according to civil defence official Mohammed el-Mougher. Four others were killed in an air strike in the Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City, east of Shaaf, and at least 17 more were killed in other assaults across the enclave on Thursday, including a strike on a tent housing displaced civilians near Deir el-Balah. Witnesses told the AFP news agency about a trail of devastation in Khan Younis. “We came here and found all these houses destroyed, and children, women and young people all bombed to pieces,” said Ahmed Abu Zarqa. “Enough, we’re tired. We don’t know what to do with our lives any more. We’d rather die than live this kind of life.” The bombardment comes amid dire warnings about the humanitarian situation in the besieged territory, which has been under a total Israeli blockade for two months. Volker Turk, the UN human rights chief, said the conditions being imposed by Israel on Palestinians in Gaza are “increasingly incompatible with their continued existence as a group”. He warned that starvation as a method of warfare could amount to a war crime. The humanitarian crisis in Gaza has reached a catastrophic level, with Palestinians teetering on the edge of mass starvation, according to Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum reporting from the ground. “Parents have literally started to skip meals and children are now eating spoiled food. Canned food has become a luxury,” he said. Aid-supported bakeries have shut down due to severe shortages, while the World Food Programme has reportedly run out of stock, leaving soup kitchens overwhelmed and barely operational. “Locals are calling for safe, sustained humanitarian corridors, but say meaningful aid can only enter when Israel permits it,” he added. With the blockade now in its second month, many in Gaza feel they are not just enduring a humanitarian emergency but “an engineered misery” that has unleashed famine on a devastating scale. Tom Fletcher, the UN’s humanitarian chief, echoed those concerns on Thursday. “Aid, and the civilian lives it saves, should never be a bargaining chip,” he said. “Blocking aid kills. It inflicts cruel collective punishment.” He criticised an Israeli proposal for private distribution of aid in Gaza, calling it insufficient and not aligned with basic humanitarian principles. “To the Israeli authorities, and those who can still reason with them, we say again: lift this brutal blockade. Let humanitarians save lives,” he said. UN agencies, including UNRWA, said more than 3,000 aid trucks are stuck at the Gaza border, unable to deliver essential supplies. Some one million children are said to be at risk. “The siege must be lifted,” UNRWA said in a post on X. Israel’s obligations to provide humanitarian assistance to Palestinians in Gaza and the occupied West Bank are also the subject of a weeklong hearing at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), following a request for an advisory opinion from the UN General Assembly last year. In the fourth day of hearings on Thursday, Qatar’s ambassador to the Netherlands, Mutlaq al-Qahtani, told the court Israel has continued its “genocidal war against the Palestinian people” and increased settlement efforts in the occupied West Bank. Palestinians in Gaza continue to face “famine-like conditions” as Israel continues to block “any delivery of life-saving aid”, said Mutlaq al-Qahtani Israel has jeopardised the existence of the UN agency for Palestine refugees, UNRWA, which is the “backbone” of humanitarian and development assistance in the occupied territory, added the Qatari diplomat.",

    "title": "Fourth round of US-Iran nuclear talks postponed amid continued tensions",
    "article_text": "The foreign minister of Oman has announced that a fourth round of talks with the United States about Iran’s nuclear programme had been postponed. Minister Badr bin Hamad al-Busaidi made the announcement on the social media platform X on Thursday, just days before the talks were expected to begin in Rome. “For logistical reasons we are rescheduling the US Iran meeting provisionally planned for Saturday May 3rd,” hewrote. “New dates will be announced when mutually agreed.” Al-Busaidi had previously mediated three rounds of talks between Iran and the US. Thefirsttook place in Oman’s capital of Moscat on April 12, with a follow-up in Rome the following weekend. Athird roundof negotiations returned to Moscat on April 26, with the US touting “progress” towards a nuclear deal. But tensions between the Iranian and US governments have been simmering beneath the near-weekly meetings. The administration of President Donald Trump has said its aim is to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, though Tehran has long denied armament as a goal. It frames its nuclear programme as a civilian energy project. The Trump White House has hinted its goals may extend further, though, to the total dismantlement of Iran’s nuclear enrichment programme. In mid-April, US special envoy Steve Witkoff releaseda statementsaying that “Iran must stop and eliminate its nuclear enrichment and weaponization program” as part of a final deal. Earlier on Thursday, before the postponement was announced, Iran accused the US of issuing “contradictory behaviour and provocative statements” about the nuclear negotiations. And on Wednesday, the US made a series of aggressive moves as part of its “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran, heightening the already uneasy relations. First, the US Department of Statesanctionedseven entities involved in the trade of Iranian oil products, on the basis that the proceeds “support its terrorist activities and proxies”. Then, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth offered his own remarks, warning that Iranian support of the Houthis, a Yemen-based armed group, could result in US retaliation. “Message to IRAN: We see your LETHAL support to The Houthis. We know exactly what you are doing,” Hegsethwroteon social media on Wednesday. “You know very well what the U.S. Military is capable of — and you were warned. You will pay the CONSEQUENCE at the time and place of our choosing.” Trump himself later chimed in with a social media message on Thursday, warning the international community to stop its purchases of Iranian oil products. “Any Country or person who buys ANY AMOUNT of OIL or PETROCHEMICALS from Iran will be subject to, immediately, Secondary Sanctions. They will not be allowed to do business with the United States of America in any way, shape, or form,” Trumpwrote. Despite the heated rhetoric, Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that Thursday’s postponement came “at the request of Oman’s foreign minister”. Iranian spokesperson Esmail Baghaei also emphasised that his country was committed to achieving “a fair and lasting agreement” with the US. Still, a senior official with the Iranian government told the Reuters news agency on condition of anonymity that the recent US actions were tied to the delay. “US sanctions on Iran during the nuclear talks are not helping the sides to resolve the nuclear dispute through diplomacy,” the official told Reuters. “Depending on the US approach, the date of the next round of talks will be announced.” Other media reports, meanwhile, indicate that the US was not completely on board with the prospects of renewed talks in Rome this weekend. An anonymous source told The Associated Press that the US “had never confirmed its participation” in this weekend’s anticipated talks, but that further negotiations were expected “in the near future”. Successive US administrations have sought to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. One recent effort culminated with a 2015 agreement called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The multilateral agreement, forged during the administration of US President Barack Obama, created a framework for Iran to receive relief from international sanctions, in exchange for reducing its uranium enrichment and submitting to inspections of its nuclear facilities. But when Trump succeeded Obama as US president, he set into motion plans to withdraw the US from the JCPOA in 2018, causing the deal to crumble. Instead, during his first term as president from 2017 to 2021, Trump pursued a campaign of “maximum pressure” against Iran, a strategy he has returned to since taking office a second time in January. When Trump launched a new round of US attacks against the Houthis in March,he warnedhe held Iran responsible for Houthi strikes against ships in the Red Sea — and he hinted he would consider using force against that country as a result. “Every shot fired by the Houthis will be looked upon, from this point forward, as being a shot fired from the weapons and leadership of IRAN, and IRAN will be held responsible, and suffer the consequences, and those consequences will be dire!” Trumpwroteon March 17. More recently, the US president threatened military action could also be an outcome if a nuclear deal were not reached. In an interview with Time Magazine, published on April 25, Trump addressed the pressure from the US’s ally Israel to confront Iran militarily, saying he had not ruled it out. “It’s possible we’ll have to attack because Iran will not have a nuclear weapon,” Trump said at one point. “Ultimately, I was going to leave that choice to them, but I said I would much prefer a deal than bombs being dropped.” He later added, “If we don’t make a deal, I’ll be leading the pack,” seemingly referring to military intervention. But the US president emphasised he was optimistic that the talks with Iran would pan out. He even expressed willingness to meet with Iran’s leadership personally. “I think that we’re going to make a deal with Iran. I think we’re going to make a deal with Iran,” he said. “Nobody else could do that.”",

    "title": "Pakistan airspace ban could cost Air India $591m over 12 months: Report",
    "article_text": "Air India expects to face about $600m in additional costs if a ban from Pakistan’s airspace lasts for a year and has asked the Indian government to compensate it for the hit. The New Delhi-based air carrier on Sunday asked the government for a “subsidy model” proportionate to the economic hit, estimating a loss of more than $591m (50 billion Indian rupees) for each year the ban lasts, according to a letter sent by the airline to the Ministry of Civil Aviation and seen by the news agency Reuters. Indian airlines are bracing for higher fuel costsand longer journey times after Pakistan shut its airspace to the country’s carriers in a tit-for-tat retaliation following anattack on tourists in Kashmir last week. “Subsidy for affected international flights is a good, verifiable and fair option. … The subsidy can be removed when the situation improves,” the letter said according to the report. “The impact on Air India is maximum due to airspace closure, due to additional fuel burn, … additional crew.” Air India declined to comment to Reuters. The Civil Aviation Ministry did not respond to the outlet’s request for comment. Air India’s letter was sent after the government asked its executives to assess the impact of the airspace ban on Indian carriers, said a source with direct knowledge of the matter. The Tata Group-owned airline is in the midst of amultibillion-dollar turnaroundafter a period of government ownership, and growth is already constrained by jet delivery delays from Boeing and Airbus. It reported a net loss of $520m in fiscal 2023-2024, on sales of $4.6bn. Air India, which has a 26.5 percent market share in India, flies to Europe, the United States and Canada, often crossing Pakistan’s airspace. It operates many more long-haul routes than domestic rival IndiGo. Data from Cirium Ascend shows IndiGo, Air India and its budget unit Air India Express have roughly 1,200 flights combined from New Delhi scheduled for Europe, the Middle East and North America in April. The Indian government is considering options to reduce the hit to the airline industry from the closure of Pakistan’s airspace, three other people familiar with the matter said. One of the sources said Indian carriers met with the Civil Aviation Ministry to work on possible solutions, including flying over difficult terrain closer to China and some tax exemptions. In its letter, Air India asked the government to liaise with Chinese authorities for certain overflight clearances without elaborating.",

    "title": "Ryanair threatens cancelling Boeing aircraft order amid tariffs: Report",
    "article_text": "European budget airline Ryanair threatened to cancel hundreds of orders of Boeing aircraftamid tariffs imposedby the United States, which have driven prices higher and is considering alternative suppliers, including Chinese planemaker COMAC. The news agency Reuters first reported the story on Thursday. The airline had ordered 330 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft – at a list price of more than $30bn. Ryanair’s chief executive Michael O’Leary said in a letter to an undisclosed senior US lawmaker “If the US government proceedswith its ill-judged plan to impose tariffs, and if these tariffs materially affect the price of Boeing aircraft exports to Europe, then we would certainly reassess both our current Boeing orders, and the possibility of placing those orders elsewhere,” Reuters reported. The threat byEurope’s largest low-cost carrier, and one of Boeing’s biggest customers, was the latest sign of a potential reordering of the global aerospace industry if Trump does not exempt the sector from his tariff plans. The letter, seen by Reuters, was a response to a warning by US Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Democrat from Illinois, about the security implications of Ryanair following through on an earlier suggestion it might consider a COMAC order. But with COMAC not yet certified in Europe, and Boeing’s main rival Airbus saying it is sold out through the rest of the decade, Ryanair may find it hard to follow through on its threat, one industry source told Reuters. O’Leary’s letter is an escalation from a previous threat in April, in which he said that the airline would delay deliveries. In March, he said that Boeing executives had privately expressed confidence that aircraft would be exempted from Trump’s tariffs. According to Reuters, aircraft industry sources said that Boeing and Airbus contracts do not include any provision for tariffs, since the industry has for decades operated without them. Tariffs only become due once ownership of the aircraft has passed to the purchasing airline and the contract has been completed. Most aircraft purchase contracts include a clause requiring all sides to pay their own taxes without explicitly mentioning tariffs, the sources said. But many aerospace companies are said to be reviewing the wording of contracts for future deals on the assumption that trade turbulence will remain for some time. O’Leary’s comments in the letter may in part be a tactical intervention before a period of potentially tough negotiations with Boeing behind the scenes, the industry sources told the outlet. O’Leary said in the letter that the Irish airline has not had any discussions with COMAC about aircraft purchases since about 2011, but that it would “of course” consider it if they were 10 to 20 percent cheaper than Boeing’s main rival, Airbus. Airbus, which is Boeing’s only competitor for large single-aisle aircraft that are currently certified in Europe, has repeatedly said it is sold out through the rest of the decade. No Western airline has bought a COMAC plane. The Chinese company has applied for certification for its C919 jet in Europe, but not in the US. The C919 jet is approximately 150 seats, or up to about 190 in dense layouts, smaller than the Boeing planes Ryanair currently flies and the MAX 10, which make up most of the planes it has on order, which can seat up to 230. Ryanair’s threat comes as Boeing is looking to resell potentially dozens of planes locked out of China by tariffs after repatriating a third jet to the US in a delivery standoff that prompted more criticism of Beijing from Trump. It is rare for airlines to cancel aeroplane contracts, rather than delay delivery, because of the small number of suppliers and the risk of returning to the back of the queue for capacity, dampening growth, analysts say. And attempts by airlines to cancel contracts are typically resisted by planemakers, who can cite a list of excusable factors like supply chain delays, according to industry sources and previous court filings.",

    "title": "Pro-Palestine activist arrested in Belgium after attending protest",
    "article_text": "Brussels, Belgium –The recent arrest of a Palestinian activist in Belgium has raised alarm as the organisation he works for describes the incident as “a form of state harassment”. Mohammed Khatib, the 35-year-old European coordinator for Samidoun, a global Palestinian prisoner solidarity network, was arrested on April 21 after attending a daily protest demanding an end to Israel’s genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Every evening, dozens of people, some sporting keffiyehs, gather on the steps of the former stock exchange in Brussels to drape a Palestine flag down the steps and chant slogans of solidarity in English, Arabic and French. A police presence is usual, but Khatib felt uneasy when he noticed an officer photographing him He left about 7:30pm (17:30 GMT) and was stopped nearby for what he called a “spontaneous” ID check by local police. He was arrested and taken in a police van to a central station. About 30 supporters gathered outside, chanting, “Free our comrade!” before being dispersed by riot police about 10pm (20:00 GMT). Khatib was then transferred to a nearby station. He was questioned without a lawyer and released about 5am (03:00 GMT). Khatib said he spent hours waiting in a cell before being asked for a few minutes about an incident in April 2024 during which he was attacked with a knife. There was also a brief trip to the hospital for nonurgent medication. “They were doing anything they could to keep me,” Khatib told Al Jazeera. The Brussels Public Prosecutor’s Office told Al Jazeera: “Mohammed Khatib was arrested as part of an investigation into events that took place in April 2024. He was released after questioning.” A Palestinian refugee born in the Ein El Hilweh camp in Lebanon in 1990, Khatib fled to Belgium alone at age 19, claimed asylum and co-founded Samidoun one year later in 2011. Campaigning for the rights of Palestinians incarcerated in Israel is his sole occupation. Samidoun’s stance on Israel-Palestine has led to Khatib being designated as a “serious” security threat by the Coordination Unit for Threat Analysis (CUTA), an independent body that reports to Belgium’s justice and interior ministries. Khatib said officers on April 21 justified the arrest initially with the CUTA designation. It marked the second time he has been arrested. In October 2023, he was arrested at a demonstration after refusing to stop waving a Palestine flag. The latest detention was “nothing in terms of what we are facing”, he said, referring to efforts in some Westernnationsto curtail thepro-Palestine movement. Samidoun called the arrest “a form of state harassment targeting a prominent leader, not only of Samidoun, but of the growing movement against the ongoing genocide in occupied Palestine”. “It’s hard not to see it in that light,” refugee and immigration lawyer Benoit Dhondt told Al Jazeera. “A lot of people are living in a state of schizophrenia because of how invisible the genocide in Gaza is being made in Europe.” Meanwhile, “disproportionate policing of the pro-Palestine movement makes it very difficult to understand what is actually happening,” he said. The author and journalist David Cronin wrote in The Electronic Intifada: “If the Belgian authorities enjoy any success in muzzling Mohammed Khatib and Samidoun, then we have to ask: Who is next? All Palestine solidarity campaigners are at risk.” In May last year, police used water cannon and tear gas to disperse a peaceful protest outside the Israeli embassy in Brussels under instructions from Mayor Boris Dillies, who said the demonstration was unauthorised. An open letter signed by Amnesty International described the measure as “contrary to international law”. Earlier that month, police had arrested about 40 protesters when a demonstration at the US embassy went overtime. In a report on the state of the right to protest published in July, Amnesty noted that administrative arrest “is increasingly used to prevent people from participating in protests” in Belgium. Human rights and immigration lawyer Helene Crokart told Al Jazeera that arrests “are not isolated incidents” and “sometimes amount to outright intimidation”. On October 15, then-State Secretary for Migration and Asylum Nicole De Moor, a Christian Democrat, announced a procedure to strip Khatib, who she called a “hate preacher”, of asylum. “Even if someone has already been recognised as a refugee but that person turns out to be an extremist, recognition can be withdrawn,” she stated. On the same day, the United States and CanadablacklistedSamidoun, deeming it a “sham charity” and accusing it of raising funds for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a designated “terrorist” organisation. Samidoun denied the allegation. Germany banned Samidoun in 2023, alleging it celebrated the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led attacks in southern Israel. Khatib said, “Some Palestinians were distributing baklava in the street. And we were there with the Samidoun flag.” Khatib has also been banned from entering Switzerland for 10 years, which occurs only when an individual poses what is considered a “concrete” threat to national security, according to a Swiss government spokesperson. He was not permitted to enter the Netherlands for a university talk in October. During the October 2023 attacks, 1,139 people were killed and more than 200 were taken captive into Gaza. Since then, Israel’s latest war on Gaza has killed more than 52,000 people, including more than 17,000 children, in the besieged enclave. Israel has justified the onslaught as an attempt to crush Hamas. According to a CUTA spokesperson, Samidoun is classified as an “extremist” organisation, which “is not a criminal offence”. “We are more interested in keeping an eye on the leadership, the members, what they do and say, how they disrupt public order and what group they are potentially targeting,” the spokesperson said. Belgium’s right-wing government, appointed in February, is markedly more sympathetic to Israel than its predecessor. Prime Minister Bart De Wever of the New Flemish Alliance party said Belgium would not arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu despite an International Criminal Court (ICC) warrant for his arrest on charges of crimes against humanity. Four months earlier, then-Liberal Premier Alexander De Croo stated the opposite. The coalition headed by De Wever intends to “ban dangerous radical organisations such as Samidoun due to their ties to terrorism or for spreading antisemitism”, according to official documents. But a ban would likely take a long time to implement because Belgian positions depend on European Union and United Nations Security Council decisions. De Moor’s successor, Anneleen Van Bossuyt, supports the initiative to revoke Khatib’s refugee status. Such a decision is made independently by the commissioner general for refugees and stateless persons and must rely on proof of a serious crime. A decision to strip someone’s status may be appealed, but once finalised, the immigration office could issue an order for a person to leave the country. The case depends on material that authorities said they are not sharing, even with Khatib. Dhondt warned of a “chilling effect” on freedom of expression. The government is using Khatib’s case as a “propaganda tool” to demonstrate strong policies on “extremism”, he said, even though it “can’t really say why [Khatib poses any threat]”. Khatib denies all allegations of hate speech. “If they had something they could use against me, I would not be sitting here. I would be in prison. “The goal of this intimidation is to silence the movement, to make an example of us and say, ‘If you do the same, this is your future’. We will fight this.” Khatib has previously called for Israel to be “dismantled” and said, “We do not call Hamas’s attack in Israel a terror attack. We call it justified resistance.” Seen as hardline positions by some, mainstream activists have distanced themselves from Samidoun but urged Brussels to uphold freedom of expression. The Human Rights League, a nonprofit organisation that has criticised Belgian authorities for allowing the transit of arms to Israel, does not wholly endorse Khatib’s views but “reiterates the need to protect freedom of expression, including for statements that ‘offend, shock or disturb’, according to the European Court of Human Rights”. “While the positions defended by Mohammed Khatib and Samidoun can undeniably be described as radical, … to our knowledge they have never been prosecuted for any criminal offence (including for anti-Semitic statements) nor have they caused any public disorder,” the rights group said in a 2024 report. The group linked Khatib’s case to other measures, such as local bans on keffiyehs and other pro-Palestine symbols and the temporary suspension of decisions on Palestinian asylum applications. The report concluded that the lack of a decision on revoking Khatib’s refugee status suggests insufficient evidence against him. The Union of Progressive Jews in Belgium last year denounced a “smear campaign” against Khatib. “Whatever political differences we may have, this threat is intolerable and shakes the very foundations of our democracy.”",

From carrier promos to straight discounts, the deals landscape is dotted with ways to save on your monthly bills. bySheena VasaniandCameron Faulkner If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. So far, 2025 has been a great year for watching new, must-see TV shows and movies on subscription services.But if you, like many of us, have more concurrent subscriptions than you care to admit, you’ll agree that keeping up with the latest each month is expensive. They may not cost as much as most of the tech we cover, but it adds up. If you’re trying to cut down on your expenses, you might be able to do so while holding onto your precious subscriptions. Several services offer ongoing promos, some of which are even available to new and returning subscribers alike. Below, we’ve curated some of the best deals going on right now, so you can enjoy streaming your favorite show or movie for less than it would typically cost you. Most streaming services offer free trials that typically last from a week to a month, whether you sign up for an annual membership or just a monthly subscription. However, you will likely have to provide your credit card information in advance, and you will be charged once your trial is over, so make a note in your calendar if you don’t want to be charged. Some streaming platforms offer student discounts. These include Hulu, Paramount Plus, YouTube TV, Amazon Prime, and more. You’ll have to prove your student eligibility through a sign-up form and typically be enrolled in an accredited Title IV college or university to take advantage of these deals. This bundle comes with ads and grants access to all of the shows and movies available in Hulu’s and Disney Plus’ library. WithDisney Plus, you can stream a wide range of shows and movies, includingStar Wars: Skeleton Crew,Deadpool&Wolverine,Andor,X-Men ‘97,Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man, andTaylor Swift’s Eras Tour film. A monthly subscription currently costs $9.99 a month with ads or $15.99 a month without (or $159.99 annually). The $15.99 per month service includes Dolby Atmos sound, as well as the ability to download TV shows and movies on up to 10 devices. For just a dollar more,Disney offersan ad-supported, $10.99-a-month Duo Basic subscription that brings together Disney Plus and Hulu. To enjoy an ad-free experience across both services, the cost is $19.99 per month. There’s also the $16.99-a-month Disney Bundle Trio Basic bundle, which includes the ad-supported Hulu and ESPN Plus (paying $26.99 a month nets you the ad-free version of Hulu and Disney Plus, though ESPN will still have ads). That’s cheaper than subscribing to all three streaming services individually, and is the wisest route to take if you want all three. That being said, there are other ways to save, particularly with carrier promos. Those currently onone of Verizon’s Unlimited plans, for instance, can get Disney Plus Trio Basic with adsfor $10 a monthinstead of $16.99.

You’ll also be able to record live shows with unlimited DVR storage and take advantage of the same features the standard, ad-free, and ad-supported Hulu plans offer. Thead-supported Hulu with Live TV subscription is $82.99 a month, while thead-free tier is $95.99 a month(though, it’s worth noting that, of the three services included, ESPN Plus will still have ads, even at this tier). Complicated, right? However, if you just want Hulu and don’t need the live TV version, you can subscribe to the ad-supported Disney Bundle Duo Basic, which includes Disney Plus, for $10.99 a month. You can also add ESPN Plus for $16.99 per month, or get rid of ads and add live sports for $26.99 a month.

    "title": "The best budget smartphone you can buy",
    "article_text": "You can’t have everything at this price, but you can get a great smartphone. Whether you want an iPhone, a 120Hz screen, or water resistance, you’ve got options. You can’t have everything at this price, but you can get a great smartphone. Whether you want an iPhone, a 120Hz screen, or water resistance, you’ve got options. byAllison Johnson If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. Some of us take a kind of “I eat to live” rather than an “I live to eat” approach to gadgets. They’re tools that help you get things done, not something you want to invest a lot of time or money in. If that’s you — and there’s no judgment here from a certifiable gadget nerd — then you can probably think of more worthwhile ways to spend $1,000 than on a phone. Budget phones to the rescue. These devices are roughly $500 or under, though not all of them, and they’re more capable than ever. You won’t get all the bells and whistles, but you will save a little money to spend on, I don’t know, actual bells and whistles. It’s your world. There’s no shortcut to properly testing a phone; I put my personal SIM card (physical or otherwise) in each phone I review and live with it for a minimum of one full week. I set up each phone from scratch, load it up with my apps, and go about living my life — stress testing the battery, using GPS navigation on my bike while streaming radio, taking rapid-fire portrait mode photos of my kid — everything I can throw at it. Starting over with a new phone every week either sounds like a dream or your personal hell, depending on how Into Phones you are. For me, switching has becomeso routine that it’s mostly painless. At least a couple of years of OS upgrades and, ideally, three years of security updates. There’s no point in buying even a cheap phone if you have to replace it after just a couple of years because it stopped getting security patches. Since you look at it roughly two thousand times a day, your phone’s screen is one place you shouldn’t compromise. An OLED has richer contrast and color than an LCD, and the big screens on today’s phones really need at least a 1080p resolution. Faster refresh rates like 90Hz and even 120Hz are becoming more common on budget phone screens, but for my money, a smooth-scrolling LCD doesn’t look as nice as an OLED with a standard refresh rate. If you plan to hang onto your phone for a while, you’ll want enough storage space to accommodate all the system files, photos, and videos you’ll accumulate over the years. Ideally you’ll get at least 128GB built in. Upgrades like telephoto cameras and optical image stabilization are rare in the under-$500 class, but you can still expect good, basic performance in good lighting from any modern smartphone. Low light is trickier. Phones in this class should offer a night mode to help with non-moving subjects in very dim light. And there are no bonus points awarded for adding extra macro and depth cameras to pad out the rear camera array — those 2- and 5-megapixel sensors are pretty much useless. What compromises can you expect from a budget phone? Some combination of the following: slower processors, less storage, and worse cameras than flagship phones, almost across the board. Many have lower-resolution screens and water resistance is often less robust than on a pricier phone. 7 Verge Score Reliable performanceGood, if limited, camera systemIt’s the cheapest new iPhone you can buy No MagSafe$599 feels like $100 too muchNo ultrawide Screen:6.1-inch, 1170p OLED /Processor:A18Cameras:48-megapixel f/1.6 with OIS, 12-megapixel selfie /Charging:20W wired, 7.5W wireless /Weather-resistance rating:IP68 If I was making this recommendation to you face-to-face, you’d hear a heavy sigh. Yes, this is the cheapest new iPhone Apple makes. Yes, it comes with most of the things that make an iPhone an iPhone. But it comes with some significant tradeoffs — some of which make more sense than others — and it’s not exactlycheap.If you’re amenable to last year’s model or a refurbished iPhone 14, one of those might actually be a better option. But for an unfussy person who just wants a new iPhone for the least amount of money, the 16E will do the trick. There’s a single 48-megapixel rear camera on the back, meaning there’s no ultrawide like on the regular 16. That’s an understandable tradeoff — so is the use of the older “notch” design rather than the Dynamic Island. But it’s harder to understand why Apple left out MagSafe here — that’s the ring of magnets built into the back of virtually every other iPhone since 2020. The 16E still supports wireless charging, but it can’t take advantage of the ecosystem of magnetic chargers and accessories on its own; you’ll need to add a magnetic case. This is a silly omission, and Apple should feel bad about it. Another heavy sigh: the 16E supports Apple Intelligence, which you won’t get if you opt for an iPhone 15 or 14. Should you care? It’s really hard to say. What exists of Apple Intelligence so faris underwhelmingand the most interesting bitswon’t arrive anytime soon. If you want to future-proof your purchase as much as possible, the 16E will be ready for Apple’s AI. But don’t buy one expecting a life-changing experience now. It’s just an iPhone after all, for better and worse, and right now it’s the best price you’ll find on a brand-new one. 8 Verge Score Robust IP68 ratingSeven years of software updatesBrighter, bigger screen Missing a couple of AI featuresAI is occasionally handy, usually weird Screen:6.3-inch, 1080p OLED, 120Hz /Processor:Tensor G4Cameras:48-megapixel f/1.7 with OIS, 13-megapixel ultrawide, 13-megapixel selfie /Battery:5,100mAh /Charging:23W wired, 7.5W wireless /Weather-resistance rating:IP68 Google’s Pixel A-series phones have been my go-to recommendation for a cheap Android phone for years, but there was still room for improvement. With the 9A, Google made some modest tweaks that make it even easier to recommend — and at $499, the price is right. The phone uses a Tensor G4 chipset that doesn’t run as hot as some of its predecessors, and performance is reliable. The 6.3-inch OLED screen is a little bigger and a bit brighter than last year’s, which makes a difference when you use the phone outside. Durability also got a small boost up to IP68, which means it can survive a drop in deeper water than the IP67-rated Pixel 8A. The 9A’s camera is fine, though it comes up short against the rest of the Pixel 9 series in low light. Portrait mode could be better, too, and if you care a lot about image quality, then that might be a good reason to consider stepping up to a Pixel 9. But it does the trick for everyday snaps, and for the price, the 9A’s better qualities outweigh its shortcomings by a wide margin. 6 Verge Score Excellent battery lifeGreat screen for the priceSix years of security updates No wireless chargingOnly splash-resistantFewer OS updates than Google and Samsung Screen:6.78-inch, 1264 x 2780 120Hz OLED /Processor:Snapdragon 8 Gen3Cameras:50-megapixel f/1.8 with OIS, 50-megapixel 2x telephoto, 8-megapixel ultrawide, 16-megapixel selfie /Battery:6,000mAh /Charging:80W wired /Weather-resistance rating:IP65 The OnePlus 13R isn’t quite as well-rounded as my pick for the best overall budget Android phone, the Pixel 9A. It’s also a little pricier at $599 — though we’ve seen it at $499 for extended periods of time — but for some people the 13R’s upgrades will make it a better choice. It comes with one of the bestbigscreens in its class, and lots of people love a big screen. The 13R also offers very strong battery performance; unless you’re a power user, you can probably manage two full days on a single charge. There’s also very fast charging with the included charger, though you won’t find wireless charging at any speed. The 13R also lacks full water resistance; it should hold up fine against spray and rain showers, but it isn’t rated to withstand full immersion. Plenty of people won’t find those omissions bothersome, but they make it harder to recommend to a general audience — especially at a higher price than the Pixel 9A.

They’re the kind of features you won’t really spot from the outside, but they’re important, particularly its IP67 rating for dust and water resistance. Unlike virtually every other phone at this price, the A35 5G is built to withstand water immersion, so you don’t need to sweat it if your phone lands in a toilet bowl or puddle. Here’s another unexciting spec: four years of OS updates and five years of security updates. That’s not the very best in the budget category — the Pixel 9A takes that honor with seven years of updates — but it’s much better than the two or three years we typically see in phones well under $500. The camera is lackluster; it’s fine in bright light but struggles in dim and mixed indoor lighting. It doesn’t have the strongest processing performance you can find under $500, either, and the Samsung-made Exynos processor occasionally stutters when quickly bouncing between tasks. I was horrified — horrified! — when I accidentally texted my husband one of the automatically generated replies because it popped up at the last moment as I was trying to tap on something else. These things don’t happen when everything loads quickly. But overall, it’s a compelling package — especially with a big, crowd-pleasing OLED display and strong battery performance. If you’re a light user and not fussy about camera quality, the A35 5G offers some upgrades that make a real difference in the long term.

Now it will ask people signing up for new accounts to only use more secure methods like passkeys, push notifications, and security keys instead, by default. The new no-password initiative by Microsoft is accompanied by its recently launched,optimized sign-in windowdesign with reordered steps that flow better for a passwordless and passkey-first experience. Although current accounts won’t have to shed their passwords, new ones will try and leave them behind by not prompting you to create a password at all: As part of this simplified UX, we’re changing the default behavior for new accounts. Brand new Microsoft accounts will now be “passwordless by default.” New users will have several passwordless options for signing into their account and they’ll never need to enroll a password. Existing users can visit their account settings to delete their password. With today’s changes, Microsoft is renaming “World Password Day” to “World Passkey Day” instead and pledges to continue its work implementing passkeys over the coming year. This time last year, the company implementedpasskeys into consumer accounts. Microsoft says it’s seeing “nearly a million passkeys registered every day,” and that passkey users have a 98 percent success rate of signing in versus 32 percent for password-based accounts.

A Pentagon inquiry is examining how classified information ended up on the Defense Secretary’s unsecured personal phone. byTina Nguyen The Pentagon Inspector General is expanding an inquiry into Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’squestionable Signal group chats. According to theWall Street Journal, the investigation is now also looking into a second chat, as well as exactly how classified information was transferred from a secure government computer onto Hegseth’s account on his personal devices. Beyond the “Houthi PC Small Group” that inadvertently added the editor-in-chief ofThe Atlanticmagazine to discussions about an upcoming military strike in Yemen, the existence of a second chat wasreported by theNew York Timesin April. According to theTimes, Hegseth sent the same information about the Yemeni strike to a chat called “Defense | Group Huddle,” which included his wife, brother, personal lawyer, and several personal friends. The Wall Street Journalreports, based on anonymous sources, that the inquiry is investigating who moved classified information off a secure government computer onto a personal device “moments” after it was sent. By design, it’s “impossible to quickly copy and paste information from a classified system to an unclassified one,” writes theJournal. Hegseth, a former Fox News anchor, has repeatedly downplayed the significance of the first chat but has remained relatively quiet about the second chat. President Donald Trump has publicly backed Hegseth, but on Thursday, Michael Waltz, the National Security Advisor who mistakenly added the editor to the group chat,was “purged” from the White Houseandreassigned as Trump’s Ambassador to the United Nations.

    "title": "Apple says tariffs will cost it at least $900 million this quarter",
    "article_text": "CEO Tim Cook reiterated that “the vast majority” of Apple’s products aren’t subject to global reciprocal tariffs — at least for the time being. CEO Tim Cook reiterated that “the vast majority” of Apple’s products aren’t subject to global reciprocal tariffs — at least for the time being. byChris Welch During Wednesday’s earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook went into the most detail yet on how the company is responding to the far-reaching US tariffs imposed by President Trump — and the potential impacts on its business. “Assuming the current global tariff rates, policies and applications do not change for the balance of the quarter and no new tariffs are added, we estimate the impact to add $900 million to our costs,” Cook said. “This estimate should not be used to make projections for future quarters, as there are certain unique factors that benefit the June quarter,” he clarified. Once the call moved on to the Q&A section, Cook expanded quite a bit further, and I’ve transcribed that entire answer below: For the June quarter, we do expect the majority of iPhones sold in the US will have India as their country of origin, and Vietnam to be the country of origin for almost all iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and AirPods products also sold in the US. China would continue to be the country or original for the vast majority of total product sales outside the US. If you look at the categories of tariffs that are applicable of us today, for the June quarter, most of our tariff exposure relates to the February IEEPA-related tariff at the rate of 20 percent, which applies to imports to the US for products that have China as their country of original. In addition, for China, there was an additional 125 percent tariff for imports of certain categories of products announced in April. For us, that’s some of our US AppleCare and accessories business, and brings the total rate in China for these products to at least 145 percent. Also, for transparency and clarity, the vast majority of our products including iPhone, Mac, iPad, Apple Watch, and Vision Pro are currently not subject to the global reciprocal tariffs that were announced in April, as the Commerce Department has initiated a Section 232 investigation into imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and downstream products that contain semiconductors. For the June quarter, as I talked about in my opening comments, we estimate the impact — assuming that the current global tariff rates, policies, and applications don’t change for the balance of the quarter — to be $900 million to our costs. I wouldn’t want to predict the mix of production in the future, but I wanted to give you clarity for the June quarter. So there you have it. It sounds as though Apple believes tariff costs might rise once those “unique factors” at play in the June quarter no longer apply, but the company isn’t yet confirming as much. “For our part, we will manage the company the way we always have, with thoughtful and deliberate decisions,” Cook said.

    "title": "Amazon’s CEO says the company can weather challenges from tariffs because of how big it is",
    "article_text": "‘We’re often able to weather challenging conditions better than others,’ says Andy Jassy. ‘We’re often able to weather challenging conditions better than others,’ says Andy Jassy. byJay Peters In Amazon’s Q1 2025 earnings call, CEO Andy Jassy touched on the potential impact of the Trump administration’s tariffs, and he seems to think that Amazon won’t be affected too harshly. People are “buying a lot of their everyday essentials at Amazon” and the company has “extremely large selections” and “hundreds of millions of SKUs,” Jassy says, which means that “we’re often able to weather challenging conditions better than others.” While “none of us knows exactly where tariffs will settle or when,” Jassy says that “we haven’t seen any attenuation of demand yet.” The company has also seen “some heightened buying in certain categories that may indicate stocking up in advance of any potential tariff impact.” And, according to Jassy, the “company hasn’t seen “the average selling price of retail items appreciably go up yet” and that “most sellers just haven’t changed pricing yet.” Here’s Jassy’s full statement on tariffs from his opening earnings remarks. I thought I’d share a few thoughts on the prospect of heightened tariffs on our stores business. Obviously, none of us knows exactly where tariffs will settle or when. We haven’t seen any attenuation of demand yet. To some extent, we’ve seen some heightened buying in certain categories that may indicate stocking up in advance of any potential tariff impact. We also have not seen the average selling price of retail items appreciably go up yet. Some of this reflects some forward buying we did in our first party selling, but some of that reflects some advanced inbounding our third party sellers have done. But a fair amount of this is that most sellers just haven’t changed pricing yet. Again, this could change, depending on where tariffs settle. Amazon is not uniquely susceptible to tariffs, as it relates to China, retailers who aren’t flying directly from China are typically buying from companies who themselves are buying from China, marking these items up, rebranding, and selling to US consumers. These retailers are buying the product at a higher price than Chinese sellers selling directly to US consumers in our marketplace, so the total tariff will be higher for these retailers than for China direct sellers. It’s also sometimes easy to forget what Amazon sells. We’re not mostly selling high average selling price items, though we certainly sell a bunch. In the first quarter, our everyday essentials grew more than twice as fast as the rest of our business, and represented one out of every three units sold in the US on Amazon. Even if you exclude Whole Foods Market and Amazon Fresh, Amazon is one of the largest grocers in the US with over $100 billion in gross sales last year. People are buying a lot of their everyday essentials at Amazon. We also have extremely large selections, hundreds of millions of unique SKUs, which means we’re often able to weather challenging conditions better than others. When there are periods of discontinuity, substantial, unexpected product trends emerge. Think about the pandemic, when items like masks and sanitizer became big sellers. When you have the broadest selection like we do, and two million plus global sellers like we do, you’re better positioned to help customers find whatever items matter to them and lower price points than elsewhere. Finally, when there are uncertain environments, customers tend to choose the provider they trust most. Given our really broad selection, low pricing, and speedy delivery, we have emerged from these uncertain arrows with more relative market segment share than we started, and better set up for the future. I’m optimistic this could happen again.

    "article_text": "The Osmo Pocket 3 used to be an incredible deal. The Osmo Pocket 3 used to be an incredible deal. bySean Hollister If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. We’ve called DJI’s baby steadicam “almost everything I wanted my iPhone camera to be” andone of our favorite gadgetsof 2023, but it’s just become a harder product to recommend. In April, DJI quietly hiked the US price of the camera from $519 to $619. Now, DJI has hiked the priceagain, officially listing the camera at $799 in the US. That’s a $280 price hike in just two months, a 54 percent increase, and the company says it’s not a mistake. “The price you saw today is the current price,” DJI spokesperson Daisy Kong tellsThe Verge. We’re seeing that US retailers have already updated their listings. DJI’s “Creator Combo” has risen in price even more. The kit, which adds loads of useful accessories including a modular extended battery handle and one of the company’s excellentMic 2 wireless lav microphones, is now listed at $979, up from the original $669 list price it had maintained before April. (It quietly rose to $799 around the beginning of April.) Is this the impact ofTrump’s tariffs on China? DJI is a Chinese company, after all, but it says things aren’t as clear-cut as that. Tariffs “are certainly among the key considerations,” the company tellsThe Vergeby email, but suggests it’s not the only factor. DJI did not say which other factors might be responsible — but it doesn’t seem to be demand, as these price increases are explicitly targeted at the United States despite high demand for the camera everywhere. In the UK, Europe, and Japan, we’re still seeing these gadgets listed at their original prices. (Last year, it was reported that the Osmo Pocket 3had become Japan’s best selling video camera.) “The Osmo Pocket 3 is one of the top-selling products in the history of DJI. Since its launch in 2023, its popularity has continued to grow and exceed expectations. We are constantly working to meet consumer demand in nearly every market. We attribute the product’s success largely to word-of-mouth recommendations, among both content creators and everyday people who want to film everyday moments,” reads a statement from DJI toThe Verge. Despite the higher prices, DJI’s cameras are not currently in stock at most US outlets. In fact, many of DJI’sdronesare not currently in stock in the US either. Even before Trump’s latest rounds of tariffs, DJI had been having trouble importing its items in the United States,as US customs has allegedly been blocking many of them. DJI did not answer whether tariffs might cause the company to stop shipping product to the US entirely, as some other Chinese gadget makers have. In February,I interviewed DJI about the future of its business in the United States, where it also faces a potential automatic ban on all its products starting in 2026. In our interview, it sounded like the company would be fine selling fewer products in the US if it had to. “DJI remains committed to the U.S. market and is closely monitoring recent challenges affecting product availability,” reads a statement from DJI toThe Vergethis week. “We are actively working to address and mitigate any influences and uncertainties, and to ensure products are accessible to our customers soon.” There is currently one intriguing and unorthodox way to get a DJI Osmo Pocket 3 Creator Combo for closer to its original price:Amazon will ship one to the United States from Germany for free. Just note Amazon is currently charging an extra $71 in estimated tax to cover the tariffs you need to pay — it’s showing me a grand total of $725.92 to buy the formerly $669 product. Amazon US is also tentatively offering the camera-only optionon backorder for $639, though that’s less of a deal. I use an Osmo Pocket 3 every single week to film chunks ofmyToday I’m Toying Withvideos, and I’m beginning to use it as a very high quality PC webcam thanks to its built-in webcam mode. I’d pay the $726… but $979 is a tougher ask. DJI does not yet seem to have increased the prices on drones or other products yet.

At least on this occasion, Apple’s revenue numbers weren’t top of mind for tech industry onlookers like they ordinarily would be. Still, overall revenue in fiscal Q2 2025 was $95.4 billion — a 5 percent jump compared to the year-ago quater — and services reached another all-time high. The iPhone, Mac, and iPad businesses all performed well thanks to new products; the iPad was particularly strong, with revenue up 15 percent year over year. In recent months, Apple has released hardware includingnew MacBook Airs, amore powerful Mac Studio, and therefreshed iPad Air tablet. Andthe iPhone 16E, designed to compete with lower-cost smartphones, debuted in February. But Apple’s software team has been going through a rough patch following a series of stumbles and embarrassments. The company’s attempts to build out its own artificial intelligence capabilities that rival OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and other leaders in the category have been slow going. In early March, long-promised improvements to the company’s Siri assistantwere delayed. Apple is rumored to be integrating Google’s Gemini to its Apple Intelligence software suite this fall to help keep pace. Meanwhile, the effect of President Trump’s tariffs are already reverberating across many industries, but Cook downplayed any major impactsin an interview with CNBC. He pointed to Apple’s well-distributed supply chain and manufacturing operation as a potential buffer. “If you look at the US, over half of the US sales of iPhone come from India,” he said. “If you look at the other products, Mac and iPad and AirPods and the Watch, almost all of the country of origin is Vietnam.” Much has been made about the possibility of Apple’s next iPhone lineup getting a price hike. “With an iPhone, you really have to go a step lower and look at the individual parts and where they come from,” he said. Apple is also navigating significant legal battles. In a Wednesday ruling, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers excoriated Apple executives including CEO Tim Cook for deliberately trying to limit and mollify a 2021 ruling intended to loosen the iPhone maker’s grip over the App Store. Apple has appealed Rogers’ order, but if it holds, companies including Epic, Spotify, and Patreon are planning to seize the opportunity to more freely sidestep Apple’s in-app payments and steer users to the web.

    "article_text": "After a slight delay, the company’s autonomous trucks are finally hauling freight. After a slight delay, the company’s autonomous trucks are finally hauling freight. byAndrew J. Hawkins After years of testing and validation,Aurora says its first fully autonomous tractor-trailers are operating on public highways in Texas. The company’s Class 8 trucks are now making customer deliveries between Dallas and Houston, having already completed 1,200 miles “without a driver,” Aurora said. The clients for these initial trips are Uber Freight, the ridehailing company’s trucking brokerage, and Hirschbach Motor Lines, a carrier that delivers time- and temperature-sensitive freight. Aurora CEO Chris Urmson said he rode in the backseat during the first truck’s inaugural ride, which he called “the honor of a lifetime.” “We founded Aurora to deliver the benefits of self-driving technology safely, quickly, and broadly,” Urmson said in a statement. “Now, we are the first company to successfully and safely operate a commercial driverless trucking service on public roads.” Aurora said it plans to expand its driverless service to El Paso and Phoenix by the end of 2025. Driverless trucks were once expected to precede robotaxis and personally owned autonomous vehicles in mass adoption, considering that highways are vastly less complex than city and residential streets. But self-driving truck operators have run into hurdles involving the technology and regulation that have delayed their public debut. Some companies, likeEmbark Trucks,TuSimple, andLocomation, have gone out of business, while others havecut plans to deploy driverless trucksas timelines have stretched into the future and funding has dried up. Moreover, public opinion toward autonomous vehicles hastrended downward, thanks in part to missteps ofcompanies like Tesla and Cruise. But like Waymo, Aurora has placed its hopes on a measured, conservative approach to commercialization, as well asan emphasis on safety. Founded in 2017 byalumni of Uber, Tesla, and Waymo, Aurora had planned to deploy its fully autonomous trucks in 2024. Butthose plans got delayeduntil this year, with the company continuing to tweak its autonomous system for surface-street driving and construction sites. Aurora says its technology presents a possible solution to the challenges currently facing the trucking industry, such as a trucker shortage, high turnover rates, and increasingly expensive operating costs. The company says its system can address these specific problems, while also reducing labor costs and heightening safety on the highway. Aurora has spent four years conducting supervised pilot hauls, mostly in Texas, where it delivered over 10,000 customer loads across 3 million autonomous miles. The company says it has also demonstrated capabilities, such aspredicting red light runners,avoiding collisions, anddetecting pedestriansin the dark hundreds of meters away. And it has forged partnerships with a bunch of leading players in the trucking industry, includingContinental,Volvo,Uber, and others. The need to start charging customers for deliveries is evident if you look at Aurora’s earnings.In its most recent report, the company reported a net loss of $748 million for 2024, down from $796 million the previous year. While the loss decreased, Aurora’s revenue estimates have declined. Aurora expects to report its first quarter earnings on May 8th.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 1, 2025 / 7:19 PM EDT/ CBS New York Luigi Mangione's defense team wants at least two counts against him in theNew York state indictmentthrown out. His attorneys filed a motion that includes photos ofMangione's arrest at a Pennsylvania McDonald's. Attorney Karen Agnifilo alleges evidence was illegally obtained, that terrorism charges don't apply, and the concurrent state andfederal prosecutionviolate the double jeopardy clause. Her filing argues his statements to law enforcement were unconstitutional because he wasn't given his Miranda rights, and that any evidence from his backpack should be suppressed because it was obtained without a search warrant. Agnifilo called it a \"legal tug-of-war between state and federal prosecutors\" and an \"unprecedented prosecutorial one-upmanship.\" As an alternative, Agnifilo wrote the court could temporarily halt the state case while Mangione's federal death penalty case plays out. Mangione is charged inthe murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The 26-year-old is accused of ambushing Thompson outside a Midtown hotel in December. So far, New York state prosecutors have not filed a response. Mangione faces 11 state charges, including murder and terrorism, in New York, as well as forgery and weapons charges in Pennsylvania. Federal prosecutors have also charged with stalking, a firearm offense, and murder through the use of a firearm. Federal prosecutors say they intend to seek the death penalty.

    "title": "Starbucks' latest strategic pivot involves less tech, more baristas",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 1, 2025 / 3:02 PM EDT/ CBS News Starbucks is rethinking the role of \"innovation\" in running a coffee chain. After rolling out a new system of technical enhancements to streamline cold food and drink orders, the company made an abrupt U-turn this week and said it would halt use of its automated equipment and restore the human touch by bringing more baristas on board. The reboot comes at a delicate time for the restaurant giant, which is under pressure to boost sales and revive a brand that haslost its luster with some customers. Although Starbucks remains profitable, its sales slowed last year. In the company's most recent quarter its revenues rose 2% to $8.7 billion, falling just short of Wall Street analysts' forecasts of $8.8 billion. In a bid to win back customers, starting in May Starbucks will expand its \"Green Apron service model\" which will involve hiring new baristas at thousands of locations and fine-tuning an algorithm to manage orders, CEO Brian Niccol said on a call with Wall Street analysts earlier this week. \"What we've learned over the last couple of months, specifically behind both the algorithm pilot and the labor pilot, is the combination of staffing, deployment and technology gives us the outcomes of a great customer connection experience as well as the right speed and throughput associated with what we want to achieve, both in-cafe, mobile order and drive-thru,\" Niccol said. Named after thetwin-tailed mermaidthat serves as the face of the company's branding, the Siren system is a series of hot and cold food equipment that Starbucks started rolling out in 2022 to \"make crafting beverages and food more straightforward\" for workers, according to the coffee chain's website. The Siren System is installed in less than 10% of U.S. company operated stores, according to a Starbucks spokesperson. Building on that platform, Starbucks unveiled the Siren Craft System in July 2024. The technology is aimed at streamlining beverage and food preparation, shortening wait times, and helping baristas deal with the daily flood of orders, including the speciality concoctions the coffee chain has become known for,accordingto Starbucks. Less than a year later, however, Niccol said the company will halt its deployment of the Siren tech and instead invest more in labor. Focusing on expanding its workforce, the company said, has proven more effective than implementing new tech when it comes to driving growth. \"It's not that we're not going to ever use the Siren system,\" Niccol said in the earnings call. \"It's just not something that we need to be rolling out across all 10,000 stores.\" Starbucks will bring more baristas on board this year at thousands of locations and allow employees to pick up extra shifts, the Starbucks CEO said. The company's hope is that small personal touches — like handwritten notes from baristas on their cups and ceramic to-stay mugs — will keep customers coming in the door and entice them to stay longer. \"What we're discovering is the equipment doesn't solve the customer experience that we need to provide, but rather staffing the stores and deploying with this technology behind it does,\" Niccol said. To be sure, Starbucks isn't turning its back on tech. While Siren is taking a backseat, the CEO also said the company is testing a new sequencing algorithm that has lowered drive-thru and in-store wait times to less than four minutes. Starbucksemploys around 361,000 workers worldwide, according toThe Associated Press. In February, the coffee chainannouncedit would lay off 1,100 corporate employees, about 7% of all its white-collar workforce. This did not include baristas who service the stores. Starbucks baristas earn an average of $19 an hour, according to a spokesperson. The company also offers health care, retirement and other benefits, distinguishing it from many retailers. \"When you factor in benefits, our comprehensive compensation package averages $30 per hour,\" the spokesperson said. Starbucks' automation push was part of a larger effort to draw more customers to its stores, known as the \"Back to Starbucks\" strategy. After enjoying years of rapid growth, the company's progress has stalled, with U.S. same-store sales slipping 2% last year. Looking for a refresh, the company in 2024 brought Niccol — a highly regarded restaurant industry veteran who as CEO of Chipotle had helped the fast-casual chain more than double its business — in as chief executive. In coming aboard in September, Niccolpromisedto elevate the in-store experience, reduce wait times and boost sales. \"It is clear we need to fundamentally change our strategy to win back customers and return to growth,\" Niccolsaidduring a call with analysts last year.

    "title": "U.S. releases image of cartel leader's jaguar while announcing sanctions",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 1, 2025 / 1:26 PM EDT/ CBS/AP The Trump administration on Thursday imposed economic sanctions on three Mexican nationals — including one accused drug lord with a fondness for exotic animals and luxury cars — and two Mexico-based entities involved in a drug trafficking and fuel theft network linked to Mexico'sJalisco New Generation Cartel. It is one of Mexico's most powerful cartels and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration says it has some 19,000 members in its ranks. The cartel developed rapidly into an extremely violent force after it split from the Sinaloa cartel after the 2010 killing of Sinaloa cartel capo Ignacio \"Nacho\" Coronel Villarreal by the military. The new sanctions against Jalisco New Generation, including top members Cesar Morfin Morfin (dubbed \"Primito\") and his brothers Alvaro Noe Morfin Morfin and Remigio Morfin Morfin, target the group'sfuel theft network. U.S. officials allege Primito is involved in the transportation and distribution of fentanyl, heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine and marijuana into the United States. \"Primito's luxurious lifestyle has included ownership of exotic animals and dozens of luxury vehicles,\" the Treasurysaid in a news release, while releasing an image of a jaguar allegedly seized from Primito by Mexican authorities in December 2023. The Treasury Department says that network has resulted in tens of millions of dollars in lost revenue to the Mexican government and also funds the flow of illicit fentanyl into the United States. The sanctions freeze any assets the individuals or companies have in the U.S. and prohibit U.S. citizens from doing business with them. The U.S. administration has made it a priority to combat that flow, which has been blamed for tens of thousands of overdose deaths every year. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement that his department \"will continue to use all available tools to relentlessly target drug cartels and foreign terrorist organizations to Make America Safe Again.\" Paul Anthony Perez, president of the National Border Patrol Council, said the sanctions actions \"will ensure that the cartels no longer have the ability to provide unlimited funds to further their criminal enterprises and allow the U.S. government \"to disrupt their daily activities on both sides of the border.\" In February, theadministration designatedJalisco New Generation as a Foreign Terrorist Organization and Specially Designated Global Terrorist.  The group has been accused of using fake job advertisements to lure new members and oftorturing and killing recruitswho resist. In March, a group of people looking for missing relatives foundcharred bones, shoes and clothingat a suspected training ground for the cartel. Thursday makes the eighth time the Trump Treasury Department has taken action against cartels. The Biden administration also imposed sanctions on the Jalisco New Generation group. The cartel is led by Nemesio Rubén Oseguera Cervantes, who is better known as\"El Mencho.\"Washington has offered a$15 million rewardfor information leading to his capture. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, when asked Tuesday about the fight against fuel theft and smuggling, said her party in Congress was working to strengthen the government's tools so there will be \"traceability\" when it comes to fuel shipments. \"So that any tanker truck carrying fuel, whichever kind, we know: where it came from; where it's going; if it's imported, with what import permit did it enter, where was it stored, and from there to which service station is it going to be taken,\" Sheinbaum said. \"If a tanker has stolen fuel from a pipeline and is stopped on the highway, it has to show where that fuel came from; if it doesn't, there's something illegal.\" Aman known as \"The Tank\"leads the cartel's fuel theft arm, supplying it with tens of millions of dollars a year by selling stolen gasoline through a network of seemingly legitimate businesses, according to the U.S. Treasury. The White House has linked fentanyl to President Trump's tariff plan, saying he wants \"to hold Mexico, Canada, and China accountable to their promises of halting illegal immigration and stopping poisonous fentanyl and other drugs from flowing into our country.\" © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "title": "Harris calls tariff war the \"greatest man-made economic crisis in modern presidential history\"",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 1, 2025 / 1:27 AM EDT/ CBS San Francisco Former Vice President Kamala Harris made her highly anticipated return to the public stage Wednesday in San Francisco, delivering her first major speech sincelosing the 2024 presidential electionto President Trump in the city where her political rise began. Harris gave the keynote address at the 20th anniversary gala forEmerge America, an organization that assists Democratic women in running for office. In her speech, which comes on the heels ofMr. Trump's 100th day in office, Harris took aim at her former opponent, saying that \"instead of an administration working to advance America's highest ideals, we are witnessing the wholesale abandonment of those ideals.\" Harris said that the Trump administration and his allies are \"counting on the notion that fear can be contagious. They are counting on the notion that if they can make some people afraid, it will have a chilling effect on others.\" Harris called Mr. Trump'strade warthe \"greatest man-made economic crisis in modern presidential history,\" describing the president's tariffs as \"reckless.\" Harris saidthe tariffsinstituted by the Trump administration have \"hurt workers and families by raising the cost of everyday essentials\" and are paralyzing \"American businesses, large and small, forcing them to lay off people, to stop hiring or pause investment decisions.\" She later added that \"the tariffs, as I predicted, are clearly inviting a recession.\" \"But please, let us not be duped into thinking everything is chaos. It may feel like that,\" Harris said. \"But understand: What we are, in fact, witnessing is a high velocity event, where a vessel is being used for the swift implementation of an agenda that has been decades in the making.\" Harris also touched on Mr. Trump's immigration crackdown, saying \"it is not OK to detain or disappear American citizens without due process.\" The Trump administrationhas faced ongoing controversyover the removal of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident who the Justice Department has admitted was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. The Department of Homeland Security last weekalso senta 2-year-old U.S. citizen to Honduras with her mother, who is undocumented. The former vice presidentpraised\"the courage of judges to uphold the rule of law in the face of those who would jail them,\" a reference to the federal arrest of a Wisconsin judge last week accused of obstructing immigration agents. Harris ended her speech by acknowledging that \"things are going to get worse before they get better,\" but called on Americans to \"stand together\" and \"gear up for the hard work ahead.\" \"Always remember: This country is ours. It doesn't belong to whoever is in the White House. It belongs to you. It belongs to us. It belongs to we the people.\" The former vice president focused her speech on criticizing the Trump administration, stopping short of announcing a run for California governor or any other office. With Gov. Gavin Newsomterming out of the governor's office in 2026, Harris' name has been floated as a possible candidate to become California's next chief executive.Some polling has shownHarris garnering strong support for a run. Harris has mostly kept a lower profile since the election. She was in attendance atMr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. Earlier in April, Harris attended the Leading Women Defined Summit event and gave a talk that possibly hinted at some of the themes she expanded on in Wednesday's speech. \"We're seeing people stay quiet. We are seeing organizations stay quiet. We are seeing those who are capitulating to clearly unconstitutional threats,\"Harris said.

    "title": "Senate vote aimed at blocking Trump's tariffs falls short",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 30, 2025 / 8:37 PM EDT/ CBS News Washington —An effort aimed at blocking President Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs in the Senate amid anxiety over how the wide-ranging tariffs could disrupt the U.S. economy fell short on Wednesday, with Senate Republicans largely united in their opposition. In a 49 to 49 vote, all but three Republicans opposed the measure, in a victory for the White House and GOP leadership in the Senate as the party seeks to remain united on the issue. Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, and Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, did not vote. \"Senator Whitehouse is on his way back from representing the United States at the Our Ocean summit, where he was the sole American official,\" a spokesperson for the Senator said in a statement explaining his absence. \"The Senator expressed America's continued support for the Blue Economy, climate solutions, fisheries, and maritime security, even as the Trump administration cedes leadership on the oceans to the rest of the world.\" The resolution, led by Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, would terminate the April 2 national emergency that the president is using to impose the tariffs, effectively blocking the sweeping levies on foreign imports. Along with Paul, Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska joined Democrats and independents in support of the measure, falling short of the majority needed for passage. The measure almost certainly wouldn't have been taken up in the GOP-controlled House, making the vote largely a symbolic one. The vote came after the president on April 2 announced a 10% baseline tariff on almost all U.S. trading partners while increasing levies on dozens of other countries. Days later, as investors appeared spooked, Mr. Trump announced a90-day pauseon most of his new tariffs, keeping the 10% baseline in place while raising the tariff rate on goods imported from China. Wyden told CBS News ahead of the vote of the measure's chances that \"this is a choice for senators.\" \"They've been home and they've heard from their constituents, like small businesses, that are getting clobbered by these tariffs,\" Wyden said. \"If they're going to listen to their constituents, we'll get their support, and if they're more concerned about Donald Trump being mean to them, they'll go with opposition.\" Paul admonished his fellow Republicans on the Senate floor ahead of the vote Wednesday, saying \"this should not be a partisan issue\" and noting that \"Congress didn't debate these tariffs, Congress didn't vote to enact these tariffs — the tariffs are simply imposed by presidential fiat.\" \"If Americans are to live under this emergency rule, it will not be because the president sought too much power,\" Paul said. \"It will be because Congress let it happen.\" Earlier this month, the Senate approvedanother resolutionto block Mr. Trump's tariffs on Canada, which fall under an earlier national emergency. At the time, four Republicans joined all Democrats and independents to support the measure — Murkowski, Collins and McConnell, along with Paul. The House did not vote on the measure. Mr. Trump had put pressure on Senate Republicans to oppose the measure, calling out the senators expected to support it by name. But those senators held fast in their opposition. Ahead of the vote this time around, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Vice President JD Vance joined the conference during their launch meeting on Tuesday, where senators said Greer told them the administration is making progress on trade deals. Meanwhile, House Republican leadership has takensteps to quashefforts to block Mr. Trump's tariffs. Earlier this month, Republicans included in a key piece of legislation a provision that would prevent members from forcing a vote to block the tariffs announced on April 2, after also doing so with the earlier tariffs. And any measure to roll back the tariffs would need the president's signature, leaving opponents in Congress with little likelihood of reining in his levies. House Speaker Mike Johnson said Wednesday that it isn't appropriate for Congress to \"jump in\" a handful of weeks into the administration's tariff policy, saying at an Axioseventthat \"the executive has a broad array of authority that's been recognized over the years\" on trade. But he suggested limited openness to stepping in down the road. \"If it gets close to where the imbalance is there, then we would step in,\" Johnson said, while adding that the first step would be for him to call the president to discuss the concerns. \"But right now I think ultimately this policy is going to achieve the desired outcome and it's going to be good for the country, and so we're applauding that.\" Still, anxieties continued to run high over the economic impact of the tariffs. And economic growth slowed in the first quarter of 2025, the Commerce Departmentreportedin its estimate of the nation's gross domestic product Wednesday. Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters Wednesday following the GDP report that \"the tariff issue is one that's probably going to take some time to realize the results and the benefits from.\" \"Overall, the things we're going to be doing to support a healthy economy, on taxes and regulations and energy, are going to have a positive impact long term,\" Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said. \"The tariff issue is something that's, like I said, it's an open question, but we're giving them some space to negotiate and see if they can get some good deals.\" Kaia Hubbard is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital, based in Washington, D.C. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "title": "Trump's deportation campaign is capitalizing on a key hallmark: Speed",
    "article_text": "A deportation flight carrying immigrantsto El Salvadortook off while a judge was ruling in the case. A mother of two U.S. citizens was sent to Honduras without speaking to anyone other than immigration officials.College students have been suddenlyarrested on city streets and sent to detention centers hundreds of miles away. The Trump administration’s promise to carry out the biggest deportation campaign in American history has a distinct and potent hallmark: speed. Officials have fast-tracked deportation proceedings so that some people are removed without speaking to an attorney, family members or without a court hearing at all. Trump’s immigration efforts have broken norms and bent the law as he enacts his agenda with dizzying fervor, seeking to show his supporters he’s delivering, even as the overall number ofdeportations in February laggedbehind Biden administration during the same period last year. “One theme that runs through all the Trump administration’s immigration actions this term is its attempt to rush people out of the country without due process or oversight by the courts,” said Lee Gelernt, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, who has argued some of the most high-profile immigration-related challenges to Trump during both terms. Trump’s first-term push to drastically reshape the nation’s immigration system was often stymied by the courts, slowed because of the officials around him or undone over a tide of public criticism. The president has been emboldened in his second term, surrounded by loyalists and governing a nation that has moved to the right on immigration. “This is a much more powerful presidency than I had the first time,” TrumptoldThe Atlantic in April.“The first time, I was fighting for survival and I was fighting to run the country. This time I’m fighting to help the world and to help the country.” Even as Trump slams individual judges publicly, he and his aides have stressed that they will abide by court rulings. Still, administration officials are testing that line. \"I can’t — I can’t have a trial — a major trial — for every person that came in illegally,\" Trump said this week in an interview with ABC News. In March, afterTrumpsigned an executive order invoking the Alien Enemies Act — a rarely used wartime power — to deport men alleged to be members of a Venezuelan gang, a federal judge during an emergency hearing ordered deportation flights to be turned around. But two planeloads of people were deported anyway, taken to a prison in El Salvador that has a history of human rights abuses.U.S. District Judge James Boasberghas since suggested that the deportations appeared to be designed to “outrun” the judicial system. A federal judge Thursday ruled Trump could not rely on the act to detain and remove migrants. White House officials argue that voters chose this agenda; Americans consistently reported immigration reform as a top priority.  More than 100 days into his presidency, the issue still resonates but adults were split, with 49% approving of his handling of border security and immigration and 51% disapproving, according to anNBC News Stay Tuned Poll, powered by SurveyMonkey. There is still a massive backlog of immigration cases, though Biden-era policies that allowed migrants to stay in the U.S. and work have been rescinded and asylum-seekers once again must wait for their cases across the border. Trump’s team is seeking to fast-track deportation cases so they don’t get bogged down this time by legal wrangling. “You’re not going to get an ounce of sympathy from this administration or President Trump,” Stephen Miller, Trump’s deputy chief of staff and arbiter of immigration policies, said Thursday. The administration has argued that it is not required to provide immigrants due process during arrest and deportation proceedings, citing rarely used provisions, including the Alien Enemies Act of 1789, said Muzaffar Chishti, director of the Migration Policy Institute at the NYU School of Law. The minimal requirement for due process, as defined by judges over time, “is that you know what you are being charged for, you have the ability to present the case against the charge, and you have the right to have a lawyer to that,” he said. By that definition, Chishti said, he doubted due process was met “in the speed with which they are executing these deportations.” In a Januaryinterviewwith NBC News, Trump’s border “czar,” Tom Homan, acknowledged that the administration’s mass deportation plans would include “collateral arrests” — immigrants without criminal records who are discovered as Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents search for targets. Homan said those with criminal records remain the priority, but anyone in the U.S. illegally should consider themselves a target. But some of these recent cases have involved undocumented immigrants arrested during a routine check-in with immigration officials, a significant escalation of the deportation efforts. According to the Department of Homeland Security, immigration officers had arrested 151,000 undocumented immigrants, far more than the Biden administration did during the same period last year. But overall deportations arelagging behindthose of the Biden administration during the same period last year. Trump officials say it’s because of a drastic drop in border crossings. But they’re looking to keep the pressure up in other ways — through brashness and high-profile arrests. And unlike his first term, when after widespread condemnation, Trump backed off the “zero-tolerance policy” that separated families who crossed the border to seek asylum, there has been no backing down, even as some efforts draw criticism. The administration has revoked more than 300 student visas; college students have been picked up, in some cases by masked immigration agents, and held in detention centers, sometimes a thousand miles from their homes with little warning and often with few details about why they were being detained. And last week in Louisiana, three U.S. citizen childrenfrom two families were removed from the country with their mothersamid public outcry. One of them is a 4-year-old with stage 4 cancer who was being treated in the U.S. Homan said Monday that officials sent the children because the mothers requested they depart with them. “This was a parental decision. Parenting 101. The mothers made that choice,” he said. Yet, Sirine Shebaya, the executive director of the National Immigration Project, which has been helping on the cases, insisted the mothers did not choose to have their children removed from the U.S. and that they were given no other alternatives. She said they were not told that “there were people on the outside saying they were ready to take their kids with them.” One of the women who was flown out with her 2-year-old U.S. citizen daughter is pregnant. Attorneys said she had a less than two-minute phone call with her husband that Immigration and Customs Enforcement abruptly cut off, so she could not arrange for her child to stay in the U.S.  She had been in the country a number of years and checking in with ICE regularly, Shebaya said. The second was deported with her 4-year-old son who has stage 4 cancer and her daughter, 7, both citizens.  Attorneys said the boy was sent out without access to his medications and treatment. The woman's attorney said she did not sign or write anything or give consent to her children being removed from the country with her. He said she wasn’t given a phone to call her attorney or family. Shebaya said normally, there’s time for people who are ordered to be deported to make a case to stay, and it’s highly unusual when children are involved not to make time for decisions to be made about the children. But both women had been ordered to be deported  after they failed to show for immigration appointments, making them targets for a faster deportation. The mother with the 2-year-old missed her appointment because she had been kidnapped while waiting in Mexico, said Mich P. González, co-founder of Sanctuary of the South, an immigration and LGBTQ civil rights cooperative, who represents her. She was eventually released. The second woman, who had been an unaccompanied minor at 13 and claimed asylum at the border, didn’t receive the notice for a hearing, González said. The administration is also ramping up its calls for undocumented immigrants to leave voluntarily — or risk being permanently barred from the country if immigration authorities find them first. Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, said the administration has given parents in the U.S. illegally the opportunity “to take control of their departure process with the potential ability to return the legal, right way and come back to live the American dream.” Linda Rivas, an immigration lawyer in El Paso, Texas, summed up the second-term agenda this way: “Law feels like a suggestion. Families and communities are terrified of what’s to come.”",

    "title": "Sean 'Diddy' Combs confirms he rejected plea deal ahead of sex trafficking trial",
    "article_text": "Sean “Diddy” Combs confirmed at a hearing Thursday that he hadrejected a plea deal from federal prosecutorsin his sex trafficking case, paving the way for his trial to begin next week. “Have you rejected the government’s offer?” U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian, who is overseeing his trial in New York, asked him. “Yes, your honor,” Combs replied. Combs, wearing olive-colored clothing over a white thermal shirt, carried a black binder with notebooks in it as he entered the courtroom and waved to supporters in the gallery before he hugged and shook hands with his attorneys. He haspleaded not guilty to charges of sex trafficking, racketeering and transportation to engage in prostitution. Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo said that Combs’ legal team discussed the offer with him and that together they decided to reject it. Assistant U.S. Attorney Maurene Comey said the proposal would have given Combs a lighter sentence than he would receive if he is found guilty at trial on all charges. The hearing was the last before the trial begins with jury selection Monday. Subramanian said voir dire, or the questioning of potential jurors, would be conducted in a way to protect jurors’ privacy, including possible disclosures about experiences with sexual or domestic abuse. Subramanian said he wanted to seat a jury of 12 and six alternates in three days. The court will call 50 jurors each day to the 26th-floor courtroom in Manhattan. Each juror will either be excused for cause or asked to return to the main courtroom for further questioning. The goal is to narrow the group to 45 people, who will each be interviewed separately with two attorneys from each side present. The court had requested 600 potential jurors. If prospective jurors want to speak privately, they will go into Subramanian’s chambers, where the media will be excluded, he said. The transcript for those parts would be sealed. Agnifilo had expressed concern that the media’s presence would prevent prospective jurors from speaking candidly. Given the amount of attention the case has received, particularly in recent days, Agnifilo asked the court to add a question to the juror survey, regarding a questionnaire already sent to prospective jurors: “Have you read anything since completing the questionnaire?” Subramanian agreed to do so. Comey said she understood the defense team had added two new attorneys and said prosecutors would like to know who they are. Agnifilo said that the new attorneys were in the courtroom, and that they would file their appearances by the end of the day. One of them is Xavier Donaldson, who has been present for several previous hearings. A prosecutor said at a hearing last week that Combs had been offered a plea deal, the details of which have not been made public. Subramanian asked all parties to be in his courtroom at 8 a.m. Monday and reminded them to avoid making public statements that could prejudice the trial’s outcome. The reminder came in response to a court filing this week, in which Combs’ attorneys asked Subramanian to bar lawyers for witnesses, including Douglas Wigdor and Lisa Bloom, who represent people who have filed separate civil suits against Combs, from speaking publicly about the trial until its conclusion. Combs attorney Teny Geragos said at Thursday’s hearing that Bloom had appeared on the BBC to try to bolster her client’s credibility. “It is deeply disturbing to us and could violate the rules of judicial conduct,” Geragos said. Bloom represents a John Doe and Dawn Richard, who was a member of two now-defunct groups formed by Combs, Danity Kane and a second one called Diddy — Dirty Money. Bloom told the BBC that Richard was “absolutely terrified” of Combs. “How hypocritical that Mr. Combs and his attorneys, having made public statements many times, now want to silence me,” Bloom said Thursday. “Accusers and their attorneys have every right to speak out. I am very proud to represent my brave clients, Dawn Richard and John Doe, in litigation against Mr. Combs. “I look forward to attending Mr. Combs’ upcoming criminal trial in New York and continuing to advocate for my clients consistent with the law and the ethical rules.” Richardalleged in a suit filed last year, a week before Combs was arrested, that he had groped and threatened her and that she had witnessed him assaulting his former longtime girlfriend Cassie, whose full name is Casandra Ventura.Richards’ suit is pending, along withdozens of others filed by men and womenaccusing Combs of sexual misconduct, which Combs has vehemently denied. Wigdor represents Ventura,whose bombshell lawsuitfiled in November 2023 preceded the federal raids of his home in March 2024 and criminal charges. Ventura accusedCombs of years of physical and emotional abuse andalleged that he forced her to have sex with male sex workers — encounters she said he called “freak offs” that were fueled by drugs and alcohol — while he masturbated and recorded them. Freak offs are at the center of the government’s case. Ventura and Combs settled the lawsuit within a day without disclosing the terms and with Combs denying any wrongdoing. Wigdor pledged to fight Combs’ efforts to prevent him from speaking publicly about the case. “We will vigorously oppose the motion seeking an extraordinary sweeping gag order as it is an obvious attempt at controlling and silencing victims and their counsel in contravention of well-established legal and ethical precedent,” he said in a statement. “Given this, it should come as no surprise that Combs fails to cite even one case to support his request.” Combs is alleged in the five-count indictment to have coerced and threatened women to participate in sexual acts and silenced them through blackmail and violence. Prosecutors allege he had help from a network of associates and employees.",

    "title": "Updated Covid vaccines for the fall may be in jeopardy under Kennedy's new rules",
    "article_text": "The anticipated rollout ofupdated Covid vaccinesthis fall might be at risk after a change by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in how vaccines are tested, experts say. Under the change by Kennedy, according to an HHS spokesperson, all new vaccines will need to go through placebo-controlled clinical trials — where some people get the actual shot and others get something inactive, like a saline shot — to compare the results. Running trials that include a placebo group is already routine for most new vaccines. The original Covid vaccines, from Pfizer and Moderna, approved in late 2020, went through placebo-controlled trials. Butas the viruscontinued to mutateand the vaccines needed to be updated to match the circulating strain, drugmakers moved to a flu vaccine-like model — usingsmaller studies to test how well the updated shots triggered an immune responseagainst the variant in question. Like the annual flu shot, the updated Covid vaccines weren’t treated as entirely new products, since they still used the same formula, with just a tweak to what strain the vaccine would be targeting. ThemRNA Covid vaccines were designed so that this change would be particularly easy to make, in the event the shots needed to be quickly updated. Quickly, in this case, turns out to be several months. In order to have enough Covid doses ready to go for the fall, vaccine-makers are told what strain to target in the spring. The Food and Drug Administration’s vaccine advisory committee is expected to meet in May or June to make a recommendation on which strains should be included in the next round of shots. A person familiar with the matter, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said the FDA had planned to schedule a meeting for May 22. An HHS spokesperson declined to comment on the meeting date. If the FDA deems Pfizer’s and Moderna’s updated vaccines “new” products, requiring fresh trials, it’s extremely unlikely the doses would be ready for the fall, experts said. Dr. Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the FDA's vaccine advisory committee, said the change would almost certainly delay the rollout of the updated shots from Pfizer and Moderna by “months,” as it would take time for the drugmakers to design the new trials and enroll participants. That would only be the start — the drugmakers would then have to run the actual trial, which would take several months on its own, at minimum, and analyze the results. Even the Covid vaccines — which were hailed as “the most successful government science program” because of how quickly they were developed, according to Dr. Alex Greninger, a professor of laboratory medicine and pathology at UW Medicine in Seattle — still took at least about six months to run their Phase 3 trials. The HHS spokesperson didn’t directly respond to a question about whether the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines would require new clinical trials. However, the spokesperson said in a statement that “FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary has indicated that significant updates to existing vaccines — such as those addressing seasonal strain changes or antigenic drift — may be considered ‘new products’ requiring additional clinical evaluation.” “As we’ve said before, trials from four years ago conducted in people without natural immunity no longer suffice,” the spokesperson said. “A four-year-old trial is also not a blank check for new vaccines each year without clinical trial data,” they said, adding that the flu shot would be exempt from the new rule, because it “has been tried and tested for more than 80 years.” The FDA has alreadydelayed the approval of Novavax’s updated Covid vaccine, requiring the company to carry out a new clinical trial because the strain included in the shot differs from what was originally authorized. Vaccine experts panned the new requirements. It’s “unethical,” Offit said, noting that it’s generally frowned upon in the scientific community to give someone a placebo when an approved product already exists that can protect them. Dr. Stanley Plotkin, a pediatrician who played a key role in developing the rubella vaccine, said the move would make “no sense.” “What would be reasonable is to compare the old vaccine with the new vaccine to see whether the new vaccine gives better immunologic responses,” Plotkin said. “We have vaccines against Covid, where we have pretty concrete ideas as to what works and what doesn’t work. We know they’re not perfect, but we have vaccines we know work.” Spokespeople for Pfizer and Moderna did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Former government officials have said HHS, under Kennedy,was moving to slow-walk vaccine approvals, including by imposing new regulatory hurdles on drugmakers, such as changing the requirements for approval or seeking additional clinical trial data. Vaccine experts also fear the rule change is part of a broader effort by Kennedy to sow distrust in vaccines and limit public access to them. “The goal is to make vaccines more onerous to make, more onerous to test by bringing up these sort of false safety concerns or false efficacy concerns,” Offit said. Dr. Sean O’Leary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases, said the change is unlikely to affect brand-new vaccines. But it could have major implications for vaccines that may require updates besides Covid — like those for RSV — since placebo trials are costly and take significantly more time to conduct. “It’s really not feasible, and would lead to lots of hospitalizations and deaths,” O’Leary said. Plotkin added that vaccines being developed for infections that are incurable, like HIV, may also be at risk. “Suppose you wanted to develop a new HIV vaccine?” he asked. “Would you do a placebo-controlled trial in that situation? I mean exposing children to a disease which is very serious without offering them anything.”",

    "title": "Meet the New England team working to rescue the seals",
    "article_text": "BLOCK ISLAND, R.I. — The Mystic Aquarium Animal Rescue Team has never been busier. Looking through binoculars, program manager Sarah Callan scanned the shoreline for a growing problem on Block Island — entangled seals. When fishing gear, garbage or a balloon gets wrapped around a gray seal’s neck, it tightens as the marine mammal — which can exceed 800 pounds — grows and lead to significant injury or death. Twenty entangled gray seals have been reported to the Connecticut-based nonprofit organization so far this year; that is more than what it typically documents in a full year. Callan called the spike “alarming.” NBC News was given rare access to follow Mystic, working in partnership with the Atlantic Marine Conservation Society and the Block Island Maritime Institute, as they set out to disentangle seals born in the last several months. Callan and her colleagues flanked a group of seal pups sunbathing on the water’s edge. They army-crawled in an attempt not to spook the herd before they sprinted in with bright red boards to separate the entangled pup and scoop him up with a net in a feat of speed and impeccable timing. Once the pup was contained, the team drew blood, attached a tracker for research and cut him free of the fishing net constricting his neck. “We’re going to be able to just release the seal today and avoid having to bring it into our clinic for rehab,” Callan said as the team worked. “The quicker we can get out here to disentangle them, the better.” This is the same team that took in awayward sealstranded in downtown New Haven, Connecticut, in February. The seal pup won over the internet with his big eyes and sweet cry, and the public even voted on his name, “Chappy.” Sadly, he didn’t make it, succumbing to gastrointestinal issues that were too severe to treat. In astatement posted online, Mystic also said it found pieces of plastic in his stomach, “highlighting the threat that marine debris, especially plastics, poses to marine animals.” Some estimates suggestplastic pollution kills more than 100,000 marine mammals every year. “The amount of animals that are interacting with human-made products and debris within the first couple months of their life is a bit alarming,” Callan said, “and it directly relates to the state of the ocean. ... We feel that it’s our job to help share that message and educate people on the threats they face.” It’s a mounting fight that Mystic isn’t giving up on. The team members cheered as the seal they just cut free from netting galumphed (the undulating motion seals use to move on land) back into the ocean. “You get to give an animal a second chance at life that they normally wouldn’t have without our intervention,” Callan said. “It’s such a special moment to see.”",

    "title": "HHS breaks with major U.S. medical groups in review of pediatric gender care",
    "article_text": "The Department of Health and Human Servicesreleased a reviewon Thursday that found that the quality of evidence regarding the effects of transition-related care for minors “is very low,” and that, as a result, many U.S. doctors have managed to unintentionally “fail their patients” by providing them with such care. “A central theme of this Review is that many U.S. medical professionals and associations have fallen short of their duty to prioritize the health interests of young patients,” the conclusion of the 409-page report states. The HHS review found that there is limited evidence regarding the effects of medical interventions for youth with gender dysphoria on “psychological outcomes, quality of life, regret, or long-term health.” At the same time, it found that “evidence for harms associated with pediatric medical transition in systematic reviews” is “sparse,” but said “this finding should be interpreted with caution” because there are no studies that track and report harms. It also sharply criticized the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, an internationalnonprofit made up of medical professionalsthat develops guidance regarding trans health care, arguing that its guidelines are biased and politically motivated. The HHS report alleges that WPATH has influenced U.S. medical associations to create a false perception that there is consensus regarding transition care for minors despite concerns from whistleblowers and detransitioners,or the relatively small number of peoplewho no longer identify as trans or regret transition care they received. The review also casts doubt on the increasing number of studies in recent years that have found a significant independent association betweengender dysphoriaand suicide, and onstudies thathavelinked accesstotransition caretoimproved mental health outcomesfor youth. The HHS review ultimately calls for psychotherapy as “a noninvasive alternative to endocrine and surgical interventions for the treatment of pediatric gender dysphoria” and for more research regarding the effects of exploratory psychotherapy on minors with gender dysphoria. The report marks the most recent escalation of the Trump administration’s efforts to roll back access to transition-related care and other rights for trans people. President Donald Trump issued several executive orders targeting trans people during his first weeks in office, including one declaring there are only two unchangeable sexes assigned at birth, another banning trans people from serving or enlisting in the military and one prohibiting federal funding for hospitals that provide transition care to minors. The order regarding trans care for minors,signed on Jan. 28, required HHS to publish a review of the existing literature on “best practices for promoting the health of children who assert gender dysphoria,” the medical term for the distress caused by the misalignment between someone’s birth sex and gender identity. The HHS review notes that it is “not a clinical practice guideline,” which is meant to help clinicians and patients make decisions about care, “and it does not issue legislative or policy recommendations.” However, the review could still affect access to transition care for minors nationwide by adding fuel to the political firestorm surrounding it. The review’s findings mark a significant break between the federal government and the stance of major U.S. medical associations — including theAmerican Medical Association, theAmerican Academy of Pediatricsand theAmerican Psychological Association— which support access to transition-related care for minors and oppose restrictions on it. As a result, the review was met with immediate backlash from medical associations and trans activists, who criticized its methods and lack of transparency. Most notably, HHS did not list any of the review’s authors in what appears to be a break with protocol, as the names of authors are generallyrequired to be includedon any scientific publication. “While this is a systematic review of the literature on this subject executed by experts in the field, the credibility of this report plummets in the mind of many folks in the scientific and medical communities because those experts are not named anywhere,” said Dr. Morissa Ladinsky, a clinical professor of pediatrics at Stanford University’s medical school. She added that a scientific report of this kind generally also lists the names of the experts who peer-reviewed it, and this review does not. It’s unclear if the entire report was peer-reviewed or only a portion of it.A news releaseissued by HHS on Thursday states: “Chapters of this review were subject to peer review prior to this publication, and a post-publication peer review will begin in the coming days involving stakeholders with different perspectives.” Ladinsky said that is highly out of the ordinary, and that post-publication peer review generally only happens when there has been “serious doubt cast” on the findings of a study or report. Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for HHS, said the department \"stands firm in its decision to withhold the names of the contributors to this report in order to protect them from intimidation tactics and undue pressure campaigns.\" He added, \"These tactics aim to stifle thoughtful, evidence-based analysis, preventing contributors from making independent judgments and engaging in honest peer reviews.\" He said the contributors' names will be shared after the post-publication peer review is conducted. Susan J. Kressly, the president, American Academy of Pediatrics, said the organization is “deeply alarmed” by the report. “For such an analysis to carry credibility, it must consider the totality of available data and the full spectrum of clinical outcomes rather than relying on select perspectives and a narrow set of data,” Kressly said in a statement. “This report misrepresents the current medical consensus and fails to reflect the realities of pediatric care.” The review also promotes “exploratory psychotherapy,” which refers to talk therapy as an alternative treatment to puberty blockers or hormone therapy. In this kind of therapy, therapists try to help youth “come to terms with their bodies,” according to the review, or accept their birth sex. Some of the nation’s largest LGBTQ advocacy organizations — including GLAAD, an LGBTQ media advocacy organization, and The Trevor Project, an LGBTQ youth suicide prevention and crisis intervention organization — as well as medical experts who specialize in research regarding care for LGBTQ youth said “exploratory psychotherapy” is often another way of referring to “conversion therapy,” or a discredited practice that attempts to change someone’s sexual orientation or gender identity. “This is the argument they have been using for decades, and really it’s conversion therapy light,” said Doug Haldeman, a psychologist and professor of clinical psychology at John F. Kennedy University. “We are in an era where the administration has made it clear from the very first day that their wish is to erase trans identity altogether.” Haldeman, who is also the author of “The Case Against Conversion ‘Therapy’: Evidence, Ethics, and Alternatives,” said there isyears of researchshowing that trying to get trans people to “accept” their birth sex has negative mental health outcomes. The HHS review pushes back on equating “exploratory” therapy with so-called conversion therapy, arguing that all psychotherapy is “exploratory by definition.” The review also mentions multiple “whistleblowers,” or people who previously helped provide care to trans youth who have since denounced such care. It mentions Jamie Reed, a former case worker at the Transgender Center at the St. Louis Children’s Hospital, who alleged in a23-page affidavitthat children were being routinely prescribed puberty blockers or hormone therapy without “appropriate or accurate” mental health assessments. Her allegations were used by state lawmakers in support of legislation that eventually barred gender-affirming care for minors in the state of Missouri. The review says that the concerns of whistleblowers have been “discounted, dismissed, or ignored by prominent advocates and practitioners of pediatric medical transition.” Reed said that, “as a named whistleblower in the report, and as a lesbian myself with insider knowledge of this field, I wholeheartedly agree with the conclusions” of the review. “Gender medicine has been gay conversion therapy since the beginning,” Reed said in a statement to NBC News. “The HHS review shares that history and concludes the practice raises ‘serious justice-related concerns’ because of the overrepresentation of LGB youth among patients. As a lifelong Democrat, I believe it is high time for bipartisan support to acknowledge the findings of this report.” Ladinsky previously practiced as a pediatrician in Birmingham, Alabama, for 10 years, where she treated hundreds of trans adolescents until the state passed a ban on transition care for minors in 2022. The state is one of 25 that have enacted such restrictions. “All of us on the front lines will tell you that in these 25 states where elements of the care is banned, we have yet to learn of one young person who is no longer transgender,” Ladinsky said.",

    "title": "Harvey Weinstein's lawyers try to poke holes in Miriam Haley's testimony during cross-examination",
    "article_text": "Harvey Weinstein’s defense team on Thursday deployed a pit bull lawyer with a history of defending notorious men to try and poke holes in the testimony of a former “Project Runway” production assistant who has accused the Hollywood mogul of sexually assaulting her twice. When Miriam Haley took the stand for the third day, defense attorney Jennifer Bonjean, who is known for representing accused sex predators Bill Cosby and R. Kelly, grilled her about the jet-setting lifestyle that gave her access to celebrities like Weinstein. During her questioning, Bonjean got Haley to say that she didn’t give reporters a complete picture of her complicated relationship with Weinstein after she first came forward with allegations that the Hollywood heavyweight had performed forcible oral sex on her in June 2006 and then, a month later, raped her. “I told the part that was relevant,” Haley said when Bonjean asked if she had told the press about friendly email exchanges she had with Weinstein over the years following the alleged 2006 assault. A key detail in Haley’s testimony on Wednesday was that she had had her period during the time Weinstein allegedly assaulted her in 2006. During questioning from Bonjean, Haley said that she didn’t remember “exactly” when she got her period in 2006 after the defense attorney showed Haley her calendar, where the former assistant sometimes tracked the start date of her period by writing “P.” Haley testified that there was no “P” indicated in the months of January, February and April but there was “something in March that may be a ‘P’.” She said she didn’t always remember to add it to her calendar and that she “skipped” her period some months, adding that she doesn’t have a clear memory of her cycle from that year. Bonjean focused on this detail a day after Haley, in graphic detail, told the court Weinstein was not deterred during the first alleged assault when she told him she was having her period. Haley is expected to field more questions from Bonjean about the alleged assaults when court resumes on Friday. Weinstein is on trial again after the New York State Court of Appeals last year overturned hislandmark2020 convictionfor sexually abusing young women which defined the #MeToo movement and helped turn the Oscar-winning producer into a pariah. Bonjean was enlisted to be part of Weinstein’s defense team partly because she helped get Cosby’s conviction for aggravated indecent assault overturned in 2021. But after Friday, Bonjean will no longer be representing Weinstein because she has to appear in a Brooklyn court next week for another case she is defending. Weinstein is charged with one count of engaging in a criminal sex act in connection with Haley’s allegations that he forcibly performed oral sex on her in June 2006. He is also charged with one count of third-degree rape for allegedly assaulting actress Jessica Mann in 2013. Both women were part of Weinstein’s first trial and Mann is also expected to testify in his retrial. New to the retrial is an additional charge of engaging in a first-degree criminal sexual act for the alleged assault of a Polish former model namedKajaSokola. Sokolaclaimedin a lawsuitthat she was 16 when Weinstein in 2006 performed oral sex on her without her consent at a Manhattan hotel. She, too, is expected to testify at Weinstein’s retrial. Weinstein, 73, has denied assaulting Haley, Mann and Sokola. Prosecutors contend that Weinstein used his Hollywood clout to prey on young women like Haley who were searching for jobs in the TV and film industry — and to silence them after the alleged assaults. Haley, whose testimony at the retrial has largely been a reprise of the testimony she provided in 2020, has already testified that she reached out to Weinstein because she wanted his help finding a job. She has also testified that she did not report the assaults to the police or cut ties to Weinstein immediately after the assaults because she feared what he would do to her professionally. But, under questioning from Bonjean, Haley acknowledged that Weinstein was not the first producer she tapped for job connections. She recounted that she had previously worked for British film and theater producer Michael White, and that, through White, Haley met numerous “A-listers” like rock stars Mick Jagger and Paul McCartney, as well as actor Jack Nicholson. Weinstein’s lead attorney,ArthurAidala, has insisted from the start of the retrial that his client’s sexual encounters with the accusers were “transactional” and “consensual.”",

    "title": "Why Trump waited to make his move on Mike Waltz: From the Politics Desk",
    "article_text": "Welcome to the online version ofFrom the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail. In today’s edition, Jonathan Allen breaks down President Donald Trump’s decision to remove Mike Waltz from his post as national security adviser and nominate him to an ambassadorship instead. Plus, Gabe Gutierrez and Suzanne Gamboa identify the defining theme of Trump’s mass deportation agenda. Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here. — Adam Wollner President Donald Trump could havebooted national security adviser Mike Waltz from his postat any time since the Signalgate scandal broke in March. To review, Waltz and his team let a journalist, Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic, into a private chat among national security officials about U.S. strikes against the Houthis in Yemen. Trump doesn’t seem particularly upset about Cabinet members and top White House aides using a commercial application to communicate about sensitive government information. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth alerted his colleagues to attack plans in the Signal chat, and Trump has given no indication that the Pentagon chief is on the hot seat. Waltz’s sin wasn’t about evading record-keeping laws or leaving military planning visible to the wrong eyes. It was about letting a journalist in — and, in doing so, losing Trump’s trust. Trump let the story burn slowly before deciding to heave Waltz into a soft landing as his nominee for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. After all, it was in the midst of the Signalgate furor that Trump withdrew New York Rep. Elise Stefanik’s nomination to the U.N. job. He had suddenly become worried that there would not be enough Republicans in the House to pass the “big, beautiful bill” for his agenda. The delayed timing of the maneuver matters for at least two reasons. First, by waiting until the story blew over, Trump gave himself room to argue that he wasn’t forced into it by criticism from Democrats and Waltz’s adversaries within the administration. But perhaps more importantly, the inside-baseball switcheroo — one that doesn’t affect most Americans’ day-to-day lives — comes at a time when Trump could use a distraction from a mudslide of tough economic news. It’s true that the inflation rate has slowed a little since Trump took office, but he failed to eliminate inflation — a key campaign promise — upon being sworn in. Moreover, with his tariffs threatening to dry up supply and drive up prices, the U.S. economy shrank in the first three months of the year. Trump and his allies have struggled to explain why his election did not immediately improve national economic conditions. In what might be called a dollhouse austerity pitch, Trump said this week that instead of 30 dolls, American childrenmight have to make dowith just two dolls. Extending that metaphor, his deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, told reporters at the White House on Thursday morning that consumers will be willing to spend more for an American-made doll — one produced with stronger safety regulations — than a cheaper Chinese-made one. For a president elected on his vow to ease the suffering of American consumers, the short-term pain message shows how twisted he has become around the double helix of that promise and a tariff program that makes it harder to fulfill. The Waltz news served to distract the national media from the economy storyline for a full day. Perhaps the broader implications of the move, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio adding Waltz’s job to his portfolio, will put focus back on Trump taking action — rather than sitting back and watching the economy gasp for air — for a few days. It’s no shock that Trump wanted to remove Waltz from his job. It made a lot of political sense for him to wait. A deportation flight carrying immigrants to El Salvador took off while a judge was ruling in the case. A mother of two U.S. citizens was sent to Honduras without speaking to anyone other than immigration officials. College students have been suddenly arrested on city streets and sent to detention centers hundreds of miles away. The Trump administration’s promise to carry out the biggest deportation campaign in American history has a distinct and potent hallmark: speed. Officials have fast-tracked deportation proceedings so that some people are removed without speaking to an attorney, family members or without a court hearing at all. Trump’s immigration efforts have broken norms and bent the law as he enacts his agenda with dizzying fervor, seeking to show his supporters he’s delivering, even as the overall number of deportations in February lagged behind the Biden administration during the same period last year. Trump’s first-term push to drastically reshape the nation’s immigration system was often stymied by the courts, slowed down because of the officials around him, or undone over a tide of public criticism. The president has been emboldened in his second term, surrounded by loyalists in a nation that has moved to the right on immigration. “This is a much more powerful presidency than I had the first time,” Trumprecently told The Atlantic. “The first time, I was fighting for survival and I was fighting to run the country. This time I’m fighting to help the world and to help the country.” Even as Trump slams individual judges publicly, he and his aides have stressed that they will abide by court rulings. Still, administration officials are testing that line. “I can’t have a trial — a major trial — for every person that came in illegally,” Trump said this week in an interview withABC News.

    "title": "Pittsburgh Pirates 'devastated' by fan's fall during winning late-inning rally",
    "article_text": "ThePittsburgh Pirates were left reelingbya fan's scary fallonto the playing surface at PNC Park, which quickly turned a moment of joy into “devastated” concern, veteran outfielder and team leader Andrew McCutchen said Thursday. Just after McCutchen'sdramatic two-run doublegave the Pirates a 4-3 lead in the seventh inning Wednesday night, a fan spilled over the Roberto Clemente Wall in right field and appeared to lie motionless before first responders rushed him to the hospital. \"We're devastated of the situation that took place yesterday,\" McCutchen said Thursday. \"So we all came in here together as a team after the game and said a prayer for him. We hope the best for him and his family. \" McCutchen, one of the team's most popular players, said he hopes the man's loved ones know that players are concerned. \"We’re all thinking about him and just praying for the best for him,\" McCutchen said. \"I hope he pulls through. And yes, it was a tough situation. So yeah, we’re definitely thinking about him.\" The fan was identified Thursday as standout high school football player Kavan Markwood, a spokesperson for the South Allegheny School District said in a statement. He is 20, according to public records. Markwood, who graduated from South Allegheny High School in 2022, was named team MVP and earned first team all-conference honors, the spokesperson said. \"Kavan is best known for his resilience, strength, and kindness,\" the spokesperson said. \"He is a friend to all — someone who lifts others up and faces challenges with courage and grace.\" Markwood remains hospitalized in serious condition, according to the statement. The shocking moment was captured in viral video by fan Bobby Ketter, who didn't immediately know what he had recorded. Ketter was at the game with his father, celebrating his dad's recovery from a stroke, and they were cheering for McCutchen's big hit. \"It was a couple minutes before I really realized that I had the video,\" he told NBC News on Thursday. \"Then next thing you know, people are pounding, piling around me and watching it over my shoulder. And that’s when we all realized what happened.\" Ketter said he was struck by the sudden quiet of what had been wild cheers coming from the11,297 paid fans. \"It was eerie silence,\" he said. \"You saw the players taking a knee. You could see the gentleman on the warning track, and he has shut off, and everyone’s very confused.\" Ketter praised medical personnel who acted fast: \"You know what honestly? Shoutout to PNC Park. The EMS, they were quick, were right there.\" While law enforcement is investigating, the fall is believed to have been an accidental, not a criminal act, Pittsburgh Public Safety said in a statement.",

    "article_text": "WASHINGTON — Emily Stenson’s life changed forever when she learned that her daughter, Charlie, then 3, had stage four germ cell cancer. Charlie, now 5, is cancer-free. But the clinical trials sponsored by the National Institutes of Health that Stenson says saved her daughter’s life are at risk, with the Trump administration weighing whether to slash billions more in funding and fire hundreds of scientists from the agency in an effort to downsize the federal government. “Her life was saved from research,” Stenson said in an interview. “The trials provided us with the drugs that were needed to save her life. Another trial provided us with an option to preserve her fertility if she wants to be a mom when she grows up.” Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who chairs the powerful Appropriations Committee tasked with managing the federal budget, slammed the administration Wednesday as she gaveled in an oversight hearing on the subject. “These actions put our leadership in biomedical innovation at real risk and must be reversed,” Collins said. Collins said in an interview before the hearing that the administration needs a “surgical approach, not a sledgehammer,” when it comes to the NIH. “I think it’s better that Congress make it really clear in our legislation, in our appropriations bills, that we want the funding to be there, that we don’t want arbitrary caps, and that we want to be more efficient. There may be some savings that make a great deal of sense, but we’ve got to be careful,” Collins said.",

    "article_text": "A suspect was arrested on a boat in a South Carolina beach town, hours after three pedestrians were struck and the driver ran away armed with a knife, Isle of Palms police said. Two children and an adult were injured a little before 1 p.m. on Sullivan's Island, a coastal community near Charleston that is adjacent to Isle of Palms, said Sgt. Matthew Storen, an Isle of Palms police spokesperson. \"The suspect has been arrested. He is in custody. The area is now safe,\" Storen toldNBC affiliate WCBDof Charleston late Thursday afternoon. \"He was found on a boat.\" There was no struggle in the arrest, Storen said. Police identified the suspect as Justin Collin Adams. Sullivan’s Island Police Chief Glenn Meadows said at a news conference that he would not comment on the charges and that he has asked the Charleston County Sheriff's Office to lead the criminal investigation. Police arrested Collins minutes before 6 p.m. after he was spotted by a helicopter, Meadows said. He did not comment on whether the crash was believed to have been intentional or accidental, citing the investigation. None of the injuries were life-threatening. The adult and one child were taken to the hospital after the crash, and the other child was treated at the scene and released to parents, police said. One of those taken to the hospital had been released by Thursday evening, and the second was due to be released, Meadows said. \"We’re thankful that those injuries were not as serious as we thought they were going to be,\" he said. Calls about the wreck on Sullivan's Island came in around 12:50 p.m., police said. The FBI and the U.S. Marshals Service were among the agencies that assisted in the investigation and the search for the driver, Meadows said. Checkpoints had been set up during the manhunt. Collins was at the sheriff's office Thursday evening being interviewed \"to determine why this happened, what went on and what charges,\" Charleston County Sheriff Carl Ritchie said. \"So we don't have those yet, what charges we're going to make,\" he said. \"But there will be charges, obviously.\" Sullivan's Island is a town of around 1,800 on the Atlantic coast around 5 miles outside Charleston and next to Isle of Palms.",

    "title": "Deported mom says she never had the option to take her 17-month-old daughter with her",
    "article_text": "Heidy Sánchez was so distraught that she got on the rooftop of a house in Havana to get Wi-Fi connection and send her daughter a bedtime lullaby via WhatsApp. The Tampa-area mother was deported to Cuba last week without her 17-month-old U.S.-citizen daughter, who has a history of seizures and was still being breastfed, she and her lawyers told NBC News. “My daughter tells me over the phone, ‘Come, mama.’ And when she cries, she just keeps saying, ‘Mama, mama, mama.’ It’s overwhelming ... I can’t even sleep at night,” Sánchez said by phone from Havana. Sánchez’s case illustrates the stepped-up pace of deportations of immigrants who don’t have criminal charges or convictions, even though President Donald Trump said during his election campaign the focus would be on deporting violent criminals. Sánchez’s deportation occurred around the time two other mothers weredeported to Honduraswith their U.S. citizen children, including one with stage 4 cancer. In those two cases, attorneys have said the mothers wanted their children to stay in the U.S. but were not allowed to make the arrangements. In the case of Sánchez, she said everything happened very fast. “They never gave me the option to take my daughter,” said Sánchez. Her attorneys said the same. ICE did not respond to a request for comment on the case, but the administrationhas said in previous commentsthat deported parents have been given the choice to take their children or not. Sánchez said her daughter starting having seizures three months ago and is seeing a neurologist in the Tampa area. Her daughter’s bedtime routine consisted of breastfeeding, lullabies and then sleeping together in bed. Now her daughter just cries, Sánchez and her husband, Carlos Valle, said in separate interviews. Valle, who's a naturalized U.S. citizen,  remains in Tampa with their child. Sánchez was scheduled to check in at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Tampa on April 30, but her appointment was bumped up, her Miami-based attorney, Claudia Cañizares, said. Sánchez went to the appointment with her daughter and Cañizares’ associate in Tampa, while Valle, Sanchez’s husband, waited outside because he was not allowed in the room. At the appointment Sánchez was informed she was being detained and she needed to arrange for someone to pick up her child.  According to Sánchez and the attorneys, Sánchez started crying, saying she couldn’t leave her baby. The officers told her the child could visit her in Cuba. The child was handed to the attorney who was in the room and she carried her outside to her father. According to the attorneys, the officers didn’t let Sánchez say goodbye to her husband or give the baby to him. When Valle asked if he could say goodbye, they told him no and said he had to leave. Valle said he does his best to console his daughter. He has reached out to members of Congress seeking help to bring Sánchez home. Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Fla. sent a letter to Trump, which was shared with NBC News, asking for the return of Sánchez to the U.S. Valle will meet with Castor’s office on Friday. The office of Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., responded with a letter, viewed by NBC News, which stated that “our office is unable to assist you in this legal matter” and suggested Valle speak with a private attorney. Cañizares said she was given the “run-around” when she found out Sánchez had been detained on Tuesday and was working to file a stay of removal on humanitarian grounds so she wouldn’t be deported. “It’s very taxing and very overwhelming,” Cañizares said, adding she couldn’t contact Sánchez or confirm her exact whereabouts. She said when her firm went to file documents on Thursday she was told Sánchez had already been removed from the country, though she thinks she was still there and deported later. “It’s very scary because we have rule of law, and as an attorney I have to abide by those rules,” said Cañizares. “But if the government is not abiding by those rules, then what can I do? Sánchez applied for U.S. asylum in 2019 during Trump’s first administration. Under his “Migrant Protection Protocols,” asylum-seekers had to wait in Mexico for their hearings in U.S. immigration court. Sánchez said she missed her scheduled hearing in the U.S. because at the time she was required to wait in Nuevo León, Mexico, where she said it was too dangerous to cross the international bridge at 4 a.m. Because of her missed hearing, she was ordered deported in absentia. But she later went to the port of entry and was allowed into the U.S.; she was placed in detention for nine months and later released under ICE supervision with regular check-ins. Sánchez’s husband is a naturalized U.S. citizen who is also from Cuba. He was in the process of trying to get Sánchez a green card. Cañizares is considering requesting humanitarian parole for Sánchez, though she acknowledged it’s “going to be a stretch,” because she has an order of removal that's already been executed. Other processes being considered are complex and could take years. “The only thing we are asking for is to be reunited once again,” said Sánchez. “We’re not asking for money. We’re not asking for food ... our daughter is suffering. She is the most affected one and that scares us. We hope this message reaches the pertinent people.”",

    "title": "Growing GOP fight over 'SALT' tax deduction complicates Trump agenda bill",
    "article_text": "WASHINGTON — Republicans are at loggerheads over the fate of a controversial tax deduction that is critical to winning enough votes in the House to passPresident Donald Trump’s legislative agenda. After a week of meetings and discussions, Republicans still haven’t settled on how to handle the state and local tax deduction, also known as “SALT,” which allows filers to deduct up to $10,000 in taxes paid to state and local governments. Before the House adjourned for the week on Thursday, GOP lawmakers on opposite ends of the spectrum continued to snipe over whether to raise that $10,000 maximum imposed by the 2017 Trump tax cuts. Pro-SALT Republicans insist it’s not enough to lift the cap to $15,000 for individuals and $30,000 for married couples. Party leaders are looking at a higher cap, nixing the “marriage penalty” and potentially an income threshold to limit the deduction to the middle class, according to lawmakers and sources with knowledge of the talks. There is no consensus in the GOP’s narrow House majority. It is a sensitive topic after several Republicans in high-tax areas lost their re-election races in 2018 after backing the 2017 tax law that imposed the $10,000 cap. A new crop of GOP lawmakers has since won re-election by promising to raise that cap, but doing so would be expensive and complicate the rest of the bill, which also seeks to boost funding for immigration enforcement and the military, as well as raise the debt limit. SALT is one of many contentious issues in the package, but it is the most unique. Many Republicans — across ideological lines — care little about the deduction and would be content to avoid expanding it. But there is no path to passing a bill without catering to the roughly dozen Republicans in New York, New Jersey and California who have made it a red line. Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., the only “SALT Caucus” member who serves on the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, said she had briefed her fellow committee members Thursday morning about negotiations following a SALT-focused meeting a day earlier with Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. While there is no deal on numbers yet, Malliotakis said discussions include limiting the SALT deduction to families making less than $400,000 per year. She said the new cap could be boosted to slightly higher than $25,000. “There is general consensus that we have no interest in supporting millionaires and billionaires, and this needs to be targeted relief for middle class families,” Malliotakis, who represents Staten Island and part of Brooklyn, told reporters. “That’s what this comes down to — what number can provide the most relief for middle class families that is acceptable to other members of the conference.” She said the issue wouldn’t be resolved this week, but sounded optimistic that they will ultimately get “something real approved by the committee.” “We are going over all of the menu of options,” Malliotakis said, “and eventually we will get to the right number.” If Trump’s tax cuts expire, the SALT cap would reset to infinity, at a cost of$1.2 trillionover a decade, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a Washington research group that advocates for lower deficits. GOP leaders want to contain the price tag of any SALT policy to make room for other priorities. The Ways and Means Committee still hasn’t released the text of its bill or scheduled a hearing to vote on sending it to the floor, although House GOP leaders want it to happen next week to stick to their schedule of passing the entire package out of the chamber by Memorial Day. Democrats are guaranteed to attack SALT limits imposed by Republicans as an attempt to raise taxes on residents of blue states, which hold enough swing districts to decide control of the House. “I don’t think there’s any magic number where it’s not a fertile attack line for Democrats, so at a certain point SALT members just have to take yes for an answer,” said Liam Donovan, a lobbyist and former GOP aide, who said the cap is likely to end up above $10,000 but well short of the $100,000 pro-SALT members appear to want. “To me, the best way to indemnify yourself politically is to make the number as big as possible but with an income phase-out,” he said. “Hard to attack Republicans if you can’t claim it hurts middle class families. The poster child is ostensibly the cop or firefighter who has a big property tax bill, which is a relatively cheap and easy problem to fix.” Conservative Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said he opposes the SALT deduction and criticized his colleagues for pushing it. “We shouldn’t have such high local taxes and the federal government shouldn’t subsidize it. So I’m not all that interested in hearing about my blue-state colleagues complaining about it,” Roy said, while adding that he’s only willing to accept a higher SALT cap if it is offset with spending cuts. “You have to figure out how to get a deal done. So if the math adds up and we’re doing enough on the spending restraint side and the tax policy works out and SALT goes up a little, whatever, we’ll work it out,” Roy told reporters. “I just don’t support that policy.” Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., who represents a competitive district outside New York City, is demanding a higher SALT deduction, noting that his state gives more to the federal government than it takes, unlike many red states. “It’s an issue of fairness. For my colleagues that talk about bad blue-state policies, the fact is New York is a donor state. Many of my colleagues from red states actually get more money from the federal government than tax revenue that is sent to the federal government,” Lawler, who is considering a run for governor of New York, told reporters. “So if we want to talk about subsidies, then we can talk about subsidies, but the fact is that New Yorkers need tax relief. That’s what I’m fighting for in this bill.” Lawler’s colleague, Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., is also weighing a run for governor and has beentalking up SALTrecently. That could make her another difficult vote for Johnson. Rep. Nick LaLota, R-N.Y., who represents a Long Island district that was hit hard by the 2017 GOP law’s SALT cap, said this week that boosting the deduction is essential to winning his support for the reconciliation package. “I’m all in on the SALT provision,” LaLota told reporters. “My folks didn’t just send me here for my great good looks. They sent me here to fight for SALT, and I intend to win that fight.”",

    "article_text": "The driver whocrashed into an Illinois after-school program, killing four students, was not under the influence of alcohol and controlled substances. A toxicology report for Marianne Akers, 44, came back negative, and no charges have been filed, Illinois State Police Director Brendan Kelly said Thursday. Akers was taken to a hospital and provided both blood and urine samples for testing. Investigators are reviewing evidence that a medical emergency may have led to the crash into the building at YNOT After School Camp in the town of Chatham. \"The evidence is still being developed,\" Kelly said. \"There's a lot of work still to do, and we're going to keep doing that until all possible leads and explanations have been exhausted.\" Kelly emphasized that the investigation continues and said state police are not jumping to conclusions about the cause of the crash. \"There's obviously high emotion in something like this, and we have people that are impacted by this or part of this community,\" he said. \"But the Illinois State Police, our view ... is to relentlessly pursue those facts, no matter where they take us.\" Akers was behind the wheel of a vehicle that slammed into the east side of the building around 3:20 p.m. Monday and exited through the west wall. Four girls — Rylee Britton, 18; Ainsley Johnson, 8; Alma Buhnerkempe, 7; and Kathryn Corley, 7; — werepronounced dead at the scene, according to the county coroner's office. Six other people were taken to a local hospital for treatment. Two were released by Wednesday, but four others remained hospitalized, state police said. Jamie Loftus, founder of YNOT Outdoors, said in a statement Tuesday that security cameras showed the vehicle coming toward the building at a \"high rate of speed.\" \"I cannot gather the words to express much of anything that will make sense in print,” Loftus said. “However, I do know that our families who suffered loss and injury today are hurting very, very badly.\"",

    "article_text": "NvidiablastedAnthropicThursday in a rare public clash overartificial intelligencepolicy with U.S.chip export restrictionsset to take effect. “American firms should focus on innovation and rise to the challenge, rather than tell tall tales that large, heavy, and sensitive electronics are somehow smuggled in ‘baby bumps’ or ‘alongside live lobsters,’ ” a spokesperson for Nvidia said. Anthropic, the AI startup backed by billions fromAmazon, argued for tighter controls and enforcement, saying in a blog post Wednesday thatChinese smugglingtactics involved chips hidden in “prosthetic baby bumps” and “packed alongside live lobsters.” Chip restrictionsfrom former PresidentJoe Biden’s term, called the “AI Diffusion Rule,” are set to take effect May 15. The rule puts global export controls on advanced AI chips and model weights to prevent rival nations like China from gaining ground in an escalating AI arms race. PresidentDonald Trumpis reportedly working on updating theserestrictions, adding another layer of uncertainty to the already contentious policy. Anthropic, which relies heavily on Nvidia hardware to train its models, is calling for tighter restrictions that could limit Nvidia’s overseas business and revenue from chip sales. Anthropic argued that compute access is the key strategic chokepoint in the race to buildfrontier AI. The company proposed lowering the export threshold for Tier 2 countries, tightening the rules to reduce smuggling risks, and increasing funding for enforcement. “Maintaining America’s compute advantage through export controls is essential for national security and economic prosperity,” Anthropic wrote. In a sharply worded response to Anthropic, an Nvidia spokesperson blasted the use of policy to limit competitiveness. “China, with half of the world’s AI researchers, has highly capable AI experts at every layer of the AI stack. America cannot manipulate regulators to capture victory in AI,” the spokesperson said. Nvidia CEOJensen Huang, who visited withChinese trade officialsin mid-April, said Wednesday in Washington, D.C. that China is “not behind” the U.S. in AI and praised Huawei as a top global tech company. “They’re incredible in computing and network technology, all these essential capabilities to advance AI,” Huang said. “They have made enormous progress in the last several years.”",

    "article_text": "The city of Chicago and former “Empire” actorJussie Smolletthave reached a settlement six years after the city sued the TV star. The city sued Smollett in April 2019, three months after he claimed he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack in Chicago's Streeterville neighborhood. However, police and city officials later said he orchestrated thehoax hate crime against himself. The city's suit accused him of submitting a false police report on Jan. 29, 2019, saying he knew his attackers and planned the attack, and it sought $130,000 in expenses spent on the police investigation. Smollett had filed a countersuit denying that he orchestrated the attack, and he denied making a false police report. On Monday, the city and Smollett told the court they have settled “but need more time to finalize documentation.” The details of the settlement were not disclosed. A status hearing set for this week has been reset for May 29, according to the court docket. The Chicago Department of Law and an attorney for Smollett did not respond to requests for comment. Back in January 2019, Smollett reported to police he was the victim of a hate crime and that he was attacked because he is Black and gay. Two men — brothersOla and AbimbolaOsundairo— were arrested. Police later said Smollett had recruited the brothers to help him stage the attack. Smollett was arrested in February 2019, and the following montha grand jury indicted himon suspicion of filing a false police report. Then Cook County State Attorney Kimberly Foxx dropped the charges later. A special prosecutor revived the case, and in February 2020Smollett was charged with six disorderly conduct counts, leading to a trial. In December 2021, hewas found guilty on five of the six counts. He was sentenced in 2022 to 150 days in jail and 30 months’ probation. In that trial, the Osundairo brothers said that Smollett hired them to stage an attack as a ploy for public attention and that they were paid with a $3,500 check. Smollett argued that the check was written for personal training services and denied the claims that he staged the attack. The Illinois Supreme Court overturned that conviction last November over prosecutorial issues. The state Supreme Court found that Smollett should not have been charged after he entered a nonprosecution agreement with the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office.",

    "article_text": "ASoviet-eraspacecraft meant to landon Venusin the 1970s is expected to soon plunge uncontrolled back to Earth. It’s too early to know where the half-ton mass of metal might come down or how much of it will survive reentry, according tospace debris-trackingexperts. Dutch scientist Marco Langbroek predicts the failed spacecraft will reenter around May 10. He estimates it will come crashing in at 150 mph, if it remains intact. “While not without risk, we should not be too worried,” Langbroek said in an email. The object is relatively small and, even if it doesn’t break apart, “the risk is similar to that of arandom meteorite fall, several of which happen each year. You run a bigger risk of getting hit by lightning in your lifetime,” he said. The chance of the spacecraft actually hitting someone or something is small, he added. “But it cannot be completely excluded.” The Soviet Union launched the spacecraft known as Kosmos 482 in 1972, one of a series of Venus missions. But it never made it out of Earth orbit because of a rocket malfunction. Most of it came tumbling down within a decade. But Langbroek and others believe the landing capsule itself — a spherical object about 3 feet in diameter — has been circling the world in a highly elliptical orbit for the past 53 years, gradually dropping in altitude. It’s quite possible that the 1,000-pound-plus spacecraft will survive reentry. It was built to withstand a descent through the carbon dioxide-thick atmosphere of Venus, said Langbroek of Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. Experts doubt the parachute system would work after so many years. The heat shield may also be compromised after so long in orbit. It would be better if the heat shield fails, which would cause the spacecraft to burn up during its dive through the atmosphere, the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics’ Jonathan McDowell said in an email. But if the heat shield holds, “it’ll reenter intact and you have a half-ton metal object falling from the sky.” The spacecraft could reenter anywhere between 51.7 degrees north and south latitude, or as far north as London and Edmonton in Alberta, Canada, almost all the way down to South America’s Cape Horn. But since most of the planet is water, “chances are good it will indeed end up in some ocean,” Langbroek said.",

    "title": "Health care for transgender children questioned in 400-page Trump administration report",
    "article_text": "Selena Simmons-Duffin White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller called gender-affirming care for children \"barbaric\" at a press conference on Thursday. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt looks on.Evan Vucci/APhide caption On Thursday, the Department of Health and Human Services published a400-page documententitled \"Treatment for Pediatric Gender Dysphoria: Review of Evidence and Best Practices.\" The review's authors are not being named by HHS. According to apress release, the names \"are not initially being made public in order to help maintain the integrity\" of a post-publication peer review process. HHS did not immediately respond to NPR's questions about the number of authors, their professional backgrounds, and their affiliations. The current approach for transgender youth, endorsed byall major medical associationsin the U.S., is to affirm a young person's gender identity and give their family the option of medical interventions like puberty blockers and hormone therapy. The report describes that approach as fundamentally misguided. Its authors conclude that doctors and clinics that provide gender-affirming care have \"fallen short of their duty to prioritize the health interests of young patients.\" White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller used the term \"barbaric\" when describing gender-affirming medical interventions at the White House on Thursday. \"They violate all sound medical ethics. They are completely unwarranted. They harm children for life irreversibly. It is child torture. It is child abuse. It is medical malpractice,\" he said during a press conference on Thursday. In a statement, Dr. Susan Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, wrote that the organization is \"deeply alarmed\" by the new HHS document. \"This report misrepresents the current medical consensus and fails to reflect the realities of pediatric care,\" she wrote. She asserted that the report was not credible because it relied \"on select perspectives and a narrow set of data.\" She added that AAP was not consulted on the report, but that its recommendations were \"inaccurately\" characterized throughout. (The official AAPrecommendationsays, in part, that transgender youth should \"have access to comprehensive, gender-affirming, and developmentally appropriate health care that is provided in a safe and inclusive clinical space.\") The report's conclusion that gender-affirming care for youth should be curtailed is not surprising given that the report was commissioned in anexecutive orderentitled \"Protecting Children From Chemical and Surgical Mutilation.\" It reads: \"Across the country today, medical professionals are maiming and sterilizing a growing number of impressionable children under the radical and false claim that adults can change a child's sex through a series of irreversible medical interventions.\" This trend, it continues, \"must end.\" On the campaign trail, President Trump and the Republican party spent more than$200 millionon anti-trans television ads. Since taking office, Trump has moved swiftly to target schools andhospitalsthat affirm transgender youth, to limit the participation of trans people in sports and the military, to require that passports reflect a person'ssex at birthand tocancel millions in fundingfor LGBTQ+ health research. Some of these efforts have been blocked in the courts. The HHS report describes transition-related medical care for young people as being too readily available, but more than half of U.S. stateshave banned it. The Supreme Court is set to rule this spring on achallenge to Tennessee's banon gender-affirming care for youth. In tone and form, the HHS report mirrors theCass Review, published in the U.K. last year and commissioned by the National Health Service. (The name \"Cass\" is cited 149 times in the HHS report.) Like the new HHS report, the review submitted by Dr. Hilary Cass, looks at available evidence and concludes the benefits of gender-affirming care are overstated. But Cass was also the public face of the review process, and she spent four years conducting interviews with transgender young people, parents and clinicians to prepare the report. HHS did not respond to NPR's questions about how long its  lengthy report had been in the works. \"The purpose of this piece of propaganda is to give the veneer of science,\" says a physician who provides gender-affirming care in a state where it remains legal. NPR agreed not to name the doctor because they did not have permission from their employer to speak with the media, and because they fear for their safety. The doctor added that the anonymous authors of the report and the politicians who commissioned it \"have already said what they think — they don't think being trans is real, they don't think that trans people should be allowed to do what they want with their bodies, they think that gender is this immutable concept, and they have absolutely no curiosity about whether that might not be true for everybody.\" On social media, Kristen Waggoner, president of the Christian legal group Alliance Defending Freedom,praised the reportand said that it \"should lead to the closure of every gender clinic in America. Doctors who perpetrate these experiments on children should lose their medical licenses and be sued for damages.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "article_text": "Rob Stein A new requirement for vaccine studies could delay the availability of new vaccines.Aire Images/Moment RF/Getty Imageshide caption The Trump administration plans to impose a new testing requirement for new vaccines — a demand that could delay the availability of the next round of COVID-19 vaccines and complicate the approval of other vaccines. The administration will require all new vaccines to be tested against an inert substance known as a placebo before they can be made available, which is a \"radical departure from past practices,\" according to a statement from Andrew Nixon, a spokesman for Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the secretary of Health and Human Services. The latest statement triggered alarm among vaccine experts that this may be another step by Kennedy to undermine the confidence in and availability of vaccines. \"I think it is the interest of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to make vaccines more expensive, less available and more feared,\" said Dr.Paul Offit, a University of Pennsylvania vaccine expert. \"He's an anti-vaccine activist, a science denialist who is going to do everything he can to tear down the infrastructure in this country of vaccines. Robert F. Kennedy Jr is a dangerous man.\" The administration maintains this new requirement is aimed at ensuring vaccines are safe. But vaccine experts dispute the claim that key vaccines weren't tested against a placebo. They also take issue with the definition of what constitutes a new vaccine. The ingredients in some vaccines, such as the COVID shots, have been updated regularly to better match the strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in circulation, without fundamentally changing the vaccines themselves. That has long been the case with flu vaccines, too. \"Secretary Kennedy's HHS has pledged radical transparency to the American public. This means being honest and straightforward about what we know — and what we don't know — about medical products, including vaccines,\" Nixon said. He also claimed that \"except for the COVID vaccine, none of the vaccines on the CDC's childhood recommended schedule was tested against an inert placebo, meaning we know very little about the actual risk profiles of these products.\" Nixon also questioned the reliability of existing vaccine monitoring programs, which he described as \"regulatory malpractice.\" While the administration didn't specifically name the COVID vaccines, Nixon indicated any update to the COVID vaccines could make them new vaccines that would require this testing. \"As we've said before, trials from four years ago conducted in people without natural immunity no longer suffice. A four-year-old trial is also not a blank check for new vaccines each year without clinical trial data, unlike the flu shot which has been tried and tested for more than 80 years,\" Nixon said in a statement he had earlier sent toThe Washington Post. \"The public deserves transparency and gold-standard science — especially with evolving products.\" He also referred torecent commentsfrom Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary indicating the COVID vaccines should be considered new vaccines. \"Makary has indicated that significant updates to existing vaccines—such as those addressing seasonal strain changes or antigenic drift—may be considered 'new products' requiring additional clinical evaluation,\" Nixon wrote. \"He emphasized the need for robust data to support vaccine approvals, highlighting, 'Rather than allow that void to be filled with opinions, I'd like to see some good data.' \" The moves are concerning at a time when vaccination rates are already falling and diseases likemeasles are experiencing outbreaks. COVID is still killing hundreds of Americans every week, and the next pandemic could hit at any time, Offit and others say. \"He appears to be on full-on attack mode when it comes to vaccines. And it's so self-defeating for our country and globally as well,\" says Dr.Peter Hotez, a vaccine researcher at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. \"It's absolutely dangerous.\" Offit, Hotez and others disputed the claim that testing vaccines against a placebo is a \"radical departure\" and that childhood vaccines were not evaluated that way. Scientists routinely test new vaccines and drugs against placebos to see if they are safe and effective. \"The blanket statement that none of the routine vaccines were ever tested against placebo is incorrect,\" says Dr.Jesse Goodman, a former Food and Drug Administration vaccine regulator now at Georgetown University. \"Placebo trials have been done.\" That includes the original COVID vaccines, which were evaluated in large, well-designed placebo-controlled trials that evaluated their safety and effectiveness. Those trials, along with subsequent monitoring, have clearly shown that the COVID vaccines as well as all the other shots on the market are safe and effective, Goodman and others say. Given how much immunity people have at this point, any new placebo trials for the update COVID vaccines would have to be huge, which means it would be prohibitively expensive and would take too long to make the updated vaccines available in time for next fall and winter, they say. \"By the time you got those studies done, the strain would have evolved and the study you just did would be of a strain that's not as good,\" Goodman says. \"You'd be deliberately creating a situation where you would probably be using less-good vaccines – and for no reason.\" \"It would basically be a recipe for paralysis,\" Hotez says. In addition, experts say that giving someone a placebo to protect them against a potentially deadly disease when an effective vaccine already exists would be unethical. \"Are they really planning on doing a placebo-controlled trial where a certain group of people are not given that vaccine, knowing that the virus can cause infection and disease, including serious disease in anyone? Anyone can be felled by this virus,\" Offit says. \"So it's not an ethical trial.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "article_text": "By Rebecca Rosman A general view of Harrods store in Knightsbridge, central LondonJoel Ryan/Invision/APhide caption LONDON — Harrods, the iconic luxury department store, has become the latest British retailer to fall victim to a cyberattack. The hack targeted the London-based retail giant, raising concerns over the vulnerability of high-end businesses to online security breaches. Details of the cyberattack remain unclear, but some customers have reported being unable to complete purchases. The Qatar-owned department store said it was forced to temporarily shut down some systems after realizing it was being targeted earlier this week. Harrodsadded that customer payment data was not compromised during the attempted breach. In a statement the store said, \"we recently experienced attempts to gain unauthorised access to some of our systems. Our seasoned IT security team immediately took proactive steps to keep systems safe and as a result we have restricted internet access at our sites today.\" This hacking attempt follows shortly after two other major British retailers —Marks & SpencerandCo-op— were targeted in online breaches.  Both retailers have lost millions after they were forced to shut down parts of their IT systems to protect themselves from further attacks. Marks & Spencers has been unable to complete online orders since last Friday. It's still unclear whether the three cyber attacks are connected. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Trump-appointed federal judge blocks use of Alien Enemies Act for Venezuelans in South Texas",
    "article_text": "Sergio Martínez-Beltrán 17 alleged members of Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang and members of the MS-13 gang, who were deported to El Salvador by the US in San Salvador, El Salvador on March 31, 2025.El Salvador Press Presidency Office/Anadolu via Getty Imageshide caption A federal judge in Texas Thursday ruled that President Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to detain and deport Venezuelan immigrants from South Texas was \"unlawful.\" U.S. District Judge Fernando Rodriguez, Jr., a Trump appointee, wrote that Trump's invocation of the act \"exceeds the scope of the statute and is contrary to the plain, ordinary meaning of the statute's terms.\" The government,he ruled, does not\"possess the lawful authority under the AEA, and based on the Proclamation, to detain Venezuelan aliens, transfer them within the United States, or remove them from the country.\" The men inthis Texas casehave been threatened with imminent removal under the Alien Enemies Act, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. They are accused of being members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang. They remain in detention at El Valle Detention Center in Raymondville, Texas. The judge's decision covers all of the Southern District of Texas, which includes Brownsville, McAllen and Houston. Other courts have sought to block the Trump administration from deporting anyone under the act. But this is the first time a judge has ruled that the act cannot be used against people who are alleged gang members invading the United States. \"The court ruled the president can't unilaterally declare an invasion of the United States and invoke a wartime authority during peacetime,\" Lee Gelernt, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union and lead counsel for the three Venezuelan plaintiffs, said in a statement. \"This is a critically important decision that prevents more people from being sent to the notorious CECOT prison (a maximum security prison in El Salvador).\" After extensive analysis of historical records, Judge Rodriguez concluded in his ruling that the ordinary meaning of \"invasion\" or \"predatory inclusion\" when the Alien Enemies Act was enacted required a military incursion. He found that the criminal activities of Tren de Aragua members described in the Proclamation, while harmful, did not constitute an \"invasion\" or \"predatory incursion\" as understood under the Act. \"The Proclamation makes no reference to and in no manner suggests that a threat exists of an organized, armed group of individuals entering the United States at the direction of Venezuela to conquer the country or assume control over a portion of the nation,\" Judge Rodriguez wrote. \"Thus, while the Court finds that an 'invasion' or 'predatory incursion' must involve an organized, armed force entering the United States to engage in conduct destructive of property and human life in a specific geographical area, the action need not be a precursor to actual war.\" The Department of Homeland Security didn't immediately reply to a request for comment. If the Trump administration appeals the decision, it would go to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of appeals, considered one of country's most conservative courts. The case could eventually be headed to the U.S. Supreme Court. President Trumpissued a proclamation in Marchaccusing Tren de Aragua of \"perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States.\" \"(Tren de Aragua) is undertaking hostile actions and conducting irregular warfare against the territory of the United States both directly and at the direction, clandestine or otherwise, of the Maduro regime in Venezuela,\" Trump wrote in his proclamation. Trump has used the Act toremove more than 130 Venezuelan mento a maximum security prison in El Salvador. The administration has accused all of them of being Tren de Aragua, but has conceded not all of them have criminal records. The Texas suit is one of several court cases on the topic sparked by Trump's proclamation and his administration's actions. In late March, a three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuitupheld a ruling by federal Judge James Boasbergand denied the White House's use of the wartime authority by a vote of 2 to 1. Judge Patricia Millett, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, cited a lack of opportunity for the alleged gang members to contest the cases. \"The government's removal scheme denies Plaintiffs even a gossamer thread of due process,\" Millett wrote in a concurring statement. The Supreme Courthas already ruled the Trump administration can remove migrantsunder the Alien Enemies Act, but with a caveat. Migrants alleged to be gang members must be given \"reasonable time\" to challenge their removal from the country. The high court did not specify a length of time.

    "article_text": "By Franco Ordoñez , Tamara Keith , Asma Khalid In this file photo from Feb. 14, 2025, Mike Waltz speaks with an official just outside the Oval Office where a copy of President Trump's mugshot on the front page of theNew York Postis posted.Andrew Harnik/Getty Imageshide caption President Trump said on Thursday he is nominating his national security adviser Mike Waltz as his ambassador to the United Nations in the first big shake up of top aides since Trump started his second term. Trumpsaid on social mediathat he would make Marco Rubio his interim national security adviser — a role that will come on top of his existing job, Secretary of State. It's very unusual for one person to hold both major roles. Waltz' new job will depend on confirmation by the U.S. Senate, where Republicans narrowly control the majority — but where some have expressed concerns after  inadvertently inviteda journalist into a private text chatdiscussing military plans for U.S. strikes on the Houthis in Yemen. The UN spot has been vacant since Trump asked his first nominee, Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., to instead stay in Congress to help preserve the narrow majority Republicans hold in the House of Representatives. \"I'm deeply honored to continue my service to President Trump and our great nation,\" Waltzsaid on social media. National security adviser Mike Waltz stands behind Vice President Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth in the Oval Office on April 7, 2025.Saul Loeb/AFPhide caption Trump had initially defended Waltz — who took responsibility for the mishap — and downplayed the incident as a \"glitch.\" He was complimentary of Waltz in his announcement on Thursday, and last week toldThe Atlanticin an interview that \"Waltz is fine\" when asked about his future. \"I think we learned, 'Maybe don't use Signal, okay?' If you want to know the truth. I would frankly tell these people not to use Signal, although it's been used by a lot of people,\" Trump said. Trump has not talked to reporters yet about his decision. But Vice President Vance said in an interview that the change in roles had nothing to do with the group chat incident. \"I know the president really likes Mike Waltz. He just thought that the UN ambassador position would be a better place for Mike Waltz to be,\" Vance told Fox News' Bret Baier. \"The media wants to frame this as a firing. Donald Trump has fired a lot of people. He doesn't give them Senate-confirmed appointments afterwards,\" Vance said. National security adviser Mike Waltz and his wife, former homeland security adviser Julia Nesheiwat, take a selfie as they tour the Pituffik Space Base on March 28, 2025 in Greenland during a visit with Vice President Vance.Pool/Getty Images Europehide caption During his first 100 days in office, Trump has leaned more heavily on other top aides for national security issues like the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, and talks with Iran, includingMiddle East envoy Steve Witkoff, Treasury SecretaryScott Bessentas well as Secretary of StateMarco Rubio. Waltz was the first Green Beret elected to Congress where he served three terms representing east central Florida in the House of Representatives. Waltz, who was known as a national security hawk, had an uphill road to climb within Trump's circle. He had long been an advocate of sanctions against Russia and never seemed to fully align with Trump's approach to Moscow and other adversaries. Vance denied that the change in position was a sign of philosophical divisions within Trump's team. \"I've already seen some folks saying that this is a war between the hawks and the anti-hawks, new conservatives vs. MAGA or the realists -- that's not what this is about at all,\" Vance said. Before taking the White House job, Waltz served as chairman of the House Armed Services subcommittee on readiness and was a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Trump's announcement came after hours of rumors that Waltz was leaving his position — and while Rubio's spokeswoman Tammy Bruce was briefing reporters at the State Department. \"We have to admit, these last 100 days — it's like hanging on to a freaking bullet train,\" Bruce told reporters. The last person to simultaneously be Secretary of State and national security adviser was Henry Kissinger, during the Nixon era. He did both jobs for two years. \"Some Americans in Washington and elsewhere thought the double assignment gave Kissinger too much power and persuaded President Ford to strip him of his White House title in late 1975,\" presidential historian Michael Beschloss said. In Rubio's case, Trump has indicated this will be a temporary assignment until he picks a new national security adviser. Trump has been known to give people he trusts multiple positions at the same time. In his first term, his budget director Mick Mulvaney was also in charge of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, noted Katie Dunn Tenpas, an expert on presidential personnel at the Brookings Institution. \"it's highly unconventional, but it's not unusual for the Trump administration. And I watched it during the first term — and I watched it with a great deal of awe because I had not seen it in prior administrations,\" Tenpas said.

    "title": "Trump nominee gives misleading testimony about ties to alleged 'Nazi sympathizer'",
    "article_text": "Tom Dreisbach Left: Interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Edward Martin during an Anacostia Coordinating Council monthly meeting in Washington, D.C., on March 25. Right: Timothy Hale-Cusanelli with a mustache resembling Adolf Hitler's in photos recovered from his cellphone by the Department of Justice.The Washington Post via Getty Images/Department of Justicehide caption Ed Martin, President Trump's nominee for U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, is trying to distance himself from a convicted Jan. 6 Capitol rioter known for his racist and antisemitic rhetoric. Federal prosecutors have described the man, Timothy Hale-Cusanelli, as a \"Nazi sympathizer.\" But NPR's reporting — including a direct email exchange with Martin and a review of a series of podcast interviews he conducted — casts doubt on the accuracy of Martin's sworn testimony to the U.S. Senate. In written answers to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Martin now claims he was unaware of Hale-Cusanelli's past comments until at least August 2024. \"I am not close with him,\" Martin told the Senate. \"The statements that individual made are abhorrent, deplorable and unacceptable in any context.\" However, in anemailin September 2024, NPR wrote to Martin and made him aware of a laundry list of Hale-Cusanelli's prior antisemitic and racist statements. In subsequent weeks and months, Martin continued to praise Hale-Cusanelli as an \"amazing guy\" and \"great friend,\" and they appeared at multiple events together. Martin and his office did not respond to multiple requests for comment on this story. Martin, a longtime conservative activist, currently serves as theinterim U.S. attorneyand is facing a tough confirmation fight in the Senate. As NPR previouslyreported, Martin awarded Hale-Cusanelli the \"Eagle Award\" at Trump's golf club in Bedminster, N.J. in Aug. 2024, praising him as an \"extraordinary man\" and \"extraordinary leader.\" In podcast interviews, Martin has also called Hale-Cusanelli a \"friend.\" In his testimony to the Senate Martin said that when he gave Hale-Cusanelli that award, he was not aware of his prior comments. But on apodcast in July 2024— about a month prior to giving him the award — Hale-Cusanelli and Martin discussed photos presented by prosecutors, in which Hale-Cusanelli had a \"Hitler mustache.\" \"You had the mustache shaved in such a way that you looked vaguely like Hitler and making jokes about it,\" Martin said. \"Not your best moment, but not illegal.\" Hale-Cusanelli has described the photos as \"satirical\" and said federal prosecutors included them in court filings to \"smear\" him. Hale-Cusanelli's case drew outsized attention among the more than 1,500 Capitol riot prosecutions, due to \"Hitler mustache\" photos, as well as extensive evidence of virulent racist and antisemitic comments. In one lengthy video rant heposted online, he compared orthodox Jews to a \"plague of locusts\" and blamed Jews for spreading COVID-19. At his Capitol riotsentencingin 2022, U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden, a Trump appointee,saidHale-Cusanelli's conduct makes Jewish people \"less safe and less confident they can participate as equal members of our society.\" Jewish civil rights organizations, including the Anti-Defamation League and the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, denounced Martin's decision to honor Hale-Cusanelli at a Trump property. After his nomination to the role of U.S. attorney, Senate Democrats flagged Martin's relationship to Hale-Cusanelli and vowed to block Martin's confirmation. \"He is disqualified, and I'm going to do everything to stop his confirmation,\" said Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., in astatement. Only after those questions mounted did Martin denounce Hale-Cusanelli. \"I was not aware of his comments and views until after he received an Eagle Award,\" Martin wrote. \"I condemn his comments and views in the strongest terms possible.\" Separately, Martin gave an interview last month to theForward, a Jewish news outlet, in which he apologized and claimed ignorance about Hale-Cusanelli's past conduct. \"I certainly didn't know all the terrible things that he said and how he had acted. I think that's terrible, and I denounced it completely,\" Martin said, according to theForward. \"I hate it. I hate that it happened.\" But Martin's statements contrast with his earlier response to NPR in Sept. 2024, when asked about his repeated public appearances with Hale-Cusanelli. In thatemail, NPR provided explicit examples of Hale-Cusanelli's antisemitic comments and linked to evidence presented at his trial. \"We plan to excerpt thisvideo[Hale-Cusanelli] posted, where he attacked Orthodox Jews in New Jersey as 'unhygienic,' 'backward,' and a cause of COVID-19, comparing them to a 'plague of locusts' and attacking what he called the 'Hasidic Jewish invasion' of New Jersey,\" NPR wrote. The email included a link to the video posted by Hale-Cusanelli. \"Other evidence from court records indicates that he went to work with a 'Hitler mustache,' told coworkers 'Hitler should have finished the job' and 'babies born with any deformities or disabilities should be shot in the forehead,'\" the email went on, and provided additional links to text messages presented at Hale-Cusanelli's trial, where he usedantisemiticandracistslurs. Finally, NPR asked Martin, \"Could you address your praise of Hale-Cusanelli in light of his antisemitic remarks?\" Several hours later, Martin responded. \"NPR, the government-funded propaganda outlet that has lied at every turn about what happened on J6 is at it again,\" Martin wrote. In his response, Martin did not denounce or object to Hale-Cusanelli's rhetoric. In the months that followed, and as revealed in a review of podcast interviews, Martin continued to publicly associate with Hale-Cusanelli. Martin also did not appear to show any discomfort with Hale-Cusanelli's views in subsequent social media posts, just weeks and months after NPR first reported about the events at Trump Bedminster. On Sept. 24, 2024, Martinposted a podcast interviewhe conducted with Hale-Cusanelli, where Martin described him as a \"great friend.\" \"You're a reader, a writer and a thinker,\" Martin told Hale-Cusanelli during the interview. On Oct. 8, 2024, MartininterviewedHale-Cusanelli again. \"Our next guest is my friend Timothy Hale,\" Martin said, describing him as an \"amazing guy.\" And yet, in written testimony last month, Martin stated, \"I am not close with him,\" and added, \"I am aware of his name and some details involving his case, and I otherwise do not have close, consistent interactions with him.\" However, in January 2025, Hale-Cusanellipostedmultiplephotosof himself with Martin on social media, in which the two appear to have a friendly relationship. In one photo, from Trump's inaugural festivities, the two men are giving thumbs up to the camera. In January 2025, Hale-Cusanelli, seen here on the far left, posted this photo on social media featuring Martin, seen on the far right, at a Trump inaugural celebration. Martin has referred to Hale-Cusanelli as a \"great friend\" and \"amazing guy,\" and the photo and caption appear to indicate a friendly relationship between the two men. But in testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Martin said he is \"not close with him.\"Screenshot/Xhide caption In March, they both attended an event in Florida, where Martin compared the treatment of Jan. 6 riot defendants to Japanese internment during World War II, according toMother Jones. Hale-Cusanelli has denied that he is a \"Nazi sympathizer,\" describing his past antisemitic and racist comments as trolling meant to provoke, and said he has Jewish and Puerto Rican ancestry. What makes Martin's sudden claims of ignorance about Hale-Cusanelli's past comments particularly striking is his long-standing involvement in efforts to support Jan. 6 defendants — and the fact that Martin has been closely following his case for years. In 2022, Martin joined the board of thePatriot Freedom Project, a nonprofit founded by Cynthia Hughes, Hale-Cusanelli's self-described \"adoptive aunt,\" which was created in response to his arrest to support Jan. 6 defendants and their families. Martin first interviewed Hale-Cusanelli onhis podcast in June 2022, where Hale-Cusanelli spoke by phone from jail. \"This was an incredible trial,\" Martin said. \"I followed from Cynthia so many of the details.\" Martin'sfinancial disclosure reportshows he received a $30,000 \"board stipend\" from the group. In a statement, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said that he was unsatisfied with Martin's testimony about Hale-Cusanelli and a number of other issues. \"Mr. Martin makes a number of false statements that are easily debunked and dodges at least 80 questions outright,\" Durbin said.

    "title": "The U.S. set the global order after WWII. Trump has other plans",
    "article_text": "Greg Myre President Harry Truman signs the Marshall Plan on April 3, 1948, in Washington. The plan played a key role in the reconstruction of Europe after World War II and was part of the wide-ranging moves by the U.S. to establish a new international order that still defines the world to this day.AFP/Getty Imageshide caption From the ashes of World War II,President Harry Truman presided over the creationof global institutions that have defined the international order for the past 80 years. \"It must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressure,\" Truman said as he spelled out his doctrine in a1947 speech to Congress. In a few short years, the U.S. helped establish and lead the United Nations, NATO, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The U.S. helped rebuild Europe with assistance funneled through the Marshall Plan, and it also funded the reconstruction of Japan. Democratic and Republican presidents supported these institutions for generations. They sometimes grumbled at the cost, yet they believed the institutions ultimately strengthened the U.S. as the world's leading superpower. But 100 days into his second term, President Trump is moving aggressively to scale back the United States' role in the world, based on his \"America First\" agenda. Trump sees this web of alliances, treaties and soft power as expensive, outdated relics that restrain America's ability to act decisively on its own. \"I'm not aligned with anybody. I'm aligned with the United States of America and for the good of the world,\"  Trump said in February. Trump says the U.S. should not be the world's policeman and should not guarantee the security of its allies. Rather, he has attacked many of them and threatened to take control of territory ranging from Greenland to Canada to the Panama Canal to the Gaza Strip. Hal Brands, a historian at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative Washington think tank, puts it this way: \"If I had to boil it all down, I would say Trump's goal is to extract more privileges from the international order while bearing fewer responsibilities for upholding them.\" Trump scaled back U.S. global commitments in his first term. In his second term, he has launched a much more ambitious effort. \"In the first term, I would say the defining characteristic of this foreign policy was chaos. This time he's really taking a sledgehammer approach to U.S. foreign policy and the institutions around it,\" saidKelly Griecowith the Stimson Center, a nonpartisan think tank. Trump wants to do this on all major fronts — military, diplomatic and economic. President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a contentious meeting at the White House on Feb. 28 over the Russia-Ukraine war. Trump opposes additional U.S. military aid to Ukraine, though the two countries on Wednesday signed an agreement to share future revenue from Ukraine's natural resources.Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption With the U.S. military, Trump wants to end U.S. involvement in open-ended wars, like the Russia-Ukraine conflict. His signature moment so far was the White House meeting two months ago where Trump and Vice President Vance berated Volodymyr Zelenskyy, saying the Ukrainian president had not shown enough gratitude for U.S. aid and was overestimating Ukraine's military capabilities. \"You're not in a good position. You don't have the cards right now,\" an agitated Trump said to Zelenskyy. \"You're gambling with the lives of millions of people. You're gambling with World War III.\" The president opposes further U.S. military assistance for Ukraine and wants a permanent ceasefire. However, this is proving elusive as the fighting grinds on, with Russian leader Vladimir Putin launching some of his country's largest aerial assaults of the war in recent weeks. \"He's underestimating, often, his adversaries,\"Stewart Patrick, with the nonpartisan Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said of Trump. \"He seems to believe that Vladimir Putin is going to be satisfied with only 20% of Ukraine. This is the appetizer course as far as Vladimir Putin is concerned. He wants the entire meal.\" A ceasefire would give Trump some cover to pull back in Ukraine, where the U.S. does not have troops, though it has led the international effort to support that country since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022. But if the war carries on and Russia makes further gains, Trump could look weak, unable to stand up to Russia. This would raise even more questions about NATO's future and the U.S. willingness to defend Europe. \"I think that NATO will survive a second Trump presidency,\" said Brands. \"But I don't think that any European country will want to be as dependent on the United States in the future as they were in the past.\" Vice President Vance tours the U.S. military's Pituffik Space Base in Greenland on March 28. The Trump administration has called for the U.S. to take control of Greenland, which is a semiautonomous territory that's part of Denmark, a NATO ally of the United States.Pool/Getty Images Europehide caption On the diplomatic front, Trump is pursuing several high-stakes deals. It's still early in his second term, though so far he has had no major successes. An Israel-Hamas ceasefire, reached as Trump entered office in January, has collapsed. Talks with Iran on a nuclear agreement are ongoing. Grieco, of the Stimson Center, applauds the diplomatic efforts but is critical about Trump's approach. The president believes that these complex negotiations can be done quickly and with little or no input from allies. \"In many ways, he overestimates American power,\" said Grieco. \"This leads him to this more bullying approach, because he thinks the United States is so powerful that our allies and our adversaries will have to give way.\" This unilateral approach to diplomacy is also evident in Trump's trade policy. His actual or threatened tariffs against virtually every country have destabilized the global economy, and many economists say this was a significant factor at home as well, where theU.S. economy shrank 0.3%in the first three months of this year. Trump thinks U.S. economic clout will give him the leverage to win much better terms in one-on-one deals. His main target is China, yet his go-it-alone approach led him to antagonize friendly countries that could help in a collective effort to isolate China. \"If you're going to be trying to press China on a number of different fronts, you would want to do it with allies,\" said Patrick. Eighty years after the U.S. established the modern global order, foreign policy analysts wage nonstop debates about how it should be updated. The discussion often centers on whether the U.S. is still able and willing to shoulder the burden it has since World War II. But, Brands said, if the U.S. abandons that role, no other country can replace it. \"If the United States says that it's going to stop being a global public goods provider and simply take benefits out of the system, I don't know how long that system is going to last,\" Brands said. Trump seems determined to find out. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Education Department stops $1 billion in funding for school mental health",
    "article_text": "Cory Turner The U.S. Department of Education is telling impacted districts that the Biden administration, in awarding the grants, violated \"the letter or purpose of Federal civil rights law.\"Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption The Trump administration says it will stop paying out $1 billion in federal grants that school districts across the country have been using to hire mental health professionals, including counselors and social workers. The U.S. Department of Education is telling impacted districts that the Biden administration, in awarding the grants, violated \"the letter or purpose of Federal civil rights law.\" The grants were part of the2022 Bipartisan Safer Communities Act— a bill passed in the aftermath of theschool shooting in Uvalde, Texas, in which a teen gunman killed 19 elementary school students and two adults and injured 17 people. The bill, among other things, poured federal dollars into schools to address rising concerns about astudent mental health crisis. Those dollars helped Superintendent Derek Fialkiewicz in Corbett, Ore., more than triple the number of school mental health professionals in his largely rural district of 1,100 students east of Portland. Before the grants, Fialkiewicz says his district had just two counselors, \"and we realized, that's just not sustainable for our students and especially coming out of COVID.\" In early 2023, thanks to the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the district received a federal grant that fully covered the salaries and benefits of five new trained social workers. \"It's been amazing,\"says Fialkiewicz of the difference that federal money — and the social workers it paid for — have made in his school community. He says he was shocked when he heard the Trump administration was putting an end to this federal support. Just Tuesday, a U.S. Department of Education employee who oversees their grant had given his district the go-ahead to add a telehealth texting service for students. An hour later, Fialkiewicz says, he got an email that the grant would be discontinued. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, and the mental health funding that accompanied it, enjoyed considerable Republican support even in the years after it passed. \"Too often, adolescents with untreated mental health conditions become the very same perpetrators who commit acts of violence,\" wrote three of the law's Republican supporters — Sens. John Cornyn of Texas, Susan Collins of Maine and Thom Tillis of North Carolina — ina 2024 opinion piece. \"For this reason, we crafted our law to ensure teachers and administrators are equipped with the tools to recognize when a student is experiencing a mental health crisis and, more importantly, connect them with the care they need before it's too late.\" The endgame was \"to prepare and place 14,000 mental health professionals in schools,\" says Mary Wall, who oversaw K-12 policy and budget for the U.S. Department of Education during the Biden administration. Wall says about 260 school districts in nearly every state received a portion of the $1 billion — in the form of five-year grants, which were paid out in installments. Now, it appears those districts will have to find a way to do without the money they had planned for but will not receive. \"The preparation of new mental health professionals, as well as those who are already in service, is at risk,\" Wall says. In Corbett, Fialkiewicz says he's been told his grant money, which was supposed to last until December of 2027, will instead stop this December, two years early. Once it does, he says, \"We're gonna end up going back to having two counselors in our district.\" The superintendent says he feels \"disgusted\" by the idea of having to lay off those federally funded social workers. \"To be able to provide those [mental health] services and then have it ripped away for something that is completely out of our control, it's horrible,\" Fialkiewicz says. \"I feel for our students more than anything because they're not gonna get the services that they need.\" AnAugust 2024 pollfrom the American Psychiatric Association found that \"84% of Americans believe school staff play a crucial role in identifying signs of mental health issues in students.\" In a statement to NPR, Madi Biedermann, deputy assistant secretary for communications at the Department of Education, explained the decision to discontinue the grants: \"Recipients used the funding to implement race-based actions like recruiting quotas in ways that have nothing to do with mental health and could hurt the very students the grants are supposed to help. We owe it to American families to ensure that tax-payer dollars are supporting evidence-based practices that are truly focused on improving students' mental health.\" But the2022 federal grant noticetold schools explicitly: The services to be provided must be \"evidence-based.\" Wall also disputes the department's characterization, telling NPR that \"the focus of these grants was absolutely on providing evidence-based mental health support to students. Any suggestion that this is a DEI program is a distraction from the real issue.\" The Trump administration and the Education Department have been applying a new interpretation of federal civil rights law to a wide range of federal programs. Last month, the departmentthreatened to revoke K-12 schools' federal fundingif they don't stop all DEI programming and teaching that the department might consider discriminatory. In response to a request from NPR to further explain why the department believes these mental health grants had somehow run afoul of Trump's anti-DEI policy, it offered a few brief excerpts from districts' grant applications, in which one grantee wrote that school counselors must be trained \"to recognize and challenge systemic injustices, antiracism, and the pervasiveness of white supremacy to ethically support diverse communities.\" The initial federal request for grant applications suggested districts prioritize \"increasing the number of school-based mental health services providers in high-need [districts], increasing the number of services providers from diverse backgrounds or from the communities they serve, and ensuring that all services providers are trained in inclusive practices.\" In the email Fialkiewicz received, notifying him of the grant's end, the department wrote that the efforts funded by the grant violate federal civil rights law, \"conflict with the Department's policy of prioritizing merit, fairness, and excellence in education; undermine the well-being of the students these programs are intended to help; or constitute an inappropriate use of federal funds.\" When asked if diversity played any role in his district's grant application, Fialkiewicz replied: \"Yes, in our application, we did state, because it was part of the requirements, that we would use equitable hiring practices. And that's exactly what we did. And to me, equitable hiring practices means you hire the best person for the job. That's equitable.\" And now, those social workers he hired might lose their jobs.

    "title": "Time saved by AI offset by new work created, study suggests",
    "article_text": "Survey of 2023–2024 data finds that AI created more tasks for 8.4 percent of workers. Anew studyanalyzing the Danish labor market in 2023 and 2024 suggests that generative AI models likeChatGPThave had almost no significant impact on overall wages or employment yet, despite rapid adoption in some workplaces. The findings, detailed in aworking paperby economists from the University of Chicago and the University of Copenhagen, provide an early, large-scale empirical look at AI's transformative potential. In \"Large Language Models, Small Labor Market Effects,\" economistsAnders HumlumandEmilie Vestergaardfocused specifically on the impact of AI chatbots across 11 occupations often considered vulnerable to automation, including accountants, software developers, and customer support specialists. Their analysis covered data from 25,000 workers and 7,000 workplaces in Denmark. Despite finding widespread and often employer-encouraged adoption of these tools, the study concluded that \"AI chatbots have had no significant impact on earnings or recorded hours in any occupation\" during the period studied. The confidence intervals in their statistical analysis ruled out average effects larger than 1 percent. \"The adoption of these chatbots has been remarkably fast,\" Humlum toldThe Registerabout the study. \"Most workers in the exposed occupations have now adopted these chatbots... But then when we look at the economic outcomes, it really has not moved the needle.\" During the study, the researchers investigated how company investment in AI affected worker adoption and how chatbots changed workplace processes. While corporate investment boosted AI tool adoption—saving time for 64 to 90 percent of users across studied occupations—the actual benefits were less substantial than expected. The study revealed that AI chatbots actually created new job tasks for 8.4 percent of workers, including some who did not use the tools themselves, offsetting potential time savings. For example, many teachers now spend time detecting whether students use ChatGPT for homework, while other workers review AI output quality or attempt to craft effective prompts. Indeed, the reported productivity benefits were modest in the study. Users reported average time savings of just 2.8 percent of work hours (about an hour per week). The Register points out that the finding contradicts arandomized controlled trialpublished in February that found generative AI increased worker productivity by 15 percent on average. Humlum suggested to The Register that the difference stems from other experiments focusing on tasks highly suited to AI, whereas most real-world jobs involve tasks AI cannot fully automate, and organizations are still learning how to integrate the tools effectively. And even where time was saved, the study estimates only 3 to 7 percent of those productivity gains translated into higher earnings for workers, raising questions about who benefits from the efficiency. This conclusion, however, may face future scrutiny regarding its timing and scope. For example, data from 2023–2024 captures only an early phase of generative AI deployment, potentially missing lagging effects or the impact of more integrated generative AI uses beyond chatbots. Also, focusing on data from Denmark might overlook localized impacts already happening in other labor markets or specific fields like freelance creative work. Even so, the Danish study provides a valuable but limited snapshot that challenges some narratives of immediate, widespread labor market transformation from generative AI. Given the rapid pace of AI development, the longer-term economic impact of generative AI remains an uncertain and debated question that will likely be the subject of many future research papers.

    "title": "Why MFA is getting easer to bypass and what to do about it",
    "article_text": "Why multifactor authentication based on one-time-passwords and push notifications fails. An entire cottage industry has formed around phishing attacks that bypass some of the most common forms of multifactor authentication (MFA) and allow even non-technical users to quickly create sites that defeat the protections against account takeovers. MFA works by requiring an additional factor of authentication besides a password, for instance, a fingerprint, face scan, or the possession of a digital key. In theory, this prevents attackers from accessing an account even after they phish a victim’s username and password. Most often, the second form of authentication comes in the form of a one-time passcode that is sent to the user by text message or email or is generated by an authentication app that the user has already set up. Asdetailed on Thursdayby Cisco Talos, an entire ecosystem has cropped up to help criminals defeat these forms of MFA. They employ an attack technique known as an adversary in the middle. The tools provide phishing-as-a-service toolkits that are marketed in online crime forums using names including Tycoon 2FA, Rockstar 2FA, Evilproxy, Greatness, and Mamba 2FA. The products provide all the code someone needs to set up a proxy server that sits between the victim and the site they’re trying to log into. The toolkits also provide templates for creating convincing-looking phishing pages. The attack starts by sending the victim a message enticing them to log into their account, often by falsely claiming it has been compromised and needs to be locked down immediately. The hoax message provides a link that looks similar to the legitimate account URL, but in actuality, is slightly different. For instance, rather than the URL beinghttps://accounts.google.com/—the real link for logging into a Google account—it’s something like https://accounts.google.com.evilproxy[.]com. In many cases, the victim will be so consumed with the anxiety over the purported account compromise that they won’t spot the incorrect URL. The malicious link leads to the attacker’s proxy server that, thanks to the phishing-as-a-service toolkit, looks identical to the real Google login site (except for the URL displayed in the address window). The user then enters their username and password. The proxy then forwards the credentials to the real Google site. Google will then send the proxy server an MFA request, and the proxy server sends it back to the victim, who is expecting it since they believe they’re trying to log into the legitimate Google page. The victim then sends the MFA code to the proxy server, which sends it to the real Google site. Alternatively, the user clicks a push notification displayed on their phone. In either case, the attacker has successfully compromised the account even though MFA was turned on. The problem with these forms of MFA is that the codes themselves are phishable, since they come in the form of numbers, and occasionally other characters, that are just as easy for the attacker to copy and enter into the site as passwords are. The effect is the same in the event that the MFA is based on push notifications, since the victim clicks the button. And given the ease of using the phishing toolkits, even technical novices can create a legitimate-looking login page and a proxy server. These sorts of adversary-in-the-middle attacks have grown increasingly common. In 2022, for instance, a single group used it in a series of attacks that stole more than10,000 credentials from 137 organizations, and led to the network compromise of authentication provider Twilio, among others. One company that was targeted in the attack campaign but wasn’t breached was content delivery network Cloudflare. The reason was its use of MFA based onWebAuthn, the standard that makespasskeyswork. Services that use WebAuthn are highly resistant to adversary-in-the-middle attacks, if not absolutely immune. There are two reasons for this. First, WebAuthn credentials are cryptographically bound to the URL they authenticate. In the above example, the credentials would workonlyonhttps://accounts.google.com. If a victim tried to use the credential to log into https://accounts.google.com.evilproxy[.]com, the login would fail each time. Additionally, WebAuthn-based authentication must happen on or in proximity to the device the victim is using to log into the account. This occurs because the credential is also cryptographically bound to a victim device. Because the authentication can only happen on the victim device, it’s impossible for an adversary in the middle to actually use it in a phishing attack on their own device. Phishing has emerged as one of the most vexing security problems facing organizations, their employees, and their users. MFA in the form of a one-time password, or traditional push notifications, definitely adds friction to the phishing process, but with proxy-in-the-middle attacks becoming easier and more common, the effectiveness of these forms of MFA is growing increasingly easier to defeat. WebAuthn-based MFA comes in multiple forms; a key, known as a passkey, stored on a phone, computer, Yubikey, or similar dongle is the most common example. Thousands of sites now support WebAuthn, and it’s easy for most end users to enroll. As a side note, MFA based on U2F, the predecessor standard to WebAuthn, also prevents adversary-in-the-middle attacks from succeeding, although the latter provides flexibility and additional security.

    "title": "New study accuses LM Arena of gaming its popular AI benchmark",
    "article_text": "The popular AI vibe test may not be as fair as it seems. The rapid proliferation of AI chatbots has made it difficult to know which models are actually improving and which are falling behind. Traditional academic benchmarks only tell you so much, which has led many to lean on vibes-based analysis from LM Arena. However, a new study claims this popular AI ranking platform is rife with unfair practices, favoring large companies that just so happen to rank near the top of the index. The site's operators, however, say the study draws the wrong conclusions. LM Arena was created in 2023 as a research project at the University of California, Berkeley. The pitch is simple—users feed a prompt into two unidentified AI models in the \"Chatbot Arena\" and evaluate the outputs to vote on the one they like more. This data is aggregated in the LM Arena leaderboard that shows which models people like the most, which can helptrack improvementsin AI models. Companies are paying more attention to this ranking as the AI market heats up. Google noted when it released Gemini 2.5 Pro that the model debuted at the top of the LM Arena leaderboard, where it remains to this day. Meanwhile, DeepSeek's strong performance in the Chatbot Arena earlier this year helped to catapult it to the upper echelons of the LLM race. The researchers, hailing from Cohere Labs, Princeton, and MIT, believe AI developers may have placed too much stock in LM Arena. The new study,available on the preprint arXiv server, claims the arena rankings are distorted by practices that make it easier for proprietary chatbots to outperform open ones. The authors say LM Arena allows developers of proprietary large language models (LLMs) to test multiple versions of their AI on the platform. However, only the highest performing one is added to the public leaderboard. Some AI developers are taking extreme advantage of the private testing option. The study reports that Meta tested a whopping 27 private variants ofLlama-4before release. Google is also a beneficiary of LM Arena's private testing system, having tested 10 variants of Gemini and Gemma between January and March 2025. This study also calls out LM Arena for what appears to be much greater promotion of private models like Gemini, ChatGPT, and Claude. Developers collect data on model interactions from the Chatbot Arena API, but teams focusing on open models consistently get the short end of the stick. The researchers point out that certain models appear in arena faceoffs much more often, with Google and OpenAI together accounting for over 34 percent of collected model data. Firms like xAI, Meta, and Amazon are also disproportionately represented in the arena. Therefore, those firms get more vibemarking data compared to the makers of open models. The study authors have a list of suggestions to make LM Arena more fair. Several of the paper's recommendations are aimed at correcting the imbalance of privately tested commercial models, for example, by limiting the number of models a group can add and retract before releasing one. The study also suggests showing all model results, even if they aren't final. However, the site's operatorstake issuewith some of the paper's methodology and conclusions. LM Arena points out that the pre-release testing features have not been kept secret, with aMarch 2024 blog postfeaturing a brief explanation of the system. They also contend that model creators don't technically choose the version that is shown. Instead, the site simply doesn't show non-public versions for simplicity's sake. When a developer releases the final version, that's what LM Arena adds to the leaderboard. One place the two sides may find alignment is on the question of unequal matchups. The study authors call for fair sampling, which will ensure open models appear in Chatbot Arena at a rate similar to the likes of Gemini and ChatGPT. LM Arena has suggested it will work to make the sampling algorithm more varied so you don't always get the big commercial models. That would send more eval data to small players, giving them the chance to improve and challenge the big commercial models. LM Arena recently announced it was forming a corporate entity to continue its work. With money on the table, the operators need to ensure Chatbot Arena continues figuring into the development of popular models. However, it's unclear whether this is an objectively better way to evaluate chatbots versus academic tests. As people vote on vibes, there's a real possibility we are pushing models to adopt sycophantic tendencies. This may have helped nudge ChatGPT intosuck-up territoryin recent weeks, a move that OpenAI hashastily revertedafter widespread anger.

    "title": "New material may help us build Predator-style thermal vision specs",
    "article_text": "Films of IR-sensitive material only tens of nanometers thick are tough to make. Military-grade infrared vision goggles use detectors made of mercury cadmium telluride, a semiconducting material that’s particularly sensitive to infrared radiation. Unfortunately, you need to keep detectors that use this material extremely cool—roughly at liquid nitrogen temperatures—for them to work. “Their cooling systems are very bulky and very heavy,” says Xinyuan Zhang, an MIT researcher and the lead author of a new study that looked for alternative IR-sensitive materials. Added weight was a sacrifice the manufacturers of high-end night-vision systems were mostly willing to make because cooling-free alternatives offered much worse performance. To fix this, the MIT researchers developed a new ultra-thin material that can sense infrared radiation without any cooling and outperforms cooled detectors at the same time. And they want to use it to turn thermal vision goggles into thermal vision spectacles. Cooling-freeinfrared detectorshave been around since before World War II and mostly relied on pyroelectric materials like tourmaline that change their temperature upon absorbing infrared radiation. This temperature change, in turn, generates an electric current that can be measured to get a readout from the detector. Although these materials worked, they had their issues. Operating at room temperature caused a lot of random atomic motion in the pyroelectric material, which introduced electrical noise that made it difficult to detect faint infrared signals. In cooled mercury cadmium telluride detectors, this atomic motion is dramatically lower. “Cooling them down to liquid nitrogen temperatures is done to suppress the internal noise,” Zhang explains. Her team figured getting this kind of low-noise performance out of pyroelectric materials was theoretically possible. The caveat was that these materials need to be absurdly thin to get the noise down. And this made manufacturing a bit tricky. The process of fabricating ultra-thin films (between one and a few tens of nanometers) made of various materials is called epitaxy and is used in manufacturing chips and two-dimensional semiconductors. It relies on growing crystalline structures on a substrate material. The key challenge is getting those crystalline films off the substrate without damaging them—they tended to stick to the substrates like fried eggs to an old pan. One way to do that is called remote epitaxy, where an intermediate layer made out of graphene or other material is introduced between the substrate and the growing crystals. Once the epitaxy process is done, the substrate and everything on it are soaked in a chemical solution that dissolves this intermediate layer, leaving the crystalline film intact. This works but is expensive, difficult to scale, and takes a lot of time. To make the process cheaper and faster, the MIT team had to grow the crystals directly on the substrate, without any intermediate layers. What they were trying to achieve was a non-stick frying pan effect but at an atomically small scale. The material that prevented the crystalline films from sticking to substrates wasn’t Teflon but lead. When the team was experimenting with growing different films in their previous studies, they noticed that there was a material that easily came off the substrate, yet retained an atomically smooth surface: PMN-PT, or lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate. The lead atoms in the PMN-PT weakened the covalent bonds between the film and the substrate, preventing the electrons from jumping through the interface between the two materials. “We just had to exert a bit of stress to induce a crack at the interface between the film and the substrate and we could realize the liftoff,” Zhang told Ars. “Very simple—we could remove these films within a second.” But PMN-PT, besides its inherent non-stickiness, had more tricks up its sleeves; it had exceptional pyroelectric properties. Once the team realized they could manufacture and peel away PMN-PT films at will, they tried something a bit more complex: a cooling-free, far-infrared radiation detector. “We were trying to achieve performance comparable with cooled detectors,” Zhang says. The detector they constructed was made from 100 pieces of 10-nanometer-thin PMN-PT films, each about 60 square microns, that the team transferred onto a silicon chip. This produced a 100-pixel infrared sensor. Tests with ever smaller changes in temperature indicated that it outperformed state-of-the art night vision systems and was sensitive to radiation across the entire infrared spectrum. (Mercury cadmium telluride detectors respond to a much narrower band of wavelengths.) But before the US Air Force that funded this study gets its predator-like thermal vision spectacles—or even super-thin, lightweight FIR sensors—there are a few challenges left to overcome. Sensors and their cooling systems alone are not enough to build a good night-vision system. “We are still working to develop this into a functional night-vision device. We still need some optical design to focus light onto our detector, some power supply, circuitry, and we need to integrate this into our goggles,” Zhang says. She said that, although the infrared detecting layers are very thin themselves, finding space for all the other parts will be the next problem to solve on the way toward miniaturizing night-vision devices further. “I think night-vision contact lenses will be challenging to build, but I expect our technology could potentially be used to make something that looks like normal spectacles,” Zhang suggested. Other applications she is considering are infrared sensors that could enable autonomous cars to orient themselves better in difficult weather conditions, like during a heavy fog. But there’s a lot we can potentially do with easily manufactured ultra-thin films. Zhang thinks the atomic liftoff method developed by her team can be applied to other films, not just ones containing lead. Her team suspects that it can induce the same non-stick effect using lead in the substrate, rather than in the film. This should open a path toward using them in wearable sensors, flexible transistors, or even very small computers. “If we can generalize this method to other materials, we can use it in many other applications,” Zhang claims.

This article originally appeared onInside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy, and the environment. Sign up for their newsletterhere. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) kicked off a Wednesday hearing criticizing ​​the Trump administration for cutting science funding, firing federal scientists, and triggering policy uncertainties that she said threaten to undermine the foundation for America’s global leadership. Collins, chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said the administration’s abrupt cancellation of grants and laying off scientists has little or no justification. “These actions put our leadership in biomedical innovation at real risk and must be reversed,” she said. Her warning came as American University’s Institute for Macroeconomic & Policy Analysis published a study Wednesday showing how major cuts to federal funding for scientific research could cause economic damage equivalent to a major recession. In the first 100 days ofTrump 2.0, the administration has fired 1,300 employees from the National Institutes of Health, the largest funder of biomedical research in the world, and canceled more than $2 billion in federal research grants. Earlier this week, the administration dismissed all the scientists and other authors working on the next authoritative look at how climate change is affecting the US. In one such cutback, the Trump administration stripped almost $4 million in federal funding from Princeton’s climate research department as it determined that Princeton’s work did not align with the objectives of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The White House said Princeton’s research on topics including sea level rise, coastal flooding, and global warming promoted “exaggerated and implausible climate threats,” according to aUS Department of Commerce press releaseearlier this month explaining the funding cuts. The White House is expected to propose additional reductions in discretionary spending as part of the annual budget process. Federal agencies like the NIH and the National Science Foundation are among the few funding basic and applied scientific research. The study, from a group of American University economists, is among the first to run preliminary macroeconomic estimates of the cost of the Department of Government Efficiency and the Trump administration’s cuts to public spending on science. The study’s macroeconomic model used various scenarios, one of which looked at 25 percent cuts to public research and development spending. A cut of that magnitude, the study found, would reduce gross domestic product (GDP) by approximately 3.8 percent in the long run, over roughly 25 to 30 years. It’s a decline comparable to that of the Great Recession ending in 2009, albeit over the span of years rather than months. Under this scenario, government revenue would decrease by approximately 4.3 percent each year. If R&D spending were to be cut in half, GDP would decrease by more than 7.5 percent, the economists found. It also would drastically affect living standards moving forward and reduce government revenue by 8.6 percent annually. The study describes how private businesses lack the financial incentive to fund basic and applied scientific research and development and how government agencies like the NIH and NSF ameliorate the market failure. Investing in basic science can often be too risky for the private sector to take on, said Ignacio González Garcia, one of the report’s authors and an assistant professor of economics at American University. The returns of basic science come long after and can be too diffuse to be worthwhile for any single private firm taking on the risk. But basic science is what drives the technological innovation and progress that leads to economic growth, he said. “This is about the society that we build together, how we invest in the future,” González Garcia said. “Everything starts with basic science—everything starts with stuff that most of the time is publicly funded.” The cuts to the federal agencies have largely included funding for academic medical centers and other institutions. The Association of American Universities sued the Department of Health & Human Services and the NIH in February over NIH funding cuts the group said would destroy medical research at American universities and put quality of life in the US at stake. “The effects will be immediate and devastating,” the group wrote inits legal complaint, filed in a federal district court in Massachusetts. “… Even at larger, well resourced institutions, this unlawful action will impose enormous harms, including on these institutions’ ability to contribute to medical and scientific breakthroughs.” The group filedanother suitApril 11 after the administration announced it would attempt to cut funding for Department of Energy research grants to colleges and universities.

    "title": "The 2025 Aston Martin Vantage: Achingly beautiful and thrilling to drive",
    "article_text": "It took time to get confident with the Vantage, and it did not like rain. I'm not sure I can remember another car that took as long to get comfortable with as the 2025 Aston Martin Vantage. It's an achingly beautiful machine, from the outside at least. And by the week's end, I had my first glimpses into how it can deliver driver engagement with the best of them. By then I'd also gotten over my disappointment with the interior and, sadly yet again, had the \"British cars with crap electronics\" stereotype confirmed once more. Painted the same striking shade of Podium Green as one of Formula 1's safety cars, the Vantage is one of the most eye-catching cars we've tested in a while. In person, that giant front grille dominates things, but all around the car you see the influence of the aerodynamicists and engineers who want to bend the airflow to their needs; cutting drag here, adding downforce there, feeding a cooling duct or venting waste heat. The way the wheel arches stretch out from the doors reminds me of the One-77 supercar from a few years ago, but it's all a thoroughly modern shape here. That sculpted and vented hood contains the Vantage's 4.0 L twin-turbo V8. With 656 hp (490 kW) and 590 lb-ft (800 Nm), it's the most powerful Vantage to date, eclipsing the time the companybolted some Eaton superchargers to a 2-ton Chesterfield sofa on wheels. ZF'sexcellent 8HP automatic transmissionsends that power and torque to the rear wheels, which arrived wearing Vantage-specific versions of Michelin's latest Pilot Sport 5 tires. Aston Martin's bonded aluminum spaceframe platform gives the Vantage an extremely stiff chassis, and the car's vehicle dynamics controller takes inputs from accelerometers and sensors in the powertrain, brakes, and the electronic differential to flatter the driver's abilities. At first, that translated as an almost-nervous feeling. The variable ratio steering is very direct and in Sport mode (the default) has quite a lot of assistance, but the 21-inch front wheels are prone to tram lining on heavily used roads, and you also have to remember to turn off the lane keeping assistance each time you start the car or it will attempt to intervene in corners. Visibility is good, and it's an easy car to drive slowly, but as you increase the speed, it's as if the car begins to sit up on its contact patches and move around. Just a little, and I'm not talking anywhere near the tires' limit of adhesion, but enough to remind you that you're at the wheel of something light, powerful, and responsive. It's a rare trick to pull off at sensible speeds, and one that only reallyFerrarihas mastered until now, at least in my experience. I just wish it hadn't taken me a week to relax enough to trust the Vantage and start enjoying it. A track session would probably have gotten me there much faster, as it did our correspondent Alex Goywhen he first drove the Vantage last year. Aston Martin has come a long way since the days of wood-trimmed interiors. Even further from the days when you'd findexposed screwsholding those bits of walnut in place. The interior got a comprehensive redesign last year, including a new 10.25-inch infotainment system that was developed in-house to replace the old Mercedes-sourced system. But seated inside the car, the interior lacks much of the exterior's drama, and that's a real shame. But it's made up for by the bits of the exterior that you can still see—the pod-like side view mirrors out on their stalks are a visual delight. The new infotainment human-machine interface was a little confusing at first; pairing my phone took about 10 minutes but worked out in the end, and wireless Apple CarPlay behaved itself throughout the week. When starting the car there was sometimes a lengthy wait for the infotainment to boot up, as if the hardware wasn't quite powerful enough for the software stack on top. Those are very minor complaints compared to what happened when it rained really hard, though. I had been planning to drive the Vantage to dinner, but upon getting in the car and turning it on, I realized it had other ideas. A number of yellow glyphs remained brightly illuminated on the digital main display—including traction control. A series of notifications informed me of what else wasn't working, including the ability to switch the car into Wet mode. With the numbers \"$264,300\" and \"656 hp\" at the forefront of my mind, the DC metro sufficed for that trip. Later that evening, the air still damp but no longer raining, it was if it had all been a dream. A push of the start button and everything lit up and then went dim as normal. The infotainment even booted in an acceptable time. My guess is that there was an improperly sealed connector somewhere, and in torrential rain, water got where it shouldn't. Regardless, the car let me down when it was supposed to take me somewhere. As a former resident of the UK, it saddens me to no end that the stereotype about British cars and their electronics is as true today as ever, but the fact remains that every British car I drive, from Minis to McLarens, manages to have some kind of digital or electrical foible that should have been ironed out. Do better, Britain! With a base price of $191,000, the Vantage is competing with a number of other sports cars, but its biggest rival has to be the Porsche 911 Turbo. It's a much more dramatic car than the Porsche, in all the meanings of that word, both good and bad. Credit:\n\n          \n          Jonathan Gitlin Sure looks good though.

    "title": "Neanderthals invented their own bone weapon technology by 80,000 years ago",
    "article_text": "Neanderthals used sleek bone projectiles to hunt big game. Archaeologists recently unearthed a bone projectile point someone dropped on a cave floor between 70,000 and 80,000 years ago—which, based on its location, means that saidsomeonemust have been a Neanderthal. The point (or in paleoarchaeologist Liubov V. Golovanova and colleagues’ super-technical archaeological terms, “a unique pointy bone artifact”) is the oldest bone tip from a hunting weapon ever found in Europe. It’s also evidence that Neanderthals figured out how to shape bone into smooth, aerodynamic projectiles on their own, without needing to copy those upstartHomo sapiens. Along with the bone tools, jewelry, and even rope that archaeologists have found at other Neanderthal sites, the projectile is one more clue pointing to the fact that Neanderthals were actually pretty sharp. Archaeologists found the bone point in Mezmaiskaya Cave, high in the Caucasus Mountains (Mezmaiskaya is also home to the remains of three Neanderthals who lived around 90,000 years ago; anthropologists sequenced samples of their DNA in earlier studies). Herbivore teeth from the same layer of sediment dated to around 70,000 years old, and the bone point’s position near the bottom of that layer probably makes it closer to 80,000 or 70,000 years old. That makes it the oldest bone projectile point ever found in Europe (so far). At about 9 centimeters long and just 6 millimeters wide at its base, the point is much too light to be of much use as a thrusting weapon, which means it must have been meant to strike from a distance. And it’s shaped for the purpose, sleek and straight. The point lay near an ancient hearth, which the Neanderthals had built “in a natural hollow on top of a large limestone block.” A few stone tools, along with debris from flint-knapping, lay scattered nearby, hinting that the Neanderthals probably sat near the hearth to make and retouch their tools. Ten thousand years before them, other Neanderthals had lived and died here. And thousands of years later, still others would leave behind more traces of their lives and handiwork. But the bone spear tip, as Golovanova and colleagues point out, is unique (and pointy). The point is shaped from the hard outer layer of bone (called cortical bone), probably from one of the massive leg bones of a bison. Under the microscope, Golovanova and colleagues could still see the grain pattern that marked where muscle once attached to the bone, even though the original knob of bone that formed the attachment had been ground flat and smooth by the Neanderthal who made the point. Golovanova and colleagues’ microscopes also revealed shallow, parallel grooves where Neanderthal crafters had used stone tools and carefully scraped, ground, and polished the bone into exactly the right shape without breaking or splintering it. A couple of discolored spots also reveal that the point’s maker hardened its tip in a fire. And if the tip doesn't seem as sharp as you'd expect, Golovanova and colleagues say it's sharpenough. \"To be an effective hunting weapon,\" write the archaeologists, \"the bone point does not need to have a sharply pointed (needle-like) distal end (in contrast to bone awls), but it needs to have a strong, conical tip, symmetrical outlines, and a straight profile.\" Traces of bitumen, or tar, on the point—which Golovanova and colleagues identified using spectroscopy—show that it must have been secured to its wooden haft with the sticky substance. That’s also howNeanderthals mounted many of their stone tools, so it’s not surprising that they’d do the same with a bone point. But making and using tar or resin requiresa fair amount of technical know-how, and it’s easy to get it wrong and end up with an unusable mess. Earlier hominins made bone tools, too; archaeologists have founda hippo femur hand axmade byHomo erectusand even someknapped bone dating back 1.5 million years. But those tools were roughly shaped, using the same chipping and flaking methods their makers would have used on stone. For some things, that works, but for something like the streamlined spear point from Mezmaiskaya, working bone takes different techniques: less flaking, more grinding. Working bone into a streamlined, aerodynamic spear point, then hafting it onto a shaft with tar that had to be extracted and refined before use takes some sophisticated knowledge and skill. And it’s clear that the Neanderthals developed that skill on their own, instead of acquiring it from our species through some sort of prehistoricITAR violation. Even so, Golovanova and colleagues note in their paper that “the production technology of bone-tipped hunting weapons used by Neanderthals was in the nascent level in comparison to those used and introduced by modern humans.” (Which seems a bit rude.) A small crack at the tip of the spear point shows that some Neanderthal hunter used it at least once and managed to hit something. Golovanova and colleagues examined the crack and the finer network of cracks (visible in micro-CT images) that spread back and out from the original break. Those cracks closely resembled damage from a head-on impact, which archaeologists have seen in bone tools from other sites and in experimental studies (also called “archaeologists made some bone-tipped spears and threw them at things to see what would happen,” which is an excellent approach to science). And apparently a bone spear point was worth trying to fix up and reuse, because traces of grinding show that someone tried to smooth out the crack, probably with a stone tool. What kinds of prey were the Neanderthals of Mezmaiskaya Cave hunting? Based on the bones found in the cave, many of which show marks from cutting and scraping, the local menu included some birds and small mammals, but also bigger game like bison, deer, relatives of modern horses, and wild sheep and goats. Archaeologists have found plenty of evidence that Neanderthals used bone tools for all sorts of things, from shaping and retouching stone to softening animal hides. The projectile point, though, is the first evidence that Neanderthals knew how to carefully work bone into a particular shape, instead of just picking up a conveniently shaped rib to smooth out some hides. Using specific processes to sculpt bone, combined with using ocher to decorate things and using tar and resin to stick things together, is part of what anthropologists have defined as “modern” human behavior. And it looks likeHomo sapiensand Neanderthals each worked most of it out on their own, separately, long before the two species met. There’s good reason to think that the two groups eventually traded some key bits of technology here and there, but that exchange wasn’t the one-way street that anthropologists once expected.

    "title": "Google is quietly testing ads in AI chatbots",
    "article_text": "Unsurprisingly, an advertising company is finding more places to run ads. Google has built an enormously successful business around the idea of putting ads in search results. Its most recent quarterly results showed the company made more than $50 billion from search ads, but what happens if AI becomes the dominant form of finding information? Google is preparing for that possibility by testing chatbot ads, but you won't see them in Google's Gemini AI—at least not yet. A report fromBloombergdescribes how Google began working on a plan in 2024 to adapt AdSense ads to a chatbot experience. Usually, AdSense ads appear in search results and are scattered around websites. Google ran a small test of chatbot ads late last year, partnering with select AI startups, including AI search apps iAsk and Liner. The testing must have gone well because Google is now allowing more chatbot makers to sign up for AdSense. \"AdSense for Search is available for websites that want to show relevant ads in their conversational AI experiences,\" said a Google spokesperson. If people continue shifting to using AI chatbots to find information, this expansion of AdSense could help prop up profits. There's no hint of advertising in Google's own Gemini chatbot orAI Mode search, but the day may be coming when you won't get the clean, ad-free experience at no cost. Google is racing to catch up to OpenAI, which has a substantial lead in chatbot market share despite Gemini's recent growth. This has led Google to freely provide some of its most capable AI tools, including Deep Research, Gemini Pro, and Veo 2 video generation. There are limits to how much you can use most of these features with a free account, but it must be costing Google a boatload of cash. Generative AI in general is very expensive to run, with big AI players spending billions annually on AI accelerators and the power it takes to run them. This is a big problem, as no one, not even Google or OpenAI, has managed to turn generative AI into a profitable consumer business. Running ads in free AI products has the potential to defray some of those costs. At the same time, there are hints that Google may be looking to expand its AI subscription tiers, which could also help make generative AI a moneymaker. Gemini users have noticed a few places where Google's subscription plans may be leaking. After the discovery of new \"Gemini Ultra\" strings in the Gemini app, users have also started seeing messages that encourage them to upgrade to \"Gemini Ultra,\" an apparent subscription plan that doesn't exist yet. This appears to be different from the olderGemini Ultra AI models—Google hasn't used this branding since the Gemini 1.5 branch. The only Google AI subscription currently offered is Gemini Advanced, which costs $20 per month. Competitors like OpenAI and Anthropic havehigher $200 monthly plans, so Google may be heading in the same direction. Google I/O later this month will probably help clarify how Google plans to monetize Gemini, but the company appears to be getting all the pieces in place. Before long, free chatbots could have interstitial AdSense ads unless you pay for premium access, and Google could be upselling us on a more expensive version of Gemini services. The free ride may be coming to an end. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "article_text": "There are four broad categories—physics, chemistry, biology, and social science—liberally defined. It's time again to honor the winners of the annual Dance Your PhD contest, where eager young scientists attempt to convey the concepts of their doctoral theses through dance. This year'soverall winneris the University of Helsinki's Sulo Roukka, who researcheschemesthesis, specifically how people experience different sensory food compounds like capsaicin (hot) or menthol (cool). Aswe've reported previously, theDance Your PhDcontest was established in 2008 by science journalist John Bohannon, who is now a data scientist at South Park Commons. Bohannontold Slate in 2011that he came up with the idea while trying to figure out how to get a group of stressed-out PhD students, who were in the middle of defending their theses, to let off a little steam. So he put together a dance party at Austria'sInstitute of Molecular Biotechnology, including a contest for whichever candidate could best explain their thesis topics through interpretive dance. The contest was such a hit that Bohannon started getting emails asking when the next one would be—and Dance Your PhD has continued ever since. It's now in its 17th year. There are four broad categories: physics, chemistry, biology, and social science, with a fairly liberal interpretation of what topics fall under each. All category winners receive $750. Roukka won the chemistry category and, as the overall champion, will receive an additional $2,750. This year's sponsor is Sandbox AQ, an AI company specializing in large quantitative models. The 2025 competition also included a special $750 prize for dances related to AI and quantum science, won by Arfor Houwman of the University of Innsbruck for his dance video explaining the physics of laser cooling and ultracold atoms. Bohannon noted that the winners were all European scientists. \"This year, American scientists did not seem to be in the mood to dance,\"he told Science. \"Lucky for the world, Europe's scientists have doubled their creativity and enthusiasm.\" Roukku's doctoral thesis is entitled \"Insights into oral chemesthetic perception: A focus on food-related behavior.\" Chemesthesis is less about taste (or smell) and more about chemical-induced reactions on the skin of mucous membranes. That includes capsaicin in chili peppers, menthol, the tingling in response to carbonated beverages, and the production of tears in response to cutting onions. Such reactions typically occur when the trigeminal nerves, responsible for sensation in the face, are triggered by such compounds. Or as Roukku's lyrics—which focus on \"hot\" capsaicin and \"cool\" menthol—put it: Feel the heat, feel the freeze, it's chemistry, oh please.Tiny sensors deep inside set your tastebuds on a ride.Capsaicin, burning high, menthol chills, oh my my!Trigeminal pathways light, sparking fire, bringing ice.

    "article_text": "Tesla board contacted exec search firms to find Musk replacement, WSJ reports. Tesla today denied a report that its board contacted executive search firms to find a replacement for CEO Elon Musk. The Wall Street Journalreportedlast night that about a month ago, \"Tesla's board got serious about looking for Musk's successor\" and that board \"members reached out to several executive search firms to work on a formal process for finding Tesla's next chief executive.\" Tesla's official X account then posted astatementattributed to board chairperson Robyn Denholm saying that \"there was a media report erroneously claiming that the Tesla Board had contacted recruitment firms to initiate a CEO search at the company.\" \"This is absolutely false (and this was communicated to the media before the report was published). The CEO of Tesla is Elon Musk and the Board is highly confident in his ability to continue executing on the exciting growth plan ahead,\" Denholm's statement said. The Wall Street Journal report said that Tesla didn't provide a statement before publication and attributed information about the CEO search to people familiar with the discussions. Musk claimed in apost on Xthat the Journal \"fail[ed] to include an unequivocal denial beforehand by the Tesla board of directors\" and alleged that the WSJ committed \"an EXTREMELY BAD BREACH OF ETHICS\" by publishing \"a DELIBERATELY FALSE ARTICLE.\" The Journal article notes that at the time of the reported outreach to executive search firms, Tesla's stock was sinking, and some investors were \"irritated\" about Musk spending more time working for the White House's DOGE project and less for the carmaker. The article said: Tensions had been mounting at the company. Sales and profits were deteriorating rapidly. Musk was spending much of his time in Washington. Around that time, Tesla's board met with Musk for an update. Board members told him he needed to spend more time on Tesla, according to people familiar with the meeting. And he needed to say so publicly. Musk didn't push back. Musk subsequentlysaid in an April 22 call with investorsthat \"starting next month, I'll be allocating far more of my time to Tesla now that the major work of establishing the Department of Government Efficiency is done.\" The Journal report said that after Musk's public statement, the Tesla \"board narrowed its focus to a major search firm, according to the people familiar with the discussions. The current status of the succession planning couldn't be determined. It is also unclear if Musk, himself a Tesla board member, was aware of the effort, or if his pledge to spend more time at Tesla has affected succession planning.\" Tesla's eight-member board has been criticized for having members with close ties to Musk. Last year, a Delaware judge whoinvalidated a $55.8 billion pay packageawarded to Musk said that most of the board members \"were beholden to Musk or had compromising conflicts.\" That includes Musk's brother, Kimbal, and longtime Musk friend James Murdoch, said the ruling from Delaware Court of Chancery Judge Kathaleen McCormick. The judge also wrote that Denholm \"derived the vast majority of her wealth from her compensation as a Tesla director\" and took a \"lackadaisical approach to her oversight obligations.\" Denholm later defended Musk's pay,telling shareholdersthat the large sum was needed to keep the CEO motivated.

    "title": "Microsoft raises prices on Xbox hardware, says “some” holiday games will be $80",
    "article_text": "You'll have to pay $80 to $100 more for an Xbox console going forward. Microsoft is increasing the recommended asking price of Xbox hardware and accessories worldwide starting today and will start charging $79.99 for some new first-party games this holiday season.The announcementcomes after \"careful consideration given market conditions and the rising cost of development,\" Microsoft said. In the United States, this means Microsoft's premiere Xbox Series X will now cost $599.99 for a unit with a disc drive (up from $499.99), while the Digital version will cost $549.99 (up from $449.99). On the lower end, a 1 TB Xbox Series S will now cost $429.99 (up from $349.99), while a 512GB unit will cost $379.99 (up from $299.99). The new prices are already reflected on Microsoft's official online store, and Microsoft says it will \"provide updated recommended pricing to local retailers.\" That might leave a small window where you can get Xbox hardware and accessories from those retailers at the older, lower price while supplies remain available. For headsets specifically, Microsoft said that pricing will change \"in the US and Canada only,\" a potential recognition of the Trump administration's tariffs on foreign goods imported into the United States. Microsoft also warned that \"Xbox Series S and X availability may continue to change over time depending on the retailer and by country\" as those tariffs threaten to upend international trade worldwide. On the software side, Microsoft said the increase to $79.99 will apply to both digital and physical versions of \"some\" new games this holiday season. Existing Xbox games will not be seeing a price increase, and \"different games and expansions will continue to be offered at a variety of price points.\" Today's announcement marks the first time in the history of the Xbox line that Microsoft has raised the recommended asking price for its gaming hardware in the United States. The move stands in stark contrast to the Xbox One era, for example, when the struggling Xbox Onesaw a series of price dropsthat undercut the launch price by a full 50 percent after just three years on the market. While Sonyraised the price of the PlayStation 5 in many international regionsin 2022, those price increases did not affect the United States (which remains the largest market for game console sales). The Xbox Series X is now substantially more expensive than the PS5 in the US, where you cancurrentlybuy a \"slim\" console bundled withAstro Botfor $449.99. Microsoft's foreshadowing of $80 first-party software, meanwhile, comes just weeks after Nintendoannounced the same price point for Switch 2 launch titleMario Kart World, and just a few years after$70 became the de facto price ceilingfor big-budget games. Despite the nominal sticker shock, though, the new $80 price level isbroadly in line with the last few decades of inflation-adjusted game pricing. The hardware price increases could also be seen as a response to higher-than-normal inflation in the years since the 2020 launch of the Xbox Series line. The $499.99 Microsoft charged for the Xbox Series X in the US in November of 2020, for instance, is worth about $615 in March 2025 dollars, according tothe Bureau of Labor Statistics' CPI inflation calculator.

    "title": "NASA’s Psyche spacecraft hits a speed bump on the way to a metal asteroid",
    "article_text": "“This kind of thing happens, and that’s why we build redundancy into our missions.\" NASA's Psyche spacecraft, located nearly 150 million miles from Earth on the way to an unexplored metal asteroid, has stopped firing its engines after detecting a problem in its propulsion system. NASApublished an update Tuesdayrevealing that the robotic spacecraft shut off its plasma thrusters earlier this month. The news wasn't widely shared until Wednesday, when NASA science chiefNicky Fox posted it on X. \"Engineers with NASA’s Psyche mission are working to determine what caused a recent decrease in fuel pressure in the spacecraft’s propulsion system,\" the agency said. The spacecraft detected the drop in pressure April 1 inside the line that feeds xenon fuel to the spacecraft's four plasma thrusters. Sensors aboard the Psyche probe detected a pressure reduction in the xenon fuel line from about 36 pounds per square inch to about 26 psi. \"As designed, the orbiter powered off the thrusters in response to the decrease,\" NASA said. The Psyche spacecraft uses solar electric propulsion, a highly efficient means of maneuvering through space that relies on solar-generated electricity and more than a ton of xenon gas stored in seven 22-gallon (82-liter) tanks. Inside each of the mission's four thrusters, an electromagnetic field ionizes the xenon gas before expelling the ions to produce thrust. Louise Prockter, director of NASA's planetary science division, said engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California are looking into the problem. So far, there's no effect on the Psyche spacecraft's trajectory. Psyche's plasma thrusters can remain unpowered until at least mid-June before the spacecraft would begin to drift off course, according to NASA. Mission managers decided to keep Psyche's engines turned off until they better understand the pressure decrease. If engineers trace the problem to the fuel line itself, NASA has the option of switching to a backup fuel line to resume thrusting. \"This kind of thing happens, and that’s why we build redundancy into our missions,\" Prockter said at a meeting of Mars scientists Wednesday. \"We don't have any concerns at the moment about it, but we’re obviously keeping tabs on it.” Each electric thruster on Psyche generates just 250 milli-newtons of thrust, roughly equivalent to the weight of three quarters. But they can operate for months at a time, and over the course of a multi-year cruise, these thrusters provide a more efficient means of propulsion than conventional rockets. The plasma thrusters are reshaping the Psyche spacecraft's path toward its destination, a metal-rich asteroid also named Psyche. The spacecraft's four electric engines, known as Hall effect thrusters, were supplied by a Russian company named Fakel. Most of the other components in Psyche's propulsion system—controllers, xenon fuel tanks, propellant lines, and valves—come from other companies or the spacecraft's primary manufacturer, Maxar Space Systems, in California. The Psyche mission is heading first for Mars, where the spacecraft will use the planet's gravity next year to slingshot itself into the asteroid belt, setting up for arrival and orbit insertion around the asteroid Psyche in August 2029. Psychelaunched in October 2023aboard a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket on the opening leg of a six-year sojourn through the Solar System. The mission's total cost adds up to more than $1.4 billion, including development of the spacecraft and its instruments, the launch, operations, and anexperimental laser communications packagehitching a ride to deep space with Psyche. Psyche, the asteroid, is the size of Massachusetts and circles the Sun in between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. No spacecraft has visited Psyche before. Of the approximately 1 million asteroids discovered so far, scientists say only nine have a metal-rich signature like Psyche. The team of scientists who put together the Psyche mission have little idea of what to expect when the spacecraft gets there in 2029. Metallic asteroids like Psyche are a mystery. Most of Psyche's properties are unknown other than estimates of its density and composition. Predictions about the look of Psyche's craters, cliffs, and color have inspired artists to create a cacophony of illustrations, often showing sharp spikes and grooves alien to rocky worlds. In a little more than five years, assuming NASA gets past Psyche's propulsion problem, scientists will supplant speculation with solid data.

    "title": "Fortnite will return to iOS as court slams Apple’s “interference“ and ”cover-up“",
    "article_text": "Judge refers Apple for criminal contempt over hiding its attempt to thwart a 2021 injunction. Epic CEO and founder Tim Sweeney said in a Zoom call with press Wednesday night that the company is \"going to do everything we can to bringFortniteback to the iOS App Store next week.\" That decision comes after a federal district courtfound late Wednesdaythat Apple was in \"willful violation\" ofa 2021 injunctiondesigned to allow iOS developers to steer customers to alternate payment processors for in-app purchases. That 2021 injunction wound its way through years of appellate review until January 2024, when the Supreme Courtdeclined to hear a final attempt by Appleto overturn it. Since then, the District Court for Northern California has been holding a series of evidentiary hearings examining the internal development of Apple's so-called \"compliance plan\" for the injunction. Ina scathing Wednesday night order, District Court Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers determined that Apple had engaged in a plan to \"thwart the injunction's goals,\" and then engaged in an \"obvious cover-up\" to prevent that plan from being revealed. Apple's response to the initial injunction \"strained credulity,\" the judge said, by charging a new 27 percent commission for off-app purchases and adding new barriers such as \"full page 'scare' screens\" to \"increase friction\" for users seeking off-app payment alternatives. These moves demonstrated Apple's intent to \"continue its anticompetitive conduct solely to maintain its revenue stream,\" the judge writes. More than that, Judge Gonzalez Rogers said that Apple's in-court testimony in initial hearings on that conduct were in \"stark contrast\" to evidence that came to the court later via contemporaneous business documents. Those showed that \"Apple knew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option,\" the judge wrote. Apple VP of Finance Alex Roman \"outright lied under oath\" in testimony about Apple's internal deliberations, according to the court order, while CEO Tim Cook \"chose poorly\" in actively deciding not to comply with the court's injunction. Judge Gonzalez Rogers wrote that Apple's conduct in court represents a \"clear and convincing violation\" of her initial injunction that has been referred to the District Attorney for Northern California \"to investigate whether criminal contempt proceedings are appropriate.\" \"Apple’s continued attempts to interfere with competition will not be tolerated,\" Gonzalez Rogers wrote. \"This is an injunction, not a negotiation. There are no do-overs once a party willfully disregards a court order. Time is of the essence. The Court will not tolerate further delays.\" In a statement provided to Ars Technica, an Apple spokesperson said, \"We strongly disagree with the decision. We will comply with the court’s order and we will appeal.\" With the new court order in place, Epic says it will once again submit a version ofFortniteto the iOS App Store in the US in the next week or so. That new version will offer players the option to use standard Apple App Store payments or its own, cheaper \"Epic Direct Payment\" system to purchase in-game currency and items. That would mirror the system that was briefly in place for iOS players in August 2020, whenEpic added alternate payment options to iOSFortnitein intentional violation of what were then Apple's store policies. Apple removedFortnitefrom the iOS App Store hours later, setting off a legal battle that seems to finally be reaching its conclusion. For those few hours when Epic Direct Payments were available on iOSFortnitein 2020, Sweeney said that about 50 percent of customers \"decided to give Epic a shot,\" going through an additional step to register and pay through an Epic account on a webpage outside the app itself (and saving 20 percent on their purchase in the process). The other roughly 50 percent of customers decided to pay a higher price in exchange for the convenience of paying directly in the app through the iOS account they already had set up, Sweeney said. \"Consumers were making the choice... and it was a wonderful thing to see,\" he said. Speaking to the press Wednesday night, Sweeney said the new court order was a \"huge victory for developers\" looking to offer their own payment service alongside Apple's on iOS devices. \"This is what we've wanted all along,\" he said. \"We think that this achieves the goal that we've been aiming for in the US, while there are still some challenges elsewhere in the world.\" While Sweeney said the specific iOS developer account Epic used to publishFortnitein 2020 is still banned, he added that the company has several other developer accounts that could be used for the new submission, includingone it has used to support Unreal Engine on Apple devices. And while Sweeney allowed that Apple could still \"arbitrarily reject Epic from the App Store despite Epic following all the rules,\" he added that, in light of this latest court ruling, Apple would now \"have to deal with various consequences of that if they did.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "article_text": "If any recentDisney+ Marvel showseemed poised to get a second season, it wasHawkeye. It starred one of the original Avengers, played by Jeremy Renner;set up a new, younger version of the heroin Hailee Steinfeld’s Kate Bishop; and told a storyfeaturing characters that havesince come back in other places like Kingpin, Yelena, Echo, and others. Well, according to Renner he was asked to do a second season, but was only offered half of what he made for the first season, so he turned it down. “They asked me to do a season two, and they offered me half the money,” Renner said on theHigh Performancepodcast. “Iâm like, ‘Well, itâs going to take me twice the amount of work for half the amount of money, and eight months of my time, essentially, to do it for half the amount.'” “Iâm like, ‘Iâm sorry? Why? Did you think Iâm only half the Jeremy because I got ran over? Maybe thatâs why you want to pay me half of what I made on the first season,'” he continued, referring to his 2023 accident where he was run over by a Sno-Cat, suffering near life-ending injuries. Renner quickly added that it wasn’t Marvel who did this, but accountants at Disney. “This is not Marvel, mind you,” Renner said. “This is like, just Disney, not even really Disney. Itâs just the penny pinchers, the accountants. I told them to go fly a kite. I mean, just at the insult offer. So we didnât see eye to eye on it.” This, if we’re being honest, doesn’t add up. DisneyisMarvel and accountants who work for Disney are representing Marvel. But the implication, it seems, is Renner doesn’t want to blame Marvel’s creative people, just the people who sign their checks. io9 reached out to Disney for comment and an insider there disputed Renner’s claims, but failed to get into specifics. So this is certainly just his side of the story. Renner’s hesitance to place the blame specifically on anyone is probably also because he says he would like to play Hawkeye in the future. “Sadly, I still love the character. Iâd still love to do it, but I had to defend myself,” he said. “I didnât ask for any more money, mind you. Just pay me what I made the first season. So itâs a little disheartening that that didnât happen, but thatâs fine. Iâm happy to let that go, because my bodyâs probably thanking me, time and time again, that Iâm not doing it right now. But weâll see.” Here’s the clip: Jeremy Renner reveals why Hawkeye Season 2 never happened… ðð¹ Jeremy’s episode with us is available now, exclusively on the High Performance App! ð Jeremy Renner’s ‘My Next Breath’ is available in all formats now, published by Simon & Schuster UK#avengers#jeremyrenner#hawkeye#hawkeyeseason2#disneyplus â¬ original sound – High Performance – High Performance So there you have it.

    "article_text": "Last year, TikTok had been taken over by theBird Buddyâa smart bird feeder with a built-in camera which could capture stunning photos and videos of your local birds. Using AI trained on real bird visits, the smart feeder is able to recognize exactly what species of bird stopped by for a visit. This product understandably took off and even landed itself onTIMEâs best inventions list of 2023. Well, the team behindBird Buddyhas more than just birds in their sights. Early Monday morning, Bird Buddy Inc. unveiledWonder Blocksâa smart modular habitat system built to help bees, butterflies, hummingbirds, and other pollinators prosperânow available for pre-order on Kickstarter. See Wonder Blocks at Kickstarter TheWonder Blocksystem comprises of a freestanding planter with a bee sanctuary built into its base and magnetic trellis which can be built upon with key habitat modules and accessories. The Frame as itâs called can be used to anchor butterfly feeders, hummingbird feeders, shelters, and more. As a bee habitat,Wonder Blocksprovides safe, essential shelter for solitary bees. As effective as they may be, solitary bees represent some of our most vulnerable pollinators. Healthy ecosystems rely on pollinators like bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds. However, populations of these helpful critters is on the decline thanks to climate change, pesticides, and habitat loss. The battle for conservation isnât just about rainforests many of us will never see in our lives. The frontline is our own backyards, gardens, and balconies. AndWonder Blockscan be how individuals make a difference, fighting the good fight for a better Earth. The real star ofWonder Blockssetting it apart from other habitats on the market isPetalâan AI-powered camera trained on over 2,000 species of pollinators, birds, and native plants. The 12MP camera is capable of recording in 4K, an enhancement over the 5MP camera on theBird Buddywhich only records up to 2K. Its colors and design mimic that of a flower to attract birds and insects. You can mount the camera in a number of ways. Its universal clip lets you adhere it to the edge of a planter. It can be hung, pointed downward from a branch or the flexible stem can be wrapped around a pole like a vine. ThePetalSmart Camerais equipped with a 2,000mAh battery which will last up to six weeks on a single charge. EachPetalas a standard feature included a special small form factor solar panel which, in most environments, is capable of extending the battery life of the camera indefinitely. Swappable lenses let you choose between a wide angle lens and a macro lens to best capture the tiny visitors to your habitat. For nature enthusiasts, bird watchers, and big bug heads,Petaluses machine learning to ID the different species of pollinators that come into view so you know exactly who you’re helping. AI is used even further to take the videos you record in yourWonder Blockshabitat and add in augmented voice over narration of their activity. You can play back recordings of the birds and insects in your garden like they are your own personal nature documentary. âWonder Blocks is about more than just observing nature â itâs about understanding it,âsaid Franci Zidar, co-founder and CEO of Bird Buddy. âWonder Blocks support the pollinators our ecosystems depend on, and Petal lets you see and hear their stories unfold. This is conservation made accessible, emotional, and intelligent.â The smart AI camera can even detect behavioral patterns and changes to the environmentsâwhether that is nesting, plant stress, or something elseâand then alert you of whatâs been observed. See Wonder Blocks at Kickstarter TheHabitatis the base habitat, capable of self-watering and equipped with an integrated Bee Habitat module. Modularity is at the forefront of its design as the planter can function either as a standalone smart habitat or be added as another piece to the Wonder Blocks system. The outer edge of theHabitatÂcomprises a built-in micro water featureâThe Streamâwhere helpful pollinators can stop by for some critical hydration. Wonder Blocksrepresent the core modular habitat. It adds in the observation pole and are designed for dynamic pollinator support and thePetalcamera system.

    "title": "After Boeing Delays, Trump Is Getting a Secondhand Plane for Air Force One",
    "article_text": "Since his first administration, Donald Trump has obsessed over replacing Air Force One. However, delays with the contracted Boeing have pushed delivery back by another decade. Now, Trump’s impatience is showing ashe’s commissioned an interim plane from another contractoron top of the existing multi-billion contract with Boeing. In 2018, Trump commissioned Boeing, which has supplied presidential planes since Roosevelt, to replace Air Force One for $3.9 billion. Currently, a thirty-five-year-old duo of modified Boeing 747-200s (or VC-25A) make up Air Force One. Boeing failed to meet its original Dec. 2024 deadline for the first aircraft due todelayscaused by supply and design issues,workforce complications, and more. The Wall Street Journal reported that Boeing told federal officials around election time that they couldn’t deliver until about 2035. So, Trump took matters into his own hands. According to the outlet, Trump has commissioned L3Harris, a Florida-based defense contractor, to modify a plane previously used by the Qatari government. (Ironically, the interim jet is a Boeing 747.) This isreportedly the same planethat Trump toured in February in a weird public shaming of Boeing. He wasn’t subtle about it, either. At the time, Steven Cheung, the White House Communications director, said the tour was to “highlight the project’s failure to deliver a new Air Force One on time.” Trump alsosaid, “No, I’m not happy with Boeing…We may do something else. We may go buy a plane.” Sources told the Wall Street Journal that Trump wants the interim plane available as early as the fall. Air Force One isn’t your typical plane, though. AsPopSci outlined, it has an advanced navigation system, encryption capabilities, defensive countermeasures, and more. It’s unlikely that L3Harris can supply an equivalent to the existing duo that fast. Andrew Hunter, the Air Force’s acquisitions chief under Biden, told the Wall Street Journal, “You could do some paint, you could do some communications upgrades, and I suspect it would be hard to do too much beyond that on that timeline.” Years before Trump first took office, the Air Forceselectedthe Boeing 747-8 as the next presidential plane. Under the existing contract, Boeing is supposed to supply two 747-8s. Per the Wall Street Journal, senior officials debated cancelling Boeing’s contract before Trump’s inauguration. Since then, there have also been discussions about a potential lawsuit. Trump did something worse than sue, though. Immediately after his election, he sic’d Elon Musk on Boeing. In February, CEO Kelly Ortberg said thatMusk was helping remove constraintsto speed things up. However,Musk also considered questionable measures like lowering security clearancesfor workers, which isn’t ideal for the president’s plane. It’s unknown how much Trump’s second-hand plane will cost. However, Boeing is already billions of dollars over budget. But ostentatious displays are a key part of Trump’s presidency. And who knows. Maybe this time, Trump can pick the paint. air force oneBoeingTrump Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily. News from the future, delivered to your present.

The long-time Republican and wellness grifter will likely be a rubber stamp to the Trump administration's worst impulses. The CDC is set to cut a third of its contracts spending within the next two weeksâthe latest bit of dismantling orchestrated by the Trump administration. The so-called \"manosphere\" helped deliver the young male vote to Trump in the 2024 presidential election. NASA is considering another test flight of Boeing's Starliner vehicle, with or without a crew on board. The Starliner crew was originally meant to stay on board the ISS for a week, but issues with Boeing's Starliner spacecraft severely delayed their return to Earth.

    "title": "MoviePass Launches Box Office Betting Platform Unfortunately Tied to Crypto",
    "article_text": "MoviePass, the service best known for the unsustainable plan to let people see unlimited movies in theaters for a monthly fee, is launching a new fantasy sports-style platform for film buffs. Unfortunately, it’s tied to the blockchain as part of the company’songoing shift into the Web3 space. The platform, calledMogul, launched Thursday as part of a collaboration between MoviePass and Mysten Labs. MoviePass describes it as a âcompetitive entertainment experienceâ that will let fans participate in fantasy tournaments, head-to-head matchups, and solo challenges based on various metrics of film fandom. That includes scoring based on audience attendance, critic scores, award victories, and other markers of success. If you’re a listener ofThe Big Picture Podcast, they play games similar to this on the regular, though it’s just a competition between the hosts. There have also been games that try to tap into a similar energy, like theHollywood Stock Exchange, which allowed users to buy and sell bets on actors, directors, and films as if they were trading shares in a company. MoviePass is tapping into that energy, and it seems like they at least have a lot of people interested. The company claims they have 400,000 on the early-access waitlist. Once they’re in and the games launch, users on Mogul will compete to win “digital collectibles,” virtual currency, and rewards. There will also be a leaderboard to compete with friends and other players. MoviePass CEO Stacy Spikes said in a statement that the goal of Mogul is “activating a new generation of fans who arenât just watching movies but influencing the culture and economy around them.â Which, sure? I guess? The kids are really doing a number on theaters right now duringA Minecraft Movieshowings, which probably counts as influencing the culture and economy. They did force Warner Bros. to create“rowdy” versions of screeningsso that people can be as loud and rambunctious as they want, so that’s something. But the Web3 aspect just makes it feel a little flimsy. If you buy into the blockchain as the platform of the future, maybe this is super promising to you. But there seems to be very little done via Web3 for MoviePass that can’t be done elsewhere. The company’s platformcurrently leans on Web3for virtual currency, which can be used to purchase monthly plans, and lets people do things like watch ads in exchange for credits that get deposited in their virtual wallets. Again, nothing that hasn’t been done on other platforms. And fantasy sports as a pastime have a lot of infrastructure already on the current web. The concept here is cool, at least. Maybe it’d be best to not let the blockchain of it all dampen the mood. Anything that gets people more interested and engaged in film should be a win.

    "title": "Andor Walked a Delicate Line With Its Latest Tragedy",
    "article_text": "The second act ofÂAndorseason two,among many other things, reunited insurgent lovers Vel Sartha and Cinta Kaz as part of Luthen’s attempts to scope out resistance to the Empire on Ghorman. Separated for years after the events of season oneâsave from a distant “reunion” at the climax of season two’sopening trio of episodesâwhen Vel and Cinta meet again across these episodes, they are given a chance to reflect on both their relationship to Luthen and the growing Rebellion, and ultimately to each other, culminating in a tender moment: one that, afterthe casual queernessof their arc across season one, handily became what is arguablyÂStar Wars‘ most prominent and explicit showcase of on-screen queer intimacy yet. Alas, it was not to last. Almost immediately after Cinta and Vel get to share a moment of passion together, tragedy strikes. Dealing with anxious and unprepared members of the Ghorman resistance to stage a heist of Imperial weaponry, an altercation between one of the guerrillas, Samm, and a local Ghor leads to an accidental blaster discharge, a stray bolt that catches Cinta clean in the chest, killing her instantly (banner week for Varada Sethu being shot, apparently, between this and thelatestDoctor Who). It’s simultaneously both an excellent dramatic momentâespecially the aftermath of Vel’s grief, where she ruefully hangs the trauma of Cinta’s death on Samm’s conscience, a greater pain she can deal in the moment than simply killing him in turnâand an incredibly precarious one forAndorto navigate. No matter however it could be handled, the moment still brushes up on a controversial trope of disposing LGBTQ characters that has plagued discussion of queer representation in media for years: the idea of“Bury Your Gays,”Â in which a queer character is introduced and then killed off for shock value once they have checked a box off for diverse representation rather than being given much of a character arc. Star Wars, especially in on-screen material, still has a long way to go in introducing prominent LGBTQ characters, five years on from itspainfully lackluster watershed momentwithÂRise of Skywalker‘s fleeting sapphic kiss. While queer characters certainly exist plenty inStar Warsmediamore broadly these days, from comics, to books, to games,ÂStar Warsis still in the eyes of many still primarily a franchise of film and TV, and Vel and Cinta were arguably by far and away the most prominent on-screen LGBTQ characters it had delivered in the last decade. Giving one of them a tragic endâespecially almost immediately after allowing them a moment of happy reconciliation and romanceâwould always have stung for queer audiences in this context, regardless of how well it was handled, and especially regardless of howAndoritself is often willing to derive tension in its spy thriller narratives by making it clear to audiences that the vast majority of its cast are rarely guaranteed safety. But on the other hand,ÂAndordoes not treat Cinta’s death as mere shock value. The moment is presented with tremendous weight, a meaning that the arc itself is built around in the tensions of what it really means for people to take resistance into their own hands. Cinta’s bravery could’ve earned her a hero’s death, a blaze of glory reflecting the choices she had made to fight back against the Empire, but the bitterness of her death is that people in conflicts likeÂAndor‘s don’t get the liberty of the death they’ve earned. It can be sudden, and messy, and indelicate, because that is simply the reality we all face in the shadow of the great equalizer. Her death is not only a harsh lesson for the Ghorman Front, but for Vel and the audience too: revolution is rarely clean and rarely without cost. Vel and Cinta are one of several romancesAndorexplores, and often fractures, as they are caught up in this question of the necessity of resistanceâand arguably even as their relationship forms a significant part of that questioning, its nature as an explicitly queer one is not the sole defining aspect of that lens. In distinct contrast toRise‘s fleeting, easily discarded queer moment,Andortreats both Cinta and Vel as enriched, fleshed-out characters whohappen to be queer, rather than capital-Q, capital-C Queer Characters whose existence only hangs on the metatext of the franchise getting to say “look, lesbians!” and then having little else to say through them before they can be discarded. That doesn’t erase either character’s queerness, but just makes it one aspect of their whole. Andor‘s narrative treating them both in this regard, even as Cinta and Vel face the tough prospect of still being one of the very few on-screen queer couples the franchise has had so far, also means that the show treats the both of them like it does almost any other member in its cast. InÂAndor‘s case, that means giving them the narrative right to be jeopardized, to be put in harm’s way, to experience random tragedy as much as any other heteronormative character would. And even asStar Warsstill continues to take tiny steps towards better representing a plethora of queer characters, it’s just as vitally important that it doesn’t feel like it cannot risks with those characters simply because of representative importance. Neither Cinta nor VelÂhadto be doomed by the narrative, but in the story thatÂAndoris telling inÂStar Wars, the fact that they can be is a testament to the series treating them as more than just a checked box on list of diverse representation. Star Warsshould have more gay people in it, absolutely, so the loss of any at this point is always going to hurt. But part of that journey to tangible, quality representation also means that those queer characters need to be able to be as messy, complicated, and nuanced as their straight counterparts, to be treated as actual characters to whom queerness is just one quality, and one story, among many they can be used to explore. And sometimes that also means, for better or worse, being able to put them in harm’s way and experience tragedy, instead of leaving them safely tucked away on a shelf.

    "title": "Photo Shows Mike Waltz Using Signal in Wednesday’s White House Cabinet Meeting",
    "article_text": "Today, the Trump administration announced that national security advisor Mike Waltz would be leaving the White House after the disastrous Signal debacle last month. Waltz never seems to have learned his lesson, however, as a photo taken just yesterday shows Waltz using the app while in a meeting at the White House. The photo, taken by Reuters photojournalist Evelyn Hockstein, shows Waltz checking “his mobile phone while attending a cabinet meeting held by U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., April 30, 2025,” the media organization’s website states. If you zoom in on the photo, it seems quite clear that Waltz is checking Signal. A message from JD Vance reads, “I have confirmation from my counterpart it’s turned. He’s going to be here in” before it cuts off. Blown-up images of the photo circulated on social media on Thursday, as the outgoing national security advisor was ridiculed for still having used the app that got him into hot water last month.

Pete Hegseth, Trump’s Defense Secretary, then accidentally shared Yemen war plans with Goldberg, who proceeded to publish them after the government accused him of lying. After being called out for this bit of buffoonery, Waltz claimed he was unsure how Goldberg had been added to the chat and intimated that other unknown parties may have somehow been responsible. Goldberg has said this is nonsense. Photos show Mike Waltz literally checking Signal during the cabinet meeting (via Reuters)pic.twitter.com/XCxn6Tja4I — Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering)May 1, 2025 As of Thursday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio is taking Waltz’s position in an interim capacity. A report fromThe Daily Beastpreviously stated that Trump was potentially considering replacing Waltzâwho one government insider recently referred to as a “fucking idiot”âwith Steve Witkoff, a real estate developer who has alternately been described as a “bumbling fucking idiot” by another inside source. Trump has said he wants Waltz to be the U.S.’s new ambassador to the U.N. Gizmodo reached out to the White House for comment. Additional reporting has revealed that Waltz appears to have beeninvolved in other Signal chatsthat involved foreign policy.Â In a previous White Housepress conferenceinvolving both Waltz and the President, the advisor stammered his way through a public non-apology in which he mumbled something about âlessons learnedâ before accusing the media of lying and then bragging about America taking a stand against terrorism. âThank God for American leadership! Thank God for American strength! Youâre welcome, world!â Waltz said, when Trump asked him why he had sent war plans to a journalist.

    "title": "Back to the Future Returns to Universal Studios Hollywood With an Incredible Immersive Experience",
    "article_text": "AfterBack to the Future: The Rideclosed, like many fans of the iconic Universal Studios theme park ride, I was heartbroken. To me, it was the attraction that outside of the studio tour really encompassed whatUniversalwas all about. You got in the DeLorean and had your own time-travel adventure on a huge screen as you flew past iconic settings and even encountered prehistoric threats. It put you into the movies and no matter what other attractions came and went around it, it felt timeless for being out of time. Until of course, it was replaced byThe Simpsons Ride,which doesn’t hold a candle to the glory of Universal’s iconic original attraction. I can’t even bring myself to ride it as it feels like I’m walking on the hallowed resting place of what was once my favorite ride ever. So whenUniversal Studios Fan Fest Nightswas announced and featured the DeLorean in its marketing, it felt like finally respect was being put back on the studio’s beloved ’80s classic’s name. WithBack to the Future: Destination Hill Valley, Universal delivers on the promise of bringing you into the movies in a new, impactful way. The immersive experience is a triumph and you won’t want to leave. You get on the studio tour and it becomes a time traveling tram that drops you into the moment that Marty McFly arrives and through the events ofBack to the Futureon the courthouse square where the Robert Zemeckis film was shot. Through roaming actors portraying George, Lorraine, Biff, and Doc, we get to see iconic moments recreated and be a part of them. I got to chat with my childhood crush George McFly and turned into a total shy mess as he asked if I was going to the Enchantment Under the Sea Dance. The storytelling propels forward as you are able to encourage him to ask Lorraine to go with him and help with his writing before we see the hilarious hijinks of Lorraine hitting on Marty, her future son who she wants to go to the dance with. Biff shows up and causes mayhem while fans spectate and quote along. View this post on Instagram To be standing in the real setting with themed areas where you could wander off to, including a meet and greet with the first time traveler, Einstein, or see the gas station attendants perform was such a treat. But what really tugged at my heartstrings were the moments where fans were able to have personal interactions with the characters that meant so much to them. The cast was excellent at reacting to the cosplay and lore cleverly, which having to do all over again after the about 45-minute interval of story is a huge feat for an event that goes until 2 a.m. There are two casts so thankfully they get a break. I spent two intervals of the story there myself, one for work and the other for fun in recreating my first date with my husband. Our hard launch was at an Enchantment Under the Sea-themed Valentine’s Day dance since we connected over time-travel films when we met. And it was especially meaningful to go back to that night in a timey-wimey way with our little “Earth Angel” baby girl to dance the night away. Like many there with friends and loved ones who were brought together by the films, the experience brought back immense nostalgia for the movies and its presence at the parks. The love for the Amblin franchise runs deep and you could pretty much spend the whole night there with friends or make news ones including real fan club members who met up that were also there to slip out of time for a spell. Destination Hill Valley successfully brings immersive experiences to Universal in a big way. There’s so much Universal could do with the concept if it so choose, like a similar set up withBack to the Future Part IIat the Courthouse Square, but I’m not sure if it has that same retro romanticism as classic Hill Valley does. I think that this specific experience expanded with the sequels in other ways would be neat. And maybe, just maybe, Universal could add a surprise remaster of theBack to the FutureRide to experienceâif not in its original home, then maybe inside the DreamWorks theater.

    "article_text": "As recently as April 29, whenVarietydropped aResident AlienupdateâStephen Root guest-starring as Alan Tudyk’s father is pretty fantastic castingâit seemed certain thatthe sci-fi showwas only going to be airing on the USA Network in a shift from its original home at fellow NBCUniversal outlet Syfy. However, today’s season four date announcement trumpetsResident Alien‘s return to USAandSyfy. That’s good news, if a bit of a turnaround, for the offbeat comedy starring Tudyk as an alien who crash-lands on Earth and immediately has to pretend to be the local doctorâan endeavor made more awkward by the fact that he’s supposed to be destroying the planet that’s now his home. It’s based on the Dark Horse comics and has picked up a fan following since its 2021 debut. Last year,Deadlinereported thatResident Alienhad gotten a season four renewal but would be moving from Syfy to USA, with budget cuts to go with it. An earlierDeadlinearticle had noted that Netflix was also a potential new home after the first two seasons were well-received when they were released on the streamer, but that didn’t end up happening. However, today’s announcement clearly states that the show will be returning to both USA and Syfy; a freshDeadlinereport notes that, indeed, “the decision to keep the show on Syfy in addition to its USA run reportedly came in the months following the Season 4 renewal.” It makes sense for a sci-fi show to stay on the Syfy channel, does it not? io9 reached out to NBCUniversal for any further comment on the decision and will update this post if we hear back. As for season four, according to a press release it “starts with Harry (Alan Tudyk) and his baby Bridget stuck in prison on the Grey Moonbase, while a shape-shifting Alien called a Mantid (also Alan Tudyk) has taken over his body on Earth passing himself off as the real Harry Vanderspeigle.” “Harry manages to escape the Greys and arrives back on Earth for a showdown with the Mantid Alien, but soon finds he may not have what he needs to finish the job. Asta (Sara Tomko) and Dâarcy (Alice Wetterlund) struggle to keep a secret from Ben (Levi Fiehler) and Kate (Meredith Garretson), who are both desperate to find answers to what has been happening to them. Sheriff Mike (Corey Reynolds) and Deputy Liv (Elizabeth Bowen) attempt to solve some mysterious deaths in Patience that Sheriff Mike is beginning to think arenât caused by anything human.” As noted above, comedy veteran Stephen Root will also guest-star as Harry’s evil alien father.Fireflyfans, take note: Jewel Staite will also pop up in season four, joining the returning guest-starring likes of Gary Farmer, Gracelyn Awad Rinke, Jenna Lamia, Sarah Podemski, Linda Hamilton, Enver Gjokaj, Terry OâQuinn, and Edi Patterson. Tudyk will also make his TV directing debut with the season’s first two episodes.Resident Alienseason four premieres Friday, June 6 at 11 p.m. on USA and Syfy; you can also catch the new episodes one week after air on Peacock.

    "title": "Report: RFK Jr.-Led HHS Has Shut Down Federal Lab Studying the World’s Scariest Germs",
    "article_text": "The Trump administration looks to be surrendering in the war against germs. A new report from Wired reveals the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has shuttered a federal lab dedicated to studying some of the deadliest infectious diseases in the world. According to Wired’s report,publishedWednesday, the Integrated Research Facility in Frederick, Maryland was ordered to completely cease its experimental research by April 29. The facility has long researched the treatment and prevention of “high consequence” infectious diseases, including Ebola and Lassa fever. The facility’s ultimate fate is uncertain at this time. TheIntegrated Research Facilityoperates under the umbrella of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). It hosts one of the dozen research laboratories in North America allowed to handle germs that meet the criteria for Biosafety Level 4, the highest level of containment; it’s also one of the few places in the entire world where scientists can perform medical imaging on BSL-4 infected animals. BSL-4 pathogens typically cause severe or fatal illness, may be able to spread easily in a lab setting, and have few or no available treatments or vaccines. These pathogens include the viruses that cause Ebola and Lassa, as well as the reconstructed flu virus that caused the 1918 pandemic. Wired viewed an email sent by Michael Holbrook, associate director for high containment at the Integrated Research Facility, that detailed the facility’s shuttering. Holbrook reportedly told employees that the facility will be explicitly ending its studies on Lassa fever, SARS-Cov-2, and Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), arare but often deadly mosquitoborne virusfound in the U.S. Northeast.Â The animals used for these studies, however, will not be euthanized. He added that officials from the Department of Homeland Security would padlock the freezers used for BSL-4 research. âThe sacrifice to research is immense,â Gigi Kwik Gronvall, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told Wired. âIf things are unused for a period of time, it will cost more money to get them ready to be used again.â The HHS’s closing of the Integrated Research Facility shouldn’t come as a complete surprise. After President Donald Trump’s election win last November, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.âwho has since become HHS chiefâpromised that he would try toshut down infectious disease researchat the National Institutes of Health as soon as Trump took office. During his confirmation hearings, Kennedy also(wrongly) claimedthat federal funding on infectious diseases far outweighed the money spent studying chronic diseases. When contacted by Wired, a NIH spokesperson characterized the facility’s closing as a “research pause” and appeared to blame staff members for the shutdown, though without any further details. Notably, the facility’s director, Connie Schmaljohn, was also put on administrative leave. “This decision follows identification and documentation of personnel issues involving contract staff that compromised the facilityâs safety culture, prompting this research pause,” Bradley Moss, communication director for the office of research services at NIH, told Wired. The government’s stated rationale for pausing work at the Integrated Research Facility might merit some skepticism, however, given how unorganized and destructive the supposed “restructuring” of HHS being carried out by RFK Jr. has gone to date. And seeing as we’re still fresh off the worst pandemic seen in over a century, any sustained pause in infectious disease research is likely to be bad news. infectious diseasesRFK Jr Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "article_text": "Take flight as a dragon rider of Berk with the latest look atHow to Train Your Dragon. TheUniversal Pictures live-action film based on the animated DreamWorks classichas landed with a glimpse of Viking life in the movie, as well as ways you can gear up for the film’s release and the opening of theIsle of Berk at Epic Universethis summer. Director Dean DeBlois aims to immerse a new generation of fans in the world ofHow to Train Your Dragon. A new look at how Berk came to life for the live-action picture shows how the young cast was able to feel a part of a world where dragons are real.

    "title": "The Force Is With May’s Lego Releases",
    "article_text": "A new month is upon us, and as with any May when itcomes to Lego, the theme of the month isÂStar Wars, as the brick-builder gets ready to drop a swath of new sets to celebrate May 4 this weekend. But whileStar Warsis definitely in the spotlight this month, there’s a few more notable releases coming too. Lego’s already given us a good tease of what to expect from the galaxy far, far away ahead ofÂStar Warsday, with releases from across the saga, anchored in the latestÂStar WarsUltimate Collector Series entrant in the form of Jango Fett’s starship. But like we said, those wars in the stars aren’t the only things shining brightly for Lego in May: itslatest Nintendo collaborationcelebratesÂMario Kartin style this month,ÂAvengers: Endgamecomes back for round two in the Marvel line, and there’s even few more artsy extras to boot. Here’s the rundown on the must-have sets of the month! We’ve already coveredwhat to expect from Lego’sÂStar Warsday celebrations this weekend, when nine brand new sets drop just in time for Lego’s annual celebration and themed Gift-With-Purchase campaigns. This year, any purchase of the UCS Jango Fett’s Starship will nab you a themed keychain, but beyond that, there’s two extra bonuses tied to purchase amounts: spending $160 or more on any LegoStar Warssets (new or otherwise) directly from Lego will net you the exclusiveÂKamino Training Facilitypolybag, featuring three Clone cadets and a small set of Kamino-themed builds, while purchases of $40 or more will get you anew minibuild polybagof the Millennium Falcon. Here’s a reminder of the newÂStar Warsreleases coming, starting today and this weekend: Lego’s chibi line of buildable characters gets a prequels and original trilogy infusion, with a new Luke inspired by his pilot suit appearance inÂA New Hope, and a special five-figure set celebratingÂRevenge of the Sith‘s 20th anniversary. The latest entry in the ship mini-display series whisks us to the opening moments ofÂThe Force Awakens, and Kylo Ren’s sleek shuttle. ($70, availableÂhere) TheÂRebelsandÂAhsokalegend is the latest in theÂStar Warsscaled droid line, and everyone’s most beloved tinpot malcontent comes with a bunch of cute featuresâand, of course, an even-teenier Chopper minifigure to sit on the display base. ($100, availablehere) The buildable helmet display line continues with the theme of the month, offering the masked visages of both Kylo Ren and Jango Fettâperfect to sit next to their new ship sets! Lego bids farewell toÂAndorwith the first U-Wing model since theÂRogue Oneline. Less pieces this time around, but it does add a Lego Dedra Meero to your shelf, and that’s not nothing. ($70, availableÂhere) After doing something similar for Marvel last month, Lego turns the iconicÂStar Warstitle card into a funky display piece. Unlike the Marvel logo set, there’s no included minifigures here, but let’s be real:Â theÂStar Warslogo is infinitely cooler regardless. ($60, availableÂhere) The latest crowning glory in theStar WarsUltimate Collector Series line, Lego’s latest crack at the legendary Firespray owned by the Fett family takes inspiration from Jango, rather than Boba this time, and includes minifigures of both father and son to sit in its cockpit. ($300, availablehere) Star Warsmight be providing the bulk of the bricks this month, but there’s still a few notable highlights from other Lego lines. Here’s all the sets from galaxies closer to home arriving this month as well. After evolving the Lego Mario line with a new set of kart-racing-themed sets, Lego turns back to its adults-focused Nintendo sets with a specialMario Kartreplica, complete with a stand that lets you tilt Mario and his ride as if they’re drifting around a corner. ($170, availablehereÂ from 5/15) Spring is here, but Lego’s flower series is forever! This latest bouquet brings together buildable bluebells, pink gerberas, tulips, and more. ($30, availablehere) The latest Lego Marvel vignette returns toEndgameto take on the iconic portals scene, delivering a veritable swath of minifigures (and even a buildable giant-sized Ant-Man for good measure!) ready to do battle against Thanos and his Chitauri forces. ($100, availablehere) Lego’s Art series gets funky with this riff on the legendary work of Keith Haring: five multicolored models of his famous motif that you can build for display on either wall mounts or for flat surfaces.

    "title": "This Color E Ink Monitor Promises It’s (Almost) Fast Enough to Keep Up With YouTube",
    "article_text": "Weâve seen E Ink devices meant toemulate a smartphone, E Ink displays positioned on theflip side of a laptop lid, and even afolding E Ink tablet. Still, somehow, theBoox Mira Procolor E Ink monitor is the one paper-like screen Iâm most intrigued by. The only question left is whether its refresh speed is fast enough to keep up with my browserâs many, many tabs while watching a YouTube video on the side. Boox is known for itse-readers,tablets, and its phone-sizedBoox Palma. On the other end, the companyâs Mira Pro black-and-white monitor seemed a little too much like a novelty without the option for color. The new, $1,900 Mira Pro with color is an expensive, though promising product that could make staring at your screen easier on the eyes. Color E Ink utilizes ink capsules that get pulled around with an electrical field. Booxâs monitor usesE Inkâs Kaleido 3 display techthat can display 4,096 colors. The display type was created for tablets and other signage, but we’re a bit surprised it took so long for somebody to make it into a full-fledged monitor. The Boox Mira Pro promises a fast enough refresh to watch videos. Still, past attempts at using Kaleido to watch YouTube werenât ideal. Boox claims its “Super Refresh” can minimize some ghosting that occurs when images change too fast for the display to keep up. Even so, the company makes it clear on its website that âE Ink monitors’ refresh speed is not as high as conventional monitors, and increased speed will result in more ghosting.â So if you were thinking you would use this monitor for gaming at above the typical 24 frames per second, you can expect some truly wonky visuals. The Mira Pro comes with four modes that users can switch to when scrolling, reading, typing, or watching content. The E Ink monitor also includes a physical button you can press to refresh the screen when it becomes necessary. The included stand allows for swivel and tilt. You can also turn it 90 degrees to use it vertically, which is handy for coders. We’ll have to see it in person to believe it, but there are other reasons why youâd want a 25-inch E Ink display over a typical backlit IPS LCD monitor. The display type is typically less straining on your eyes. After eight hours straight of working with a screen, a full-sized E Ink monitor sounds mighty appealing. The downside is that colors will likely not look as accurate as they should on an LCD or OLED display. Images will also appear slightly desaturated compared to the âinkyâ blacks of OLED. The displayâs specs arenât too shabby. The resolution is 3,200 x 1,800, and it has ports for HDMI, mini-HDMI, USB-C, and DisplayPort. The monitor also includes dual speakers. Thatâs all par for the course on your average work monitor, but at $1,900, the color Mira Pro is demanding a lot for its large E Ink display. It costs nearly as much as the$2,000 Samsung Odyssey 3D, another niche monitor with a very particular use case. At least itâs clear thereâs still room for people to innovate with the old, staid desktop screen design. Booxe ink Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "NASA’s Psyche Mission Suffers Strange Glitch on Its Way to a Metallic Asteroid",
    "article_text": "The Psyche spacecraft launched nearly two years ago and is currently on its way to rendezvous with a unique asteroid in an effort to understand the origins of Earth. Although it’s still a few years away from orbiting the asteroid, which bears the same name, the Psyche mission has run into an issue with its propulsion system that forced it to power off its thrusters. NASA engineers with the Psyche missionÂ are investigating the root cause of a recent decrease in fuel pressure in the spacecraft’s propulsion system, an issue that needs to be resolved before mid-June so that it doesn’t affect the mission’s trajectory. “The mission team has chosen to defer thrusting while engineers work to understand the pressure decrease,” NASA wrote in anupdate. Psychelaunched in October 2023, beginning a 2.2 billion-mile journey to a metal-rich asteroid located in the main belt. The spacecraft began firing its thrusters in May 2024, using a solar electric propulsion system that relies on solar energy to generate power for four electric thrusters. On April 1, the spacecraft detected a pressure drop in the line that delivers xenon gas to the thrusters, which went from 36 pounds per square inch (psi) to about 26 psi, according to NASA. In response to the sudden decrease, the spacecraft automatically powered off its thrusters. The mission can keep its thrusters turned off for another month and a half before it’s too lateâwhen the probe needs to adjust its trajectory.Â As it works to figure out what may have caused the drop in fuel pressure, the team of NASA engineers is also considering switching to the spacecraft’s backup fuel line so that it can resume firing its thrusters. If all goes well, the spacecraft will enter asteroid Psycheâs orbit in late July 2029 and begin its mission in August of the same year. The mission is scheduled for a flyby of Mars in spring 2026, using the planet’s gravitational pull to slingshot it toward the main asteroid belt that’s located between Mars and Jupiter. Psyche is a 140-mile-wide (226-kilometer) asteroid which may be the stripped-down core of a shattered planetesimal, one of the building blocks that come together to form a planet. The mission has been a long time in the making, and has run into its fair share of issues. Psyche was originally scheduled to launch in 2022, butan issue with the spacecraft’s flight software delayed the missionuntil its next launch window the next year. The spacecraftâs flight software controls its orientation and trajectory, as well as its ability to send and receive data to Earth. A week before its original launch date on October 5, 2023,engineers discovered an issue with the Psyche spacecraftâs thrustersÂ that could have caused it to overheat during its eight-year mission. As a result, the missionâs liftoff date was delayed by one week as the team resolved the issue. NASA officials don’t seem too concerned about the problem. “This kind of thing happens and thatâs why we build redundancy into our missions,” Louise Prockter, director of NASAâs planetary science division, said during a meeting of the Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group on Wednesday, SpaceNewsreported. “We donât have any concerns at the moment about it but weâre obviously keeping tabs on it.” asteroidsNASAPsyche Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Undercover North Korean Remote Workers Hate This One Weird Question",
    "article_text": "There are allegedly thousands of North Koreans who have successfully disguised themselves as Americans and landed remote work jobs at Fortune 500 businesses and crypto firms. And while their techniques for getting in are sophisticated, catching them apparently just requires asking one kinda crude question: “How fat is Kim Jong Un?” According to Adam Meyers, the Senior Vice President of Counter Adversary Operations at cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, asking that question during the interview process stops the North Korean workers in their tracks. Whilespeaking at the RSA Conferenceearlier this week, Meyers explained that asking a question like that will cause the prospective worker to abort. “They terminate the call instantly, because it’s not worth it to say something negative about that,” he said, according to areport from The Register. Meyers said there are other giveaways, too, if you know what to look for. “One of the things that we’ve noted is that you’ll have a person in Poland applying with a very complicated name, and then when you get them on Zoom calls, it’s a military age male Asian who can’t pronounce it,” he said. The “neg” Kim Jong Un approach is not a Meyers original. Earlier this month,Fortune spoketo Harrison Leggio, the founder of a cryptocurrency startup called g8keep, who said his company has been flooded with applications from North Korean citizens posing as prospective IT workers around the globe. To weed them out, hetold Fortunehe ends interviews by asking candidates, âSay something negative about Kim Jong Un.â Leggio claims other founders he knows are asking the same thing to thwart the infiltration attempts. Now, is this actually true? Probably some version of it is, right? It just sounds so outlandishly cartoonish.According to Meyers, these infiltration efforts usually involve creating somewhat elaborate backstories and fake social media profiles for a candidate, then utilizing a team of people who work on technical problems during the interview process while one person serves as a front person. And they just throw that all out at the prospect of saying one bad thing about their leader? They aren’t given the go-ahead to pull a Captain America saying “Heil Hydra” type move? With such a simple technique to stop a potential North Korean phony, you’d think that the success rate would be low for them getting in. And maybe it is, but they are still reportedly funneling millions of dollars back to the North Korean government,according to the FBI.TheÂ UN estimatedNorth Korean IT worker scams have generated $250 million to $600 million every year since 2018, with the workers keeping just a sliver of what they earn. Part of the reason is that once they secure those jobs, they tend to perform well in them.The Register reportedthat FBI Special Agent Elizabeth Pelker, a panelist at the same RSA Conference event as Meyers, said it’s common for businesses to ask if they really have to fire the employee once they’re discovered to be a North Korean citizen, because they are reliable workers. Now, just imagine how much they’ll be able to pull in if they’re allowed to say one mean thing about Kim Jong Un.

    "title": "Fortnite‘s Giant New Star Wars Season Will Let You Watch Tales of the Underworld Early",
    "article_text": "Fortnite, for better or worse, has become the video game mecca for cross-promotional events. We saw it back in 2019Â whenStar Warsunceremoniously announced thatsomehow Emperor Palpatine returnedin a galaxy-wide broadcast explicitly housed in the battle royale before moviegoers receivedthat information in theRise of Skywalkeropening title crawl. Now,Star WarsandFortnite‘s upcoming event will let players check out the first two episodes of its forthcoming Disney+ animated series,Star Wars: Tales of the Underworld. Earlier today,Fortnite’s official websiteposted a blog detailing all of the festivities it has in store for players throughout its first seasonalStar Warsevent,Fortnite: Galactic Battle, starting May 2.There are honestlyÂsoÂmany details thrown at players with daily events, rewards, and freebies if they connect theirEpic and MyDisney accountsthat it’s an info dump, overshadowing how to streamTales of the Underworldfor those who just want to watch someStar WarsÂearly. We’re strong with the Force, so we sussed out how to check outTales of the Underworldfor those looking for how to do that. According to Fortnite, players can jump into theStar WarsWatch Party island May 2 at 10 a.m. ET. How you do so involves clicking the magnifying glass in the top left corner of the screen after logging in. Should that prove too much of a headache, you can also search for it using this code: 2124-6713-8076. What will transpire is something akin to a theater-in-the-park experience, only virtual, where players can engage in lightsaber battles (with no damage). At the same time, a giant screen shows them the first two episodes of the series, starring fan-favorite character Asajj Ventress. Should watching the first few episodes ofÂTales of the UnderworldÂ inspire you and yours to giveÂFortnite‘sÂStar Warscollab a try, you’ll find yourself spoiled for choice with how many things the event will have for you to kill time, scour for new rewards, or trinkets. The core premise ofFortnite‘s latestStar Warsevent sees the First Order take over its world and establish various bases for players to push back the baddies. Key among them are Darth Vader, Samurai, trading the volcanic wasteland of Mustafar for a Shogun’s palace. Players can train with Palpatine, Rey, or Mace Windu and get their respective colored lightsabers, which allow you to move faster, jump higher, and not take fall damage should you have it equipped. Beyond mastering force techniques like pull, throw, and lightsaber toss, players can also pilot TIE Fighters, X-Wings, and Star Destroyers. The event also offers players the chance to get skins for Storm Troopers, Poe Dameron, General Grievous, Palpatine, an original game character named Apprentice Evie, and a nightmare fuel-inducing Wookiee skin. Granted, most of these extras require having enough real-life credits to purchaseFortnite‘sStar Warsbattle pass to reap the rewards, so players will have to search within their disposable income and plan accordingly.

    "title": "Samsung Odyssey 3D Review: This Glasses-Free 3D Monitor Can Impress, But Poor Games Support Kills It",
    "article_text": "For a moment, it seemed the very concept of 3D displays was dead and buried. Then, Samsung came along with a shovel under one arm and advanced eye-tracking technology under the other. Which brings us to the SamsungOdyssey 3D, a $2,000 27-inch monitor with one major feature: it does glasses-free 3D for gaming. I wanted to love it, but as youâll see in this review, there just isnât enough here to justify the price for anybody who has a mountain of cash to burn and a lingering adoration for thelong-dead Nintendo 3DS. Samsung Odyssey 3D It does 3D right, but it costs way too much and does way too little. Pros Cons I grew fond of the Odyssey 3D whenI got to use it briefly last month. Having it in hand, it’s now obvious the monitor is constrained by issues both niggling and overt. Without the 3D effect, it’s a simple, though relatively colorful, 4K IPS LCD display with a max 165Hz refresh rate. You can find a quality monitor with those specs for under $500. However, Samsung’s new display houses a âlight field displayâ that uses a lenticular lens to direct different images to each eye. The eye-tracking makes sure the lens is always showing the content to your face, no matter how you duck and weave in front of the screen. All that means is the 3D effect offers surprising fidelity. If you remember the awkward viewing angles on earlier lenticular-based displays like the Nintendo 3DS, the tech inside Samsungâs monitor fixes the need for straight-on viewing, offering a unique gaming experience unlike any monitor I’ve used before. Still, the issues mount as soon as you plug it into your PC. The screenâs 3D requires special Reality Hub software you have to install yourself. You can find it either on the Microsoft Store or by digging through thedownloads pageon Samsungâs support site. This monitor does not support 3D movies, either. You can get a subtle 2D effect when watching YouTube or other non-copyrighted videos in full screen, but itâs not exactly the kind of experience you shell out $2,000 for. There are a few other big caveats to Samsung’s monitor that go beyond its astronomical $2,000 price tag. You need an Nvidia RTX GPU to support the 3D effects. I tested the Odyssey 3D on a desktop PC with a GeForce RTX 5090, and I spotted no problems with framerates in the games I played with the additional 3D effects. Then again, many of these titles arenât meant to push your GPU to the limit. The majority of them are cartoonish, kid-friendly games alongside several more stylized third-person action adventure titles. There are only 14 of them compatible with the Odyssey 3D at launch. Although Samsung’s original list of games it supplied me included titles likePsychonauts 2, those are not available as of release. The 14 games supported on the Odyssey 3D:The First Berserker: Khazan, Lies of P, Stray, Dragonball Z: Kakarot, Little Nightmares II, F.I.S.T: Forged In Shadow Torch, SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake, Wigmun, Disney Epic Mickey Rebrushed, The Smurfs Dreams, Palworld, and the threeGrand Theft Auto Definitive Editiontitles. Khazanis the only game built from the ground up with the Odyssey 3D in mind. Loading into it, youâll find that the game’s cutscenes use the eye-trackingto give you a presence in the scene, as if you were peering through a window into the world as objects in the foreground shift around you. In-game, the 3D effect is sharp andâin many waysâengrossing. The characters and snowflakes pop off screen, though it’s subtle enough you wonât feel like youâre being punched in the face every time an arrow flies toward you. The 3D enhances the stylized, cell-shaded visuals, even if an odd artifact too close to the screen would occasionally make me feel uncomfortable and claustrophobic. The problem is that most people likely donât own the vast majority of the games supported by the Odyssey 3D, at least not all in one place. I have access toPalworldthrough Xbox Game Pass. Unfortunately, it seems that Samsung did not take the executable files from Microsoftâs subscription service into account. Reality Hub is supposed to detect any of these games on your PC, but the software failed to detectPalworld. When I manually entered the file path for Reality Hub to access the game, in this case the âgamelaunchhelperâ file, it would launch theÂPalworldoutside of Samsungâs launcher without any 3D effect. Iâve been in communication with Samsung about this issue, and it may change in the future. I loaded up the side-scrolling beat-em-upF.I.S.T: Forged In Shadow Torch specifically to test just how much the 3D makes an impact on a non-3D action game. I pushed the 3D depth and 3D popout settings to their max to get any sense of the varying layers in the gameâs relatively static environment. Even in its coolest moments, where enemies fly at the screen or you see the varying depth of foreground and background, it elicits the same kind of âwow, thatâs neatâ feeling of staring into an infinity mirror at a carnival. Inevitably, the novelty wears off quickly. Iâve encountered other odd glitches, like the Odyssey 3D asking me if I wanted to overlay a 3D effect on a game running in 2D (this didnât actually add a 3D effect). Other times, when using the subtle 3D effect on YouTube, clicking away would end the process of Reality Hub working in the background, which loaded an error message I needed to click away. But these issues are dwarfed simply by the lack of game support compared to this monitorâs price. Itâs always hard to be the first of its kind, and early adopters of new tech will always pay more. The only hope is that Samsung adds more supported games in the future, though that may not be very likely considering how niche this monitor is. The issue then is whether I can recommend whatâs still barely more than a rough concept to anybody now, especially considering you can buy two high-quality4K QD-OLED monitorsfor the price of one Odyssey 3D. I would love to see this monitor tech become more available, with broader support for more games and different options for resolution at a cheaper price. I just hope the Odyssey 3D doesnât get dumped into a shallow grave like all the past attempts at 3D screens. 3DMonitorsSamsung Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

April was the month of the Nintendo Switch 2, but mid-range Android phones were a separate standout. There are so many other ways Apple and Samsung could make phones better instead of just making them thinner. The Odyssey 3D makes characters pop in games without 3D glasses, but it wants you to drop $2,000 for the privilege.

    "title": "Elon Flips Out, Denies Report That Tesla Board Is Looking to Replace Him as CEO",
    "article_text": "Elon Musk publicly melted down on Thursday over a recent report from the Wall Street Journal that claims the billionaire’s car company, Tesla, is looking to replace him as CEO. On Wednesday, the Journalreported that, in recent weeks, Tesla’s board had begun the search for a new corporate leader. Sources familiar with the internal conversations said that board members had “reached out to several executive search firms to work on a formal process for finding Teslaâs next chief executive.” The company ultimately zeroed in on one major search firm, the newspaper says. It is unclear if the search is ongoing or whether Musk even knew about it prior to the reporting, the newspaper claims. Tesla has since denied the report. In a post made to Musk’s platform, X, Tesla’s chair, Robyn Denholm,said the following: “Earlier today, there was a media report erroneously claiming that the Tesla Board had contacted recruitment firms to initiate a CEO search at the company. This is absolutely false (and this was communicated to the media before the report was published). The CEO of Tesla is Elon Musk and the Board is highly confident in his ability to continue executing on the exciting growth plan ahead.” On Thursday morning, MuskretweetedDenholm’s post, adding his own vitriolic commentary to the mix:Â  âIt is an EXTREMELY BAD BREACH OF ETHICS that the [WSJ] would publish a DELIBERATELY FALSE ARTICLE and fail to include an unequivocal denial beforehand by the Tesla board of directors,â Musk said. Later,Musk tweeted: “WSJ is a discredit to journalism.” The Journal claims it reached out to Musk for comment before the story was published, so ostensibly Musk would have had time to personally deny the report if he wanted to. Gizmodo reached out to Tesla and Musk for comment. It would be difficult to say that Musk has been a particularly present or effective corporate leader over the past few months. Instead, Musk has been very busy leading the Trump administration’s DOGE effort that is designed to shrink the government and cut federal spending. That effort has been a complete and total mess, and has inspired intense hatred from millions of Americans. Since helming DOGE, Musk and Tesla’s standing have plummeted all over the world. Indeed, Musk’s DOGE-work has become the subject ofnationwide political protests,Â which have targeted the car company’s corporate profits. During Tesla’s most recent earnings call, it was revealed that the car company’s profits had plummeted bya whopping 70 percentduring the first quarter of this year. Tesla sales are also dropping all over the world,most dramatically in Europe. DOGEElon MuskTESLA Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "article_text": "No offers found Go ahead start recruiting some friends for this one. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. An initial glance at May game releases almost had me calling it a quieter month, but I think it's just because there's no gauntlet of back-to-back RPGs. I'll gladly accept the breather, but there's still plenty on the docket for these next few weeks if you're looking for something to play with a friend. Among Us 3D kicks things off for something to build hostilities within bigger groups, while Revenge of the Savage Planet andElden RingNightreign add more focused co-op adventures. As bummed as I am about theDune: Awakeningdelay pushing it into June, my schedule is better for it. (And we might avoid some Doom/Dune confusion.) There's quite a few worth at least a cursory glance, but I've highlighted some of the biggest games we're looking forward to in May, along with a few events and sales happening leading us all the way into June. Among Us 3D | May 6 (Steam)It's not enough to betray my friends in 2D, so Innersloth adds another dimension this month for Among Us 3D. It's really justAmong Us VRturned flatspace friendly, and includes crossplay between the versions. Revenge of the Savage Planet | May 8 (Steam)The Journey to the Savage Planet sequel is out early this month with more co-op action-adventuring through alien worlds. Plus there's housing. Everyone loves collecting junk to put in player housing. Labyrinth Of The Demon King | May 13 (Steam)I say this with so much love:Labyrinth Of The Demon King looks like something that crawled out of the PS2 horror era. It was a favorite of Ted's in last year'sSteam Scream Festfor its brutal sounds and \"Silent Hill 'rusted industrial hell' brush\" aesthetic, so that's enough to get it on my radar. Doom: The Dark Ages | May 15 (Steam)Doom Guy is getting a bunch of new toys this month, including giant mechs and a literal dragon. Josh wasn't totally sold on the Panzer Dragoon bits in hisDoom: The Dark Ages preview, but there was still plenty there that left him eager to jump in at launch. Monster Train 2 | May 15 (Steam)The first Monster Train released a little after Slay the Spire, and didn't get quite as much recognition, but was another great roguelike deckbuilder from near the start of the genre's boom (and some of useven like it more than Slay the Spire). Elden Ring Nightreign | May 30 (Steam)An co-op Elden Ring game may have some Fromsoft diehards a little worried, but I'm more of a 'Do Not Let Me Solo Her' type and want a buddy (or three).  Morgan compared its structure to Fortnite, causing me immeasurable grief, but by the end of hisNightreign previewI was too intrigued to bail out now. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "article_text": "No offers found The popular streamer was kicked out of the PogChamps 6 tournament for a \"fair play violation.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Popular gaming streamer Benjamin Lupo, better known to his fans as DrLupo, has been kicked out of the PogChamps 6 online chess tournament for a \"fair play violation\"—in other words, he got caught cheating. Hosted by Chess.com, PogChamps—not to be confused with thePogChamp Twitch emote—is a series of amateur chess tournaments featuring well known streamers and celebrities competing for some pretty serious prize money.PogChamps 6, which began on April 29, included soccer player Eberechi Eze, Fortnite pro Mongraal, YouTube Inoxtag, US gymnast Stephen Nedoroscik, and various others—including, of course, DrLupo. The quality of chess seen at PogChamps tourneys may not be world class, but that's not the point. \"PogChamps is one of Chess.com's most successful event franchises,\" Chess.com said in the PogChamps 6 announcement. \"Since its debut in 2020, the event has introduced chess to millions of viewers from different communities. Previous editions of the events have broken several viewership records and inspired many new players to take up the game.\" Unfortunately for DrLupo, it seems he got a little carried away with his enthusiasm for being a chess ambassador, and so now he's out. \"Had a ton of fun playing, but have decided to drop out of the event to help maintain competitive integrity for those involved, as well as the tourney organizers,\" DrLupo wrote onX. \"Having the main stream up on my left monitor over the course of the day today to watch other games being played led to me getting move information I shouldn't have had for a game. That's on me and no one else. That's my fuck up. I apologize—you'd think I would know better, but here we are.\" Shortly after that, however, Chess.com weighed in with the proverbial \"he didn't quit, he was fired,\" writing that he was removed from the tournament \"for a fair play violation that occurred during today’s Pogchamps event. He will be replaced in the consolation bracket before the start of tomorrow’s round.\" DrLupo had initially denied any sort of cheating, claiming he'd hidden the chat window while playing and saying he'd just \"had a really good couple games.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Here's how DrLupo reacted on stream when being accused btw (he did this for like an hour) https://t.co/AvMDR2pQA5 pic.twitter.com/hZ1RMQNkjkMay 1, 2025 But as sometimes happens with this sort of thing, it all unravelled quickly. DrLupo later acknowledged the chat window was open and that he had seen, and used, a few suggested moves. That explanation, alas, brought a torrent of scorn from Reddit. \"He did not randomly stumble upon the best moves by having a stream up on the side,\" redditorPistolcrabwrote. \"He intentionally sought out the help of an engine to find the best move for like 20 turns in a row.\" \"His Elo is 612 on rapid and he blundered a queen away,\"InsertaGoodNamereplied. \"He actually thought people would believe he came up with that checkmate. It's like if a 5 year old started writing at a graduate level right after he shat his pants.\" \"If you have the stream open by accident and you hear a move you just close it afterwards,\"eismann333wrote. \"It's impossible to hear 25 consecutive moves by accident lmao.\" There's a lot of that sort of thing to be seen, and it's collectively a universal rejection of DrLupo's claim that he got fed a few moves through his chat, because his play wasso damn good, forso damn long: DrLupo's Elo—basically his skill rating—is 612, while his opponent in the match, WolfeyVGC, has an Elo of 1340, and that's a massive difference. \"For anyone not into chess, being able to beat someone 700 Elo higher than you would be basically a 2% chance,\" redditorComplex-Emergency-60explained. \"Ie, you will win 1 out of only 50 games. Now, make yourself down a QUEEN (most important piece in the game), and it would be literally impossible to pull off. Like a highschool freshman tying his arm behind his back and beating Kobe in a 1v1, 20 points to zero. \"Now, anyone who is maybe 900 or 1000+ rated might know just how much harder it would be to climb to 1300, and the skill gap involved to reach that rating, but a 600 player likely would be dumb enough to think the skill gap isn't that big and he could fool people who are 1300 and above. He didn't.\" The only explanation that makes sense, according to pretty much everyone commenting on the matter, is that DrLupo used a chess engine—software that analyzes positions and suggests moves—in order to cheat. And the general consensus is that it wasnotsubtle: Asmadjani000put it, \"Dude went from 'what's a horsey?' to 'I can see 15 moves ahead' in two minutes.\" And it seems the chess community was correct, because DrLupo has now copped to using an engine to cheat. \"It sucks that I fucked up,\" he said in astreamtoday. \"And I deserve 100%—I deserve 100% of what people are saying. Using an engine to fix my own fragility is fucking pathetic.\" \"I f*cked up\"DrLupo apologizes for cheating in the PogChamps chess tournament yesterday pic.twitter.com/xgptF5hCnVMay 1, 2025 \"I betrayed the trust of the chess community. I betrayed the trust of my chat. I lied directly to Wolf, and so if somebody can see this, I'm sorry. I got caught in a fight or flight moment, and panicked, and doubled down. \"I am appalled and embarrassed. It's funny too, because I'm the Tarkov guy that's always very anti-cheater, right? And then of course it's the person that's so loud and vocal about it that ends up doing it.\" Unsurprisingly, as noted bySportskeeda, DrLupo is now facing a wider backlash, including questions about possible cheating in other games. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Andy has been gaming on PCs from the very beginning, starting as a youngster with text adventures and primitive action games on a cassette-based TRS80.

    "article_text": "No offers found The next three heroes may make you cry. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Stadiumis more than just anOverwatch 2mode—it's different enough that it could almost be classified as its own game, and a separate game needs a separate roadmap. The developers have planned out the next three seasons of Stadium, albeit roughly, that'll coincide with the regular cadence of seasons. Season 17 will introduce two new maps, Esperanca and Samoa, as well as a crossplay feature, new custom games, saveable and shareable builds, and additional example builds. Although the maps are existing Overwatch 2 maps, they will be modified to accommodate Stadium's quicker matches, resulting in smaller maps and closer spawns to the objective. 2025 games: Upcoming releasesBest PC games: All-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Saveable builds are another massive positive. While my picks are all but ingrained into muscle memory, it would be super helpful to just have my usual powers and items lined up like the example builds. While you can do lots of experimenting in Stadium, I think most players, myself included, havesettled into picking the same buildthat works for us. That may be my favourite feature coming to Stadium, but I don't think it's the most exciting. Next season, there will be three heroes added to the mode: Sigma, Junkrat, and Zenyatta. These heroes are all scary enough without items and powers, and as they all have unique abilities, I can imagine that their builds will be pretty monstrous. These aren't the last characters to join up, though. Season 18 will see Winston, Sojourn, and Brigitte added alongside Route 66 and London maps, another new mode, payload race, and new all-star rewards. While Season 19 will add a few more heroes, a new China map, consumables, and item upgrades. It seems like a pretty stacked summer for Stadium, but that's not surprising considering itsrecent success. Stadium has quickly become one of the main attractions of Overwatch 2, rivalling Quick Play and Competitive, unlike other modes or Arcade add-ons. That's mostly thanks to how different it is compared to what Overwatch 2 players have seen before, and how this was the feature or mode, alongside perks, which should've heralded in Overwatch 2—these are the changes that players have wanted and expected Blizzard to make for the last three years.

    "article_text": "No offers found So that's where all the players were. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I've been playing a lot of Overwatch 2's Stadiummode since it launched a couple of weeks ago. But I do like to diversify, so I also decided tocheck out the hero bansin ranked. Or at least I tried to. It took me a whole seven minutes to find a match—outrageous, I know. It turns out I hadn't been blacklisted, everyone was just playing Stadium. \"StadiumisOverwatch 2'smost-played mode currently, eclipsing Quick Play and Competitive,\" a press release says. \"There were 2.3 million matches played across 7.8 million hours of Stadium during launch week. More than twice as much as the previous most popular game mode's launch week, when Overwatch Classic was added to Overwatch 2.\" 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Those numbers attest to just how desperately Overwatch needed something new. The best part about Stadium is that it's almost a complete redesign. The maps and objectives have been made smaller, heroes have new powers, and there are new features like bounties and boosts. It may have the same heroes as regular old Overwatch 2, but the fights and strategies are quite different. I've seen one strat where you simply go after builds for the first couple of rounds, sacrificing the win, but getting more cash to spend on items to complete your build and crush your enemies after round two. Alternatively, you can go heavy on the offensive and try to make the gap between the two teams so wide that the losers get mercied after the third round. I've seen both work, and I have no doubt that new metas and fun ideas will emerge as the seasons commence. But regardless of what method you choose, you'll likely earn a substantial amount of money. In fact, players have apparently earned 900 billion Stadium cash, with a total of 206 million items chosen. Most of that being me building into my ridiculous Soldier 76 Helix Rocket build—it works so well, and it's absolutely glorious. Although I must admit that the massive number of players, time spent, and cash earned is somehow not the most surprising thing. Finding out who the most successful hero in Stadium is. You may think that the best hero pick in Stadium would be a hitscan like Soldier 76 or Cassidy, or perhaps one of the strong tanks like Orisa or Junker Queen. Nope, it's none of the usual suspects. Somehow, the hero with the best win rate is Lucio, who also happens to be the least picked hero in the entire mode. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. So, what have we learned from all of this? The gamers love Stadium, Overwatch players have too much time on their hands (myself included), and Lucio players are like a rose among many thorns—their scarcity makes them all the more beautiful, that is, when they're healing you and not just stuck on speed boost.

    "title": "Oblivion is a lot better now that I can read",
    "article_text": "No offers found I was not equipped to enjoy this game in 2006, I'm learning. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The other day, I was frantically crouch walking around Skingrad in Oblivion Remastered, tailing the neighbors of a seriously paranoid guy named Glarthir, and thought: This is new, right? When did Oblivion get all these weird, engrossing sidequests? Didn't I play this game a lot back in the day? Technically yes, I played Oblivion in 2006… when I was nine, had a horrible attention span, and had only recently picked up rudimentary reading skills. Maybe I didn'treallyplay Oblivion. I remember it like it was just 19 years ago: My dad came home from work one day with The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Collector's Edition, a lavish bi-fold case with two discs, an art book, a map, and a metal coin. I didn't know what The Elder Scrolls was, and neither did my dad. He'd picked it up because he wanted something new to play on our Xbox 360. I don't think he ever got out of the sewers. Firing up the games my dad bought for himself and never played was a Park tradition in those early Xbox years. Crackdown, Kameo, Perfect Dark Zero, Peter Jackson's King Kong, Rainbow Six Vegas—you know, thehits. I gave Oblivion a shot based on an assumption that it'd be as cool as the metal coin that came with it. I'd never played an open world game and couldn't tell you what \"RPG\" meant. I recall Oblivion's character creator seriously stressing me out. All the sliders, tabs, and widened Bethesda faces staring deep into my soul were a bit much, so I rolled with a default white guy. I also remember the winding sewers of the Imperial City overwhelming my third-grader sense of direction—on that note, did Bethesda cut most of the sewers part out in the remaster? I could've sworn you had to fumble around those tunnels for an hour before reaching the surface. There's no way I was reading or listening to any of the dialogue, by the way. I can remember being aware of the emperor's assassination (because it happened right in front of me), but I highly doubt there was any awareness of the deeply important task the late emperor bestowed on me, a stranger. As I entered the Weynon House to find Jauffre, grandmaster of the Blades, in Oblivion Remastered last week, a faint wave of repressed anxiety washed over me. I definitely recognized this place from my 2006 playthrough—in fact, I'm pretty sure this is where it ended. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. If memory serves, I entered Weynon Priory and accidentally punched a priest in the face (or maybe it was a fireball). Everybody wanted to kill me, so I ran back outside, where all the outside priests also wanted to kill me. I hadn't saved up to that point, and my most recent autosave was after the fight kicked off, so I panicked and slapped the big power button on the 360. If I'd had any patience to actually read tutorials or listen to what characters were saying, I might've learned how to surrender and pay a fine for the accidental assault. Instead, I got confused by some big words and gave up, convinced that I'd permanently doomed that character to perpetual violence. And that was my sole Oblivion experience for years. I did pick it back up on the PS3 after finishing Skyrim in 2012, but all I remember from that time is rushing through the main quest and jumping until my acrobatics maxed out. No excuses for skipping through the dialogue that time, except that I was 15 and lazy. Now I'm embarrassed to have believed for years that Oblivion is just alright. It's great, and the remastered touches bridge the gap between past and present with modern conveniences. Every single sidequest I've started since becoming the hero of Kvatch in the remaster is new to me, which tells me that I had no idea how to properly enjoy these games when I was younger.

    "article_text": "No offers found Macron congratulated Sandfall Interactive for making \"one of the best-rated games in history.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. 14 years after Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk presented US President Barack Obama with a copy of The Witcher 2 as anofficial diplomatic gift, French President Emmanuel Macron is getting in on the \"recognizing the cultural value of videogames\" action. No, he hasn't added Donald Trump to his Steam friends list, but he did take a moment out of his surely-busy day to shout out French development studio Sandfall Interactive for its big success withClair Obscur: Expedition 33. \"A million copies and to date, one of the best-rated games in history: and yes, it's French!\" Macron wrote onInstagram(Google translated). \"Congratulations to Sandfall Interactive and all the creators of Expedition 33. You are a shining example of French audacity and creativity.\" Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is indeed a hit, both critically and commercially:Concurrent player countshave hovered around 100,000 on Steam alone in the week since its release, and that 92% aggregate score onMetacriticis a number a lot of developers can only dream of. The gamesurpassed one million copies soldjust three days after it launched. But, like Tusk's diplomatic gift, the real significance of Macron's statement—and whether he wrote it himself or it was fired off by an anonymous intern is irrelevant, it's up on his verified account—is the recognition that videogamesmatter. \"Games are for kids\" is cliche, but it's also a frustratingly persistent point of view, as is their purported dangers to that same young crowd: It was literally less than three weeks ago that US House Speaker Mike Johnson used the scourge of videogames tojustify cuts to Medicaid, a health insurance program for people with low incomes. Current US President Donald Trump also blamed videogames for fuelling aviolent real-world culturein his first term—more than once. Particularly in that light, it's nice to see another major head of state throw a public thumbs-up to videogames. And this isn't the first time Macron has done so: Just a few days before his Clair Obscur post, he congratulated French esports org Team Vitality after its Counter-Strike team won the ESL Grand Slam at the Intel Extreme Masters Melbourne 2025 tournament, a victory he said \"made our colors shine.\" Macron has his own less-than-stellar history with blaming videogames for the ills of youth. In July 2023, amidstriots in Francedriven by the police killing of a teenager during a traffic stop, Macron said there was a \"feeling of unreality\" amongst the youngest of the rioters: \"It sometimes feels like some of them are experiencing on the streets the videogames that have intoxicated them.\" Just a few months later, though, he was singing a different tune, saying his intent was to condemn violence, not videogames, which he described as \"culture, entertainment, [and] spectacle!\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"They are a field of artistic experimentation, a fascinating learning space, blending all the arts,\" Macron wrote in a lengthy message onX. \"Playing means listening to music, immersing oneself in stories, feeling emotions, and traveling through time. It means exploring visual universes that write a new chapter in the history of art. Competitive video gaming is a sport, an ecosystem, with true professionals, high-level gatherings, and international tournaments that mark history, forging generations around powerful values. \"Videogames are an integral part of France. Assassin's Creed and Dofus are creations of French talent. We are proud of them.\" J’ai fait bondir les gamers.

    "article_text": "No offers found It's all love, no hate on both sides. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I'll be honest, before the release of Oblivion Remastered, I thought it and Skyblivion—the fan mod that rebuilds Oblivion in Skyrim Special Edition—were diametrically opposed. This was zero-sum game territory, surely? If one gets mega-popular it can only be to the detriment of the other. Winner takes all. Only one leaves alive. Well don't I feel like a fool? Not only did theSkyblivion team send \"all love and no hate\"to Bethesda and Virtuos' official remaster just before it finally released, but Bethesda then gave themall keys for the game for free. In a world of litigious megacorps sending the lawyers after their most passionate fans for daring to touch their IP, it's behaviour that's been a real credit to Bethesda and the Skyblivion team both. And it doesn't stop there. In a just-released developer spotlight with art and development lead Dan Lee, Bethesda gave yet another shout-out to the Skyblivion team. \"Even though I worked on Oblivion Remastered,\" said Lee, \"I'm still excited for Skyblivion.\" Bethesda even played some footage of the mod while Lee waxed lyrical about it. It still looks great, if you're wondering. \"I think what they're doing is very special,\" continues Lee, who also worked on original Oblivion, Skyrim, and Fallouts 3, 4, and 76. \"I'm excited to see their interpretation of what we've done in the past. I think it's a great year for Oblivion fans.\" The Skyblivion team responded to Lee's shout-out onBluesky: \"Dan, we're just as excited to get Skyblivion into your hands this year as you are to play it! Thanks for the shout-out and kind words.\" Skyblivion isn't the only mod Lee called out. He also tipped his hat to quest modSirenroot, theEast Empire Expansion, theBards College Expansion, theCoven of Cronesand plenty else besides. But when it comes to Skyblivion, Lee has good reason to be excited. Skyblivion is still set for a 2025 release after a lengthy development process, and it's not letting Oblivion Remastered deter it from that goal.

    "title": "Original Oblivion developers gather to watch the 2006 documentary on the making of the game, and Todd Howard sums up the feeling: 'This is going to be really f**king awkward, watching this'",
    "article_text": "No offers found I think it actually holds up quite well. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Back in 2006, Bethesda Softworks made a documentary about the making of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion, capturing the scale of the effort behind what was then the studio's biggest and most ambitious game. And now, to celebrate the recent (and tremendously successful) release ofOblivion Remastered, Bethesda got a whole bunch of the original team back together and made them all watch it. \"Made them\" is a bit of a comedic overstatement, but Todd Howard clearly has some feelings in that regard. \"How awesome is it to see this group together?\" he says to the assembled audience. \"I'm more moved than I thought. It's been a long road, everybody.\" And then, his deeper feelings stand exposed: \"This is going to be really fucking awkward, watching this.\" Hey, it's a fair prediction. Many of us are not fortunate enough to be in a position where we can look back on what we were doing 20 years ago and think, yeah,cool. And the vast majority of us don't have it committed to film for all time, which makes it exponentially worse than hazy memories you can just try not to think too much about. But the truth is that the video, or at least the little bits we see of it, aren't cringey at all, but earnest and sincere; Howard's \"who's laughing now\" crack in particular stands out for me as a throwaway joke that probably comes off better now than it did in 2006. And not because he's become the face of one of the most successful videogame studios of all time, but because this was a point at which Bethesda still wasn't quite over that hump, and the \"look at me now\" attitude, while clearly thrown out as a joke, is something a lot of us can relate to, particularly in hindsight: We're doing this weird thing,and it's working. It also highlights what Bethesda was able to accomplish with a relatively small team. \"It felt like a really small, tight team,\" former head of publishing and public face Pete Hines says. \"I mean, it wasn't a whole lot more than the number of folks sitting here now. That was the whole company.\" I don't know how many people are in the audience, but credit listings on Mobygames tell the tale: 285 people have credits on the originalOblivion, a number that climbs to 810 forSkyrimand 4,038 forStarfield. Those latter credits include numerous external studios that also worked on the game, so it's not just Bethesda, but even so those numbers really illustrate how the scale of these projects have grown over the past two decades. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. And how does Howard feel when the show is all over? \"It was as awkward as I thought,\" he says. But, he adds, \"In so many ways, when I see it and look in the room, it feels the same.\" That has to be a pretty good feeling. The original Making of Oblivion documentary was included with The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Collectors Edition—if you don't happen to have a copy of that lying around (or an optical drive in your PC), you can still catch the whole thing onYouTube.

    "article_text": "No offers found Black also made it onto the Hot 100 with The Super Mario Bros. Movie's Peaches. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Jack Black‘s meme song Steve’s Lava Chicken fromA Minecraft Movieis now the shortest song ever to crack the Billboard Hot 100, which tracks the most popular current songs week-by-week. Steve's Lava Chicken is 34 seconds long. The song debuts at No. 78 on the Hot 100 and, according to online data tracker Luminate (thanks Billboard) had over seven million streams in the US between April 18 and April 24. The Hot 100 made its own debut in August 4, 1958, and yep there's never been a shorter track on there. As well as being an actor Jack Black is also a professional musician, best-known for his work with jokey rock group Tenacious D. Their songPOD, from 2006's Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny, spent one week on the Billboard Hot 100 at the exact same position. This is not even Black's first hit videogame song. Black plays Bowser in the Super Mario Bros. Movie and performed the songPeaches, which also broke into the Hot 100. It spent five weeks on the charts, eventually peaking at number 56. The previous shortest song on there was Kid Cudi's Beautiful Trip, which clocks in at a frankly indulgent 37 seconds. The Minecraft song happens when Black's character Steve decides to show his companions what happens when you combine lava with, yes, a chicken. Black then bursts into song, extolling the virtues of Steve's Lava Chicken, which admittedly does look kinda delicious. What the hell, here are the full lyrics: La-la-la-lava ch-ch-ch-chicken Steve's Lava Chicken, yeah, it's tasty as hell Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "Borderlands 4 looks like more of the same yet again—and in 2025, that's not enough",
    "article_text": "No offers found When your big, headline features are just basic quality-of-life improvements, something's not right. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The first Borderlands was a real innovation—probably more than it gets credit for. It carved out a new genre that's gone on to be one of the most influential in the industry. After that, Borderlands 2 cleverly refined and expanded on the core formula, demonstrating quite how much of our time all that looting and shooting could suck up with a bigger world to do it in. And then after that… well, it's been a lot of wheel-spinning, hasn't it? It's depressingly hard to remember the last time Borderlands had a really fresh new idea. Watching the substantial new gameplay reveal forBorderlands 4, it certainly doesn't feel like we're 13 years on from Borderlands 2. It doesn't even look bad, necessarily—I can admit to feeling the looter-shooter itch creeping up on me as I see glowing loot flying out of enemies. There's just a complete lack of innovation. The big headline features, shown off for the game's first major reveal? For the most part it's very basic quality-of-life updates, like improved lobbies, instanced loot, or being able to replay a boss fight. All ideas that have been commonplace in other games for years now. Is that all Gearbox has to show for six years of work? There's a handful of new movement abilities—including a jetpack glide and a grappling hook—but it's all stuff we've seen before in other games, and none of it seems to have a major impact. During the combat sequences in the reveal, the player is jumping and sliding all over the place, but it's pretty clear to see that that isn't necessary—fights are still static, with slow-moving, bullet sponge enemies and flat combat environments. Watching a character grapple-swing from one side of a small loading dock to the other when it seems like they could easily have just sprinted the distance, while enemies look on blankly… it's not exactly selling the idea of more dynamic combat. Meanwhile, we're on a completely new planet that looks exactly like Pandora, fighting enemies that look just like enemies we've fought before (does every world have its own horde of mask-wearing bandits and infestation of flying bat monsters?), still hunting for vault keys, and apparently still doing missions where we have to track down Lilith for some reason or other. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. A seamless open world map is appealing, but again the demo seems to have nothing cool to show in that space. As the footage takes us across icy plains exactly like the beginning of Borderlands 2, the developers talk breathlessly about such exciting features as… pressing a button in a bunker to activate fast travel, and groups of enemies mindlessly patrolling the map. We're promised a great new story, but what we're shown is just the same old sprinting and shooting while you ignore snippets of forgettable NPC dialogue. The big new change this time? \"For our longtime Borderlands fans, we're throwing back to our more grounded tone,\" according to Pitchford. Given the still fantastical setting and goofy foes, that seems to just be code for 'less instantly outdated meme references', which is certainly welcome but hardly a significant shift in style. It all seems like a perfectly fine set of tweaks and improvements to the Borderlands formula, but they're just not really adding up to anything. This is the point in the preview cycle where the developer has to really sell the biggest, coolest things about their game. When we're instead being invited to get hyped for things like equipable medpacks and slightly different skill trees, it's concerning. I'm sure there'll be some nostalgic fun to be had here, but I can't help but be disappointed seeing the developer that invented the genre seemingly failing to push it forward. If you're a Borderlands fan, you've likely already spent 100s of hours with the series—I know I have. Another 100 of the same again but a bit shinier and more convenient just isn't enticing, and it's not a good foundation for the inevitable spin-offs and expansions we'll be getting over the years waiting for the next mainline Borderlands. Borderlands 3 already felt like diminishing returns for the series, and with the dreadful movie still fresh in people's minds, it feels like time for a revitalising release. If Borderlands 4 is that, then Gearbox really needs to show us before September. Right now what we're seeing is just more of the same but with less annoying jokes.

    "article_text": "No offers found Put on pause. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The US tariff situation isa constantly developing story, but I think most would agree this is euphemistic at best; there'sonly so much Warhammer miniatures can explain. Since their announcement in early April, these tariffs have created a logistical nightmare for both major players and smaller businesses alike. As a result of retaliatory tariffs on Chinese goods soaring as high as 145%,8BitDohas temporarily suspended shipping stock from its China-based warehouse to the US (viaPolygon). Scoop up one of the company's controllers into your shopping basket, enter a US-based delivery address, and you'll potentially be told'Your order cannot be shipped to the selected address.' 8BitDo is known for colourful bits of kit, like theUltimate 2C wireless controller, and quirky peripherals, like theRetro Mechanical Keyboard. Not every product available on 8BitDo's website is affected, as some items will still ship from the company's US-based warehouse. However, there's currently no indication where specific stock is based on any of 8BitDo's product pages, so you won't know until you try to checkout. As the tariff situation is so tumultuous, it's unclear how long US-based customers will be unable to buy a selection of 8BitDo's stock. At time of writing, 8BitDo's landing page only specifies that the company's China warehouse will \"be closed from 1st to 5th May 2025 for Labor Day and the shipment will be resumed on 6th May 2025.\" Like I said, 8BitDo is neither the first nor the last business having to make a call like this. Just for a start,Nintendo initially postponed announcing US pricing for the Switch 2in light of the tariff situation, before more recently committing toa $450 price tag for the base console. Peripherals, like the Joy-con 2 controllers, will instead be pricier to bear the brunt of \"changes in market conditions.\" Apple moved quickly,reportedly airlifting 600 tons of iPhones out of India—only for tariffs to get put on a 90-day pause. But those are some of the aforementioned major players, and for the littler guys the tariffs represent a potentially very bleak future. For one devastating example,board game publisher CMONhad to put a number of their projects on hold and lay off staff.With board game makers particularly badly hit, the creators behind Wingspan even announced plans to'sue the president'. It's clear to see the tariffs have already created widespread disruption. It's impossible to tell exactly how this situation will shake out, but I have the sense that it's going to get worse before it gets better.

Shushei was also a winner in Season 6 of the Intel Extreme Masters with Fnatic, and won at IEM Hannover with the team myRevenge in 2011. He retired from the competitive LoL scene in 2013. As well as his considerable skills, Shushei was also a much-beloved figure in the LoL scene, and responsible for this legendary chest bump. \"Yesterday, we lost a legend in Shushei,\" reads a post fromthe official Fnatic account. \"Shushei was a part of the incredible Fnatic team that won the first-ever League of Legends World Championships back in 2011 that began the Fnatic LoL fandom for so many of our fans.

    "title": "Skyrim lead designer makes it sound like there's gonna be loading screens in Bethesda games for years to come yet, bucko: 'We just didn’t have a choice, really'",
    "article_text": "No offers found Heavy load. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Add together all the minutes of my life I've spent in loading screens and you could, well, send me into quite a grim depressive spiral, probably. And since I'm someone with several hundred hours invested across various Bethesda games, how many of those minutes were spent twiddling Daedric artifacts in Skyrim's load screens or looking at cool Netch concept art in Morrowind? More than I'd care to count, most likely, given that Bethesda loves hitting you with a loading screen before you transition to an interior. Here's the kicker: it doesn't sound like anything's going to change in The Elder Scrolls 6 or after, either. Former Bethesda dev and Skyrim lead designer Bruce Nesmith recently spoke toVideoGamerto tell you that, sorry friend, you're gonna be loading for a long time yet. \"It’s not that anybody at Bethesda ever wanted to do it. We just didn’t have a choice, really,\" said Nesmith. \"Everybody who complains about them assumes that it’s done because we’re lazy or we don’t want to follow the modern thinking on stuff,\" but he explains that the fact of the matter is that \"Bethesda games are so detailed and so graphics intensive… you just can't have both present at the same time.\" Specifically, it's really hard to keep track of all those weird physics and the precise spot you left your cheesewheels across Bethesda's enormous open worlds if you aren't giving the game a breather every so often, and trying to make 'seamless' loading screens apparently—says Nesmith—caused unacceptable performance woes. \"I can’t have the interiors of all these places loaded at the same time as the exteriors,\" said Nesmith, \"that's just not an option.All the fancy tricks for streaming and loading and all that, you end up with hitching. So you’re actually better off stopping the game briefly, doing a loading screen and then continuing on.\" The alternative is to make games with \"less going on,\" but then that would hardly be a Bethesda game, would it? \"So it's just one of those necessary evils… if the game was going to have the experience we wanted it to have.\" I see Nesmith's point, and it certainly makes me think about Starfield's immersion-breaking spaceflight loads in a new light, but I have to admit: the ability to pick up every item on a shelf has never reallydonemuch for me in Bethesda games. It can lead to some fun outcomes—like the famous Skyrim trick of robbing shops by putting a bucket on the owner's head—but it usually just feels a bit purposeless. If the choice is between that kind of complexity and fewer loading screens? I'd take fewer loading screens. Bethesda would have to lean a lot more into the systemic weirdness it's spent a lot of games stamping down on to make that complexity something I care to preserve.

    "article_text": "No offers found But hey, there's a new sprite sheet, at least. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Huge news—Silksong now has an official release date, for, uh, a museum exhibit. It'll be playable at a museum exhibit for sure at a specific date. We still don't know when it's actually coming out, and at this point I think the bit is funnier if we never know. That's according to confirmation obtainedby IGN, who received comment from the curators of AMCI—which is Australia's national museum of screen culture. \"Since Hollow Knight: Silksong's initial announcement in 2019, it has been one of the most anticipated indie games on the planet—and we are thrilled to celebrate the design of this South Australian-made game as a centrepiece of Game Worlds in September.\" You might wonder—hey, it's just an exhibit. Maybe it's just a trailer, or some concept art, or a talk, or something. No. Silksong will be absolutely playable within the exhibit from September 18, a date I'm praying comesafterthe game's still-mystified release date. Otherwise, the poor curators of this fine institution are going to suffer a horde of deranged skongers. \"From the hundreds of sprites that animate Hornet’s different movements and attacks, to the logic behind the game’s most challenging boss fights—and of course, having the game playable in-gallery—our Silksong displays delve deeply into the details of the game's artistic direction and design. We’re so grateful to Team Cherry for trusting us with their work, and so excited to share that work with you!\" As is tradition at this point, I like to check in with the Silksong Reddit to see how my favourite community of hollows is doing. Mostly,they're confusedas to how it's not a \"Silkpost\", which is a designated tag that signals a post as bait. Presumably because people kept making fake posts and nobody could stop them, so they had to make it a part of their official process. Ormaybe r/Silksong just likes to get lost in the conspiracy sauce. Likely both.

We know it's coming (probably) in 2025, but that very announcement wasstuffed hastily into the end of a Nintendo Direct, so it's really anyone's goddamn guess. It could be tomorrow. It could be never. It might've always been released, if we only had the eyes to see. Skong.

    "title": "The RX 9060 XT rumour mill flip-flops again: we shall have an 8 GB version of AMD's card after all",
    "article_text": "No offers found Hopefully at a reasonable price point. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. As we roll towards Computex, and hopefully a whole bunch of PC gaming hardware announcements, I can't help but get excited about talk of entry-level components. Probably most of all, I'm excited about the prospect of an (as-yet uncertain) AMDRadeon RX 9060 XT announcementwhich will hopefully rock the entry-level graphics card segment. So I'm most certainly excited by rumour that there will, in fact, be an 8 GB version of this card launching. That's coming fromBenchlife, which says that, despite recent rumours to the contrary, \"we have reliable sources telling us that there is currently no plan to stop supply or cancel it. As for the news from the market, it is just a rumour. The main reason is as mentioned earlier, it is entirely due to the reaction to the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti\" (machine translated). It's true, as Benchlife says, that Nvidia only sent out 16 GB versions of the card for review. Plus, there's the fact that some earlyRX 9060 XT listings that showed upwere all 16 GB versions. However, it's unclear why these two facts would make people assume that AMD wouldcancelthe 8 GB version entirely. Whatever the reason, according to Benchlife's sources, we can still expect an 8 GB version in addition to a 16 GB version. We're hoping these will getannounced at AMD's Computex press conferencetowards the end of this month. AMD specifically mentioned gaming in its announcement of this press conference, so fingers crossed. Despite all that people like to decry 8 GB of VRAM as not enough for gaming in 2025, with prices being what they are, a budget 8 GB card from AMD might be just what's needed to spice the market up at the low end. Plus, we already know that evensome big AAA games are fine with just 8 GB of VRAM—it's all game-dependent. That being said, everything will, as always, depend on stocks. Without ample stocks, AIBs can charge what they like and people will still presumably lap it up. As for what to expect in terms of performance, we have some indication that it'll be about half as powerful as theRX 9070 XT. Although this isn't official, recent leaks have it thatthe RX 9060 XT will have the same number of shader cores and whatnot as the RX 7600 XT, but with a higher boost clock. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Plus, of course, you'll be getting all that sweet RDNA 4 goodness, including FSR 4 upscaling and frame gen. Which, I might add, is a pretty impressive generation of that tech that all but closes the gap on Nvidia. For more speculation about the actual performance of the RX 9060 XT, though, you can check our Jeremy's story linked above, as he gives a good picture of what we might be in store for. With an RX 9060/9060 XT launch seemingly just around the corner, the RTX 5060 being\"available in May\", and even RTX 5060 laptop GPU benchmarksstarting to surface, it's looking like the lower end of the GPU market might finally—finally—be kicking into gear. I'll take more options over less any day of the week, 8 GB or otherwise.

    "title": "Foundry VTT creator does what Hasbro won't with D&D, trashes the idea of AI in tabletop roleplaying game industry as a 'betrayal'",
    "article_text": "No offers found \"A betrayal of the creative people who made the TTRPG industry what it is.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Generative AI has gotten its deep learning tentacles into many parts of gaming life, and tabletop is no exception—take Dungeons & Dragons for example. While Wizards of the Coast has endured controversy after controversy for accidentally putting AI art in sourcebooks, and has agenerally anti-AI stance, Hasbro's CEO Chris Cocks has been on the record as, uh,not doing that. Which is why I've found myself pleasantly surprised to find out that Andrew Clayton, creator of thevirtual tabletop software Foundry, has a two-boots-in-the-dirt hardline stance against AI, as per aninterview with RPGDropearlier this week. If you're playing any TTRPG online—be it D&D, Pathfinder 2nd edition, Blades in the Dark, whatever—chances are you might've done so on Foundry. It's a little pricier and harder to set up when compared to something like Roll20, but makes up for it in spades with customisation, thanks to player-made modules you can slot into your game. While the entire interview is interesting, Clayton very much speaks as the head of a company might—nothing overly corpo, but it's all fairly polished and media-trained. When asked about AI, though? It's a text interview, so I'm assuming a bit of tone here, but the word choice is downright stern. \"My own personal stance on this is that AI generated content remains—for the foreseeable future—an exploitative technology that unfairly harvests the intellectual property of artists, writers, and designers to produce soulless and derivative works without their consent,\" Clayton says. \"Until the legal and ethical challenges of generative AI are more adequately addressed—and I don’t foresee this happening—I don’t think generative AI can be responsibly employed in our industry without it being a betrayal of the creative people who made the TTRPG industry what it is in the first place.\" This is a far cry from the aforementioned words of Hasbro's CEO, who late last year talked a big game about \"significantly and liberally\" using AI, adding that his apparent 30-40 fellow D&D-ers (I guess he's in a West Marches campaign or something) had all been drinking from the well of deep learning: \"There's not a single person who doesn't use AI somehow for either campaign development or character development or story ideas. That's a clear signal that we need to be embracing it.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Clayton won't even go that far, though. While he concedes that \"generative AI content can have a role to play in private home games, where generative text or images can quickly supplement the storytelling with an improvisational aid or accessibility tool,\" he says that it's still \"important for the user to understand it is actively disenfranchising human creators.\" That's more or less where I land on it, too. Before the proliferation of AI, virtual tabletop players were grabbing images from Google for character reference, which is potentially rude to artists, but harmless in a utilitarian sense. And sometimes, players would then become attached enough to their characters to later commission artwork, so I've typically seen it as a net good. And while I won't lose sleep over those same players AI-generating artwork or writing for their home games, the key difference is that they're supporting tools that—as Clayton says—are actively making money off scraping the internet and using real, actual human work without consent. I should make a counterpoint here, though. While Foundry VTT doesn't have officially-supported AI integration, Ihaveseen modules that make use of AI in circulation before. These are modules created by players, and I wouldn't ask Foundry VTT to ruthlessly moderate them, but it is worth noting that this is Clayton's personal stake. Foundry, the company, is hardline against AI, but the people using Foundry aren't necessarily stopped from doing so. The real interesting meat here is, however, in how Foundry VTT has an official partnership with D&D as of February last year. Hasbro's Chris Cocks has been effusive about AI in tabletop, a stance that's at odds with the rest of the industry—including WoTC's business partners, apparently. Wizards of the Coast has its own policies, and I'd be surprised if anyone working there was jazzed about the concept, but the truth is Hasbro owns WoTC and a Hasbro executive will, invariably, have the final say. But maybe Foundry'll have AI in the future, once it's better-legislated or something? \"No.\" Clayton says. Yep, that seems pretty clear-cut.

    "title": "Gigabyte MO34WQC2 OLED gaming monitor review",
    "article_text": "No offers found When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A very practical OLED widescreen, that's only really worth a look at its discounted price. There's nothing fundamentally wrong with the Gigabyte OLED, it just doesn't do anything new or exciting for the segment. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. The 27-inch 4K OLED market has been the media darling since CES 2025 so you'd be forgiven for forgetting the good ol' staple 34-inch OLED ultrawide. Funny because it wasAlienware's fantastic AW3423DWthat kicked off the OLED gaming monitor race a few years ago. Gigabyte has quietly dropped its first OLED ultra-wide, theGigabyte MO34WQC2—a 3440x1440, QD-OLED panel, with a 240 Hz refresh rate, USB Power Delivery, and a handy dandy KVM Switch. And while it's not the most exciting OLED in the world, it certainly gets the job done. But with an MSRP just over $1000, does Gigabyte do enough to join the ranks of best OLED gaming monitors? In a word, no, even with a discount. Design wise, this thing isn't going to turn heads—it's a typical Gigabyte, plastic, utilitarian design. No flashiness, no RGB rainbows or slick colors. The matte-black chassis, subtle stand, and 1800R curve make it feel more like an accountant's monitor than a gamer's. About the only flashiness is the silver badge on the stand boldly proclaiming \"OLED\" just in case you missed that. The stand is simple with large flat angled feet that keep everything nicely sat on your desk. You get height, tilt, and swivel adjustment—everything short of pivot, which, let's be real, nobody's doing with a 34-inch ultra-wide anyway. Build quality's tight: no wobble, no creaks, just a reassuring sturdiness that makes it feel like it's built to last. The QD-OLED panel here is nothing we haven't seen before. It's a 3rd Gen Samsung panel shaped into 34-inches of glorious, curved looking glass. It's 3440 x 1440 which at this size isn't anywhere near the insane sharpness of the aforementioned 27-inch 4K OLEDs. Screen size:34-inchResolution:3,440 x 1,440Brightness:250 cd/m² (Typ, SDR APL 100%); 1000 cd/m² (Typ, HDR APL 3%)Color coverage:99% DCI-P3Response time:0.03msRefresh rate:240HzHDR:DisplayHDR 400 True BlackFeatures:Samsung Gen 3 QD-OLED panel, adaptive sync, 1x DisplayPort 1.4, 2x HDMI 2.1, 1x USB-C with 15W PD, KVM switchPrice:$800|£710 That said, what it lacks in pixel density, it makes up for in expansive canvas that's as good for super multi-tasking as it is for immersive gaming. The 1800R curve is gentle but still saves you from whiplash while gaming. Like others of its ilk, it boasts VESA ClearMR 13000 certification for Motion clarity which, in tandem with the 240Hz refresh rate and 0.03ms response, means there's no ghosts around here. From twitch shooters to high-speed racers, the performance is buttery smooth. Color-wise, it's everything you'd expect from OLED and more. Perfect blacks enhance the perception of color making everything seem more vivid. Color accuracy is rated at 99% DCI-P3 coverage which makes it very useable for more serious video and photo editing workflows. Dig into the OSD menu and you'll find a plethora of color presets including an sRGB and full six-axis color control. Even though it's 'just' HDR400 True Black certified, games like South of Midnight and Assassins Creed Shadows look stunning. Of course, that's once you get passed the usual Windows 11 HDR oddities. The monitor hits about 455 nits of peak brightness in small areas, which won't blow your socks off but its enough to make HDR in games look quite respectable. Honestly, though, more often than not, I ran the monitor in SDR; the greater contrast and colour saturation often made games look better than in HDR. Running Assassins Creed Shadows on this thing really sucks you into historic Japan—immense detail, wide field of view, fluid motion and breathtaking colors. The 21:9 aspect ratio is my favorite way to play games on PC thanks to that expanded view and immersion. To me, its better than VR. Gigabyte has always been good with ports and the MO34WQC2 doesn't buck that trend. You get two HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort 1.4, USB-C with DP Alt Mode(albeit a paltry 15W charging), plus downstream USBs—enough for your console, your PC, and your work laptop to all play nice. There's a built-in KVM switch too, though it's a little bit wonky with slow switching between devices. In addition to a headphone and microphone jack, the MO34WQC2 has two 3W speakers which you can use in a pinch but should generally be avoided. The OSD is straightforward and joystick-controlled, with easy access to presets, black equalizer settings, and overdrive tweaks. You can also use the Gigabyte Control center in Windows to control the monitor with your mouse. Besides the nipple are two buttons, one is the aforementioned KVM button while the other is a Tactical button to switch the display to a smaller 24-inch, 1080p viewport for those who want to play some serious shooter games. Of course, as an OLED, we have to address the proverbial burn-in elephant in the room. Now, I don't believe any normal person will ever have burn-in on these modern OLEDs, however, the MO34WQC2 comes with the usual suite of protections. Interestingly, Gigabyte isn't in your face about reminding you to run OLED care every four hours, which is a welcome relief. ✅You prioritize speed and immersion over flashy design:This monitor is all about delivering ultra-smooth performance and vibrant visuals, making it perfect for competitive gamers and immersive single-player experiences.✅You need multi-device flexibility:With plenty of ports and a built-in KVM switch, the MO34WQC2 is ideal for gamers and professionals using multiple systems on a single display. ❌You need professional-grade color and resolution:If you're a creative relying on perfect color calibration and pixel perfection, this isn't the monitor for you.❌You're on a budget:At MSRP this isn't the best priced OLED gaming monitor. Stepping back a generation can save you tons of money and still get you a great monitor. Instead, Gigabyte says it uses AI presets running in the background for minimal interruption, which I welcome. You do get all the standards though; pixel shifting, cleaning, brightness limiter and logo detection. Strangely, you can't manually activate these using the OSD; you'll have to use Gigabyte Control center on a Windows PC for that. Coming in at $1,099 (but currently at$800on discount), the MO34WQC2 doesn't really undercut its rivals, which is something Gigabyte is known for often as a reliably cheaper monitor brand. The legendaryAlienwareAW3423DWF is harder to find these days, but the newAW3425DW—its 240 Hz replacement—is the same as the discounted price of the Gigabyte. The only benefit the newer monitor offers is better port selection and KVM. But you do lose a little polish and design flair, but the tradeoff could be worthwhile for you. Like I said, the Gigabyte MO34WQC2 is not the most exciting OLED gaming monitor. What it is, is a no-frills, honest to goodness, practical gaming monitor that's great for gamers who work from home doing lots of spreadsheets and multitasking. That said, we haven't yet had a look at Alienware's new AW3425DW so maybe something to consider. A very practical OLED widescreen, that's only really worth a look at its discounted price.

    "title": "Turtle Beach Recon 70 review",
    "article_text": "No offers found When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Providing a mostly clear sound, but with a distinct lack of oomph, this is a reasonably solid budget pick, but I'd argue it's almost always better to put an extra $10 on and get something higher quality. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. Turtle Beach's budget gaming headsets fuelled my childhood years of yelling at friends on Call of Duty, but there's a reason I haven't touched them in a while. In my experience, poor audio quality, flimsy builds, and mediocre microphones proved to me (or more so, my mum) that putting just a little extra cash in often gets a much better investment in the long run. However, I'm fully prepared for the Turtle Beach Recon 70 to change my mind. At its $40 price point, I reckon it mostly just needs to do its main functions well enough to be unnoticeable, or at least not noticeablybad. We've seen theHyperX Cloud Alphaall the way down to $50 during sales events, which is still confidently thebest gaming headset, even so long after it arrived on the scene. It's a tough price point, mostly because the jump in quality is tangible once you move out of the tightest of budget brackets. Right out of the box, however, that reasonable price point shows in its build quality. Everything, apart from a light cushioning on the top and in the earpads, is made out of plastic. The whole thing rattles with a light shake, and it's noticeably designed for a head that, well, isn't mine. The scale of the Recon 70 suggests it was maybe created for children and teens, and with that in mind, both the design and price make sense. The top of it becomes very, for lack of a better word, square-like, wrapped over the top of my rather large cranium. The side stretches, and the plastic bends under pressure. It all feels a tad flimsy. Connection:3.5 mm jackType:Closed backFrequency response:20 Hz - 20 kHzDrivers:40 mm with Neodymium MagnetsMicrophone:Fixed omnidirectionalFeatures:Flip-to-mute microphoneWeight:231 gPrice:$40|£30 The Recon 70 is available in a wide range of colours, and the Blue Camo variety mine came in looks quite pretty. The top of the earcup is the camo design, while the bottom is a solid navy style blue. There isn't too much branding on the headset either, which is a plus, with just the logo on the very top. Different colours not only look different but also denote the difference between platform-specific headphones. This is an odd distinction, though, as they all seem to be multiplatform, with just marketing differences on the box. Though marking headsets as platform-specific makes more sense in the more expensive Turtle Beach headphones like the Stealth 700 Gen 3, which has PC-specific 3D sound. Once on and plugged in, the Recon 70's 40 mm drivers perform justokay. The mids are clear and easy to make out, but both the highs and the bass feel lacking and generally weak. It takes that oomph out of songs, even if the drivers can deliver on the overall clarity. Footsteps and the thump of an AWP in Counter-Strike 2 are certainly distinct enough to make out in the heat of the battle, though, and that seems to be what this set of cans is going for. You won't miss out on the actual sound of the world, but you will miss out on thefeelthe violin trills ofClair Obscur: Expedition 33'swonderful music evokes. You can hear the subtle jazz bass of Le Grand Café de Lumière from Expedition 33, but it doesn't quite rattle as it should. The sound is simply flat. Fallout: New Vegas'blend of shots, screams, talking, and ol-timey radio, however, works absolutely fine.Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice'sunique use of audio, too, is fairly distinct when played through this cheap set of cans. The whispers and hushed tones in my ear feel well-projected and clear. The Recon 70's strongest points are in the mids, and you won't be missing vital information in single-player games, even if it takes some of the gut punch out of the best soundtracks. Even after hours of wandering around the Mojave wasteland, the headset still feels comfortable on my head, thanks to its light weight and stretchy fit. The spongy earcups offer light protection from the hard plastic shell of the headset, though this isn't enough to fully isolate. If you happen to play in a room with others, you will likely catch an earful of whatever conversation they're having if your volume isn't loud enough to drown them out. Listen to the microphone test below: Even for a resolutely wired headset, the connectivity is a tad lacking, with just a single 3.5 mm jack that can't be unplugged. This means it can technically work in any device with an audio port, but the lead is fairly short at just over a meter. This is restrictive, particularly if you have your PC sat under your desk or use a standing model. This limitation is fine for console use—theXbox Series XandPlayStation 5 controllershave audio jacks built in—but PC gamers will feel tightly tethered to their rig with the Recon 70 thanks to that wire. ✅ You just want something simple:The Recon 70 is a plug-and-play pair of headphones that doesn't require charging and is intuitive to use. If you simply need to hear audio and want to speak in a voice call, the Recon 70 is enough.✅ You're shopping for a kid:This set of cans is cheap with a pretty clear mic, and the 3.5 mm jack works on PC and all current consoles. The sound isn't great, but it's a decent budget choice, especially if you don't quite trust them to take care of it. ❌ You can afford more:Regularly on sale for around $40 more (and with drops as low as $50), theHyperX Cloud Alphaoffers a much better experience. I would only really recommend the Recon 70 to someone if they can't afford to go a bit higher.❌ Your PC isn't right next to your monitor:The cable is pretty limited in length at just over 1 metre, so hard to plug into a PC if you aren't right next to it as you game. The fact the jack can't be unplugged also means that if the wire ever breaks for any reason, you have to throw the entire headset out. This maybe isn't the end of the world for such a cheap set of cans, but it's a shame to throw the whole thing out should your cat fancy the forbidden bite of a tasty set of audio wires. Another light annoyance is the microphone. Though it actually performs admirably for its price range, and sounds clear without much artifacting or muddiness, the flip-to-mute system is not completely fit for use. Not only is there not much of a tactile click alerting you when it's muted, but you don't get an audio notification either. This means you're never quite sure when it's muted. At a right angle upward, I assume I'm always muted, but it has certainly left me paranoid that I haven't quite pushed it far enough up. The Turtle Beach Recon 70 looks pretty clean for the price and has a clear microphone, but the quality dip from headsets that are even just tens of dollars more is notable. For a closer price point, theCorsair HS55, at an MSRP of just $20 extra, offers a more complete and more attractive package. If you can only afford this sub-$50 price point, the Recon 70 will reasonably replicate sound in your games, but if you have the funds for more, or the patience to wait for a sale on the HyperX Cloud Alpha, it's hard to recommend the Stealth 70's weak audio over even slightly more expensive headphones. Providing a mostly clear sound, but with a distinct lack of oomph, this is a reasonably solid budget pick, but I'd argue it's almost always better to put an extra $10 on and get something higher quality.

    "title": "WoW's idea to clamp down on combat add-ons is misguided, especially since it could keep improving its base experience without, uh, doing that",
    "article_text": "No offers found Blizzard is playing with forces I'm not sure it fully comprehends. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. World of Warcraft, in a huge move for a 20-year old MMO, has just announced plans to slowly, but surely,phase out its combat add-onsin favour of building that functionality into the main game. The sky's not falling just yet, mind, and these plans aren't set in stone, but there's a possible future in which your WeakAuras and such will no longer work. That doesn't mean Blizzard's taking the axe to all UI add-ons. As the article linked above explains, WoW will preserve add-ons meant for roleplay, as well as quest helpers and the like. But the studio seems set to remove things that would provide combat functionality in lieu of its own homegrown options. For example, an accessibility feature that lets you do your rotation with one button at a major DPS loss. While I enjoy World of Warcraft quite a bit, I've played Final Fantasy 14, too. In case you're not familiar, the attitude towards UI mods in FF14 is far different—in that it's actively against terms of service. While plenty of players still use mods as Square Enix won't ban you unless you're obviously cheating—or someone reports you—they're nowhere near as big a part of the ecosystem. As such, FF14's jobs are all designed to work swimmingly without combat add-ons. Rotations are intuitive (some might say too intuitive) and there are studio-made UI elements for each combat job to help you manage their core mechanics. So trust me when I say I've been on both sides, see the merit in both systems, and I still think this is a really bad idea. Blizzard's asking for a fight it really doesn't want to start. Not from me, mind, but from both players who'll start to find the design flaws in their classes that their WeakAuras patched up—and a contingent of determined coding maestros who'll break whatever blocks they put in place over their knee. I'm about to somewhat contradict myself, but I will say that Blizzard offering its ownUI improvements is an unalloyed good.The WIP cooldown managerfeature is an excellent idea, one that can either remove the need for add-ons, or simply allow playerswithadd-ons to remove a few superfluous WeakAuras that might be slowing their game down. I also think it's great for the one-button rotation to be a thing. It'll be basically useless for anyone who wants to play the game competitively, but giving an accessibility option for players with physical disabilities is a good call. Especially withhow important MMOs can become as a space for people with those conditions. It's also a good QoL feature if you're not disabled, and only want to hop in and collect transmog, or something—everybody wins. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. But for those of us who do want to engage with its combat, a large part of WoW's UI ecosystem has involved players using add-ons to make up for flaws in its design, both in terms of UI and its classes. Take my class of choice, Outlaw Rogue, for example: Back in Dragonflight, the spec basically didn't function without a few key WeakAuras. Key procs and elements would pop up in your already-cluttered buff tray, and given how fast and frenetic the spec is, it was completely unusable. But even in The War Within, Roll the Bones is sort of jank by design. Outlaw Rogues have a series of buffs they can randomly proc with Roll the Bones—which, in theory, means they'll be choosing to reroll the dice based on what buffs they need for the situation they're in. In actual practice, keeping track of a handful of discrete buffs completely rams up against the classes' fast-paced, if>then combat loop, and players already figured out the maths on which combination of auras is best years ago. A WeakAura solves this by simply suggesting when you should and shouldn't reroll. By phasing out combat add-ons, Blizzard is giving itself an impossible job it just can't do.\" And listen—that's a complete skill issue on my part. I'm ignoring a whole slice of my class with a UI AddOn. But, counterpoint, that slice sucks and is annoying. Blizzard has gotten away with Roll the Bones being an unintuitive mess with almost no usable UI feedback for years because of UI add-ons, and Outlaw is an extremely busy spec even without Roll the Bones. I'm sure I could manage it—but I'd probably enjoy it way less. But I digress. World of Warcraft has 13 classes and a whopping 39 specialisations, as well as three hero talent options for each class. Take this hyper-specific complaint about Outlaw Rogue, and then extrapolate it out to all the little minute interactions that occur between classes, specs, and hero talents, and you start to see the problem taking shape. Even if Blizzard had the best balancing team in the world, it still wouldn't be able to keep up with all the minutiae of each of these options and what they, specifically, need. By phasing out combat add-ons, Blizzard is giving itself an impossible job it just can't do. The game simply has too many moving parts. There's also the element that hey, sometimes combat add-ons are just for flavour, as well. As a Fatebound Rogue, one of my most complicated custom WeakAuras is literally there to just tell me how many coins I've got stacked up, and topop out a little pirate flag and play a jaunty tunewhen I hit the jackpot and get my agility buff. It's got no bearing on my actual rotation, I just like it. Point being, Blizzard making its core experience better is great, as is reducing player reliance on add-ons. Being of a mind to phase them outentirely? You're placing the weight of the world on your shoulders. Players are already content to fix the cracks in their classes' particular drywall, but if you're gonna do it yourself, you can expect them to be miffed when some cracks remain. Which leads me to my second warning: You don't wanna get in a slapfight with modders, dude. You'll lose. If Final Fantasy 14 has proven anything, it's that reducing UI add-ons in the interest of fairness might slow modders down, but life, uh, finds a way. Everysingletimea world first race comes up in FF14, it's revealed that the first team to win was usually using some sort of UI aid. Client-side UI tools are extremely hard to stop, and unless Blizzard is keen on adding some kind of anti-cheat (Square Enix is not, hence the issue), you're not gonna stop anyone determined enough to make the game easier. I don't think this sort of behaviour is particularly great—you shouldn't cheat at online videogames—but it is going to happen. To make combat UI mods cheating, Blizzard then needs to solve the problem of how it punishes and detects them, starting an arms race it doesn't need to run. I think Blizzard believes it can wrestle control back from a playerbase whose shenanigans have gone too far, while offering its own options to help make up for decades of live-and-let-live. In actuality, it's consigning its development team into an eternal game of whack-a-mole. In the WoWCast video, Ion Hazzikostas explains that: \"We want to keep chipping away at those things, and hopefully get to the point where really the only difference between what we are offering and what powerful add-ons can do is that small subset of computational problem-solving stuff, at which point we can move forward.\" Blizzard can't assume it'll know what's good for every individual player.\" In my bluntest of opinions, I think all of that is an excellent plan right up until the \"moving forward\" bit. Blizzard having its own set of officially supported UI features that make playing the base game possible for anybody is a net good—it's the right thing to do, it'll improve quality of life. Clamping down on combat add-ons after that?Thatis utter lunacy. It's like promising a series of cool backflips before saying 'and then, once we've done our backflips, we're going to slip on a banana peel and fall off a big cliff.' Just don't fall off the big cliff, guys—folks will benefit tremendously from having those cool backflips in their life. If you want a game that's less reliant on UI add-ons to have an acceptable experience, then bending your design towards that goal is noble and good. There is a potential future in which WeakAuras are no longer mandatory for most specs, and instead provide optional customisation tweaks to help personalise someone's game to their liking. But Blizzard can't assume it'll know what's good for every individual player. It can't possibly create a baseline kit that covers every single angle—and it can save itself all the stress and headache of doing so by not holding itself to that standard. Improve the base UI, and stop sending a few egregious elements from the combat log if you must. But there's no reason to throw the baby out with the WeakAuras. Do both. Both is good.

    "title": "Modding turf war erupts as 'notoriously controversial' dev puts out an Unofficial Oblivion Remastered Patch one week after the game came out",
    "article_text": "No offers found The ghosts of Elder Scrolls' modding past are already rearing their heads. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Birds fly, the sun shines, water is wet, and Bethesda games get unofficial patches. There'sMorrowind's Patch for Purists, theYukichigai Patchfor New Vegas (an Obsidian game, but Bethesda's engine down to its bones), even aCommunity Patch for Starfield. This is an immutable law of the universe, and not even wrapping originalOblivion in an Unreal Engine 5 layermakes it any less true. So I doubt anyone was too surprised when a mod by an author named Arthmoor called theUnofficial Oblivion Remastered Patch – UORPpopped up on Nexus Mods just one week after Oblivion Remastered launched on April 22. What might be surprising, if you're not all that wired into the Bethesda mod scene, is howangrythat made everyone. \"Warning,\" read a popular post on theOblivion Modding subredditthat went up barely two hours after the UORP hit the Nexus, \"Don't use Arthmoor's new [Oblivion Remastered] patch.\" Calling Arthmoor \"notoriously controversial,\" the post's writer strongly encouraged the Oblivion community as a whole to ignore the patch: \"It's essential that as many people as possible ignore his mods.\" Which is more drama than you'd expect from a collection of Oblivion bugfixes, but tensions between Arthmoor and the wider mod scene run deep and long. Infamously, Arthmoor was behind 'Gategate'—the brouhaha that occurred when he updated his popular Open Cities mod for Skyrim (you've probably used it; it's the one that removes load screens when entering places like Whiterun and Solitude) to add 'lore-friendly' fossilised Oblivion gates to Skyrim's cities, relics of the Oblivion Crisis in The Elder Scrolls 4. Users weren't thrilled by the feature creep, nor the resulting war between Arthmoor and other modders who attempted to patch the gates out. After a prolonged back-and-forth, Arthmoor eventually made the gates toggleable. Nor were they thrilled when his Unofficial Skyrim Patch, which incorporates changes that some players view less as bugfixes and more as Arthmoor's subjective preferences (switching a particular mine from ebony to iron, for instance) became more or less a mandatory prerequisite for installing all sorts ofothermods on Nexus, as plenty of modders relied on the fixes Arthmoor and his team had made in the patch. People rankled at Arthmoor being handed a great deal of control over Skyrim modding in general; for all intents and purposes baking in his preferences and changes as an immutable part of the modded Skyrim experience. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. All that history came bubbling back up when Arthmoor's name popped up on the Nexus Mods page for Oblivion Remastered. The warning post on the Oblivion Modding subreddit attracted over a thousand upvotes, while the author compared the UORP with Arthmoor's original patch for 2006's Oblivion and accused him, essentially, of copying it \"without proper testing… making such extensive changes to so many records is far too risky, especially when the integration method between UE5 and the TES engine has yet to be fully understood.\" That pretty much sums up the general tenor of the community response, with other players accusing Arthmoor and his team of porting the original patch \"hastily just so he could stake a monopoly on unofficial patches again,\" fearing another scenario where Arthmoor's patch becomes a de facto prerequisite for huge swathes of Oblivion Remastered's future mods. Reports of new issues introduced by the patch—a crash when entering certain stores, Argonian tails suddenly flipping to the front of their bodies and looking, well,quite phallic—didn't help matters. For what it's worth, Arthmoor and co say they've updated the patch already to fix the crashes, and I've tested it myself and found noadditionalproblems caused by the patch: no crashes on the bugbear shops, no alarmingly well-endowed Argonians. I also got in touch with Arthmoor to ask if he had a response to accusations that he had hastily ported over his old patch in an attempt to stake a monopoly on Oblivion Remastered modding. He told me \"claims that the UORP is a direct unmodified port of the original [Unofficial Oblivion Patch] are incorrect. \"Over the last week since the release of the remaster, I've been combing over the records in detail.\" Arthmoor says that the UORP removes fixes from the original Unofficial Oblivion Patch that have been replicated by Bethesda and Virtuos in the remaster. \"There were instances where they'd simply absorbed a fix directly from the UOP, which is great! The entire community will now benefit from those fixes even on consoles.\" Arthmoor says a great many original Unofficial Patch changes—a number of changes to object positioning, script changes, and other tweaks that don't jibe with how Oblivion Remastered is built or have been fixed by the devs themselves—have been removed from UORP. \"As far as staking an early claim, that's not what we're about on the project. It never has been. We do what we do because we love Bethesda games as much as everyone else does and we want to have a better experience while playing them.\" Which seems reasonable enough, but as someone who has tested the UORP myself, I'd recommend hanging back for now. While it's true that I didn't notice new bugs caused by the patch, I also haven't run into any bugs in Oblivion Remastered that urgently demand one (though, don't get me wrong, I have absolutely run into some lower-priority bugs in my time with the base game). With Bethesda still actively working on patches andsuggestions for Oblivion Remastered, and Arthmoor and his team still working on UORP, it seems like your best bet is to just wait for the dust to settle, and that's before you even set foot into the knotty questions about coups in the Oblivion Remastered mod scene.

    "title": "LG's new 'Hybrid Tandem' tech apparently solves the blue light problem which could mean near-flawless OLED gaming monitors",
    "article_text": "No offers found Here's hoping, anyway. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. OLED panels are seriously stunning and the technology is one of the few that I really,reallyhope becomes increasingly attainable for more PC gamers. But there are still flaws with OLED monitors (and no, I'm not talking about the problem of astronomical pricing). There's the potential risk of burn-in and, more to the point, they can't get as bright as other panels can. This is primarily because of a problem with blue OLED lighting at the sub-pixel level, and it's a problem that LG is now seemingly ready to start fixing. The company says it has \"become the world's first company to successfully verify the commercialization-level performance of blue phosphorescent OLED panels on a mass production line.\" You might have heard about blue phosphorescent OLED panels before—what LG points out is called the \"Dream OLED\"—because wefirst heard word of this techlast year. The problem is that, previously, blue OLEDs had to be fluorescent rather than phosphorescent due, as LG explains, to it \"having the shortest wavelength and demanding the greatest energy\"—i.e. more energy is required to make a phosphorescent OLED emit blue than for a fluorescent OLED to produce the same light. However, fluorescent lighting consumes more power because it requires constant energy, as there's no afterglow, and this means they also produce more heat. To reduce the risk of burn-in, fluorescent OLEDs are forced to run with a lower brightness. Blue is, therefore, somewhat of a bottleneck to OLED screens in general. Original OLED panels used separate red, green, and blue OLEDs for each pixel, but this caused big problems with burn-in over time. The alternative that LG found with WOLED was to use white OLEDs exclusively for each pixel and put these through colour filters, but while this improves brightness, it leads to washed-out colours. The solution Samsung used with QD-OLED was to use blue OLEDs and then have this light go through a quantum dot layer to convert to red or green, but apart from the subpixel layout causing problems such as text fringing, the fact that the blue OLEDs must be fluorescent means it doesn't allow for as much brightness. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Essentially, there has been no perfect solution to the problem because phosphorescent blue hasn't been an option. Until now, according to LG, that is, thanks to its new \"Dream OLED\" tech, which uses a stacked mix of phosphorescent and fluorescent blue OLED—a \"Hybrid Tandem\" approach—which is claimed to consume 15% less power than traditional OLED. We shouldn't expect PC gaming monitors to come with such tech for a while, though. The first such panels LG is displaying are applied to smartphones and tablets. But the company does say: \"As more and more products require high definition and high efficiency, such as AI PCs and AR/VR devices, the application of blue phosphorescence technology is expected to expand rapidly.\" If and when such tech does come to PC, we can bet some of thebest gaming monitorswill be adorned with it. It will hopefully allow for much brighter OLED panels that are more power-efficient and have all the colour accuracy and vibrancy of QD-OLED rather than WOLED. That's the hope, anyway.

Besides that time in 2009, whenAmazon remotely deleted George Orwell's 1984from devices due to a rights issue, more recent news has also given me pause. For example, did you know that as of February,it's now much harder to download and back up Kindle ebooksyou've paid for? If I was going to jump the garden wall, now was the time—and Boox presents an alternative. What's more,Boox's new colour E-ink monitorfunctions not unlike a massive Kindle Colorsoft (viaArs Technica). The catch? It costs almost as much as seven Kindle Colorsofts strapped together. On the other hand, BOOX Super Refresh technology plus an entire button dedicated to wiping away ghosting artefacts gives it the charming look of tech that fell out of a lost, retrofitted future. TheBoox Mira Pro seriesis available either with colour or with just the greyscale nature intended. If youdowant the colour version, it's going to cost you $1,900 (and for Brits like myself, one 'u'). Billed as a gentler alternative for your oh-so-LED-fatigued eyes, I still wouldn't want to game on it…but I feel like I've got to try it, at least once. What do you reckonCyberpunk 2077would be like on this thing? Perfectly awful, awfully perfect? So, that's the hefty price tag out of the way—let's get into the specs. The Boox Mira Pro Color Version is a 25.3-inch monitor with a 3200×1800 resolution. Its E Ink Kaleido 3 technology can display up to 4,096 colours (essentially, 12-bit colour). Even our top pick for thebest budget 1080p gaming monitor, theAOC Gaming C27G4ZXE, comfortably outperforms the Mira Pro Color on that lattermost point—and at less than $200. A VESA interface offers compatibility with a range of monitor supports, while five different ports (including HDMI, Mini HDMI, USB Type C, DP, and DC) demonstrate a desire to slot into whatever setup you already have. So, if you've been burned by font fringing and, uh, burn-in on OLED monitors, perhaps an E-Ink replacement or secondary monitor appeals—but only if you're willing to accept E-ink's limitations and this monitor's hefty price tag.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Black soul gemsare an incredibly rare enchanting item inOblivion, though their rarity is matched by their power, so you'll want to get your hands on as many as you can. Plus, if you're completing all the Daedric questlines, you'll also need a black soul gem to start Vaermina's quest. The good news is that you don't need to rely entirely on luck to get black soul gems. There's actually a unique process you can do to upgrade grand soul gems into black soul gems, which is easy enough to do once you know the trick. So, here's what you've got to do to make your own black soul gems. Black soul gems can befound randomly on necromancerenemiesor can becreated by upgrading grand soul gemsat specific altars. Given how rare it is for necromancers to drop black soul gems, creating your own is by far the best option. To create your own black soul gems, you need to: To get grand soul gems, your best bet is to go to analchemical and magic merchant, such as Alves Uvenim in the Leyawiin Mages Guild, where you can buy them for around 350 gold. Importantly, you can alsobuy the Soul Trap spellfrom these magic merchants for about 420 gold, depending on your reputation with the vendor. With these in hand, you'll have all the items you need to make a black soul gem. As for the altars, they're just small stone slabs with red heraldry draped over them. There's one just outside of Fort Istrirus, Fort Linchal, Dark Fissure, and Wendelbek. Conveniently, each of these locations is also a necromancer stronghold, so there's a chance (albeit a very low chance) you can find a black soul gem when clearing them. Ironically, you could also give them a taste of their own medicine and fill an empty black soul gem by casting the Soul Trap spell on a necromancer. Here are all the altar locations you can visit to create a black soul gem: The final piece of the puzzle is to make use of the Revenant Shade days. Chances are, you didn't even know these were a thing until now, but they're crucial to getting black soul gems. Every eight in-game days from the start of the game, between 12 am and 12 pm, a red pillar of light appears above each of the altar locations. Only when these are active can you perform the steps above. These are theShade of the Revenant days,so you can skip time to the right point on the Imperial calendar: Oblivion console commands: Cheats, new and oldBest Oblivion races: Min-maxingBest Oblivion classes: Pick your playstyleBest Oblivion birthsigns: Finishing touchesOblivion Thieves Guild: How to join the crewOblivion Dark Brotherhood: Assassin initiates Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "Oblivion Remastered contains an incredibly neat easter egg to one of the nerdiest viral videos of the early 2010s",
    "article_text": "No offers found Potion Seller makes a small cameo in Oblivion Remastered. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Are you going into battle in Oblivion Remastered? Do you need the potion seller's strongest potions? Are the potion seller's potions too strong for you, traveller? Do you even have any idea what I'm talking about? If you do, and you've been playing any Oblivion Remastered recently, you might want to pop into the console commands, because there's a real treat of an easter egg in there for you. If you don't have any idea what I'm talking about, allow me to point you towards the 2011 YouTube videoPotion Sellerfrom Justin Kuritzkes—probably now more well known for penning scripts for recent movies Challengers and Queer. It's a very early 2010s-ass meme, with Kuritzkes acting out a back-and-forth between a knight and a man who sells potions, complete with the goofy face distortions we were all messing around with back then. Now I have to show my ass a little here and admit I'd never actually seen this video until now, but that doesn't mean it hasn't left its mark on the internet. Potion Seller has nearly 13 million views, and when I put it to the rest of the PC Gamer news team, our senior editor Robin Valentine said: \"That video is a foundation stone of my personality.\" So, safe to say it's a pretty big deal. So where does Oblivion Remastered come into this? Well, as discovered by Twitch streamerTerraGuildTV, there's a brand-new console command tucked away in the game referencing this very video. If the command \"Altar.Player.PotionSellerGiveMeYourStrongestPotions\" wasn't already a big enough nod to the meme, the description then says \"Powers the player up with the means of defeating the Romans coming to conquer the last free village of Gaul. 'Have you heard of my potions? …My potions are too strong for you, traveller.'\" That final line is yet another direct quote from the video. The first part seems to be a sneaky bonus reference made by French studio Virtuous (who co-developed the remaster) to Asterix the Gaul—a French comic and series of movies about the titular Asterix who keeps the village safe from Roman rule. Two niche references for the price of one? Don't mind if I do. I had to dive into Oblivion Remastered myself to see if the console command was there and yup, it sure is: TerraGuildTV gives a brief demonstration of what the console command actually does, seemingly giving you a super-strong punch that sends anyone who dares be in the vicinity of your fists flying straight into the stratosphere. I'm currently doing a sweaty achievement run so haven't tinkered around with activating it myself, but I'm looking forward to using it in the inevitable troll playthrough where I mess things up to the nth degree.

    "title": "'We as the developers do not feel like we are being robbed by anyone': Drug Dealer Simulator developer says it 'would not pursue any legal actions against Schedule 1 in any shape or form' if it had its way",
    "article_text": "No offers found The two games spent April entangled in drama. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Byterunners, the developer behind Drug Dealer Simulator 2, has said it \"would not pursue any legal action against Schedule 1 in any shape or form\" if it was the one in charge of calling the shots. In case you're not caught up, Schedule 1 has been popping off since it launched in late March. It's a game that's all about drugs: Making 'em, branding 'em, selling 'em, all that good stuff. Just a couple weeks after its release, it emerged that the Movie Games S.A., the publisher for Drug Dealer Simulator 2—another game that is also all about drugs, if the name wasn't already a dead giveaway—waslaunching an investigation against Schedule 1into potential copyright infringement. That news did not go down particularly well, to say the least, withDrug Dealer Simulator 2 being review bombedto all hell as a result. That was partly due to the fact many immediately jumped to the conclusion that DDS2 was suing Schedule 1 developer TVGS. Movie Games S.A. came out with a statement shortly after the review bombing began to say\"There is no lawsuit,\"though that doesn't seem to have done much to assuage the slew of negative reviews pouring in. The whole debacle has led to Byterunners itself coming out withits own statement, as noted byWindows Central. The gist of it is this: It doesn't own the IP and ultimately isn't in charge of making these decisions. But if it was, it wouldn't be doing this. Even if it does perceive some sort of resemblance between the two games. \"We want to state that, despite the fact that we do see many similarities between the games, and that some aspects of Schedule 1 were probably heavily inspired by DDS, we as the developers do not feel like we are being robbed by anyone,\" the statement reads. It continues to say that Schedule 1 \"has its own vibe, freshness, and ideas that derive from the concept of DDS1, but expand on it and bring them in its own shape and style.\" Byterunners says that games cribbing and taking different inspirations from each other is \"abundant in game development,\" adding that \"even if they sometimes cross a few lines [they] are, in general, a good thing for the industry and gaming as a whole.\" The most important bit here is Byterunners' own stance on the entire investigation. \"If we had a choice in this, we would not pursue any legal actions against Schedule 1 in any shape or form,\" the statement reads. \"Considering we do not own the DDS IP, we do not have direct influence over the decisions surrounding the investigation or our publisher's policy; however, we have expressed our concerns and opinions to them directly.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Byterunners finishes up by saying it's been voicing its stance to Movie Games S.A. directly, adding: \"We want this to end well for everyone and do not want anyone affected to face this kind of negativity, fear, or hatred. That's not why we make games, and that's not what we stand for.\" I do feel for Byterunners here. Sometimes developer-publisher interests don't necessarily align, which already sucks, but it sucks even more when those differing views lead to your entire game getting pummeled into the ground by negative reviews. Even if it took a few jabs at Schedule 1's similarities here and there, it seems like Byterunners ultimately just wants the situation left alone, and I don't blame the developer for that. Schedule 1 developer TVGS has continued to remain quiet throughout the whole debacle, which is probably the smartest choice right now. Situations like this aren't much fun for anybody, and hopefully the whole thing gets resolved sooner rather than later.

    "article_text": "No offers found I'd almost given up on ObRem's painstaking lockpicking until recently. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I hate lockpicking in Oblivion Remastered. I hate the stupid little tumblers with their stupid speed variations and my stupid slow reaction times as I invariably miss the stupid sweet spot. As someone who loves Skyrim's lockpicking, I was about to completely write off any attempts at going around cracking every door and chest in Cyrodiil. Even with our ridiculously handyOblivion lockpicking guideI was, to be frank, crap at it. That was until last week, when one Reddit comment changed my Hero of Kvatch's life. Now before you start—sure you can run and grab the skeleton key and auto everything, and sure you can just cast a bunch of spells to unlock things without ever even having to enter the lockpicking menu, but if you're like me and still at least like to try and do things somewhat manually, this is the cheese strat for you. Turns out that once you hit a tumbler upwards, you can continuously juggle it and it'll stay the same speed until you let it fall down again. That means you can essentially keep hitting a tumbler until it reaches the slowest speed, and then comfortably juggle it until you know you're safe to set it in place. Here's an example of what I mean: I'm shocked: it's so genius that I assumed it was a widely circulated strategy, until I found myself sitting on the couch next to my partner—an absolute sicko with countless hours in the original game—who had never seen anyone tackle the lockpicking minigame the way I was doing it. I also continue to see people going through the same revelation as me on Reddit, so I thought it a worthy strategy to share with you all as well. Since learning it, I've only broken three lockpicks while successfully breaking into what is easily over 100 different locks by now. It's quickly become one of my favourite things to do (alongside the persuasion minigame, which I take a sort of sick pleasure in doing on every single NPC I encounter) and may even end up surpassing my love for Skyrim's lockpicking by the time I'm finished with the Oblivion remaster.

    "article_text": "No offers found It wasn't just you left staring at the Welcome screen for 30 seconds. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. There used to be a time when you'd log in to your Windows 7 machine, and have enough time to go fetch a cuppa as it thought about actually letting you past the welcome screen. Well, it turns out my younger self's retina-burning mauve desktop background may have been to blame. Though many preferred Windows 7 to Windows Vista'squirksback in 2009, some users who set their desktop background as a solid block of colour found themselves staring at the welcome screen for up to 30 seconds—now we know why. Microsoft veteranRaymond Chen revealed in a recent blog postthat this was likely due to a simple programming error (viaPC World). Chen explains that after your logon has been authenticated, initialising the desktop is a fairly complex process that wrangles a lot of different elements piece by piece. Chen writes, \"The logon system waits for all of these pieces to report that they are ready, and when the all-clear signal is received from everybody, or when 30 seconds have elapsed, the logon system switches away from the Welcome screen. Given that design, you can imagine the reason for the 30-second delay: It means that one of the pieces failed to report.\" In this instance, the operating system is expecting to hear back from a bitmap associated with whichever file you set as your desktop wallpaper… but if you just set your background as a single block of colour, then Windows 7 is waiting for a response that will never come. So, that leaves you waiting for the 30-second failsafe to kick in and load you into the desktop regardless. Chen says that for similar reasons you might also have had to wait the full 30 seconds to login if you had the 'hide desktop icons' group policy enabled, as Windows 7 is checking for icons you've expressly hidden. Chen explains that group policies are especially susceptible to programming oversights like this as they're often late additions \"bolted on after the main code is written.\" Fortunately, it looks like the issue was addressed within months; Chenhighlights a support pagethat shows the problem was addressed in November 2009, just five months after Windows 7 debuted. So why was the machine I shared with my family so slow then…? Actually, probably best not to think too hard about that one. Raymond Chen has been shedding light on many Microsoft mysteries on his devblog,Old New Thing, including why certain laptop hard drive discs simply could not handle the powerful bassline ofJanet Jackson's Rhythm Nation. Given that apparently present-dayMicrosoft is now using AI to write approximately 30% of its code, we may well see many moreinsightfuldev blog posts about 'programming oversights' in the future.

Assassin's Creed Shadowsis the tale of Oda Nobunaga's quest to defrag Japan, and in tribute to the daimyō's relentless ambition,Ubisofthas announced itspost-launch roadmapfor the game consisting of patches, feature drops, and \"height-gaining back ejects,\" which videogames need more of as a general rule. It looks like Shadows is set for a pretty stuffed year, all told. This month alone it's meant to get a new free quest focusing on Yasuke's Portuguese Jesuit pal Luis Frois, vaguely defined \"quality-of-life improvements,\" a photo-mode update, a \"special collaboration\" which I'm guessing is some kind of co-marketing thing like that Final Fantasy mission in Origins, and that tweak to the game's parkour. These tweaks will add the aforementioned back ejects alongside \"height-gaining side ejects\" and a \"vertical ledge jump.\" You can get a better idea of what on Earth that means in the video up top, but in essence, it's just a few extra ways to make Naoe go up. I'm curious about the quality of life changes, more than anything. I suspect Ubi will patch back in the multi-sell feature it had to yank out because it kept crashing people's games (mine included), but I'm hoping for a little more, too. It'd be good if horses could move at a full gallop while you're auto-following a road to your destination, for instance, but I also wouldn't mind seeing stuff like being able to easily switch characters in shops (for some reason, Japanese merchants have different items in store depending on which character you're playing) and some kind of quicksave option. Once May's out of the way, Ubisoft is pledging a new free quest, a new ally, new difficulty settings (which is great news—I've leveled to the point where I'm a human Cuisinart even on Expert mode), and vaguely defined stuff like \"gameplay immersion options\" alongside an \"open world alarm system\". Perhaps one of those immersion options will include the upcoming option to show your headgear in cutscenes, but I'm not sure how an open-world alarm system would be different from the game's already-existing alarm system. Anyway, Ubisoft rounds things off with its plans for some unspecified point in the future. Those include new story stuff, new collabs, new daft Animus gear for the game's weird fake battle-pass system, and—most important of all—the Claws of Awaji expansion, which will add a whole new region to Shadows' already mega-huge map.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. At this point, I'm getting a little tired of running victory laps—my knees aren't what they used to be—but PC Gaming tallied up another mark on the scoreboard. We're coming up on our five year anniversary of cheekily declaringwe'd won the console war, and it turns out yeah. We were sort of right.Consoles aren't exactly doing great, right now. Microsoft has once more proved our writers' powers of prophecy by revealing that Xbox hardware revenue has actively been weighing the whole operation down, despite gaming revenue doing very well. That's as per afinancial earningsrelease (thanks,Eurogamer)—more specifically,a slideon this presentation that details the following: This isn't necessarily anything new, though. As part of our own Tyler Wilde'sconcerned check-inon our console cousins almost a year ago, he pointed out that Microsoft had indeed reported a staggering 30% decline in Xbox hardware revenue between early 2024 and early 2023. Now, part of this whole decline has been due to Microsoft shedding its console-exclusivity chains and going system-agnostic, as well asacquiring game studios to fly under its banner. Blizzard, Bethesda, Obsidian—the list goes on.It's also shut down a fair few, too, in its hunger for growth. With that$69 billion acquisition of Blizzard preluding a huge sweep of layoffs. It's also because there's just no real reason to spring for an Xbox at the moment. There are no real major console exclusives, and Game Pass, which has been a banger on PC lately—Indiana Jones & the Great Circle, South of Midnight, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, and Avowed are all excellent games worthy of your time—is similarly system-agnostic. That's not to criticise Microsoft for those choices, which are objectively pretty consumer-friendly (and there are other,more important issuesto level at the computing giant right now) but merely a statement of fact: Console exclusivity is more and more becoming a thing of the past. Unless you happen to be Nintendo, in which case, you'll be holding onto your console exclusives to the very end.

    "title": "'China is right behind us': Jensen Huang says we need to 'accelerate the diffusion of American AI technology around the world'",
    "article_text": "No offers found Is more exports or less exports in the American interest? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. What do you get when you cross a giant global tech company with an overtly 'America-first' US administration? It looks like the answer is: Policy talk that mixes a strange blend of globalisation and patriotism. Case and point, Jensen Huang's recent comments on President Trump's potential upcoming changes to chip export rules. The Nvidia CEO tellsBloombergthat any new rule around exports, whatever it is, \"really has to recognise that the world has changed fundamentally since the previous diffusion rule was released. We need to accelerate the diffusion of American AI technology around the world. And so the policies and the encouragement from the administration really needs to be behind that.\" This is in reference to the so-called Diffusion rule (theFramework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion) which was issued just before the end of the previous US administration. Should it come into effect this month, it would split the world's countries into three groups: those that can receive chips from the US, those that can only receive some, and those that are blocked completely. President Trump, however, isreportedlyconsidering scrapping this approach and instead requiring licensing on a per-country basis—if a country wants chips, it must get a license. This would, so the argument goes, give the US more bargaining power over tariffs and enable a more fine-tuned approach to chip exports. But Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, the world's biggest (fabless) chip making company, here seems to be encouraging the US administration to be a little more lax with its approach. This is presumably because requiring each individual country to acquire a license might help with bargaining power, but will surely also at the very least slow down exports. When asked about Chinese company Huawei's chips and how competitive they are to Nvidia's, Huang reiterates the importance of making more, not less: \"Whatever policy the administration puts together really should enable us to accelerate the development of AI, enable us to compete on a global stage.\" And as if to really hit this point home for the patriots in the room, he also reiterates the importance of being competitive in this industry against China. He says: \"China is not behind... China is right behind us. We're very, very close. But remember, this is an infinite race. In the world of life there's no two-minute, end of the quarter, there's no such thing, so we're going to compete for a long time. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"Just remember that this is a country with great wealth, and they have great technical capabilities. 50% of the world's AI researchers are Chinese, and so this is an industry that we will have to compete for.\" That there is somewhat of an AI arms race between China and the US I think goes without saying, but the real question is whether more or less export controls is the way to combat that. The Nvidia CEO here seems to be suggesting, even if not outright saying, that the way to remain competitive is to get its chips out there, to \"accelerate the diffusion of American AI technology around the world.\" Best SSD for gaming: The best speedy storage today.Best NVMe SSD: Compact M.2 drives.Best external hard drives: Huge capacities for less.Best external SSDs: Plug-in storage upgrades. The counter-argument would be that more exports means more of a chance that AI chips will end up in China. We've already seen tons of chips that are banned from being sold to Chinaending up in there via third parties. The counter-argument to Huang might be that freer exports would only make such occurrences more likely. Plus, to my ears, laying so much emphasis on the American-ness of Nvidia's chips rings a little hollow. We're not dealing with Ford cars here. Remember, Nvidia doesn't physically make its own chips and most of them come out of Taiwan as TSMC-made. And sure, TSMC is increasing its US production with apromised $100 billion investment, but Taiwan islooking to block TSMCfrom having its best chips be made in the US. And regardless, most of its production is still coming out of Taiwan and will be for some time. It just seems a bit of a stretch to think of Nvidia exports as an export of American manufacturing in any meaningful sense that could combat, rather than bolster, China in its race against the US for AI supremacy. But that's just one man's opinion—I'd hope the big wigs in the policy discussion rooms are entertaining a little more nuance. It could also be an argument about profits: More exports equals more money for Nvidia equals more money for a US company making AI chips. Perhaps it's as simple as that—I suppose things do usually boil down to money, in the end. Jacob got his hands on a gaming PC for the first time when he was about 12 years old.

    "title": "I spent the day using GameSir's new GameHub app, potentially corrupting my phone and gaming PC, so you don't have to",
    "article_text": "No offers found If you want to sideload a dodgy seeming Trombone Champ emulator, GameHub is pretty good. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Handheld PC gaminghas rather exploded since the launch of theSteam Deckand other Switch-like machines. As someone devoid of such a device, the closest I typically get to this style of portable PC gaming is using Steamlink to stream games to my phone. This is why GameSir's simultaneous controller and mobile gaming app launch announcement caught my attention this morning. After spending some time with theGameHub app, all I can say is I hope the new GameSir X5 Lite gaming controller is much, MUCH better than GameHub. The dual launch makes sense as theX5 lite is a phone cradle style controller, purpose built to transform a phone into a Switch-style handheld. Despite the decent specs, like Hall effect sticks and membrane triggers, the bad experience of the GameHub app has already tainted my opinion of this controller by association. That or it has to beamazingto help move installs of the app. It's a shame, because GameSir has made some neat controllers over the years,especially for those on a budget. At $35 USD it's not a bad price for what sounds like a quality mobile cradle. I guess it's a good thing it doesn't have to be used with GameHub, so it could still be okay for some users. It's free only in the same way a monkey's paw from your local froghurt purveyor is free. GameHub, on the other hand, is not. And my frustrating day can attest to this. The software itself exists as free app for Android, but it's free only in the same way a monkey's paw from your local froghurt purveyor is free. The only way to get it is a download on the website as opposed to a verified app download. This is a bit of a red flag, especially when combined with the amount of permissions it wants. It will also demand you create a login to use the app, and then will want logins to other services it connects to like Steam. The logins are also cursed. I think it took about ten solid minutes to finish the initial installation process, which seemed completely ridiculous for what I was doing. My only assumption is that either the app is really poorly built or it's doing some sneaky stuff on the side. Once installing the app on my surely now corrupted device I can get a better look at what's on offer. Essentially it's a launcher that combines various other services like SteamLink in the one place, as well as advertising compatible games. Before you've added any games to your library it basically looks like a storefront, but I have to admit the UI is nice to scroll through. Though it'd be better if the localisation was more effective given most things are in Chinese, or just badly translated. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. It also acts as a social hub, but I didn't want to ask anyone else to install the app to try that out. I use SteamLink a bit already, so I wanted to try that out first, but every time I tried to login to Steam via the GameHub app it would completely freeze up. Then would say the request had stopped or there was an error. I gave up on this after a few more goes. One of the features GameHub also touts is the ability to move your Windows games to your Android device by downloading the GameHub manager tool to your PC. So yes, my PC is also likely infected now. It pulls a list of compatible games from your device and in no particular order displays them for download to your phone. Your phone has to be connected via USB and have permissions allowed, but then you can move games from your list to your phone supposedly run there. I know phones are beefy, and emulators are much more capable than they used to be, but I don't think it's going to make Doom Eternal run just like it does on Windows. For the sake of time and storage I tried Deep Rock Galactic first, figuring my phone had a shot at running it without making it too easy a test. It got part way through the install and then Unreal 4 needed some other Windows package (which opened in a Windows notification, thanks Winlator) and despite several tries it would freeze at the midway point on install. I gave up and decided to try something easier—though apparently I hadn't because the Deep Rock Galactic sounds started playing out of my device 30 minutes later and wouldn't stop until a complete restart. I tried opening it again but it once again demanded the update it couldn't complete. I had similar experiences with a few other games of the same tier so I decided to try something much simpler. Lowering the stakes considerably I gaveTrombone Champa try and had much better luck. This game was able to install and load just fine, though with only a black screen for the first few times. Then magically as I was about to give up it started working, so I can only assume a game needs a certain baboon quota met before it will run. It still didn't seem worth the effort involved, let alone the security questions I have. I think Trombone Champ put it best, the app is nasty. And though I've purged it from my device, I'm actually a little sad about it. The app did look and feel fairly nice, but doesn't offer anything new or, y'know, worthwhile. And that's when it works. You can do most things better through the individual bespoke apps, such as SteamLink on its own, and that feel a whole lot safer than this one.

    "article_text": "No offers found These gamer mice have that Microsoft Office aesthetic. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Cherry may be a name synonymous with mechanical keyboards and ubiquitous mechanical switches but it's been known to bang out the odd rodent now and then. A few years back it released the M8 wireless gaming mouse, an unassuming little fellow that garnered a fair bit of respect among fans. Next out of the burrow is its successor, the M68 which comes in both a wireless and Pro variant, and it looks to be a promising upgrade on the original design. Like the M8, the M68 doesn't really look like agamingmouse. The standard option has pops of aqua which could give it away, but the Pro version is all business. This is something I enjoy, because it lets you get away with some stealth mode-gaming kit on you at all times. No one looks twice at a mouse that looks like it's designed for Microsoft Word, and that's what we have here with the new M68s. Other than that minor splash of colour, the standard M68 wireless and Pro are really similar looking pieces of kit. This means they both keep the symmetrical design, which, if the side buttons were movable, would make it great for ambidextrous users. They also have the lowered front said to give extra precision to clicks, and even share dimensions. But everything meaningful that distinguishes them is under the hood. TheM68 Wirelesscomes in at $100. It boasts 75 hours of battery life and has a polling rate up to 1000 Hz. The slightly smaller battery also allows this cheaper model to weigh a few grams less than the Pro at 53 g. That makes it a good portable option, though maybe not quite as good as theminiature version the MW8. The Pro is priced at $140. For those extra $40 you get up to 90 hours of battery life and a polling rate that's up to 8000 Hz, and also claims to one of the lowest click latencies out there. It weighs a little more with those extra 15 hours of battery coming in at 55 g. Other than that they both offer the same 2.4 GHz connectivity and dual side buttons. These sound like zippy little no fuss gaming mice, which can be a reprieve when it comes to how overdone some of these are. The Pro is the clear choice for anyone who cares about being as accurate as possible in FPS games, or really need that click responsiveness in competitive scenes. While for $40 less the standard M68 could be a nicely priced midrang mouse. It will all come down to the actual feel for whether or not these mice are worth your time. Do those lowered front portions actually help with clicking heads or are they just a downwards slide into my desk? If Cherry decides to release one that looks as nice as the newNorthern Lights keyboardthen I probably won't even care.

ANGER isn't the answer to today's Wordle, it's just how I feel right now. I could've won this in two. I should've won this in two. I spectacularly failed to win this in two. I just missed an obvious clue. Never has a win in three tasted so sour. With any luck this fumble will remind me to do better tomorrow. You'd call a highly skilled or extremely talented individual this. Maybe they're an expert in their field, or simply have a knack for this sort of thing.

Keeping track of the last handful of Wordle answers can help to eliminate current possibilities. It's also handy for inspiring opening words or subsequent guesses if you're short on ideas for the day. Here are the last 10 Wordle answers: Wordle presents you with six rows of five boxes every day and the aim is to figure out the correct five-letter word by entering guesses and eliminating or confirming individual letters. Getting off to a good start witha strong wordlike ARISE—something containing multiple vowels, common consonants, and no repeat letters—is a good tactic. Once you hit Enter, the boxes will show you which letters you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second guess should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. With a bit of luck, you should have some coloured squares to work with and set you on the right path. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used, you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography.

    "title": "US court slams Apple for 'obvious cover-up' in major Epic victory that could see Fortnite return to iOS soon",
    "article_text": "No offers found Today's court order finds that Apple has violated a 2021 injunction, and that one Apple exec \"outright lied under oath.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney is still far from getting everything he originally wanted from his war over iOS app store payments, but he just won a huge victory as a US court has bodied Apple for violating a 2021 injunction, going so far as to refer the iPhone maker's behavior to criminal prosecutors. When Epic started its war with Apple, it wanted to use its own payment processing system in Fortnite on iOS, bypassing Apple's 30% fee. Epic lost that battle in a 2021 trial, but the US courts ruled in its favor on one point: Apple was told it couldn't stop iOS app developers from directing users to out-of-app websites that use their own payment processors. Since then, Sweeney has been complaining that Apple has not truly complied with the court's will, and after reviewing the evidence, the court has come down firmly on Sweeney's side. \"Apple's response to the Injunction strains credulity,\" reads today's order from judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers. \"After two sets of evidentiary hearings, the truth emerged. Apple, despite knowing its obligations thereunder, thwarted the Injunction's goals, and continued its anticompetitive conduct solely to maintain its revenue stream.\" \"We strongly disagree with the decision,\" an Apple spokesperson told PC Gamer in response to a request for comment. \"We will comply with the court's order and we will appeal.\" Instead of simply allowing developers to link to out-of-app payment systems in response to the original injunction, Apple introduced a 27% commission on those out-of-app payments. Apple also added \"scare\" screens that seemed to warn users away from out-of-app purchases, something Sweeney has also complained about with regard to Apple'scompliance with a related European law. Epic did not think Apple was truly abiding by the injunction, and an evidentiary hearing took place in 2024 to look into it. According to today's order, the court became concerned that Apple was not being entirely truthful about how it came up with that 27% fee, and told it to produce documents related to its injunction compliance planning. Apple stalled, but a second hearing took place earlier this year, and the court did not like what it saw. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"Remarkably, Apple believed that this Court would not see through its obvious cover-up\" in 2024's hearing, wrote the district judge, who also stated that Apple VP of finance Alex Roman \"outright lied under oath\"—a matter she has referred to the regional US attorneys office \"to investigate whether criminal contempt proceedings are appropriate.\" Roman's testimony was \"replete with misdirection and outright lies,\" said the judge. For instance, he testified that Apple had not considered the external payment processing costs developers would also be paying when it came up with its 27% commission for out-of-app purchases. Evidence revealed to the court showed that Apple was aware of those costs, \"which conveniently exceeded the 3% discount Apple ultimately decided to provide by a safe margin.\" And the fee itself was a violation of the injunction. According to the court, Apple executive Phil Schiller understood this and opposed the fee, but \"Tim Cook ignored Schiller and instead allowed Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri and his finance team to convince him otherwise.\" \"Cook chose poorly,\" wrote the judge. Following today's order, Apple will have no more leeway unless it succeeds in its appeal: There will be no more fees for out-of-app iOS purchases in the US, not just for Epic, but for any developer. \"This is an injunction, not a negotiation,\" reads the order. \"There are no do-overs once a party willfully disregards a court order. Time is of the essence. The Court will not tolerate further delays. As previously ordered, Apple will not impede competition. The Court enjoins Apple from implementing its new anticompetitive acts to avoid compliance with the Injunction. Effective immediately Apple will no longer impede developers' ability to communicate with users nor will they levy or impose a new commission on off-app purchases.\" We will return Fortnite to the US iOS App Store next week.Epic puts forth a peace proposal: If Apple extends the court's friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide, we'll return Fortnite to the App Store worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic. https://t.co/bIRTePm0TvApril 30, 2025 Sweeney still hasn't gotten what he originally wanted—the ability to include his own payment processor directly in the app—but that hasn't been on the table in the US since that original 2021 ruling. After this victory, he says he's ready for peace. \"We will return Fortnite to the US iOS App Store next week,\" Sweeneytweeted today. \"Epic puts forth a peace proposal: If Apple extends the court's friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide, we'll return Fortnite to the App Store worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic.\" Tyler grew up in Silicon Valley during the '80s and '90s, playing games like Zork and Arkanoid on early PCs.

    "title": "Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 rumored specs: predictions for every key spec",
    "article_text": "From the screen to the chipset and the cameras When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. TheSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 7might not be a comprehensive upgrade on theSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 6from what we’ve heard so far, with various aspects possibly staying the same. But there are some parts of the phone that likely will be substantially improved. While nothing is certain yet, we can look at claimed leaks and rumors to get a good idea of what specs we might see. So that’s exactly what we’ve done below, and where there aren’t any tips we’ve used educated guesses to fill in some of the gaps. Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 predicted specs Displays: 6.85-inch AMOLED (main), 4-inch AMOLED (cover) Resolution: 1080 x 2640 pixels+ (main), 720 x 748 pixels+ (cover) Refresh rate: 120Hz (main), 60Hz (cover) Chipset: Snapdragon 8 Elite Rear cameras: 50MP wide, 12MP ultra-wide Front camera: 10MP RAM: 12GB Storage: 256GB, 512GB Battery: 4,300mAh If you’re familiar with theSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 6’s specsthen you’ll note that the predicted specs in the chart above are a mix of old and new. But let’s start with some of the areas where theSamsungGalaxy Z Flip 7 will reportedly be an improvement on its predecessor. One of the main upgrades could be the screen sizes, with multiple sources suggesting theGalaxy Z Flip 7 could have a roughly 4-inch cover screen, which is up from 3.4 inches on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6. So that would make the cover screen significantly larger this year. One of those sources also points toa slightly larger 6.85-inch foldable screen– up from 6.7 inches on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7. So, in both cases you should have more space to interact with the phone, though this should have the greatest impact on the cover display, which is quite cramped on the Z Flip 6. So far there’s no word on the resolution, but presumably the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 will either match or better the Z Flip 6 here, meaning a foldable screen of at least 1080 x 2640, and a cover screen of at least 720 x 748. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. We also fully expect the foldable display will have a 120Hz refresh rate, since the Galaxy Z Flip 6’s does, while the cover screen will probably be 60Hz. Another upgrade we’ll almost certainly see is the chipset, withthe Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 rumored to use either a Snapdragon 8 Eliteor an Exynos 2500. So far there’s no agreement on which – and it could be that some regions will get one and some the other, but while theSnapdragon 8 Elitewill likely outperform the Exynos 2500, either of these would be an improvement on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 in the current model. RAM and storage however may not be improved, with the one leak on that front pointing to theSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 having 12GB of RAMand a choice of 256GB or 512GB of storage, just like the Z Flip 6. However, its performance may get a boost from a larger vapor cooling chamber. One of the more disappointing things we’re hearing is that there might be no upgrades at all tothe Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7’s cameras, with leaks pointing to the same 50MP main, 12MP ultra-wide, and 10MP front facing cameras as last year. Finally, there’s the battery, and multiple sourcespoint to this being 4,300mAh, which would be a noticeable upgrade on the 4,000mAh of its predecessor. That’s great news, as 4,000mAh really isn’t much for a phone of this size. What we don’t know is how fast it might charge, but the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 supports 25W wired charging and 15W wireless, so expect at least that much.

    "title": "It's official - the majority of visitors to online shops and retailers are now bots, not humans: here's why it matters to you and me",
    "article_text": "Bots now account for more online shop traffic than real humans When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The internet has entered a new era where automated traffic now accounts for more web activity than human users, new research says. Radware's2025 ecommerce Bot Threat Reportclaims the majority of traffic to online stores during the 2024 holiday season didn’t come from people. It came from bots. For the first time, automated programs - ranging from simple scripts to AI-enhanced digital agents - accounted for 57% of all traffic, surpassing human visitors on e-commerce websites. The report highlights the ongoing evolution of malicious bots, as nearly 60% now use behavioral strategies designed to evade detection, such as rotating IP addresses and identities, using CAPTCHA farms, and mimicking human browsing patterns, making them difficult to identify without advanced tools. The only effective counter is equally intelligent detection - AI-powered defenses that can learn and adapt. Businesses must reassess their security stack and look beyond basic filters to solutions offering advancedDDoS protectionand intelligent traffic monitoring. “Bad bots are no longer just based on simple scripts - they’re sophisticated, AI-enhanced agents capable of outsmarting traditional defenses,” said Ron Meyran, Vice President of Cyber Threat Intelligence at Radware. “E-commerce providers and online retailers that rely on conventional security measures will find themselves increasingly exposed, not just during the holidays but year-round.” Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Mobile platforms have become a critical battleground, with a staggering 160% rise in mobile-targeted bot activity between the 2023 and 2024 holiday seasons. Attackers are deploying mobile emulators and headless browsers that imitate legitimate app behavior. The report also warns of bots blending into everyday internet traffic. A 32% increase in attack traffic from residential proxy networks is making it much harder for ecommerce sites to apply traditional rate-limiting or geo-fencing techniques. Perhaps the most alarming development is the rise of multi-vector campaigns combining bots with traditional exploits and API-targeted attacks. These campaigns go beyond scraping prices or testing stolen credentials - they aim to take sites offline entirely. For businesses relying on thebest ecommerce website buildersor user-friendly platforms, the threat is clear. Security must evolve in step with the attackers. Platforms must also adopt dedicated mobile protections to defend against these increasingly sophisticated threats.

    "title": "This rotten Apple ruling cracks the reality distortion field – and I don't know if that's what consumers want",
    "article_text": "Apple may have crossed the wrong judge When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Appledoes not hide its deeds under a bushel; When it \"lost\" the Epic (Fortnite) case last year, it quickly rolled out a series of changes to satisfy the injunction. If no one else realized Apple had somehow won by losing, Epic certainly knew it, withEpic CEO Tim Sweeney stating on X (formerly Twitter), \"The court battle to open iOS to competing stores and payments is lost in the United States. A sad outcome for all developers.\" In answer to that ruling,Apple started charging a 27% commission on App Store appsthat chose to manage their own billing and forced them to apply for a special tool that let app developers include a button to outside billing systems. Additionally, Apple required that developers still support Apple's in-app billing system as an alternative to third-party ones. It was all there in black and white, but those decisions triggered what may be one of the most scathing rulings I have ever read. I mean, US District Court Judge Yvonne Gonzales Rogers who has been presiding over this case for years is pissed. Was Apple trying to follow the letter of the law while skirting around the bits that might have any impact on its commission revenue business? As Judge Gonzalez sees it, yes. Don't believe me? Read this unedited bitfrom the court ruling: \"In stark contrast to Apple’s initial in-court testimony, contemporaneous business documents reveal that Apple knew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option. To hide the truth, Vice-President of Finance, Alex Roman, outright lied under oath. Internally, Phillip Schiller had advocated that Apple comply with the Injunction, butTim Cookignored Schiller and instead allowed Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri and his finance team to convince him otherwise. Cook chose poorly. The real evidence, detailed herein, (Case 4:20-cv-05640-YGR Document 1508 Filed 04/30/25 Page 2 of 80 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court Northern District of California) more than meets the clear and convincing standard to find a violation. The Court refers the matter to the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California to investigate whether criminal contempt proceedings are appropriate.\" As the judge sees it, Apple may have used the ruling to further enrich its commission business: \"Prior to the Injunction, Apple did not allow 'linked-out purchases' and, thus, did not charge any commission for purchases made outside of, or off, its platform. Now, it does.\" The filing shows how Apple worked to fulfill the injunction in such a way that, while maybe opening new third-party billing and revenue avenues to developers, it also solidified Apple's hold on the process and commission collection. Judge Gonzalez paints this as a pretty nefarious operation with Apple willfully hiding and lying about its intentions. The thing is, Apple has never lied about its intentions regarding the App Store. Apple likes full-stack control for, well, control, but also so it can fulfill its security and privacy promises. An App Store where you can trust the majority of apps is not something that occurs naturally. You must set the parameters and ensure that every app that passes through those narrow gates does what it promised and is free from malware and spyware. It's no accident that yourbest iPhoneis not riddled with malware or that you rarely download a fake app (does anyone remember the early days of Android apps beforeGoogle Play?!). The more open Apple is with its platforms, the more risk it incurs for itself and its customers. It's also clear, though, that Apple doesn't think much about methods or perception. If it was being forced to give third-party fulfillment systems access to App Store customers, then why not charge third-party developers for the pleasure? After all, the links to these platforms would come through Apple. Was that a deterrent to the development of such systems? Probably. Was that Apple's intention? I don't know. If you believe the injunction, you know some within Apple knew that Apple's methods of compliance were too close to flouting the law. Those voices, though, did not win. Former Apple CFO Luca Maestri, once a voice of reason on Apple earnings calls, is named a key champion of potentially bad ideas. As for what Apple does next, well, I'm sure it will fight, but there's also no way it can ignore Judge Gonzales' closing statement: \"This is an injunction, not a negotiation. There are no do-overs once a party willfully disregards a court order. Time is of the essence. The Court will not tolerate further delays. As previously ordered, Apple will not impede competition. The Court enjoins Apple from implementing its new anticompetitive acts to avoid compliance with the Injunction. Effective immediately Apple will no longer impede developers’ ability to communicate with users nor will they levy or impose a new commission on off-app purchases.\" If this ruling holds, which is not a certaintyas Apple plans to appeal,it may trigger sweeping changes that could forever alter the way we use the App Store. The loss of a fully closed system may not be the best thing for consumers. Still, it gives developers the flexibility many have been craving and effectively takes the Apple commission (a..k.a. the \"Apple tax\") off the table for transactions happening outside the platform, even if users found that link from inside Apple's App Store. Epic is already planning for a best-case scenario and quickly announced that Fortnitewill return to the App Store next weekwith, I'm sure, in-app purchases (those skins!), all taking you outside Apple's platform. We will return Fortnite to the US iOS App Store next week.Epic puts forth a peace proposal: If Apple extends the court's friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide, we'll return Fortnite to the App Store worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic. https://t.co/bIRTePm0TvApril 30, 2025 This might be the first effective crack in Apple's \"reality distortion field,\" one that refashions reality to suit its needs. We've seen it at work this year with Apple not delivering the fullApple Intelligenceexperience but telling consumers that the iPhone 16 comes with it. It has sincequietly removed some of that languagefrom product pages. Apple has rarely admitted mistakes or shortcomings, and while this ruling isn't a sign that Apple will start now, it appears to have no choice but to deconstruct the distortion field it built around app developer choice. As for the injunction, it reads like the final word on the subject: \"Apple willfully chose not to comply with this Court’s Injunction. It did so with the express intent to create new anticompetitive barriers which would, by design and in effect, maintain a valued revenue stream; a revenue stream previously found to be anticompetitive. That it thought this Court would tolerate such insubordination was a gross miscalculation. As always, the coverup made it worse. For this Court, there is no second bite at the apple. \" Ouch.

    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. FortniteChapter 6 Season 3 is imminent, set to arrive following a period of scheduled downtime on May 2, 2025, at 2am ET / / 11pm PT (May 1) / 7am BST. It'll be aStar Wars-focused affair called Galactic Battle, bringing a whole new Battle Pass to work through, and new map locations to visit. In the build-up to launch, I'll be covering things live, providing up-to-date details on scheduled downtime, the highlights set to arrive next season, and my initial impressions of things once it's all gone live. Start date and timeMap changesBattle Pass SkinsUpdate ScheduleTrailerLoot PoolJump to Live Coverage Epic Gameshas been busy teasingthe next season ofFortniteover the last week or so, and we now know that it's entirely centered around Star Wars. So far, there's been a full cinematic trailer showing off some of the upcoming Battle Pass skins, a look at how the map is set to change as part ofFortniteChapter 6 Season 3, as well as the announcement of an in-game event that'll air shortly after the new season launches. If early signs are anything to go on, the upcoming Star Wars updates toFortnitecould be a real high point for Chapter 6 so far. Hopefully, we'll get to fly some X-Wings, battle Samurai variants of iconic Star Wars villains, and evenget to see Darth Jar-Jar in action. Personally, I've found this Chapter a little bit lacking, so I'm excited to see how Epic Games delivers on the most involved Star Wars season yet. I'll be dropping in on launch day, checking out the new Battle Pass skins and testing the new blaster-packed weapon loot pool, seeing if the changes are good enough to keepFortnitein TechRadar'sbest free games list. Join me as I keep you up to date with the launch ofFortniteChapter 6 Season 3, including live coverage of the scheduled downtime, and my live impressions once I drop into my first few matches. As new info on the latest season drops, this page will be updated. Here's what you need to know aboutFortniteChapter 6 Season 3, now that we're on the eve of launch day.. Only have time for the basics? Here are the most important things to know aboutFortnite Galactic Battle: FortniteChapter 6 Season 3 will start on May 2 at 2am ET / 11pm PT (May 1) / 7am BST. Well, sort of. This is when downtime will start, so it'll likely be a few hours before we're all able to jump back in. Once we know more about how long downtime is set to last, we'll be able to make a prediction as to when the new season is going live. For now, assume downtime to be at least two or three hours, as has been the case for the last couple of seasons. As you can see from the image above, there are four new major POIs (points of interest) set to be added alongside the newFortniteSeason. The first isOutpost Enclave, which is a rebel base looking similar in structure to Tatooine. Then there's theFirst Order Base, which is set to be populated by Stormtroopers. Then, there'sVader Samurai's Solitude, which contains a Vader mini-boss. Finally, theResistance Baseis set amongst the forest, and features the Millennium Falcon. There are four main skins on offer as part of theFortniteGalactic Battle Pass. These include a new Emperor skin, Poe Dameron, a Rebel-variant of Evie, and a Wookiee Team Leader outfit. It's likely that we'll see alternate colors for these skins, included in the Battle Pass. The bonus skin is General Grievous, who arrives later in May. Epic Games has revealed thatFortnite Galactic Battlewill receive weekly updates that add new weapons, and other content into the game. Here's the full schedule: The full cinematic trailer forFortnite Galactic Battlejust dropped. In it, we see Fish Stick in yet another life-threatening predicament, Luke Skywalker leading a squadron of X-Wings, and a group of Mandalorians using jetpacks to land amongst an ongoing blaster battle. There's red and blue lightsabers to earn in Fortnite Galactic Battle, as well as an entirely blaster-based weapon pool. Here's what's available: As a freelance games writer, it's my job to stay up to date with the latest games, especially live service titles likeFortnite. I've put hundreds of hours into the game at this point, having jumped on duringFortniteVibing. Since then, I've particularly enjoyed theFortnite OGseasons, which gave me the opportunity to experience older seasons ofFortnitethat I missed the first time around. Hopefully, this upcomingStar Warsseason ofFortnitewill give me plenty to check out each week, with regular updates that culminate in a live finale event. I'm heading off for the night! I'll be back online at 3AM ET / 8AM BST / 12AM PT to resume my live coverage ofFortniteGalactic Battle's launch. The game will be in scheduled downtime at that point. Hopefully, we won't have to wait too long to drop into the new season. On May 29, players will be able to locate a single portal that'll appear once per match. Go through it and you'll be in the Control Room of a Star Destroyer, allowing you to turn the turbolasers on and unleash destruction from above. Force Lightning will arrive inFortnitetomorrow, and you'll need to head through a portal and speak to the Emperor to get it. Force powers have been a mainstay for Star Wars-relatedFortniteevents for a while now, with everything from Force Push to Force Throw, which let you chuck big rocks at enemies for huge damage. Hopefully, Force Lightning will be worth seeking out. I'd love there to be a chain lightning effect to deal damage to multiple opponents at once. TheFortniteGalactic Battleannouncement postmentions pilotable TIE Fighters and X-Wings, which should make for some epic dogfights. Even better, there's co-pilot seats for your squadmates, where they'll be able to control turrets to deal extra damage. Darth Vader Samurai debuted during Chapter 6 Season 1, and it's confirmed that he'll be back soon. A new POI called Vader Samurai's Solitude will pop up in the southwestern corner of the new map, where Shogun's Solitude previously was. It'll feature Vader Samurai as a mini-boss, similarly to how the Shogun works on the current map. Defeat his guards to call him out for battle. The First Order Base is one of the largest POIs (points of interest) on the map, with a reboot van, and two main sections. You'll find Captain Phasma here, who drops a Mythic weapon and Medallion when beaten. You can sneak in by tracking down the utility shaft. The new Enclave Outpost location is a very Mos Eisley-esque area, with an X-Wing that you can pilot, and a sandcrawler to explore. Be sure to check the underground hangars for more weapons that you can use to take down the First Order. A couple of crashed AT-ATs will be repurposed into a food court as part of the new update. eAT-eAT could be a low-key drop spot, one that I'm betting will be filled with healing items at the start of every match. If you can infiltrate the First Order Base and defeat Captain Phasma in battle, you’ll be rewarded with the MythicCaptain Phasma’s F-11D BlasterandPhasma’s Blaster Medallion. The Medallion extends how long it takes a blaster weapon to overheat, and reduces its cooldown. With everyone else running standard blasters, this could really give you an edge worth seeking out. Thanks to ablog postrecently posted on the mainFortnitesite, we now know that all non-lightsaber weapons will be blasters. This likely means no ammo to pick up, though we'll have to wait and see. here's the full weapons list: Epic Games has already unveiled the newFortnitemap for Chapter 6 Season 3. Looks like there's four main changes, with Vader Samurai's Solitude, Resistance Base, Enclave Outpost, and First Order Base being the new main locations. That means it's time to say goodbye to Whiffy Wharf, Demon's Dojo, Shogun's Solitude, and Hopeful Heights. I'm back to resume duties on the Fortnite Galactic Battle live blog, and there's been a few reveals while I've been away. Let's dive back in with another look at General Grievous. I'll be taking a short break now, but I'll be back at 12PM ET / 5PM BST / 9AM PT to resume my live coverage ofFortniteGalactic Battle. There's still plenty to dive into, including the new map changes which tease the return of Vader Samurai. FortniteChapter 6 Season 3 will run through until early June, making it a condensed season when compared to the last two. Each week, there's going to be an update that'll kick off new narrative elements, and shift the focus of the season. Here's the update schedule: Be among the first to view the first two episodes of the newStar Wars: Tales of the Underworldanimated series, exclusive to theStar WarsWatch Party island in Fortnite for the first 48 hours before it hits Disney+! The island goes live on May 2 at 10AM ET / 3PM BST / 7AM PT. Speaking of making the most of Season 2 while it's still live, you can still pick up The Vaultbrella by getting a Victory Royale. Easier said than done, but worth giving a go while you wait for the Star Wars events to kick off. With less than a day left ofFortniteLawless, you might want to make the most of the remaining hours and collect any Battle Pass skins you've yet to redeem. Tier 100 features Mortal Kombat's Sub-Zero, though honestly, I'm happy with having just earned Big Dill. Finally, Darth Jar Jar is officially canon, well... in terms ofFortnitecanon, I suppose. He's seemingly not included in the Battle Pass, so I'm betting he'll be the bonus skin for this season. We'll have to wait and see. DespiteFortnitehaving featured Mace's lightsaber before as a mythic weapon, the character has never actually been added as a skin. He'll be available in the store at some point during Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3, hopefully alongside his purple lightsaber as a harvesting tool (we'll see). If you drop intoFortnitenow, as I just did, you'll spot a new addition to the skyline. The Death Star can be seen in the distance, signaling the arrival of the Empire and First Order. You can now connect your Epic and MyDisney accounts to earn a First Order Stormtrooper outfit to use in Fortnite. Follow these steps to do so: So far, Epic Games has shown off five confirmed Battle Pass skins forFortniteChapter 6 Season 3. Poe Dameron, Wookie Team Leader, Resistance Evie, Emperor Palpatine, and General Grievous will all be up for grabs. As in previous seasons, I'm betting on there being variants for each too, perhaps a Clone Wars-style for Grievous? One can hope. ✔️ Star Wars Themed Battle Pass\n✔️ Weekly Gameplay Content\n✔️ Culminating in a Live End of Season Narrative Event\n➡️ Fortnite Galactic Battle arrives May 2, 2025 pic.twitter.com/JmRStRA2UmApril 20, 2025 Fortnite Galactic Battleis the next season of Fortnite, and it's entirely themed around Star Wars. From the looks of things, this will be a shorter season, with weekly narrative updates that culminate in a live finale. The current season of Fortnite is set to end tomorrow (May 2) at 2AM ET / 7AM BST, and 11 PM for PT (May 1). At this point, the game will move offline for scheduled downtime. At present, there’s no info on how long downtime will be, but it's worth noting that last season's switch over took five hours. Hopefully it'll be a little shorter this time. Hello and welcome to my live coverage of theFortniteChapter 6 Season 3 launch. We’re now on the eve of release day, and there’s still plenty we don’t know about the imminent Star Wars-centric season.

    "article_text": "And the Triple Boost 14 Pro is cheaper than you might expect When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Aura Displays has launched the Triple Boost 14 Pro, a new portable three-monitor setup for laptops that uses only one USB cable for both power and data. Designed for remote workers, digital professionals, and laptop users in need of more screen space, the Triple Boost 14 Pro offers three 14-inch Full HD screens. The company says this is the first time a full triple-display solution has been offered in such a compact, cable-free form factor. The Triple Boost 14 Pro is constructed with a full-aluminum housing and weighs 4.85lb (2.2kg). When folded, it measures 13.9 inches wide and 1.38 inches thick. Each screen is a matte 1080p LED display, with a brightness of 300cd/m², a 1500:1 contrast ratio, and a 178-degree viewing angle. The displays cover 100% of the sRGB color space and refresh at 60Hz. Aura says this makes the unit especially suitable for design, coding, analysis, and multitasking. The key to its single-cable setup is Aura’s proprietary Tri-Link technology, based on a custom-optimized SiliconMotion chipset. This chip handles power and video for all three screens through a single USB connection, removing the need for additional cables or adapters. The product folds down into a compact form and is aimed squarely at users who travel often or work in temporary setups. The company sees the device as an ideal tool for those who need more workspace on the go but want to avoid carrying separate monitors or docking setups. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Pre-orders for the Triple Boost 14 Proare live now, with shipments set to begin in early May 2025. It’s priced at $469 (28% off the MSRP of $649) and there’s a welcome offer on the site that will give you an extra $10 off ($459), plus two free tempered glass screen protectors (worth $69.98), and free worldwide shipping.

    "article_text": "Google wants to show more ads in more places When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Googleis now showing ads inchatbotconversations via its AdSense for Search network, marking a shift in its digital advertising strategy as generative AI becomes not only more commonplace, but increasingly used in place of traditional search engine tools. Previously, ads were shown within the search results of other websites, however Google added them to conversations with chatbots operated by AI startups earlier in 2025 (viaBloomberg). The rollout comes after the tech giant conducted tests last year, and earlier this year, with AI search apps like iAsk and Liner. Google's ads business has been an incredibly lucrative area for the California company, which maintains a 90% share of the global search market (viaStatcounter). However, with the emergence of rival AI chatbots likeOpenAI'sChatGPT, consumers are now able to obtain information more succinctly and more quickly, putting Google's business under threat, and therefore its ads network. A company spokesperson has confirmed: \"AdSense for Search is available for websites that want to show relevant ads in their conversational AI experiences.\" Google's collaboration with startups is a strategic move to stay profitable even if the search market as we know it is shrinking, but it hasn't gone unnoticed.

    "article_text": "Tell us your go-to password manager in the comments When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. We polled our TechRadar Pro readers onWhatsApp(you canjoin our channel here)to ask them which password manager they use to keep their accounts safe, and the most popular was Google password manager, a free to use service easily accessible and built into Chrome and Android devices, with 39% of respondents choosing this service. You can check out ourfull review of Google Password Manager here. Worryingly, following closely behind were the readers who don’t use a password management service at all, with 20% of our readers choosing to manage their accounts by themselves. Take a look at our picks forbest password manager hereif you need any recommendations. Trusting a third party with your passwords and credentials naturally comes with an element of risk, especially given thatsecurity attacks on password managers have soaredin just the last year. If you choose to handle your password hygiene yourself, make sure to rotate them often, never reuse them between sites, and always change them immediately if they’re exposed in a breach. Of those who do use a password manager,ApplePasswords came just behindGooglePasswords with 23% choosing the service. This is a pretty basic manager, free and built in with Apple’s OSes, which helpfully reports on data breaches and password health. Many of our readers (17%) use a different third party service, if that’s you, feel free to let us know which you recommend and why. No matter which you use, password management is definitely important, especially given how much of our lives is digital; \"Good password hygiene and management is crucial in today's world, where we all have many different accounts,” says Joel Latto, Threat Advisor at F-Secure ”If a hacker gains access to an account that uses a similar password to another, it's easy for them to also obtain information from the other account. This makes it easier for them to obtain more information about you, putting you at higher risk of identity theft, which can have devastating and distressing consequences including financial loss.\" Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!

The teaser is quite short, but at one point, we see some first-person gameplay of V attacking enemies with a katana. According to Badowski, this can be done using a detached Joy-Con 2, allowing players to swing the sword and even deflect incoming attacks. Tremblay also touched on how the Switch 2's hardware makes the game better, saying that \"it's still the same amazing experience\" and \"returning players will feel right at home\". \"That being said, we do have a lot of ways to experience the game using the controllers.

    "article_text": "Do we really want to shop what we stream? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Amazonhas brought its 'Shop The Show' program into its US app, enabling you to easily find products related to specific movies and shows – and it's just upped the number of shoppable shows to over 1,300. The idea is simple enough: let's say you're watchingThe Boysand want to buy some tie-in merchandise. Simply open the Amazon app, search for \"Shop the show\" and you can then find an organized collection of products related to the hit show. I'm not going to pretend that I'm immune to wanting the odd bit of merch, but I do worry what this means for future Prime Video originals. Because I think the temptation to stuff them with sales opportunities in the form of ever-more-annoying product placement is going to be impossible for Amazon to resist. I'm worried about combining shows and selling because every time a streamer attempts to make more money from its users, which of course is what Shop the Show is designed to do, it makes the service worse. For example, after sitting through the pre-show ads last night on Disney+, my episode ofAndorwas interrupted by another ad after just four minutes. And on Prime Video myBosch Legacyviewings suffered at the hands of automated ad breaks that didn't care whether they were mid-scene or breaking tension. I tried to watch a concert video onYouTubethe other evening and the first ads didn't even wait for the first song to finish. What worries me about Shop the Show is that this particular kind of monetization scheme could ruin programs even further, with 'Amazon the shop' pushing more and more product placement into 'Amazon the streamer'. For streamers, product placement is even better than ads. You can't skip it, and you can't pay to get rid of it. And you can put it into existing shows that didn't previously have it: as advertising publicationThe Drumreports, Amazon has experimented with virtual product placement – adding products into existing content – in multiple ways. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Product placement isn't anything new, of course. And I'm writing on a website that generates some of its revenue from linking to online retailers. But I don't work for those retailers, and I don't write with them in mind – just as in TV, where the show's maker is not usually the retailer of the products being placed on screen. That distance between the craft and the commerce usually limits how blatant the product placement can be. With Amazon and Prime Video, the show maker and the shop are the same company. Different divisions, sure, but think of the synergy. I hope I'm wrong, and that Amazon doesn't let the sales stuff affect what's on screen. I'm all for making it easier to find the booksBoschis based on, or the video games that led to theFalloutshow. But when I look at my Amazon search results and remember when they used to show me what I wanted rather than what Amazon wants to show me, I can't say I'm very optimistic.

    "title": "\"People should remain vigilant\" – over 2 million British accounts have already been leaked in 2025, despite a global downtick",
    "article_text": "The UK was the sixth most affected country worldwide When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. An average of 17 British accounts were breached every minute in 2025 so far, totalling 2.2 million accounts leaked in the UK during the first three months of the year. This toll makes the UK the sixth country most affected worldwide after the US, Russia, India, Germany, and Spain. These are the main findings coming fromSurfshark's quarterly update on its globaldata breach analysis. Nonetheless, experts report a considerable downtick in data breach incidents worldwide compared to last year's surge. In the UK, data breaches decreased this year so far by 49% compared to the last three months of 2024. Globally, the latest data shows a staggering 93% drop, passing from a total of 973.7 million to 68.3 million leaked accounts. \"Although the number of vulnerable accounts in all major regions decreased in Q1 2025 compared to the previous quarter, people should remain vigilant,\" said Luís Costa, Research Lead at Surfshark. Surfshark has recorded a total of 1.2B personal records exposed in the UK since 2004. This includes 79.2 million unique emails and 238.4 million passwords. The US was, however, the most affected nation globally, with 16.9 million accounts breached in 2025 so far. Russia follows with 4.4 million, then India (4.2 million), Germany (3.9 million), and Spain (2.4 million). France (2.1 million), Canada (0.89 million), Argentina (0.79 million), and South Sudan (0.73 million) are also among the top ten most breached countries during the first three months of 2025. Despite the global downturn, data breaches and cyberattacks do not seem they be going away anytime soon. This is why, whether you are based in the UK or any other targeted country, you should take some steps to secure your online data against this threat. \"Cyberthreats continue to evolve and attackers are constantly adapting their tactics,\" said Costa. He then suggests following strong security practices at all times and regularly updating your passwords. Apassword managertool is very handy to help you find unique combinations and stay on top of the security of your accounts with a couple of clicks. Costa also recommends enabling 2FA, adding a second layer of security to your account by requiring another verification beyond just your password. This means that even if your password gets leaked, your account should remain safe. You should also be vigilant when online to not falling victim tophishingscams. While a fewvirtual private network (VPN)tools andsecure emailservices boast features to help you stay away from these dangers, refraining from clicking on dodgy links remains the best way to stay safe.

Nintendo has just pushed outa huge Switch system updateahead of theSwitch 2launch, which adds several new changes, including a feature that now refers to digital games and DLC asVirtual Game Cards. This function is now available on the console's Home Screen and lets users virtually load and eject their software like physical game cards. However, players are now reporting that the feature is preventing two users from playing the same digital game online at the same time, something that was possible before through a loophole (viaEurogamer). Before the update, Switch games purchased on a player's primary console could be played on a different account signed in on that device, and the original owner could also sign in and play the same game on a secondary console, too. This would essentially allow the owner of the game and another person to play the game online simultaneously on different devices, but the addition of Virtual Game Cards now makes this impossible.

    "article_text": "This historical drama is set for ten-year time jump When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. FX has released new details forShōgunseason 2, and while it makes us very excited for the return of the historical drama, it looks like it'll be a while yet until it reaches our screens. Thefirst season ofShōgun, which was adapted from James Clavell’s novel of the same name, was set toward the end of Japan’s Sengoku period as Lord Yoshii Toranaga (Hiroyuki Sanada) fought for survival as his enemies, namely the Council of Regents, circled around him, looking to oust the powerful daimyo. Enter John Blackthorne (Cosmo Jarvis), an English sailor and survivor of a European ship wrecked on the shores of the village whose strategic knowledge turned the tide of civil war in Toranaga’s favour. Originally conceived as a mini-series, which covered the entirety of its source material,Shōgunfound itself renewed for not just the upcoming second season, but also a third outing. It’s hardly surprising considering one of thebest Disney+ showswas met with almost universal critical acclaim – just look at its 99% Rotten Tomatoes score – and swept last year’s awards, taking home four Golden Globes and four Primetime Emmys among other accolades. For audiences, the medieval political machinations echoed what we loved about those early seasons ofGame of Thrones,with the premiere garnering nine million viewers globally onHuluandDisney+, two of the best streaming services, making it\"the most-viewed program in FX history\". The powers that be, then, we’re always going to want further adventures for Toranaga and Blackthorne, but with the novel fully wrapped up in the first outing, fans have been eagerly awaiting news on what might be in store for season 2. While rumors have abound that further seasons may take an anthology approach, possibly drawing from Clavell’s Asian Saga book series, it’s now been confirmed that both Sanada and Jarvis will return to their respective roles, though the characters may feel a little different, with the next bath of episodes taking place a full decade after the season one finale. As for what to expect plot wise, details are still thin on the ground with FX teasing: “Part two ofShōgunis set ten years after the events of the first season and continues the historically-inspired saga of these two men from different worlds whose fates are inextricably entwined.” It doesn’t give us much, but it does confirm that the show will continue to revolve around the destinies and relationship of Toranaga and Blackthorne.

In terms ofwhento expect the latest season of the historical drama, the new details also confirm that season 2 is set to enter production in Vancouver in January 2026. Considering the epic scale of the show, which involves a lengthy shoot and a mountain of post-production, we’d anticipate mid-2027 at the earliest, which would be a whopping three years after season one aired. While multiple years between seasons has become the norm for big budget prestige TV – looking at youMax– it’ll be interesting to see whether audiences are as keen to return to feudal Japan after so long away.

    "article_text": "Old credentials? No problem When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Security researcher Daniel Wade has discovered a protocol withinMicrosoft’sRemote DesktopProtocol (RDP), which allows users to log into machines using revoked passwords. Wade’s report warns “this isn’t just a bug. It’s a trust breakdown,” reminding Microsoft that people change their passwords trusting that this will “cut off unauthorized access”, making this feature entirely counter-intuitive. Wade cautioned “millions of users—at home, in small businesses, or hybrid work setups—are unknowingly at risk. Surprisingly, in its response, Microsoft said this behaviour is not a bug - instead calling it, “a design decision to ensure that at least one user account always has the ability to log in no matter how long a system has been offline.” Microsoft confirmed the issue did not meet its definition of a security vulnerability, and that the firm has no plans to make any changes to this. According to Wade’s report, there’s no clear way for end-users to detect or fix the issue on their end either, and Azure, Defender, Entra ID don’t raise any flags, leaving users vulnerable even if they’re taking protective measures. “This creates a silent, remote backdoor into any system where the password was ever cached. Even if the attacker never had access to that system, Windows will still trust the password,” Wade argues. Credential stealing and data breaches are far too common, and compromised passwords are a serious risk to businesses and users alike.

    "article_text": "AI-powered enforcement may create precision, but risks fairness and freedom When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. For as long as there have been laws, there’s been lawbreaking. And for just as long, much of that lawbreaking has gone unnoticed, undetected, or unenforced. From small-timetaxevasion and regulatory violations to more serious crimes, our legal and enforcement systems have always operated under the assumption that not every infraction will be caught, let alone punished. But what happens when almost everything is knowable, detectable, and enforceable — all the time? This is not a hypothetical question. It’s a future that is increasingly within reach. CEO of FairPlay. Advances inartificial intelligence, combined with ubiquitous surveillance,dataaggregation, and predictive analytics, are rapidly closing the gap between what people do and what the state or private enforcers (like insurers, employers, and technology platforms) know about it. AI-powered enforcement has the potential to make rules — from traffic laws to environmental regulations to financial reporting requirements — enforceable at a level no human system ever could. Today’s enforcement regimes are constrained by human capacity, resource limitations, and the sheer scale of human activity. There simply aren’t enough police officers, IRS auditors, building inspectors, or compliance officers to monitor every infraction. Even in the most highly-regulated sectors like banking or healthcare, enforcement operates on a sampling basis — regulators audit a small fraction of cases and rely on whistleblowers or patterns of harm to trigger deeper investigations. This enforcement gap creates space for: Minor lawbreaking that everyone does, like jaywalking or tax underreporting. Strategic rule-bending by corporations confident that the cost of non-compliance will be lower than the profit it generates. Informal economies and workarounds in communities where strict legal compliance is impractical or unaffordable. In other words, incomplete enforcement isn’t unintentional — it’s a built-in buffer between the idealism of law and the pragmatism of real life: It reflects the gap between the formal rules and the messy reality of how people andbusinessesactually live and operate. AI promises to upend this dynamic in several ways: 1. Mass surveillance:Modern AI systems can process vast streams of video, sensor data,social mediaactivity, transaction records, and communications. Unlike human enforcers, AI can integrate all these data sources into coherent profiles, spotting patterns and anomalies in real-time and nearly perfect precision. A future where every movement in public space, every business transaction, and every online interaction is automatically monitored and assessed for legality is increasingly plausible. 2. Predictive and preemptive enforcement:AI doesn’t just detect violations — it can predict them. Machine learning models trained on historical violations can flag likely offenders or anticipate where breaches will occur. This transforms enforcement from a reactive process into a predictive and preventative one. Imagine an AI system that identifies risky businesses or individuals and nudges them toward compliance before violations occur — or simply pre-emptively fines them based on the probability they’ll break the rules. 3. Automated enforcement at scale:AI systems don’t get tired. They can enforce every rule, everywhere, all the time. This could turn what are now low-risk offenses — jaywalking, minor tax errors, small regulatory missteps — into near-certainties for detection and sanction. 4. Privatized enforcement ecosystems:It’s not just governments. Insurance companies, banks, landlords, employers, and platforms could all adopt AI enforcement systems to monitor contractual compliance, workplace behavior, or loan covenants. When combined with always-on monitoring, this creates a web of privately enforced micro-compliance regimes, each with its own penalties and incentives. If AI makes laws and rules enforceable at near-100% rates, the consequences for society would be profound — and not all positive. These consequences include: 1. The end of informal economies:Many communities, particularly lower-income ones, rely on informal economies that blur the line between legal and illegal activity. From street vending without a permit to off-the-books construction work, these economies function because enforcement is incomplete. Total enforcement would collapse this informal safety net, often without offering viable alternatives. 2. The criminalization of everyday life:Laws are written with the assumption that not all violations will be punished. As a result, many laws are overbroad, technically criminalizing common behavior — but rarely enforced. If AI changes that enforcement probability from 1% to 99%, everyday life could become a minefield of minor violations, each triggering fines, penalties, or worse. 3. Disparities in enforcement scope and targeting:Even with AI, enforcement systems are built by humans — and inherit their biases. Which laws are prioritized for enforcement, and which populations are most heavily monitored, will still reflect political and economic power dynamics. AI could create a veneer of neutrality, while in practice concentrating enforcement on marginalized communities or politically disfavored activities. 4. Compliance as a full-time job:If businesses and individuals are subject to always-on monitoring and hyper-enforcement, staying compliant could become a full-timejob. Entire industries of compliance assistants, AI compliance dashboards, and personal legal monitoring services could arise, adding friction and cost to every aspect of life. 5. The death of proportionality:Human enforcers have discretion. They can give warnings, ignore trivial violations, or apply common sense to ambiguous cases. AI enforcers, especially when operating autonomously, are far less likely to exercise that kind of judgment. This could create a legal environment where the letter of the law is enforced with machine precision, but with no regard for context or fairness. The prospect of AI-enforced legal perfection raises a fundamental question: Is the goal of law to achieve perfect compliance, or to balance order with freedom, fairness, and practicality? Laws are not sacred truths. They are human creations, shaped by politics, economics, and culture. They evolve as society changes. If AI locks in existing legal regimes and enforces them with mechanical rigor, it could stifle innovation, crush dissent, and make laws less adaptable to social change. The enforcement gap — the space between law on the books and law in action — is often where society negotiates its real values. Closing that gap with AI could mean the end of that negotiation, replacing it with automated obedience. There are, of course, benefits to better enforcement — fewer dangerous products on shelves, fewer tax cheats, fewer environmental violations. But the danger lies in forgetting that the purpose of enforcement is not just to punish, but to serve justice — which sometimes means turning a blind eye, showing mercy, or allowing room for ambiguity. As AI enforcement spreads, we must ask: Are we building a system that serves justice, or one that serves only the law? Because if AI gives us perfect enforcement of imperfect laws, the result won’t be a more just society — just a more unforgiving one. We've featured the best small business accounting software.

    "title": "Don’t overlook the BISO role when it comes to growth and continuity",
    "article_text": "The BISO role is becoming essential to cyber and business growth When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In today’s world, the frequency and severity of cyberattacks have become the norm. Nation-state threats andransomwareattacks are becoming more frequent alongside advancements in phishing and deepfakes due to newAI-enabled tactics. As threats continue to evolve, defenses must keep pace. However, an organization looking to improve its defenses is only as strong as its people. Ensuring the right talent is essential to improving its cybersecurity maturity and bottom line. Cybersecuritycannot be treated as its own business focus – it should be treated as a gateway to an organization’s overall growth and innovation. As business leaders set out to accomplish this mindset, there are many opportunities behind the organization’s security leaders, who can play a pivotal role in driving value. The emerging standout player is the Business Information Security Officer (BISO), essential in securing cyber initiatives' interest and funding, allowing leaders to rethink their methods and invest in strategies that prioritize proactivity and compliance. Co-founder & chief scientist at ExtraHop. Recent research found that more cyber leadership teams want to add the BISO role to their bench, but while broader industry adoption remains slow, the role is still on track to becoming a crucial part of an organization’ssecurityfunction. Acting as the liaison between security teams, business units, and the C-suite, the BISO works closely with the CISO and CIO to understand current risk and identify areas of improvement. They handle everything from risk management and threat monitoring to third-party assessments and recommending cyber investment opportunities. These investments that meet security expectations and budget requirements will produce a greater ROI in the long run. As the role is adopted widely, more organizations will benefit from an individual who understands the connection between securing the business and aligning plans to meet broader goals. Identifying ways to drive security proactiveness – and wider business success – also helps gain trust among stakeholders. A capable BISO is both a strategic leader and a cyber tactician. Success in the role hinges on a deep understanding of cybercriminal tactics and anticipating threats before they materialize. The most impactful BISOs also bring a blend of adaptability to changing attack methods, as it’s critical that the individual can understand the true cost of risk to bolster resilience. The BISO is responsible for quantifying the cost of a cyber incident and the price of risk compliance. This approach helps them make pragmatic,data-driven decisions about what to protect and how to protect it – and communicate that to the rest of the business. A pragmatic mindset also helps a good BISO make better risk management decisions that protect a company in the long run. Armed with this approach, the BISO will then make the case to the C-suite that investing in security tools ensures operational continuity while being cost-effective. As part of the role, BISOs must continuously examine the cyber tech stack and risk levels to determine the solutions and strategies that will result in the best ROI for teams and the broaderbusiness. Approaching this from the business lens enables them to make strategic decisions that best support productivity while meeting requirements. Take the rise of ransomware and extortion attacks as an example. The BISO must take notice of the legislation, fees, and legal recourse that result from a cyber incident. The reality of today’s business world is it’s a matter of when – not if – an incident occurs, often resulting in a host of direct and indirect costs that significantly impact the business long-term, averaging around $677 million per incident according to recent research. When the BISO understands and communicates current risk and the financial implications, it can be integral in helping leaders invest in the right solutions to remain proactive in cybersecurity. For example, integrated solutions that address regulatory, legal, and cybersecurity needs make it easier for businesses to manage all aspects of their cyber deployments and compliance requirements. These initiatives match the growing industry shift towards tool rationalization, a modern approach to investments in solutions designed to handle current and future risks while reducing complexity. As a result, businesses can avoid costs related to remediation efforts, lost revenues, regulatory fines, and other expenses following a security incident. As the middleman between security teams and the C-suite, the BISO acts as the organization’s north star to forgo the fear of potential threats and embrace a more confident approach to cybersecurity. One modern approach is exploring innovative strategies, such as guiding response teams to shift from traditionalmonitoring, protection, prevention, and recovery methods. Modern techniques, such as isolating threats, allow teams to reduce disruption and maintain operations when faced with vulnerabilities. The BISO also plays a role in improving employee cyber hygiene through new initiatives. Poor cyber hygiene directly impacted many organizations that suffered an incident in the past year, so it is necessary to oversee regular cyber training across departments and develop stricter employee guidelines. Understanding that cyber risk is a business risk is imminent to today’s modern business. The attack landscape is innovating at a rapid scale and increasing regulations around the world are calling for more accountability. Businesses can’t afford to delay investing in the right tools, strategies, and, most importantly, people. The BISO ensures that high-level business planning aligns with cyber goals. Over the next few years, we’ll likely see more businesses embrace the BISO role as they understand its importance to their continuity. We've featured the best business VPN.

    "article_text": "Can't choose just one bean? No problem When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. De'Longhi has launched a coffee maker with a twist: interchangeable bean hoppers, so you can switch between two different coffees in an instant. With the new De'Longhi Rivelia there's no need to use up all the beans in the machine when you want a change – just twist the hopper off to detach it, and replace it with another. Some of thebest bean-to-cup coffee machines(like the Twin edition of the Jura J8) have two hoppers that you can switch between, while others (such as theKitchenAid KF8) have a chute that allows you to use a scoop of pre-ground coffee instead of whole beans for brewing the occasional drink. Both can work well, but also have some drawbacks. An espresso machine has to be pretty big to house two full-sized hoppers, and using a scoop of grounds for your second choice of coffee somewhat defeats the point of a bean-to-cup machine, because you're sacrificing either freshness (if you buy your coffee already ground) or convenience (if you have to grind it yourself). Having two separate hot-swappable hoppers means that's no longer a problem. The Rivelia also has several familiar features that we've seen in the company's other espresso machines, including a 3.5-inch color touchscreen andBean Adapt, which automatically dials in the grinder and adjusts the water temperature to suit the type of coffee you're using. There are four customizable profiles that let you save your preferred presets, and the machine will even pick up on your usual coffee habits and make suggestions accordingly. For example, if you usually start the day with a cappuccino, it will offer that first at breakfast time, so you don't have to spend time scrolling through other beverages.

    "title": "WATCH RT journalist speaks out after deportation from Romania",
    "article_text": "RT journalist Chay Bowes, who was deported from Bucharest, said that Romanian authorities accused him of being a security threat. The Irish reporter was detained upon arrival in the Romanian capital on a flight from Dublin on Thursday, where he had traveled to cover the upcoming re-run of the presidential election. He was put on a plane to Istanbul later that day. Bowes said that shortly after touchdown in Bucharest, a group of police officers walked onto the tarmac and boarded the plane. “They asked the cabin crew where I was. I identified myself, and three police came on to the plane and told me that I had to come with them, [and] that I was being detained,”the journalist said after arriving in Istanbul. As other passengers watched“with amazement,”the police escorted Bowes for an interrogation.“I was asked questions in the vehicle by the officers –where I was going and who I was going to meet. I told them I was a journalist. They wanted to know who I was going to speak to, which I declined to tell them. I said I’m here to cover the election,”he said. Bowes said he was then taken to“a smaller interrogation room with two chairs and a table.” I was presented with a document, which was presumably stamped by a judge. They wouldn’t let me have a copy of it. They wouldn’t let me take a photograph of it. It said that I was a threat to the security of the state, and on that basis they were deporting me from Romania. Bowes denounced the deportation as a“fundamental breach”of his rights as a journalist and an EU citizen.“I entered the country completely legally – to do my job. This is really quite shocking,”he said. The presidential election in Romania will take place over two rounds, on May 4 and May 18. The dates were set in January after Romania’s Constitutional Court annulled the results of the initial vote held in November 2024. The original first round had been won by independent candidate Calin Georgescu, a vocal NATO critic and opponent of supplying weapons to Ukraine, who received 23% of the vote. Romania’s top court, however, cited“irregularities”in his campaign and referenced intelligence reports alleging Russian interference—allegations that Moscow denied. It later emerged that a TikTok influencer campaign had been funded not by the Kremlin, but by the pro-EU Romanian National Liberal Party (PNL), which has governed the country for much of the past three decades. Its most prominent member, Nicolae Ciuca, was a losing candidate in the November election.",

    "title": "EU will never recognize Crimea as Russian – top diplomat",
    "article_text": "The EU has reaffirmed its refusal to recognize Russia’s sovereignty over Crimea, the bloc’s foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas has stated. Officials in Brussels are reportedly concerned that a possible peace deal negotiated by Washington and Moscow to end the Ukraine conflict would entail the US recognizing Crimea as part of Russia. The peninsula voted to secede from Ukraine and join the Russian Federation shortly after the 2014 Western-backed coup in Kiev. Speaking to the Financial Times on Thursday, Kallas, the EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, stated unequivocally,“Crimea is Ukraine,”underscoring that“no EU country would accept recognition of Crimea as Russia.” Meanwhile, Trump’s suggestion that lifting sanctions imposed on Russia could be part of a peace deal has also alarmed EU officials, who fear it may prompt divisions within the bloc over maintaining its own sanctions regime, according to the FT. Kallas has warned EU states against following a US policy shift toward Moscow. She told the outlet that the EU is preparing a contingency plan to sustain economic pressure on Russia, should Hungary follow through on its threat to veto an extension of sanctions in July. She noted that this could include allowing national governments to adopt the sanctions individually or for Belgium to issue a decree to seize over $200 billion worth of Russian central bank assets frozen on Belgian soil. Moscow has warned that seizing its assets would amount to“theft,”hinting at possible retaliatory measures against Western investments in Russia. The diplomat also emphasized that the EU could offer Ukraine financial support if the US withdraws, though military backing would be harder to replicate.“We are still working with the Americans and trying to convince them why the outcome of this war is also in their interest,”Kallas said. Last week, Moscow accused Brussels of obstructing US-Russian diplomatic efforts to end the Ukraine conflict, working instead to prolong the hostilities.“Europe wants war, not talks,”Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.",

    "title": "Trump announces sweeping sanctions against Iran",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has announced that countries that continue to buy Iranian oil or petrochemical products will face secondary sanctions. The move comes as Washington and Tehran have been engaging in talks over Iran’s nuclear program. The Islamic Republic is reportedly willing not to militarize the program in exchange for sanctions relief. Anyone found to be doing oil trade with Iran“will not be allowed to do business with the United States of America in any way, shape, or form,”Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social on Thursday, adding that“all purchases of Iranian oil or petrochemical products must stop, now!” The announcement came a day after the US State Department imposed sanctions against seven companies it said were involved in the“illicit”trade of Iranian oil and petrochemical products. The list includes six entities based in the United Arab Emirates, as well as one Turkish and one Iranian company. In its statement, the State Department accused Tehran of fueling conflict in the Middle East, advancing its nuclear program, and supporting“terrorist partners and proxies.”The US Treasury Department did not comment on the latest developments or announce any new restrictions. Washington has been pressuring Tehran into a new agreement on its nuclear program. Trump tore up the 2015 UN-backed agreement during his first term in office, accusing Tehran of secretly violating the deal, and reimposed sanctions. Iran has reportedly rolled back its compliance with the accord. In March, Trump threatened to bomb Iran“if they don’t make a deal.”Tehran responded by saying that it would not yield to pressure. The two sides have held three rounds of talks on the issue that were facilitated by Oman. However, the fourth round was postponed for“logistical and technical reasons,”Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi announced earlier on Thursday. He added that Tehran is nevertheless“more determined than ever to achieve a just and balanced deal.” The US has also accused Iran of supporting and directing the Houthi fighters in Yemen. Trump launched a massive strike campaign against the militants in March with a declared goal of protecting shipping in the Red Sea. Earlier on Thursday, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth warned Iran that it would face consequences of its actions at a time and place of Washington’s choosing while blaming it for facilitating the Houthis’ actions. Tehran has denied the accusations.",

    "article_text": "Neither democracy nor a free press exists in modern European NATO nations, journalist and ‘Going Underground’ host Afshin Rattansi has told RT. In an interview on Thursday he was asked to comment on the deportation of RT correspondent Chay Bowes from Romania. The journalist was detained upon arrival in Bucharest as he was on his way to cover the Romanian presidential election. The upcoming vote is a re-run, since last year’s election was controversially annulled following a shock win by far-right NATO skeptic Calin Georgescu, who ran as an independent candidate. Bowes’ arrest and deportation highlight“the totalitarianism of Western Europe,”Rattansi said. “The fact is: there is no democracy in these NATO nations because there is no free press. There is no free journalism,”he added. The attacks on the press in Western Europe are aimed at controlling voters’ access to information, Rattansi said. “The importance of the European Union and Britain in clamping down on journalism is to prevent their publics from understanding the issues so they can’t cast a vote with an informed opinion,”he said. On the other hand, media companies such as the BBC and Sky News are allowed in Russia, the journalist added. “They want to detain people like Chay Bowes, who reports for RT, has a show on RT. They want to detain him because they want to stop free press,”Rattansi said.",

    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has confirmed that Mike Waltz will leave his position as national security adviser. The president said on Thursday that he would nominate Waltz as the next American envoy to the UN, while Secretary of State Marco Rubio will take over his duties“in the interim.” “I am pleased to announce that I will be nominating Mike Waltz to be the next United States Ambassador to the United Nations,”Trump said in a post on Truth Social on Thursday as he praised Waltz’s record as an army veteran, a member of Congress, and national security adviser. The president did not elaborate on whether Waltz had already left his post or would do so in the near future. Instead, he said that Rubio would temporarily fill the position“while continuing his strong leadership at the State Department.”He did not name any potential picks to replace Waltz on a permanent basis. Earlier on Thursday, Fox News reported that Waltz had been fired earlier the same day. The broadcaster did not name the reasons for his dismissal but pointed to the role he had played in the so-called ‘Signalgate’ scandal in March. An editor from The Atlantic magazine had gained access to an internal chat involving senior Trump administration members discussing a strike against Yemeni Houthi militants, prompting the media outlet to run a story about it. The leak was then attributed to Waltz, who mistakenly saved the contact of the journalist under an incorrect name and invited him to the chat. The official later admitted his mistake in an interview with Fox and said he took“full responsibility”for it. Later on Thursday, Axios reported, citing White House sources, that Waltz had not left his position yet, but is expected to do so in the near future. Politico identified Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff as a“leading pick”to replace Waltz. CNN journalist Alayna Treene claimed, citing her sources close to Witkoff, that he is not interested in taking the position and his team does not expect him to be chosen by Trump.",

    "article_text": "Israeli firefighters continue to battle wildfires that have been raging near Jerusalem for two days. Emergency services have described them as some of the“largest ever”in the country’s history. The fires broke out on Wednesday along the main highway connecting Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, spreading quickly due to the heat and strong winds. The key highway and several other roads in the area were shut down, with people in at least ten communities forced to evacuate from what witnesses described as“walls of flame.” More than 160 firefighting teams and 12 aircraft were deployed to contain the wildfires. On Wednesday evening, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that“we are now in a national emergency, not just a local one,”adding that“defending Jerusalem”was a priority. Firefighters worked through the night, unblocking the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway and allowing residents in several settlements to return to their homes on Thursday. However, the fire service acknowledged in a statement that“at this stage we still have not gained control”of the conflagration. According to the local media, at least 12 civilians and 17 firefighters, including two pregnant women, have been hospitalized due to smoke inhalation and burns. ⚡️🔥 Israeli media says: Today's fires are the largest in \"Israel's history.\"The occupation forces evacuated five settlements and closed the highway between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.

Canada Park, outside the city of Modi’in, has been the most affected, according to the forestry organization Jewish National Fund. It’s weird how@BBCNewsis normally obsessed with Israel but has nothing on its news site about the fires devastating the Jerusalem area. It is believed that at least some of the fires are the work of arsonists.pic.twitter.com/0TkuKvJv13 Netanyahu also announced that 18 people had been arrested on suspicion of arson in connection with the fires. However, police sources told the local media that only three detentions had actually been made and that the suspects had been trying to start fires not near Jerusalem but elsewhere. 🟥 𝐈𝐃𝐅 𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐜𝐞𝐬 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐨𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐨 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐛𝐚𝐭 𝐨𝐧𝐠𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐟𝐢𝐫𝐞𝐬 𝐢𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐉𝐞𝐫𝐮𝐬𝐚𝐥𝐞𝐦 𝐇𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐬 𝐚𝐫𝐞𝐚♦️ Firefighting teams from the Air Force, including fire trucks, were dispatched to the fire zones.♦️ Yasur (CH-53) helicopter of…pic.twitter.com/HBW5ToJr2A The wildfires have prompted the Israeli authorities to reduce the scale of Independence Day celebrations, marked on April 30 and May 1.

    "title": "RT journalist detained in Romania",
    "article_text": "RT journalist Chay Bowes has been detained by the Romanian authorities upon arrival in Bucharest on Thursday, where he had traveled to cover the country’s upcoming presidential election. According to the Irish reporter, police boarded the plane immediately after landing and were specifically looking for him.“They only wanted me. Came onto the plane, asked who is Chay Bowes, and six of them took me from the plane,”he said. The officers reportedly told Bowes that their“superiors”wanted to interview him and questioned him about the purpose of his visit to Romania. Following the brief detention, Bowes – who is an EU citizen – was deported from Romania. According to his wife, he was put on a plane bound for Istanbul. Bowes has worked with RT since 2023. Prior to that, he co-founded the Irish investigative journalism website The Ditch in 2021 and helped to run it until his resignation in 2022. He previously helped expose a leak of sensitive documents by then-Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar. The story sparked an uproar and led to a criminal investigation against Varadkar that was later dropped. The presidential election in Romania is scheduled to take place over two rounds, on May 4 and May 18. The dates were set in January after Romania’s Constitutional Court annulled the results of the initial vote held in November 2024. The original first round had been won by Calin Georgescu, a vocal NATO critic and opponent of supplying weapons to Ukraine. Running as an independent candidate, Georgescu secured 23% of the vote. However, the court invalidated the outcome, citing alleged“irregularities”in his campaign and intelligence reports claiming Russian interference – allegations that Moscow denied. It later emerged that a TikTok influencer campaign had been paid for, not by the Kremlin, but by the pro-EU Romanian National Liberal Party (PNL), which has governed the country for much of the last three decades. Its most prominent member, Nicolae Ciuca, was a losing candidate in the November election.",

    "title": "Trump fires Mike Waltz – Fox",
    "article_text": "US National Security Adviser Mike Waltz has been fired, Fox News reported on Thursday, citing its sources. The White House has not made any public comments on the issue. Waltz was among the National Security Council’s“other staffers,”who got caught in the latest“purge,”the broadcaster said, adding that his deputy, Alex Wong, had been fired as well. The media outlet did not name the exact reason for the move but pointed to the criticism the national security adviser faced over his role in the so-called ‘Signalgate’ scandal in March. At the time, The Atlantic reported it had accessed an internal chat involving members of US President Donald Trump’s administration, who were discussing attacks on Yemen’s Houthi militants. The leak was then attributed to Waltz, who mistakenly saved the contact of the magazine’s editor, Jeffrey Goldberg, under an incorrect name and then sent him an invite. The national security adviser later admitted his mistake in an interview with Fox News.“I take full responsibility. I built the group. … It's embarrassing. We're going to get to the bottom of it,”he said at that time. Later on Thursday, Axios reported that Waltz had not left his position yet, but is expected to do so in the near future. Waltz had not been removed as of Thursday morning, a White House official told the media outlet, although a Trump adviser and another official said that his departure is expected soon.​ When asked about Waltz’ potential dismissal earlier this week, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News that“we are not going to respond to reporting from anonymous sources.”Trump himself told journalists in early April that certain National Security Council members had been fired following the incident but maintained that there were few of them and that he still trusted the team. Politico identified Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff as a“leading pick”to replace Waltz. The official has been instrumental in Washington’s efforts to facilitate the peace process between Russia and Ukraine. He has visited Moscow several times lately, including for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. CNN journalist Alayna Treene claimed, citing her sources close to Witkoff, that the special envoy was not interested in taking over as national security advisor and that his team does not expect him to ultimately be picked by Trump for the role. Last month, the media outlet also reported that US Vice President J.D. Vance and other senior officials suggested that Trump fire Waltz over the ‘Signalgate’ scandal. Back then, the president reportedly agreed that Waltz had“messed up,”but decided not to dismiss him. Trump had previously downplayed the controversy as a“witch hunt”and questioned the reliability of Signal. He also maintained that no classified information was compromised because of the leak.",

    "title": "WATCH Venezuela raise world’s largest Victory Banner to honor USSR’s defeat of Nazi Germany",
    "article_text": "The Venezuelan authorities have raised a giant replica of the Banner of Victory in the capital, Caracas to commemorate the defeat of Nazi Germany by the Soviet Union. Red Army troops hoisted the flag of the USSR atop the Reichstag building in Berlin on May 1, 1945. The banner, measuring 25 by 11 meters – the largest ever displayed outside Russia – was hoisted in the Venezuelan capital on April 30. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro declared the date the ‘Day of the Victory of Mankind over Fascism’. On April 30, 1945, Red Army soldiers broke into the Reichstag through breaches in the walls and captured the building. The legendary Red Banner No. 5, which later became the famed Victory Banner, was raised on top of the Reichstag dome by soldiers from the 756th Rifle Regiment – Sergeant Mikhail Egorov and Junior Sergeant Meliton Kantariya. “In 1945, on a day like today, the world heard on the radio and learned from telegraphic messages – there were no social networks then, no satellites – that the Red Army of the Soviet Union had entered Berlin, defeated Hitler, and planted the banner of the Soviet Union over the Reichstag,”Maduro said. The USSR lost an estimated 26.6 million lives during World War II. Moscow will celebrate the anniversary of victory over Nazi Germany and hold its annual Victory Day parade on Red Square on May 9. Публикация от Embajada de Venezuela en Rusia (@embaverusia) In April, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Moscow expects the Venezuelan leader to visit Russia on May 9 to take part in the 80th anniversary celebrations. “The raising of the largest Victory Banner outside Russia here in Caracas symbolizes the deep bond between our peoples, our shared commitment to truth, freedom, and peace,”Russian Ambassador to Venezuela Sergey Melik-Bagdasarov said during the flag-raising ceremony.",

    "title": "US rejected Ukraine’s security guarantee demands – NYT",
    "article_text": "The US has rejected Ukraine’s request for security guarantees as part of a newly signed mineral resources agreement, the New York Times reported on Wednesday, citing sources familiar with the talks. The nine-page deal, signed the same day after months of negotiations and published on Thursday by the Ukrainian government, gives Washington preferential access to Ukraine’s mineral projects, including rare-earth metals. It also establishes a joint investment fund to support Ukraine’s post-conflict reconstruction. Despite its scope, the final agreement contains no formal pledge of future US military support, a key demand from Ukraine during negotiations. Instead, it vaguely mentions a“long-term strategic alignment”and promises US backing for Ukraine’s“security, prosperity, reconstruction, and integration into global economic frameworks.”One source told the NYT that the US dismissed the idea of providing Kiev with explicit security guarantees early in the talks. State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce defended the agreement, suggesting that US involvement alone offers implicit protection. “When America is your friend and your partner, your nation is going to be better off. And there is a security component just in our presence,”she told Fox Business. Analysts told the NYT that the deal could help secure US President Donald Trump’s continued interest in Ukraine now that he is directly invested, and will potentially open the door to further discussions on military aid and a ceasefire with Russia. Still, critics argued that without binding guarantees, the deal’s impact may be limited if the conflict continues. Ukraine’s parliament is expected to ratify the agreement within two weeks. The US has framed the deal as a way for Ukraine to repay past military aid – estimated at $350 billion by Trump, though Kiev claims the figure is closer to $100 billion and that the support was unconditional. The debt repayment clause, however, was dropped from the final text. After signing, Trump said the US could“in theory”recover“much more”than $350 billion through the deal. Commenting on the deal, deputy head of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev said the US has essentially“forced the Kiev regime to pay for American aid with minerals,”warning that all future military supplies will have to be paid“with the national wealth of a vanishing country.”",

    "title": "Here’s what China stands to lose in the India-Pakistan crisis",
    "article_text": "As tensions flare once again between India and Pakistan following a deadly attack in Kashmir last week, China is trying to balance between the two sides. It is being squeezed between strong commitments toward Islamabad and interest in developing economic cooperation and reviving relations with New Delhi. In response to the bloodshed and the rapid escalation of tensions in the region, Beijing called on India and Pakistan to exercise restraint, resolve the conflict peacefully, and work jointly for regional peace and stability. Such rhetoric belongs to China’s usual diplomatic repertoire, reflecting an emphasis on predictability and stability, enabling Beijing to promote its economic interests and continue conducting business wherever possible. Quite often, rhetoric does not translate into concrete actions as Beijing remains committed to a non-alignment policy and does not want to be dragged into conflicts between third parties. Vocalizing principles of peaceful coexistence, China hesitates to become an active security and military player at the international level. Indeed, an active role brings not only benefits but also considerable risks. China would run the risk of losing the image of a peaceful power with an aversion to hegemony, power politics, and traditional great power competition. At the same time, Chinese neutrality often brings positive implications for one of the conflicting sides. One can hardly overlook that Islamabad, rather than New Delhi, benefits more from China’s neutrality in the current situation. Although China strongly condemned the attack in Pahalgam, it offered no assistance to India and did not accept New Delhi’s interpretation of the events. Instead of embracing the allegations linking Pakistan with the attack, Beijing supported the Pakistani government’s call for a swift and fair investigation. Talking to his Pakistani counterpart on April 27, Foreign Minister Wang Yi highlighted that China understood the legitimate security concerns of its ‘ironclad friends’ in Islamabad, supporting Pakistan in safeguarding sovereignty and security. Wang’s comments indicate that Beijing remains very serious about the commitments toward Islamabad and reserved in relation to India. This position has historical and geopolitical reasons. India and Pakistan have had serious disagreements since the partition of India in 1947. The two sides have been engaged in several rounds of military confrontation since then. Territorial claims are one of the sources of hostility. Kashmir has been divided between India, Pakistan and China, which provokes a certain frustration in each of the three capitals. No less importantly, Pakistan ceded some territories to China in 1963, which has not been recognized by India. While the agreement became at the time an important moment in deepening ties between Islamabad and Beijing, it only widened the gap between New Delhi and Beijing. Through this prism, China can hardly be accepted by the Indian side as an intermediary and neutral actor in the present conflict. Beijing’s involvement in the problem is too strong, whether China realizes it or not. China’s position in the ‘triangle’ is complicated by the fact that Pakistan has gradually turned into Beijing’s closest strategic partner. The scope of bilateral cooperation is wide and goes far beyond what is typical of the relationship between China on the one hand and India and other regional players on the other hand. When Xi Jinping launched the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2013, the Sino-Pakistani economic corridor (CPEC) became one of the flagship projects of the Chinese global initiative. It enabled Beijing to get direct access to the Arabian Sea via Gwadar Port and strengthen its position in that strategic area. The Sino-Pakistani cooperation within the CPEC was perceived very negatively in India, even more so because some projects were implemented in the disputed territories in Kashmir. New Delhi is concerned by close defense and military relations between Islamabad and Beijing, as China has become the country’s largest arms supplier and the two sides agreed on joint training, military technology transfers, and intelligence sharing. Geopolitical and geoeconomic motives drive China’s stake in Pakistan. The partnership with Islamabad helps Beijing to exert pressure on New Delhi and counterweight India’s growing regional ambitions. At the same time, a strong and stable India does not necessarily contradict China’s interests. Despite mistrust and disagreements, India is one of China’s top trading partners. India’s domestic market creates huge opportunities for Chinese exporters, and the presence of Chinese investors in the country has been strong for a long time. Paradoxically, the conflict between India and Pakistan comes at a moment when Sino-Indian relations have been warming. The two countries have recently agreed on de-escalating border tensions and resuming joint border patrols and direct flights. The conflict in Kashmir could reverse this trend. Although the Sino-Indian relations have fluctuated between cautious cooperation and military clashes, China might be receptive to India’s concerns in the ongoing conflict for several reasons. New Delhi is actively dealing with the threat posed by terrorism and Islamist groupings. Beijing also feels threatened by terrorism and Islamist-linked separatism in Xinjiang. Similarly, India’s bid for stabilization of and control over Kashmir is similar to Beijing’s approach to Xinjiang and other border regions. That is why both China and India are interested in countering actors who challenge the central authorities in Beijing and New Delhi, respectively. Moreover, China has already experienced direct attacks on its citizens in Pakistan, during which dozens of them were killed. Therefore, siding with the Pakistani government could challenge Beijing’s position as a staunch fighter against extremism and terrorism. China has a vested interest in ensuring that the region does not become a hotbed of extremism or great power rivalry. Instability in Kashmir or Pakistan’s tribal regions poses a direct threat to China’s internal stability and its western frontier. A war between India and Pakistan would cause serious damage to China as it would endanger the CPEC, destabilize Xinjiang, and potentially draw in other global actors, undermining Beijing’s long-term regional ambitions. At the same time, the current crisis creates an opportunity for Beijing and Washington to engage with each other constructively to help resolve the situation, as both India and Pakistan are traditionally important partners of the US. While China and the US have already adopted the same political stance, the chance to actively align on this matter and take active steps has not been used yet.",

    "title": "US-Ukraine deal ‘important step to end war’ – Rubio",
    "article_text": "The natural resource deal signed between Washington and Kiev is an“important step”toward ending the Ukraine conflict, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has claimed. The long-awaited agreement, which allows Washington to tap into Ukraine’s extensive mineral reserves in return for assistance with the country’s economic recovery, was signed on Wednesday. Notably, the document does not include any provisions for the US to offer security guarantees to Ukraine, despite this being“one of its initial goals,”as reported by Reuters. The New York Times indicated that the concept of security guarantees was dismissed by the US“early in the process.” In an X post on Thursday, Rubio thanked US President’s Donald Trump leadership, under which the deal was signed. Rubio called it“a milestone in our shared prosperity and an important step in ending this war.” Thanks to@POTUS's leadership, today the U.S. and Ukraine signed the Reconstruction Investment Fund Agreement—a milestone in our shared prosperity and an important step in ending this war. Negotiations for the agreement stretched on for several months, although both parties intended to finalize it during Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky’s visit to the White House in late February. The televised meeting led to a tense confrontation during which Trump accused the Ukrainian leader of ingratitude and“gambling with World War III.” This comes as Washington is in talks with Moscow over a possible peace deal that would end the Ukraine conflict. Multiple media sources indicate that the agreement put forward by Washington entails the US recognizing Russia’s sovereignty over Crimea. Additionally, the proposal reportedly includes a“freezing”of the conflict along the existing front line and an acknowledgment of Moscow’s control over significant portions of four former Ukrainian regions that voted to join Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a halt to all military operations against Ukrainian forces from midnight on May 7 until midnight on May 10, stating that this is being done for“humanitarian reasons.”Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov pointed out that Russia considers the ceasefire“the start of direct negotiations with Kiev without preconditions.” Zelensky branded Moscow’s three-day truce declaration a“manipulation attempt,”saying he wanted an immediate 30-day ceasefire instead. According to Lavrov,“a [30-day] ceasefire in this situation is considered a precondition that will be used to further support the Kiev regime and strengthen its military capabilities.”",

    "title": "Pentagon chief threatens Iran amid Houthi attacks",
    "article_text": "US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has blamed Iran for arming Houthi fighters in Yemen, warning that Tehran will face consequences at the time and place of Washington’s choosing. US President Donald Trump launched a large-scale air and naval strike campaign against the Houthis in March with a declared goal of protecting shipping in the Red Sea. The group, which Washington describes as“Iran-backed,”had been targeting commercial vessels off Yemen’s coast as part of its strategy of putting pressure on Israel over its military operation in Gaza. Hegseth addressed Tehran in a message on X on Thursday, saying:“We see your lethal support to the Houthis. We know exactly what you are doing.” “You know very well what the US military is capable of — and you were warned. You will pay the consequence at the time and place of our choosing,”he wrote. The Pentagon chief also shared a screenshot of a post published by Trump on his Truth Social platform in mid-March, in which he insisted that Iran is“dictating every move”the Houthis make as well as supplying them with weapons, funds and intelligence.“Every shot fired by the Houthis will be looked upon, from this point forward, as being a shot fired from the weapons and leadership of Iran,”the US president wrote back then. Tehran has previously categorically denied Washington’s claims of it directing the actions of the Yemeni group. “Ansar Allah (the Houthis), as the representative of the Yemenis, makes its own strategic decisions, and Iran has no role in setting the national or operational policies of any movement in the resistance front,”Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Commander Hossein Salami said, following the launch of the US bombing campaign. The latest round of American strikes on Yemen took place on Tuesday and for the first time saw British aircraft joining the raids. According to the Royal Air Force, the attacks targeted Houthi drone-manufacturing facilities south of the country's capital, Sanaa. On Monday, the US Navy said that its F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet had been lost after it fell overboard from the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier stationed in the Red Sea. According to multiple media reports, the incident happened when the vessel was maneuvering to evade a missile attack from Yemen. Also on Monday, Houthi-linked broadcaster Al Masirah reported that a US strike hit a migrant detention center in Sanaa, killing at least 68 African refugees and injuring dozens more. A US defense official said the Pentagon was aware of claims about civilian casualties. During his phone call with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in March, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov“emphasized the need for an immediate cessation of the use of force and the importance for all parties to engage in political dialogue aimed at finding a solution that excludes further bloodshed,”according to the readout by Moscow.",

    "title": "US-Ukraine resources deal: What we know so far",
    "article_text": "The US and Ukraine have signed a natural resources deal that gives Washington access to the country’s vast mineral deposits in exchange for help in Ukraine’s economic recovery. Hardball diplomacy over the deal went on for months and became a major point of contention in relations between Washington and Kiev. Here’s what we know about the outlines of the deal. The agreement establishes a joint US-Ukraine reconstruction investment fund to attract investment in the Ukrainian economy, particularly with regard to resource exploration projects. According to Ukrainian Deputy Economy Minister Taras Kachka, the US will be given preferential access to investments in the extraction of rare-earth minerals. However, Ukrainian Economy Minister Yulia Sviridenko said the fund would operate as an“equal partnership,”with neither side having a dominant vote. Ukraine will retain“full control over the resources”– including the subsoil – and will continue to determine the conditions and locations of extraction. The deal also does not transfer any state-owned companies into private hands. Ukraine will contribute 50% of new rents for new licenses for new extraction to the fund, with the money inside to be invested exclusively in Ukraine. For the first ten years, profits will not be distributed, but will be fully reinvested in the Ukrainian economy, according to the Ministry of Economy. Neither contributions nor profits are taxable. Conspicuously absent from the deal, however, is any mention of the US providing Ukraine with security guarantees, although this was“one of its initial goals,”as described by Reuters. According to the New York Times, the idea of security guarantees was rejected by the US“early in the process.” Nevertheless, US State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce insisted that the deal will strengthen the country’s security:“When America is your friend and your partner, your nation is going to be better off. And there is a security component just in our presence.” The resource deal“focuses on future, not past, US military assistance,”the Ukrainian Economy Ministry has said, adding that revenues from already active projects are not included in the joint investment fund. According to Sviridenko, the agreement“includes no provisions regarding any Ukrainian debt obligations to the United States.” The US previously portrayed the deal as a way for Ukraine to pay back past military assistance, which the administration of US President Donald Trump estimated at $350 billion. Ukraine has insisted that the past aid was provided unconditionally, while estimating it at $90 billion. Following the signing of the deal, Trump suggested that the US could“in theory”get much more than $350 billion out of the deal. US Republican Senator Lindsey Graham described the deal as“tremendously beneficial to the American economy,”adding that it will improve ties between Washington and Kiev. The New York Times suggested that the“deal will have little significance”if Russia and Ukraine fail to reach a sustainable ceasefire. Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said the US has essentially forced Ukraine to pay for American aid with minerals. Negotiations over the agreement dragged on for months, though the sides had planned to sign it in late February during Vladimir Zelensky’s visit to the White House. However, Zelensky’s televised meeting with Trump resulted in a heated exchange, with the US president accusing the Ukrainian leader of ingratitude and“gambling with World War III.”Since then, the US has on several occasions criticized Ukraine for making slow progress on the deal, with Trump at one point demanding that Kiev sign it“immediately.”",

    "article_text": "Elon Musk has branded the Wall Street Journal a“discredit to journalism,”categorically denying the outlet’s claim that Tesla’s board wants to replace him as the CEO of the electric car company. The WSJ claimed, citing anonymous sources, that about a month ago Tesla’s board reached out to a number of executive search firms to work on a formal process for finding a new CEO. The directors“got serious”after Tesla’s stock plunged and investors got“irritated”by Musk’s focus on his job as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Tesla Chair Robyn Denholm issued a statement in which she called the report“absolutely false.” “The CEO of Tesla is Elon Musk and the board is highly confident in his ability to continue executing on the exciting growth plan ahead,”Denholm stressed. Musk reacted to the report on his X platform on Thursday, insisting that“it is an extremely bad breach of ethics that the Wall Street Journal would publish a deliberately false article”and slammed the outlet for its failure to include the Tesla board’s“unequivocal denial”of claims that it is searching for a new CEO in its article. In a separate comment, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO labeled the WSJ a“discredit to journalism.” Tesla suffered a 71% drop in profits and a 9% decline in revenue for the first quarter of 2025, during which time Musk became an increasingly polarizing figure, due to his close ties to US President Donald Trump and his work as the head of the DOGE, an agency tasked with slashing government spending. Since January, dozens of Tesla-linked locations have been hit by protests, in what Musk claims is a coordinated effort bankrolled by major Democratic donors. There have also been violent attacks, including arson attempts, on the company’s dealerships, vehicles and charging stations. A week ago, Musk announced that he will scale back his government role because the“major work”to establish DOGE has now been completed. During a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Trump thanked the tech billionaire for his contribution, saying“you know you are invited to stay as long as you want... I guess he wants to get back home to his cars.”",

    "article_text": "US Senator Lindsey Graham has claimed broad Senate support for a bill that would enact“bone-crushing”new sanctions on Russia and impose steep tariffs on countries purchasing its key exports. Graham told reporters on Wednesday that his goal is to support President Donald Trump in negotiations with Russia over a potential Ukraine settlement. The US imposed extensive sanctions on Moscow since the conflict with Kiev escalated in 2022, targeting financial institutions, trade, and energy exports. While Trump has expressed a desire for mutually beneficial cooperation with Russia, he has also threatened to increase pressure on Moscow, including through sanctions, if he believes it is not negotiating in good faith over Ukraine. Russia has consistently criticized Western sanctions, calling them illegal, and maintained that they have failed to inflict lasting economic damage. Moscow has also expressed a willingness to resolve the conflict and announced a unilateral three-day ceasefire during Victory Day celebnrations. Kiev, however, rebuked the offer, instead demanding an immediate unconditional 30-day truce. “The goal is to help the president… He talked about being frustrated,”Graham told reporters, as cited by Bloomberg. In a post on Truth Social earlier this week, Trump suggested that Russian President Vladimir Putin might not want to stop the war, is“just tapping me along”and may need to be“dealt with differently, through banking or secondary sanctions.” According to Bloomberg, Graham’s bill includes a ban on US citizens purchasing Russian sovereign debt and a 500% tariff on imports from countries that buy Russian oil, petroleum products, natural gas, and uranium. Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, claimed he has secured the commitment of 72 Senators for his bill, from both parties, and enough support in the House of Representatives to bring it to the floor. “I want a negotiated end to the war, honorably and just. I think Trump’s the best person to achieve that goal, but these sanctions represent the Senate’s view that we see the primary bad guy being Russia,”the senator stated, calling the bill“a tool in President Trump’s toolbox.” “When President Trump believes that we’ve reached an impasse, then watch for action,”Graham stated, warning that themeasures, if enacted, would“crush”the Russian economy. The White House did not respond to a Bloomberg request for comment on Graham’s claims. The senator, a veteran foreign policy hawk, has previously called the killing of Russians by Ukrainian troops“the best money”the US had ever spent.",

    "article_text": "The minerals deal granting the US access to Ukraine’s natural resources benefits both nations, State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said on Thursday. Speaking to Fox Business, she described the agreement as“perfect”because it was crafted by President Donald Trump, citing his business experience. Washington and Kiev signed the long-anticipated agreement on Wednesday. While the full text has not been made public, the available details suggest that it allocates part of the revenues from resource development to a joint US-Ukraine investment fund, while Kiev retains full ownership of the actual resources. Kiev hopes the deal will secure continued military and financial support from Washington, while the US gains access to Ukraine’s vast mineral wealth, particularly rare-earth elements critical for high-tech industries. “A lot of people have wanted this to happen. It benefits both countries immensely… and it’s not a surprise because it’s President Donald Trump, it is the perfect deal,”Bruce said. She did not provide further details on the agreement but described it as“an investment in Ukraine.” “This is about a long-term durable dynamic regarding an economic partnership with that nation, which is necessary in general,”she said. Bruce added that a US presence in Ukraine would also enhance the country’s security. “When America is your friend and America is your partner, your nation is going to be better off, your citizens are going to be better off, and there is a security component just in our presence,”she stated. Bruce stressed that the deal is“separate”from the ongoing conflict and US-Russia peace negotiations, but said work on the talks is progressing, with Moscow and Kiev expected to submit proposals“in a few days.” Negotiations on the minerals deal have been underway since the early days of Trump’s return to office, running parallel to broader peace efforts. The Trump administration has insisted that thedealshould compensate the US for previous aid to Ukraine, despite Kiev’s claims that the assistance was given unconditionally.",

    "title": "Ukraine willing to ‘de facto give up’ land to Russia – Trump envoy",
    "article_text": "Kiev has agreed to acknowledge Russia’s control over Crimea and four other regions – without formally recognizing Moscow’s sovereignty over them – according to US President Donald Trump’s special envoy, Keith Kellogg. In an interview on Wednesday, Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum asked Kellogg whether the US could accept Moscow’s demand that Ukraine renounce claims to territories it considers to be under Russian occupation. “Partially, yes,”Kellogg replied.“Look, the Ukrainians, Martha, have already said – they’re willing to give up the land… not de jure – forever – but de facto because the Russians actually occupied it. They’ve agreed to that,”he said.“They told me that last week.” Kellogg added that Ukraine wants a ceasefire that would mean“you sit on the ground that you currently hold.” The envoy said he met with Ukrainian officials in London on April 23 and that they had agreed to“22 concrete terms”presented by the US, including a 30-day comprehensive ceasefire. He urged Moscow to“pick up on”the proposal. Russia, however, has maintained that a full ceasefire would require Ukraine to halt its mobilization campaign and stop accepting military aid from abroad. President Vladimir Putin has also demanded that Kiev withdraw from the Russian territories it still claims. Moscow has accused Ukraine of repeatedly violating a 30-day ‘energy truce’ brokered by Trump in March, as well as last month’s 30-hour Easter truce. Crimea voted to secede from Ukraine and join Russia shortly after the 2014 US-backed coup in Kiev. The Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk, along with the regions of Kherson and Zaporozhye, followed suit after referendums in 2022. The agreement proposed by Washington reportedly includes US recognition of Russian sovereignty over Crimea, freezing the conflict along the current front lines, and acknowledging Moscow’s control over large parts of the four other former Ukrainian regions. The deal would also reportedly block Ukraine from joining NATO and initiate a phased removal of the sanctions on Russia.",

    "title": "Tucker Carlson accuses Ukrainians of trying to kill Trump",
    "article_text": "Ukraine was involved in a plot to assassinate US President Donald Trump during his 2024 reelection campaign, American journalist Tucker Carlson has claimed. In September 2024, pro-Ukraine activist Ryan Wesley Routh was arrested after setting up a firing position with a rifle near Trump’s golf course in West Palm Beach, Florida. He was spotted by Secret Service agents before he could open fire and was detained following a brief manhunt. “It’s very obvious that the Ukrainians were involved in the attempted assassination on the golf course in Florida,”Carlson said on the Megyn Kelly Show on Tuesday. “That guy definitely had some contact with Ukraine, for sure,”Kelly replied.“He was in Ukraine!”Carlson stressed. Kelly said Routh was“asking them”for heavy weaponry, including rocket-propelled grenades. Carlson agreed and suggested that Kiev may have been involved in other assassination plots. “I know for a fact there were others who were a target of assassination attempts by the Ukrainian government,”he claimed, without providing details. According to court documents from the Southern District of Florida, Routh – a convicted felon – attempted unsuccessfully to enlist in the Ukrainian army in 2022. Despite this, he allegedly worked to recruit foreign volunteers for the Ukrainian military. Prosecutors allege that Routh attempted to purchase either a rocket-propelled grenade launcher or a Stinger man-portable air-defense missile from a Ukrainian associate.“I need equipment so that Trump don’t [sic] get elected,”he wrote in one of the encrypted messages cited in the case. Both weapons systems have seen extensive use in the Ukraine conflict.“One missing would not be noticed,”Routh reportedly said in another message. In 2022, Routh took part in a rally in Kiev in support of Ukraine’s Azov military unit, whose fighters were under siege by Russian forces in Mariupol at the time. The unit – which includes members with neo-Nazi and ultranationalist backgrounds – later stated that Routh“has never had any connection to Azov.” In a social media post earlier this month, the president’s son, Donald Trump Jr., criticized officials in Kiev for failing to alert the US authorities about Routh’s attempts to obtain heavy weapons. The Florida incident came after a separate assassination attempt in July 2024, when a gunman opened fire during a Trump campaign rally in Pennsylvania. Trump was escorted from the stage after a bullet grazed his ear. One spectator was killed and several others were wounded. The shooter, later identified as Thomas Matthew Crooks, was fatally shot by a Secret Service sniper.",

    "title": "Celebrity travel files: Actor Edwin Goh's pro tips on thrift shopping and things to do in Sydney",
    "article_text": "Entertainment Entertainment Style & Beauty Entertainment Women Women Women Women Wellness Wellness Wellness Wellness Singapore Obsessions Trending People Obsessions Style & Beauty Obsessions Obsessions Dining Travel Experiences Dining Style & Beauty Experiences Experiences Obsessions Style & Beauty Style & Beauty The Fighting Spiders alum also shares his thrifting tips for newbies and how to pack for Sydney’s finicky weather. (Photo: Instagram/edwininja) This audio is generated by an AI tool. Actor, crocheter and creatorEdwin Goh may have moved back to Singaporefrom Sydney withhis fiancee, actress Rachel Wan,butmemories of his time there are still fresh in his mind. What did Goh love most about the Australian city? “I love how people are carefree and more laidback. I love the amount of accessible nature, from mountainous hikes and coastal walks to preserved aquatic areas free to snorkel in with a huge range of biodiversity.” Even the changing of seasons sparks joy. “The transition of seasons is extremely magical, seeing leaves starting to grow, flowers blooming, and then the same leaves turning red and falling. It has allowed me to shift internally as I move along the year,” Goh explained. Sydney is a popular Australian destination for Singaporeans, but it's alsoknown for its finicky climate, which can lead to significant temperature and weather changes within a day. To ensure that you’re not caught off guard when you’re out sightseeing, Goh advised bringing along a light outwear. “As the winds can be quite overwhelming compared to Singapore, any knit with merino wool is great as it is anti-microbial, which allows you to wear it multiple days without odour. It’s also great if you’re aiming to pack light.” A post shared by Hi my name is Edwin (@edwininja) Winter aside, Goh shared that he usually dressed in a tank top as an innerwear with one of his crochet pieces layered on top. “Usually that does the job for spring, summer and autumn.” And as the nights can feel chilly for Singaporeans who aren’t adapted to the cold, he advised bringing an extra layer especially if you’re staying out till late to help you stay nice and warm. Goh also shared that after moving to Sydney, he became a bit more diligent with his grooming routine. “The climate is a lot drier, so I’ve had to amp up my hydration. These days, I do toner, moisturiser and a night cream – when I’m not lazy, in my routine. But that’s not all. Goh had to step up his sun protection too. “The UV is no joke – even on cloudy days, it’s strong. Sunscreen is a daily essential now, even in winter,” he added. Consider yourself warned for your next trip. But if you’re looking to try an Australian-made sunscreen, Goh recommended picking up one from Cancer Council. The brand offers a wide range of sunscreens for daily use, sporting activities and even lip balms – all with SPF50+. Something that many might not realise is that Sydney has a huge thrifting culture as well. In fact, Goh shared that it’s something he picked up during his time in the city. “Rachel and I both love a good thrift run. Hunting for pre-loved items that suit me has become a fun thing and changed my perspective on wearing ‘used items’.” A post shared by Hi my name is Edwin (@edwininja) Items you can look for include oversized blazers, classic denim, utility jackets and vintage knits. “You’ll also see a lot of cool 90s sportswear (think Adidas or Nike windbreakers) and accessories like leather belts, boots and even crochet pieces–which always excites me,” said Goh. A post shared by vinniesshopsnsw (@vinniesshopsnsw) If you’re keen to do a little thrifting while on holiday in Sydney, Goh shared that the biggest stores that offer budget-friendly finds are Salvos (run by the Salvation Army), Savers and Vinnies. A post shared by SWOP (@_swop) But his personal go-tos wereSWOPfor its well curated selection of pre-loved designer clothes, shoes and bags,Uturnfor a wide array of outfits from classics to trendy with nine outlets in Sydney, and the Red Cross stores for its mix of affordable and high-end pieces. And if it’s your first time thrifting, Goh offered these tips: Regardless if you’re a first-timer or repeat visitor to Sydney, Goh’s must-do and must-see recommendation would be taking the ferry to Circular Quay during sunset. “You’ll get the most beautiful view of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Sydney Opera House.” And when it comes to food,Goh’s Asian roots remain front and centre. A post shared by Ice Kirin Bar - 𝐀𝐬𝐢𝐚𝐧-𝐢𝐧𝐬𝐩𝐢𝐫𝐞𝐝/𝐓𝐞𝐚 𝐠𝐞𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐨 specialist (@icekirinbar_aus) In fact, the actor’s top picks includeIce Kirin Bar, an Asian-inspired and tea-infused gelato ice cream place (“Get the black sesame ice cream paired with a crispy pineapple bun!”), andGimme One Fried Skewer, a Chinese restaurant that specialises in mala skewers. A post shared by La Favola Iᴛᴀʟɪᴀɴ Rᴇsᴛᴀᴜʀᴀɴᴛ (@favola.sydney) If you’re looking for something different, Goh suggests going for a meal atRuth Tate Sydney. Every Friday and Saturday evening, this fashion store turns into an extended dining space for Italian restaurant,La Favola(known for its freshly made pasta). Clothes store by day, Italian restaurant by night. This concept began in 2024 when fashion designer and founder, Ruth Tate, decided to collab with her next-door neighbour and La Favola owner, Fabio Stefanelli, to combat rising costs. “It creates for an interesting atmosphere to dine in,” shared Goh. What makes it even more fun is checking out the clothes on display and revisiting the store the next morning to shop. And of course, no visit to Sydney would be complete without indulging in a cup of perfectly brewed coffee. A post shared by The Grounds Coffee Factory (@thegroundscoffeefactory) For coffee enthusiasts who want to discover more about Sydney’s renowned coffee culture, pay a visit toThe Grounds Coffee Factoryfor its exciting coffee experiences, suggested Goh. Housed in a former railway workers’ cafeteria, it features a coffee roastery and cafe in the same space. An undeniably aesthetic spot for your socials with touches of industrial elements combined with whimsical Willy Wonka-esque vibes. Besides enjoying a cuppa or two, you can even go on an insider tour to deep dive into the art and science of coffee. Copyright© Mediacorp 2025. Mediacorp Pte Ltd. All rights reserved.

    "title": "The ‘Thunderbolts*’ Post-Credits Scene Is Marvel's Most Significant Tag in Years",
    "article_text": "This story contains spoilers forThunderbolts*, including the ending and the post-credits scene. The majority of Phase 4 and 5 Marvel movies have featured tags that ended up in a coin toss as it relates to their importance. Some, like the introduction of the X-Men universe at the end ofThe Marvels,feel like the introduction of something much larger. Others, like Harry Styles’ cameo at the end ofEternals—remember that?!—less so. But for the first time in quite a while, the post-credits sequence of a Marvel movie feels essential, thanks toThunderbolts*. After the end of the film reveals that the team—which consists of Red Guardian (David Harbour), Yelena (Florence Pugh), John Walker (Wyatt Russell), Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen), Bob (Lewis Pullman), and Bucky (Sebastian Stan)—are now calling themselves the New Avengers, the nearly three-minute long post-credits sequence jumps forward 14 months. As the team re-enters the old Stark tower in NYC, now their home base, the crew bicker over the fact that Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie, only referenced by his character name) is threatening to sue the squad over a potential copyright infringement. Amid the cross-talk, Yelena mentions an ongoing set of space anomalies that’s leading to an overall “space crisis,” due to the fact that some sort of new vessel has entered the galaxy. Once the team is able to get a visual, the camera cuts to a retro-future rocket, which is then confirmed (both visually and by the inclusion ofthe Michael Giacchino theme) to be the Fantastic Four, who have somehow found their way to the main Marvel universe. Considering the fact that we knew Marvel’s first familywill appear inAvengers: Doomsday, it’s not a shock to see the Four show up, but the circumstances of their sudden arrival are worth considering. In our esteemed opinion, there are a handful of likely reasons why they’re here, some bleaker than others. It’s possible that during their debut film, the FF discovers the Multiverse and sets out to chart it, stumbling upon the main-line Marvel universe in the process. It’s also possible they’re coming to warn Marvel’s heroes of a greater threat, whether it’s incursions, Dr. Doom’s impending plan, or something else. But it’s also possible that the team are multiversal refugees whose own universe has been destroyed, either by Galactus or Doom. Regardless of the specifics, the FF are now, quite literally, on the radar of an Avengers team (copyright infringement notwithstanding), and the stage is set for bothFantastic FourandDoomsday. After years of post-credits sequences that led nowhere, it’s nice for audiences to know they’ll get a proper answer as to what exactly is happening whenFantastic Fourreleases on July 25.",

    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. The best last-minuteMother’s Day giftsare a lifeline for wayward sons and daughters that are perpetually late on the call, or procrastinators on just putting the damncardin the mail. After all, moms—the unofficial record keepers of such things as birthdays, deadlines, and annual events that always fall on the same day but you still can't remember—shouldn't really be required to nudge you about the one day of the year dedicated to them. To help you concept a gesture of thanks and “love you” for all the mother figures in your life, plus actually get agiften route and tracking at the right pace, we've selected a short list of some of the most top-notch, quick-shipping gifts out there—includingPrimeable savesand ones that you can expedite to her doorstep. These are mostly physical tokens of appreciation, including mom-friendly robes and tech upgrades, plus a foolproofbouquet—though you'll also find a couple digital gift cards andsubscriptionsthat are pretty hard to fumble unless you don't know mom's email address (buddy, we believe in you). Here, 17 last-minute Mother's Day gifts that will save the day. Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch If she still thinks Abercrombie is that stinky mall store she used to take you to when you were a youth, just show her these pants and explain to her that there's a mall brand renaissance happening and she too can wear A&F. Chanel Chanel A fancy lady with even fancier tastes. Plus, if she ever meets our boss, Ms. Wintour, we're pretty sure she'd approve. Aēsop Aēsop Nothing says “I care” like the gift of smelling good—and for that, you can't go wrong with Aesop. Levi's Levi's A good jean jacket never goes out of style—just like her. Recess Pickleball Huckberry Help Mom show no mercy on the pickleball court with this paddle set. (The only thing she loves more than you is crushing her pickleball enemies.) Nike Nike Swooshy jackets arethelight jacket of 2025—but Mom already knew that, stylish queen that she is. Shinola Shinola Watches are getting smaller, but her love for you only grows. Sandy Liang Nordstrom We called cardigans one of the biggest spring trends of 2025. Lululemon Lululemon Perfect for taking to the dog park, hitting the beach, and strolling around the neighborhood, this crossbody from Lululemon is a no-brainer gift. Studio Nicholson SSENSE Trench coats are big in the GQ offices, and if that's not a big enough reason for mom to wear one, then we don't know what to tell ya. Dyson Dyson The ultimate gift for splitting between siblings. Apple Amazon Help her drown out all the noise with these top-tier headies. Brooklinen Brooklinen Nothing says it's “me time” like throwing on a robe and blocking out the whole world. Even if “the whole world” is you. D.S & DURGA D.S & DURGA DS & Durga is one of our favorite scent brands here atGQ,and Durga is the fragrance that catapulted them to Cool Kid status. Goldbelly Goldbelly Flowers and cookies are two ways to a mom's heart—because being her child obviously wasn't cutting it. Shark Amazon LED face masks are all the rage for one simple reason: Over time, they actually work. If your mom never splurges on anything for herself, this is a great option for making sure her skin looks as youthful as ever. Venus Et Fleur Venus Et Fleur The corner store bouquet is great and all, but these roses from Venus et Fleur literally last for at least a full year. Well friends, you really took “last-minute” to heart, didn't you? A few (and we really mean “few”) retailers might still offer some next-day or express shipping options to hopefully guarantee mom gets her gift on actual Mother's Day, which is May 10 this year. Neither them nor us can actually be 100% positive it'll arrive on time, but it's worth the try. Your best bet at this point is to buy mom a gift card. Yeah, we know it's not the most personal gift, but if it's for a retailer she really loves, it won't really matter. Besides, it's better than your buying her a so-so gift just so she has to go through the hassle of shipping it back to the warehouse or,gasp, schlepping it to an actual store. The second guaranteed hit is to buy mom asubscription box. That first shipment won't hit on May 14, but the recurring deliveries will be hit after hit (after hit).

    "title": "Does Timotheé Chalamet’s Kobe T-Shirt Mean He’s Cheating on the Knicks?",
    "article_text": "We don’t need to tell you twice thatTimotheé Chalametloves his New York Knicks. But it can’t be easy for Timmy, as a native Manhattanite and longtime basketball fan, to navigate the tension of a bicoastal romance. Chalamet’s girlfriend, Kylie Jenner, has lived in Los Angeles her whole life, and her family has a longstanding allegiance to the Los Angeles Lakers. He’s a fixture of Madison Square Garden’s Celebrity Row; she’s been known to sit courtside at the ol’ Crypto.com Arena. And Chalamet, being the famous person and documentedhoops enjoyerthat he is, has been all over these NBA playoffs as of late. Last week, the moptopped actor ventured to Detroit for Game 3 of the Knicks’ series against the Pistons, digesting New York’s hard-fought win alongside fellow superfan Ben Stiller. As a highly connectedKnicks fanwith a love of Being Outside, it’s not surprising to see Timmy pop up in the Midwest to cheer on his guys. But then, on Wednesday night in Los Angeles, there he was again, ostensibly supporting the Lakers. That raised some eyebrows. People (read, theGQoffice) debated: Is it acceptable to have such a big part of one’s identity tied to the Knickerbockers, and then turn around and sit courtside in LA wearing a Lakers shirt? Timothée Chalamet and Kylie Jenner at the Lakers-Timberwolves game in Los Angeles on Wednesday. The ensemble he wore to the Lakers’ Game 5 loss was perfectly bicoastal. The Kobe Bryant T-shirt nodded to LA, but his loose, untied Timberlands were NYC as hell. Atop it all, a pearl-festooned tweed jacket from Chanel’s womenswear line. But the outfit isn’t nearly as controversial as his two-timing fandom. Sure, he was almost certainly just there because he’s a big-name actor dating one of the city’s most prominent starlets, not because he wanted to analyze the Lakers’ defensive rotations up close. But we still had some questions about this whole ordeal, mainly the morality of treating the Knicks like a wife and the Lakers as a mistress. In light of Chalamet’s potential fan faux pas,GQstaff writers Matthew Roberson and Eileen Cartter—whopreviously debatedthe merits of Eric Adams’s Mets-Yankees hat—put their heads together to decipher exactly what’s going on here. Matthew Roberson:Usually I would say no, but in this particular case—a well-documented Knicks fan going to a basketball game in the other city where he also spends a lot of time—I think it’s fine. If Timmy had gone to Denver for Game 5 of Nuggets-Clippers, let’s say, and was wearing a Nikola Jokić jersey, I’d be looking more askance. But a Kobe shirt at a Lakers game doesn’t tell me that he’s cheating on the Knicks; it just tells me he went to a Lakers game. A Kobejersey, meanwhile, would be doing too much. Something tells me he went through these exact same machinations as well, maybe even debating whether to go with #8 or #24, before settling on the T-shirt. Eileen Cartter: Even as a low-lift Knicks fan myself, I’m inclined to agree. When in Rome! Not to mention, Timothée is very much of the Kobe generation. Despite loving the Knicks, he would probably agree that Kobe is the GOAT. That said, I’m curious about what was going through Timmy’s head when he picked out his outfit for the game. Was he at all worried about what people might think if he wore something Lakers-adjacent—and if so, did he choose the Kobe shirtbecauseit’s relatively neutral? Did he throw on the Timbs to assert that he does, in fact, know where he came from? Did he opt for a T-shirt with a grayscale graphic to better compliment his black-and-white tweed Chanel jacket? I feel moved by this sort of sartorial tension. MR:If I’m hitting the Chalamet—double dipping with my favorite team and then a team I don’t really care about—I think I’d approach it similarly. But if I was in that situation, a guy like me is dusting off my best throwback jersey for the Knicks portion. Someone overnight this man a Jamal Crawford jersey withthe wild blue and orange trim. You want to wear something that shows you know ball, and there’s no better way to do that than with a niche uniform that the team doesn’t wear anymore, especially if the name on the back is more of a cult hero than a household name. For the LA game, I’d probably go with something that shows no allegiance or affiliation at all. Aplain white T-shirt, perhaps, would be my move underneath the outer layer. If, in this hypothetical situation, I’m Timotheé Chalamet and I’m forced to wear a shirt that pays tribute to a former Laker, I’d use my Hollywood connections to find a shirt depictingMark Madsen'sdance moves from the 2001 championship parade. EC: As a documented proponent ofEric Adams’s Mets-Yankees hat, I would have gone to a local mall and had a Knicks-Lakers tee made at one of those screenprinting kiosks. But I also appreciate the move of wearing local merch to a local game. If I’m at a Knicks game, I’m channelingChloë Sevigny and Pauly D. If I’m at a Lakers game, maybe I’d goFleamode. Chalamet, native New Yorker and stalwart of Madison Square Garden's Celebrity Row, frequently wears the merch of his hometown team. MR:I really am not a fan of these performance-style hoodies that the players wear on the bench—and it looks even weirder on Chalamet in the stands. The hood is too tight. It looks constricting, but maybe that’s the point for an A-list movie star who wants to watch notedDuneappreciator Deuce McBrideunbothered. I also wonder about how much peripheral vision the hood allows when deployed. I guess that could add to the locked-in factor, not unlike a horse wearing blinders. A real Knicks fan flies to Detroit to watch his team; adiehardKnicks fan throws on the distraction-free sweatshirt. As for the Kobe fit…sure. Chalamet’s style is not the route I would go if I was a super rich guy, but there’s nothing wrong with this outfit. The peanut-butter Timbs are a nice homage to his home city, and thelight jacketlooks like a sensible choice. EC: Sitting courtside at a basketball game is Timmy’s natural habitat; it’s where he really lets hispost-swagflag fly. Combine some combination of unusual designer grails, personality-forward hats, andswagged-out footwearin a glass and mix. In LA, the Chanel jacket made sense given Timmy’s proximity to the brand—he’s the face of its men’s fragrance, Bleu de Chanel, and wore plenty of double Cs onhis recent press tour forA Complete Unknown. In Detroit, the polyester Knicks hoodie made sense given his general taste forweirdsportswear. MR:I think that probably has more to do with their head coach, JJ Redick, being one year removed from podcasting, and having way too much dip on his chip. Timotheé Chalamet had no impact on the Lakers getting out-rebounded 54-37, no say on keeping their tallest player (Jaxson Hayes) inexplicably glued to the bench while Rudy Gobert had his best playoff game ever. If you letRudy Gobertgo off, there’s umpteen internal issues, none of which are impacted by the guy fromCall Me By Your Namebeing there. EC: This question is above my paygrade. Congrats to all winners, apologies to all losers! MR:As much as it pains me to say—because I naturally reject the idea of Boston sports as an institution—I’d still probably go with the Celtics. Maybe Kylie and Timmy will get flewed out to Beantown by the Wahlbergs. EC: See above RE: my paygrade. But I’d love to see what Timmy and Kylie would wear to a Finals game in Boston. In my dream scenario, they’d do a full Boston homage: Kylie cosplaying as Blake Lively’s character inThe Town, and Timmy going full bore in costume as Lucky the Leprechaun, the Celtics’ mascot.",

    "title": "9 Best Pillows for Side Sleepers in 2025",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Most people don’t put much thought into the bestpillowsfor side sleepers. They’ll buy whatever’scheapest on Amazonand use it until it’s flat, lumpy, or both. But if you sleep on your side, that lack of support can show up fast—usually as a stiff neck, sore shoulder, or general crankiness when you wake up. The right pillow matters. A lot. The ideal pillow for sidesleepingshould be firm enough to keep your neck aligned but soft enough to feel like an actual pillow (and not a giant brick.) I tested over a dozen of the best pillows for sidesleepers—as I am one myself—and alternated positions at night to see how how supportive and comfortable they felt throughout the night. Here are the ones I’d actually recommend. Buffy Buffy Firmness:Soft, medium, firm Loft:Medium Sizes:Standard, king Material:Tencel lyocell shell, recycled PET fill If you primarily sleep on your side but also find yourself in other positions throughout the night, the Buffy Cloud Pillow strikes a delicate balance. It’s soft andbreathable, with enough loft to support your head in a side-lying position—as long as you choose the firm version. (It’s not overly firm, just more structured than the other models.) What stood out most is how adaptable it felt. I shift positions a lot throughout the night, and this one managed to feel comfortable whether I was on my side, stomach, or sprawled somewhere in between. It’s not as sculpted as some of the others on this list, but it nails the balance between comfort and support and earned a permanent spot on mybedafter testing was over. Sijo Sijo Firmness:Customizable Loft:Medium Sizes:Standard, king Material:Nylon/spandex shell, shredded memory foam fill If you like the feel of memory foam but hate how dense and heavy it can be, this pillow is a solid middle ground. It’s filled with shredded memory foam instead of a solid block, so it conforms to your head and neck without feeling stiff or overwhelming. Sijo also includes a pack of extra fill so you can adjust the loft to your liking. During testing, I noticed the cooling effect immediately—even through a pillowcase. I often woke up next to it after switching positions mid-sleep, and the temperature difference was obvious. It’s a great option if you sleep hot and want something that still feels soft and moldable. It does have a slight chemical smell out of the box that needs time tooff-gas, and the shredded fill gives it a lumpy appearance—especially without a pillowcase. But those were minor issues, especially once I felt how well it conformed to my face and shoulders during side sleep. Downright Downright Firmness:Firm (listed as medium) Loft:High Sizes:Standard, queen, king, euro Material:Cotton Cambric shell, White goose down and goose feather fill The Downright Intera is one of the firmest down pillows I tested—surprisingly so, given that it’s labeled medium-firm. But just because it’s firm doesn’t mean it’s uncomfortable: In the middle of the pillow is a firmer core, surrounding by airy white goose down that you sink into as soon as your head hits the pillow. It feels plush and luxe, like something you’d get at a high-end hotel. (It has the price tag to match, because Downright hand makes all of its products in Brooklyn.) Because it’s made of down, it doesn’t bounce back like latex or memory foam. Instead, your head sinks in gradually, and the fill gently shifts to contour around you. It held its shape overnight better than expected, which made a difference in how my neck felt the next morning. That said, you may have to do some occasional fluffing to maintain the shape. Brooklyn Bedding Brooklyn Bedding Firmness:Soft (with low and high loft options) Loft:Medium Sizes:Standard, king Material:Tencel lyocell shell, talalay latex fill Latex pillows feel different from anything else. They’re soft and squishy when you lie down but immediately spring back to shape the second you shift positions. That bounce makes them ideal for side sleepers who tend to move around during the night—you never have to fluff it or rearrange the fill to get support. This one felt especially breathable and didn’t trap heat like some memory foam options. I also liked the feel of the cover—it’s soft, woven fabric with a slight cooling effect. Go with the high loft if you want better alignment in a true side-sleeping position. Quince Quince Firmness:Soft/medium, medium/firm, firm/extra firm Loft:Medium Sizes:Standard, king Material:Cotton sateen shell, microfiber fill Quince’s down alternative pillow is a great pick if you want the plush feel of a down pillow but you’re prone to allergies, want to stay away from animal products, or just want something a bit easier on your wallet. I tested both the medium and firm versions, and the firm was more effective at keeping my head and neck aligned without feeling stiff. It also held its loft better than other down-alternative pillows I tried, which tend to compress too easily overnight. The cotton shell feels smooth and breathable, and the whole thing has a clean design. If you're a strict side sleeper and don't want to fuss with memory foam or latex, this one delivers straightforward comfort and support at a very reasonable price. Luxome Luxome Firmness:Customizable Loft:Customizable Sizes:Standard, king Material:Bamboo viscose shell, shredded memory foam, down alternative, solid memory foam fill This one’s all about options. The Luxome LAYR lets you mix and match three different inserts (with different firmnesses) to create the loft and feel you want. You can go firm or soft—high or low—and switch it up later if your preferences change. It’s a good pick for anyone who wants a little more control or hasn’t quite figured out their ideal setup yet. The softer inserts are made of a combo of shredded memory foam and down alternative while the firm one is solid memory foam. Pillow Cube Pillow Cube Firmness:Customizable Loft:High Sizes:Standard, king Material:Polyester spandex shell, memory foam fill This blocky little guy looks weird, but works great if you sleep on your side and stay there. The Cube slots neatly between your shoulder and head without collapsing or forcing you into a neck crunch. It’s one of the most supportive pillows I’ve tested, while still being a soft, contouring memory foam. But it’s not for toss-and-turners—it’s far too high if you end up on your back or stomach. Buffy Buffy Firmness:Customizable Loft:Customizable Sizes:One size Material:Polyester, viscose shell, recycled polyurethane fill This funky, curved pillow is a great solution for sidesleeperswho never quite know what to do with their arms. It has a built-in space for your shoulder, which makes side sleeping feel a lot more natural—especially if you tend to hug something while you sleep. I wouldn’t call it sleek (you’ll probably skip the pillowcase, which can look questionable on a freshly made bed), but the cooling cover feels great, and the shape genuinely helped me settle in at night. It has a pretty high height, but you can also take out some of the foam to adjust it to your preferences. Helix Helix Firmness:Medium Sizes:One size Material:Tencel and polyester shell, visco foam core If your hips or lower back get tight from sleeping on your side, adding a knee pillow can make a noticeable difference. This one nestles in between your knees to reduce tension through your hips and spine. It took a couple nights to get used to, but once I did, I found myself sleeping more evenly. Even though it comes with a strap to hold it in place, if you’re a restless sleeper, it may not be worth the splurge. What kind of pillow is best for side sleepers? Generally, side sleepers need a firmer, higher-loft pillow that keeps the head and neck aligned with the spine. That could be a firm down-alternative pillow, a block of memory foam, or something adjustable—it’s less about the material and more about how well it supports your head in that side-lying position. You may need to experiment to find the blend of firmness and loft (height) that works for you. What if I switch positions during the night? If you switch positions during the night, you’re like most people. Look for a pillow that’s supportive enough for side sleeping but not so firm that it feels uncomfortable if you roll onto your back or stomach. Medium-firm or adjustable-fill pillows are usually your best bet. Skip the pillow with the high loft, as it will bend your neck at odd angles when you’re on your back or stomach.",

    "title": "How Seriously Should You Take the Trump 2028 Hats?",
    "article_text": "Donald Trump, perpetual provocateur-in-chief, has caused outrage again—this time with“Trump 2028” hatsthat can be yours for only $50 apiece. The Trump Organization dropped the hats and other Trump 2028 merch last week, amid growing concern that the president will attempt to seek an unconstitutional third term. The merch only fueled more speculation, leading people to ask: Is he trolling or is he serious? The answer—as is often the case with Trump—seems to be a little bit of both, according to Nick Marx, co-author ofThat’s Not Funny: How the Right Makes Comedy Work for Them. “Joking, for him, serves the purpose of allowing him to test the boundaries of acceptability,” said Marx, who is also an associate professor of film and media studies at Colorado State University. Trump’s apparent lack of respect for political and social niceties has long been a part of his appeal. His brash, offensive, and unfiltered sense of humor has attractededgelords and manosphere-typessince hisfirst campaign. In the following years, he would double down on the outrageous stunts because it keeps him relevant and his supporters happy. “He understands from the first term that, ‘There are going to be no consequences if I say this, so I'm going to keep doing it and keep pressing the buttons that both piss off liberals and attract my right wing base, fortifying their support behind me,’” Marx said. The new hat is just Trump’s latest way of pushing these buttons, which is “fundamental to the trolling persona” he has cultivated, according to Marx. But it also serves another purpose: Planting the seed for a third term now so that voters are more amenable to it in 2028, said Caleb Warren, an associate professor of marketing at the University of Arizona who specializes in consumer psychology. “If it doesn't go well, he can fall back and say it was just a joke, it was just a way to troll the liberals, it was just a way to make money,” said Warren. “He's using humor and irony as a cover. But I suspect it's part of a real testing of the waters to see if they'll be able to run for another term.” Trump has been elusive about whether or not he would run in 2028, which goesagainst the 22nd Amendment. A third term would require Congress to change the Constitution,which is highly unlikely. Trumptold NBC Newsin March that he was “not joking” about a possible third term but that it was “far too early to think about it.” Yet the merch drop suggests that the Trump campisthinking about it. While press secretary Karoline Leavitttold Axiosthat “it’s just a hat,” the Trump website explicitly tells buyers to “rewrite the rules” with the hat—suggesting the president’s willingness to flout the Constitution. Trump is no stranger tocapitalizingon his own controversies. He has soldsneakers with photosof his assassination attempt,mugs with his mugshoton them, andshirts trolling Taylor Swiftfor endorsing Kamala Harris during last year’s presidential election. “He's got a long history of grift, of merchandising to cash in on whatever thing people will buy at the moment and fatten his pockets,” Marx said. But the hats also serve as a ripe distraction from what the Trump administration is doing now, said Warren. The president is skilled at keeping media attention for his wild stunts and statements, which obscures his actual policies. Just yesterday,Elon Musk stirred up further headwear-related mishegossby wearingtwohats during a Trump cabinet meeting: a red MAGA-style cap that read “GULF OF AMERICA” over top of a black “DOGE”-embroidered one. “The more we're talking about this, the less we're talking about him deporting people illegally or firing people who are in charge of our nuclear codes, or cutting all health services, or all the other things he's doing,” Warren said. So with all of that being said, should we be taking these Trump 2028 hats seriously? Marx says yes. “He's proven again and again that joking is his way of introducing particularly harmful ideas into public discourse, and they have a way to sort of become normalized because we might dismiss them as jokes,” Marx said. “So even if it's framed as kind of a glib or ironic, we have to still take those things seriously and call them out for what they are.”",

    "title": "18 Best Sneaker Brands in 2025: Nike, Asics, New Balance, and More",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. What are the best sneaker brands? The answer is kind of complicated, and the terrain shifts a little every year. The sneaker market isvast and multi-varied, and, at the end of the day, this is all subjective—as any self-respecting film bro will remind you, a billion-dollar Marvel box office haul doesn’t automatically make for great cinema. So instead of rattling off the top brands by revenue or market share (though, yes, some of the biggest names do also make some of the best shoes), let’s approach this with a clear head. This is a category where three core qualities truly separate the best from the rest: Style, comfort, and materials. Style, because why wear something you don't like the look of? Comfort, because if the shoe isn't supportive, you'll hate it as fast as you loved it. And materials, because you want a sneaker to last you years, not months—or, heaven forbid,weeks. All of this has been taken into account to create the below: A comprehensive breakdown of what's hot and relevant in today's sneaker market. Below you'll find 18 of the best sneaker brands you need to know—including the requisiteNike,Asics, andNew Balanceshoutouts—along with four of each brand's best styles right now. From Japanese-made low-tops to Italian-made hikers, it's safe to say one of the 72 pairs below will satisfy your search. For more intel on kicks we love, check out theGQ Sneaker Shop. Suffice to say, Nike didn't become the biggest, baddest name in the sneaker business by making an inferior product. The Swoosh earned its placed at the top of this list through sheer consistency, building out a deep roster of iconic sneakers that's been hard for any other brand to knock off its perch. After over 50 years in the sneaker game, and with reissues and new styles continuing to hit, Nike is still the one to beat. Nike Lost & Found Nike Nike Nike Nike Nike Mr Porter From extremely popular retro-leaning styles like theSambaand Euro-centric Handball Cup SPZL to forward-looking silhouettes like theUltraboost, Adidas has worked tirelessly to establish itself as a serious player in the sneaker space, never content to play second fiddle to Nike's daunting presence. Minus one particularly high-profile collaboration, the brand has largely succeeded over the past few years: The Three Stripes has emerged as the preferred collaborator for some of fashion's most interesting minds and wildest dressers, linking and building with the likes of Grace Wales Bonner and Bad Bunny. Adidas Adidas Adidas Mr. Porter Adidas Adidas Adidas Mr Porter Since the early 1980s,New Balancehas defined the dad shoe—and inspired a wave of chunky imitators that still hasn’t let up. With its premium Made in USA line—led by Aimé Leon Dore’s Teddy Santis—still going strong, and collabs with some of the buzziest names in streetwear, sport, and music, the brand has become the reigning champ of not-just-geriatric cool. Though this year, the brand is leaning in even harder to granddad mode with the highly anticipated Allerdale, a silhouette that nods to orthopedic walkers in the best possible way. Wearing New Balance is still the easiest way to channel the swagger of a semi-retired Upper East Sider who knows the value of comfort—and won’t settle for anything less than the best. New Balance SSENSE New Balance Mr. Porter New Balance New Balance New Balance Drakes It’s wild to think the Chuck Taylor All-Star has been around for over a century—and even wilder that peopleactuallyused to hoop in them. Can you imagine the modern-day Lakers sprinting up the court in a pair? Thankfully, Chucks found a second life off the court, with fans like the Ramones, Kurt Cobain, and pretty much every cool kid ever. But Converse isn’t a one-hit wonder. From suede skate shoes like the One Star Pro to classic low-top canvas kicks, its lineup stays in style and somehow looks better the more beat-up it gets. Converse Converse Converse SSENSE Converse Nordstrom Converse Converse You heard it here first:we’re wearing Vans again. Not that anybody ever really stopped. Vans are authentic in a way most sneakers can only pretend to be. (The brand's signature style is, fittingly, the Authentic.) Founded in the late '60s to service the West Coast skate scene, the company's affordable, unpretentious sneakers immediately took off among locals and then eventually the whole country, somehow retaining their associations with the counter-culture in the process. To fully harness their power today, makelike Harry Styles, who wears his with flared trousers and statement outerwear, or mimic the millions of skaters who adopted the sneakers before you and throw on a pair of Dickies and a big, boxy tee. The off-the-wall good looks will anchor all your big fits with ease. Vans SSENSE Vans SSENSE Vans SSENSE Vans Vans As the greatMike Skinneronce said: “Let’s put on our classics and have a little dance, shall we?” The UK rapper’s a Reebok fan—and he’s not alone. Reebok’s designs reflect its far-reaching roots from the tennis court to the city streets to the sticky floors of late-night clubs. The brand's Club C style remains an enduring hallmark of modern sneaker history, and a go-to ofmegawatt A-listers. Timeless, comfortable, and just sporty enough, Reebok has earned its spot in the rotation at a bargain price, and won’t steer you wrong. Reebok SSENSE Reebok SSENSE Reebok Zappos Reebok Nordstrom When Rudolf Dassler founded Puma in 1948, he set the stage for the most legendary rivalry in sportswear. Up until that point, Rudolf had been working together with his brother Adi on a shoe company headquartered in Germany, before the relationship deteriorated and the two decided to go their separate ways. (Adi went on to lend his name to Adidas, the second-largest sportswear company in the world. Don't shed any tears for Adi.) Today, Puma stands as a sneaker powerhouse, with a deep bench of retro-inflected lace-ups that stay true to its roots even as trends come and go. And right now, Puma’s slim, low-slung classics feel more relevant than ever, thanks to the resurgence of F1-style \"torpedo sneakers\"—sleek, minimalist silhouettes built for speed, and perfect for today's shift toward less bulky, more streamlined styles. Puma SSENSE Puma SSENSE Puma SSENSE Puma Puma Salomonemerged as a fashion-crowd favorite relatively recently (we named the brand'sXT-6 style our sneaker of the yearback in 2019) but the French sports brand has been churning out tactical, trail-ready shoes since its founding in 1947. Turns out, all the tired tropes about looking \"as good on the slopes as it does on the streets\" are entirely true: If you need a sneaker ready-made to take on any terrain, chances are Salomon makes it, perfected it, and made it look cooler than it has any right to. Salomon SSENSE Salomon Mr. Porter Salomon Mr Porter Salomon Nordstrom If Salomon built its cult following by infiltrating the fashion world with pure performance gear, ROA has carved out its own niche by starting right at the crossroads of technical function and high-end design. Since launching in 2015, the brand has quietly become a go-to for style obsessives who are more likely to rock their Vibram soles to a gallery opening than on the mountain. Still, ROA’s sneakers pair serious functionality—waterproof Xpore fabrics, rugged outsoles—with serious style. With collaborations fromOur Legacyto GORP moodboardOrganicLab.Zip, and a cult following that’s only picking up speed, ROA has officially taken hiking shoes to new cultural heights. ROA Mr Porter ROA Mr Porter ROA x Our Legacy Workshop ROA ROA x Colin Meredith Mr Porter While some brands chase fashion trends, Merrell has just kept on truckin'. Founded in 1981, the American outdoor brand was cranking out rugged, functional shoes long before GORP went mainstream. The 1TRL subline updates archival designs with modern tech, bringing new attention to classics like the Jungle Moc, and collabs with hotter names— like Montreal skate brand Dime—have helped, but Merrell’s real strength is staying true to what it does best (outdoorsy comfort) and doing it better than just about anyone. Merrell SSENSE Merrell SSENSE Merrell SSENSE Merrell Merrell Keen’s outdoor footwear—especially its unmistakablehiking sandals—has become so iconic it’s hard to believe the Portland brand has only been around since 2003. But it’s the Jasper sneakers that really have us paying attention at the moment. Originally inspired by approach shoes, the Jasper blends climbing DNA with a laid-back, street-ready look that feels right on time. With their suede uppers, rope laces, and colorful palettes, they nail the sweet spot between technical and casual—perfect for trailheads, city sidewalks, and everywhere in between. Keen SSENSE Keen SSENSE Keen Amazon Keen REI Even for brands like Nike and Adidas, getting customers excited about the latest innovation in sneaker technology can be a herculean task—which makes On’s meteoric growth doubly impressive. In a little over a decade, Zurich-based On has established itself as a formidable presence in the running shoe space, chewing off a sizable piece of the market in the process. (Roger Federer even signed on as a shareholder in 2019.) The key to its success? Cloudtec, a proprietary cushioning technology that promises an explosive take-off without compromising on comfort or impact protection. Fair warning: once you try a pair, it’s hard for your feet to forget. On SSENSE On SSENSE On Mr Porter On SSENSE Not too long ago, France—a country fueled mostly by caffeine and nicotine—would’ve seemed like an unlikely place to score your next pair of running shoes. But running has taken off there lately, with brands likeSatisfyleading the charge in stylish running apparel. Hoka, though, has always been a bit different. Founded by two ex-Salomon employees in 2009, the brand’s chunky, heavily-cushioned shoes fast became a sensation, favored by long-distance trail runners and StairMaster hounds alike. The biggest testament to Hoka’s influence? When they first debuted, the brand’s distinct outsoles were easy to spot from a mile away. But by 2022, so many brands have copied their signature geometry that it’s harder than ever to tell them apart—until, that is, you take a pair of the OGs out for a spin. Hoka Mr Porter Hoka Mr Porter Hoka Mr Porter Hoka Hoka The world's most elite runners love Asics for a reason: The brand's sneakers deliver unparalleled performance all without compromising on the support and all-important cushioning that makes them such a fan favorite. More recently though, the fashion crowd has cottoned on to their appeal, yielding delightfully freaky collaborations with industry firebrands like C.P. Company and Kiko Kostadinov. They’ve also been riding the low-profile wave with their throwback Skyhand, a quietly stylish nod to their archive. Asics SSENSE Asics Nordstrom Asics Nordstrom Asics Amazon Norda isn’t trying to make good trail runners—they’re trying to make the best trail runners on Earth. The Montreal-based brand uses Dyneema (a strong yet lightweight synthetic) uppers, Vibram soles, and obsessive design tweaks to build shoes that are light, nearly indestructible, and shockingly comfortable right out of the box. Even Italian luxury titan Zegna has taken notice, with the two brands collaborating on a series of sneakers. Whether you're running technical trails or just taking the long way to work, Norda’s running shoes are tough, light, and built to go the distance. Norda REI Norda REI Norda REI Norda REI If there’s a pattern here, it’s that many of these brands simply kept doing their thing, until the trends eventually caught up to them. Mephisto is a perfect example. Founded in 1965, the French brand has been making premium walking shoes built around old-world craftsmanship, top-notch materials, and soles so comfortable you might forget you’re still wearing them. Now, styles like the Match and the Rainbow havefound new fans, as Mephisto rides the rising wave of orthopedic cool. Pair them with wide-leg jeans or trousers, and you’ll look as effortlessly stylish as a Parisian retiree holding court along the Seine. Mephisto Nordstrom Mephisto Mephisto Mephisto Nordstrom Mephisto Mephisto Moonstar has been making sneakers and rubber-soled shoes in Kurume, Japan since 1873—long before the majority of this list existed. Known for their traditional vulcanization process and meticulous craftsmanship, Moonstar shoes are durable, understated, and quietly beautiful in the way that only truly well-made things are. Its Gym Classic sneaker and sturdy deck shoes showcase that philosophy perfectly: simple, rugged, and designed to get better the more you wear them. If you care about quality, utility, and quiet confidence, Moonstar is here for you. Moonstar Buck Mason Moonstar Buck Mason Moonstar Moonstar Moonstar Moonstar Reproduction of Found specializes in digging through military archives so you don't have to.

    "title": "Inside the Glitzy Hotels Where Celebrities Pregame the Met Gala",
    "article_text": "This is an edition of the newsletterShow Notes,in which Samuel Hine reports from the front row of the fashion world.Sign up here to get it free. At theMet Gala, the question of the night is, of course:Who are you wearing?But now that the annual fundraiser has transcended its society origins and become a social-media- and celebrity-fueled cultural spectacle, another important question has emerged:Where are you staying? Famous names and fashion types have flocked to a certain style of storied five-star since the days where Coco Chanel shacked up at the Ritz Paris. But there’s nothing in the world of rarefied hospitality quite like what happens during Met Gala season, when dozens upon dozens ofMet-bound celebrities and designersdescend upon a clutch of elite Upper East Side hotels located within spitting distance of theMetropolitan Museum of Art. Having been in and around several of these uptown institutions—The Mark, The Carlyle, The Pierre, and The Lowell among them—to witness the all-importantMet Gala getting-ready ritual, I can confirm it is a remarkable scene. For one night a year, these temples of old-world discretion become epicenters of global attention. Outside, miniature red carpets are thronged by paparazzi and fans; inside, the house is stuffed with glam squads and seamstresses and photographers, all of whom revolve around stressed-out guests as they prep for an evening where their every move will be scrutinized. It’s a pressure cooker environment, protected by G8-level security. And somehow, at least in my experience, the room service still arrives in a flash. “On that day, coffee is the best-selling item. We deliver a lot of coffees,” said Etienne Haro, The Mark’s genteel French general manager. On a recent Thursday afternoon, Haro was giving me a tour of the hotel’smammoth penthouse suite, which boasts five bedrooms, a professional kitchen, and a rooftop terrace that in winter converts into a private skating rink. Last year, Instagram hosted a Met Gala watch party in the penthouse, which, at over 10,000 square feet, and up to $100,000 per night, is one of the largest and most expensive hotel suites in the world. I asked Haro if it was booked for this year’s Met. I might as well have asked if the room came with an exotic leather backgammon set (duh). “Every year!” he replied. “Every year,everythingis rented out.” Donatella Versace with Anne Hathaway at The Mark in 2023… …and with Jude Law and Andrew Scott at The Carlyle in 2024. As we poked around the Jacques Grange–designed interior, Haro explained the unique demands of Met Monday. “For us it’s a normal day at the office. It’s just bigger and more overwhelming,” he said. The hotel, Haro explained, typically houses 45 to 60 A-list attendees. (Any more would overwhelm the two small guest elevators.) The rest of the rooms are filled with family, stylists, publicists, and entire fashion house ateliers—as the Met Gala has grown in size and complexity, so have the looks on the red carpet, which means brands now keep select craftspeople close to the action. During 2023’sKarl Lagerfeld–themed Gala, “we had a lot of the old Chanel seamstresses, even some who had retired and were brought back by the brand,” said Haro. “It was a very emotional moment, actually.” Everyone else? You’re out of luck. During Met season, The Mark is off-limits to general bookings—the closest you can get on the day of is a breakfast reservation atCaviar Kaspia, before the hotel shuts down its tony stretch of East 77th Street. Rooms are doled out in coordination with the luxury brands that buy tables at the Gala, such as Dior, a longstanding Mark client. Last year, guests included several dozen of the most prominent attendees. For one, Gala host Anna Wintour has used The Mark as a pre-Met home base for years. Also in residence were Nicole Kidman, Usher, Colman Domingo, Jennie, Naomi Watts, and Emily Ratajkowski. It helps to be a familiar face—loyalty to The Mark does not go unnoticed. “When we have a few rooms left, we are privileged to be able to choose [who receives one],” said Haro. “Which we do very humbly.” The two hotels most woven into Met Gala mythology, namely The Mark and The Carlyle, were also the pioneers of the pregame red carpet. It all started in 2017, when Mark owner Izak Senbahar made the simple but ingenious decision to swap out the subtle entry mat with a fire-truck red, logo-emblazoned carpet. (Haro acknowledged that it was also “cheeky, because we are not supposed to be the one under the spotlight.”Voguehas sincesalutedthe “Mark moment.”) Dwyane Wade at The Carlyle last year. The next year, The Carlyle, as famous for its iron-clad discretion as for housing the best place to drink a martini in New York City (Bemelmans), rolled out a red carpet of its own. “The Carlyle has long been the constant behind fashion's most extravagant night,” said the hotel’s managing director, Marlene Poynder, in a typically tight-lipped email, referring to its pedigree as the home away from home for royals, Beatles, and the likes of George Clooney and Miuccia Prada. “For decades, style icons have graced our halls, and on the first Monday in May our red carpet offers the first glimpse of the glamor to come.” Like its neighbor a block up Madison Avenue, The Carlyle is slammed on Met Monday. Last year, it’s where the likes of Kaia Gerber, Dwyane Wade, Greta Lee, Omar Apollo, Sydney Sweeney, and Hari Nef got ready. Its reputation as a“palace of secrets”notwithstanding, The Carlyle’s in-house polaroid photographertakes everyone’s portraitbefore they head to their Sprinter vans. Lucky Met weekend guests at The Mark encounter a host of subtle amenities. There’s a team of couriers on call to run any errands—candles and scent diffusers are among the most common requests. I’ve seensouvenir ball capsembroidered with “Met Gala 2023” that the hotel dropped in every room that year. The staff are also happy to clear out any space to facilitate a photo shoot, including the kitchen and the dining room of Jean-Georges; last year, waiters hurriedly removed about a dozen tables so that Cardi B, wearing mountains of tulle, couldpose on a banquettebefore departing. But the biggest perk of all might be the orchestrated exit. “The carpet outside The Mark is actually where everything clicks into place,” saidGustav Witzøe, a Norwegian model and salmon fishery scion who attended last year’s Gala in aregal Atelier Versace getup. To Witzøe, it’s where he warms up for the main event. “The Met Gala carpet is a beast. It’s intimidating, no doubt about it. But the moment I step out of the hotel, see the people lined up, the energy buzzing—that’s when it all becomes real. It’s strangely calming.” It’s also an extra press moment on a night that’s all about standing out. Nothing can compare to the spotlight on the museum’s Fifth Avenue steps, but the buzz outside the hotels is getting louder. Now, said Haro, “The Mark is seen as a second red carpet of the Gala.” This year, the hotel is adding a press riser to accommodate a growing pool of media outlets clamoring for a first look at the big outfits of the night, which includes an E! News crew and the hotel’s own livestream team. “From last year’s Met Gala, we’ve reached 7 billion impressions,” Haro proudly noted. “Our red carpet is the single-most-watched recurring hotel event in the world.” Which means it’s a great place for dolled-up celebs to jump the line and tap into the social media conversation before the Gala has even gotten underway—whether they managed to snag a room or not. “A lot of talents,” said Haro, “ask to exit the hotel even if they are not staying with us.” Sign up for Show Notes to receive my subscriber-only Tip Sheet in your inbox.",

At a press event in London last week, Pullman looked great in a sharp-shouldered, double-breasted Armani jacket, a simple white shirt, straight-legged Levi’s jeans (cinched withGQ’s favorite accessory right now,the minimal Western belt), and pointy-toed Stetsons. A somewhat formal take on light-jacket season, but a strong showing nonetheless. Sebastian Stan in a Margiela chore coat. David Harbour in a bottle-green suede jacket. Thankfully, Pullman’s costars Sebastian Stan (whose freshbuzzcutis in service of his upcoming role in the dramaFjord, the first English-language feature from Romanian director Cristian Mungiu) and David Harbour were prepared to take up the gauntlet. It certainly helps that both actors share the same stylist, Michael Fisher, who dressed the duo in their own respective weather-versatile outerwear for a recentJimmy Kimmel Liveappearance. Stan supplemented his mostly Margiela fit—gray canvas chore coat, pinstriped trousers, and “Sprinters” sneakers—with aplain white teefrom Abercrombie. Harbour went tonal in a boxy suede zip-up jacket, linen shirt, and New Balance sneakers, all in muted shades of green. Wyatt Russell in a birch-toned barn jacket. Finally, Wyatt Russell—fellow son of a Hollywood GOAT,Kurt Russell—rounded out the light-jacket parade during his stop atGood Morning Americaon Wednesday, where he looked springy in a khaki barn jacket, a striped shirt, and cocoa-toned trousers. A blazer, a chore coat, a leather zip-up, and a barn jacket… If theThunderbolts*guys’ light jackets were Infinity Stones, they’d be pretty close to making a full set. All they need now is to get the Rizzler to show up ina nice windbreaker.",

    "title": "Lunges or Squats: Which Are Better for Building Your Lower Body?",
    "article_text": "A swoleupper bodymight look good on Instagram, but forreal-life practicality, you also need a bit of leg work. Stronger legs help power all manner of activities fromcyclingtoswimming, as this report fromHarvard Healthattests. But the benefits aren’t just activity-based. Working on your legs cansupercharge testosterone production, which in turn increases muscle mass and banishes fat. A study published inthe Journal of Applied Physiologyfound that athletes’ metabolic rates were supercharged after heavy resistance training, including squats. The alternative to squats are, of course, lunges. Each has its benefits, but both can be difficult to get right. Here, our experts tackle the great lunges vssquatsdebate. “The lunge is a super effective exercise that targets all the major muscle groups of your lower body,” explainsHunter McIntyre,HYROXworld champion &Represent 247athlete. McIntyre points to a 2021 study inthe Journal of Isokenetic and Exercise Sciencewhich found that activation of the quadriceps and glutes was generally stronger in the lunge than in back squats. “When performed correctly, lunges strengthen the quadriceps,hamstrings, glutes, and calves, contributing to improved lower body strength and stability,” he says. “Additionally, because they are iso-lateral”—your feet aren't in line with each other—“lunges engage the core for balance and stability.” McIntyre points out another advantage of the lunge: Its versatility. “They can be modified in numerous ways to suit different fitness levels and goals,” he says. “You can load them any way you want. Whatever it is, you cango heavyand can always just drop what you are holding.” “Squats are one of the best exercises for burning calories, preventing injury, strengthening your core and boosting weight loss,” says Simon Cox, trainer and owner ofF45 Southend-On-Sea. “They are a great all-round exercise that can be low intensity—so kinder on yourkneesand joints—and you can mix it up with weighted or bodyweight squats, front squats,Sumosquats, overhead squats. The list goes on.” “Squats are a fundamental compound movement with broad benefits—the OG big daddy lift in the gym since the golden era ofbodybuilding,” says McIntyre. “Because of the large weights and total body recruitment, squats elicit an amazing dump of testosterone, IGF-1 and HGH into the bloodstream. A randomized trial from theNeuro Endocrinology Lettersfound that you should target 6-12 sets of at least 6 reps to optimize this.” The benefits for both squats and lunges are huge, but so is the potential for injury. If you suffer from tight hips, both exercises can exacerbate the problem, so warm up properly first. Performed incorrectly, squats can hurt your lower back, too. If you’re at all unsure about your approach, ask a physical trainer to talk you through the movements, beginning with bodyweight variations. Here’s how to fine-tune your form if you’ve mostly got it down already. The Squat “Theperfect squatcan be hard to master,” says Cox. “To avoid injury make sure you’re using your legs and not your back! Also, make sure that you’re starting from your hips, not your knees, and that your knees do not cross your toes as you bend. He says to try this: The Lunge “Theperfect lungecan require a bit more thought, as you are moving more body parts,” says Cox. “It’s important to go slow.” He suggests these steps: Both Cox and McIntyre agree that this depends on your individual fitness goals. “Based onresearch, the benefits are very similar, so it doesn’t overly matter if you choose one over the other, or decide to mix it up a bit,” says Cox. “It’s important to remember that eachfitness journeyis different, if you’re just starting out, you may want to opt for squats, as they are more balanced, and then progress to lunges.” Speaking from personal preference, McIntyre comes down on the side of the lunge. “I prefer the lunge, I think it’s a more versatile movement and transfers better to overall athleticism—I guarantee that anyone with a monster lunge canrun fast and jump high, and I know lots of big squatters where it doesn't transfer over to the real world. Part of this is because of the velocity of the bar on a lunge vs a squat: a heavy lunge still happens quickly whereas a heavy squat might be ground out over 5-8 seconds.” Want tobuild muscle? Opt for the squat. Want to improve overall athleticism? The lunge should be your go-to. Sadly, a well-rounded fitness regiment needs to include more than one exercise per body part. Lunges and squats might both offer benefits, but you’ll need to combine them to prevent imbalances and to unlock your next level of fitness. With that in mind, McIntyre thinks your next leg day should look like this: Compound lift6-12 sets of at least six reps Front SquatStart with the bar secure in the squat rack, level with the middle of your chest. Step close to the bar, holding it with your palms up, elbows pointing forward. Take a step backwards as you lift the bar from the rack. Bend your legs to lower into a squat, keeping that back straight. Hold at the bottom of the move, then power down through your heels to return to the start. Isolation exercisesFour sets of ten reps Hip ThrustsHeels on the ground, upper back leaning against a bench, you’re going to position a moderately-loaded barbell across the front of your hips. Push down through your heels, driving up through your glutes to lift the bar off the ground. Hold with a straight back, then slowly lower for one. Good morningsStand with an unloaded barbell across your shoulders. Hinge forward atthe hips. Keeping your back straight, bring your upper body as close to your knees as you can, then lift yourself back up to standing. If you’re struggling from lower-back tightness, you can add a few slow left-to-right twists at the start or end of the move. Leg curlsTwo machines will help with this. On the first, you’ll sit up straight, with your legs at ninety degrees. Push them out and up to workyour quads. For the other move, you’ll lie on your front, bringing your heels down to your bum to work your hamstrings. If your legs have it in them, work in four sets of each. Reverse lungeTime to end with a big boy. Standing straight, move your right leg back, lowering down onto your toes so your legs are at opposite ninety degree angles, your weight over your back knee. Power back up then switch legs, aiming for ten reps per side. If bodyweight is too easy, add a weight plate,kettlebellordumbbell—then dig deep and lunge for your life.

The Nike Air Force 1 ‘Dirty Triple White’ feels like the kinda thing you'd find on Facebook Marketplace during a 1 a.m. scroll. The listing might say: ‘Only worn once. Basically new.’ But the deep creases across the toebox and the scuffs along midsole would suggest otherwise. Except, in this case,Nike’s latestAir Force 1is genuinely brand new—it's just made to look, well, very used. Nike Air Force 1 ‘Dirty Triple White’ The ‘Dirty Triple White’ does exactly what it says on the tin. It's the classic ‘Triple White’ that's been around since the ’80s, but now, the sneaker has been designed to look trashed. Up top, the leather upper has been pre-yellowed. There are dark marks across the front, and some of the stitching on the Swoosh has already come loose. Even the insole and the heel badge are all marked up to make it look like they've been worn a few thousand times. Down below, the Air midsole gets the same roughed-up treatment. All of this is then finished off with a metal lace dubrae that's been pre-oxidized to make everything look even torched. Nike Air Force 1 ‘Dirty Triple White’ Pre-worn kicks are nothing new. FromBalenciagatoNew Balance, some of the sneakerverse's biggest brands have all dropped ‘em. Puma even did it last month with theSpeedcat. But what makes the ‘Dirty Triple White’ different is that, apparently, the more you rock it, the cleaner it gets. The “dirtiness” is actually a coating that has been applied on top of the shoe itself. Over time this will wear off, leaving you with an Air Force 1 that’s meant to look newer, fresher, and cleaner. And if you really want to speed up the process, the American sportswear company has added a Nike-branded toothbrush and a tube of toothpaste right in the box. But where's the fun in that, lads? Nike Air Force 1 ‘Dirty Triple White’ The Nike Air Force 1 ‘Dirty Triple White’ will be available via Nike, the SNKRS app, and select stockists on May 7 for $130.

    "title": "The Best Lorde Songs, Definitively Ranked",
    "article_text": "Let’s get the particulars out of the way immediately: I love Lorde. I always have. I may be a little too old and a little too self-respecting to identify as a stan, but Lorde is one of a handful of artists who bring me the closest to standom. When she initiallyemerged, I was all butGarden State-ing my headphones onto loved ones’ ears, in hopes they’d feel the same things I felt. As such, I feel fairly qualified to rank her best songs—an exercise that took me far longer than I’d care to admit, because I really care about this stuff! Now 28, Lorde occupies an odd niche in pop—criticallyandculturally acclaimed; famous enough that your parents have heard of her, but not famous enough to be completely detached from real life; the type of fans who respect and appreciate the art, but aren’t going to stab anybody over it. She’s cultivated a persona defined in part by her lack of interest in becoming a megastar—she takes about four years between every major release, eschewing the exhausting get-rich-quick cycle of putting out an album, instantly touring it, then rinsing and repeating. So when her latest single, “What Was That,” was unleashed last week, it was a big deal! And whilethe initial response has been mixed, as with any new song by an artist with a large body of work, the new stuff has the added effect of making you go back and listen to the old stuff. I’ve taken the liberty of ranking her 23 best songs, not including features on other artists’ albums (so no “Girl, so confusing” remix) or even tracks where she does all the vocals over someone else’s production (which takes “Magnets,” technically aDisclosuresong, out of the running.) Without further ado: At first, my plan was to leave “Buzzcut Season” off this list entirely. It’s never been my cup of tea, and there’s other album cuts fromPure Heroinethat strike a deeper chord with me. But then I listened to it again while writing this and felt awash with emotions. I suppose that’s the point. Lorde, you’ve done it again. A massive, inextricable part of my Lorde fandom comes from basically being the same age as her. When she sings about never going home again, her favorite friend, and believing the teenage hologram she’s living in is real, I know exactly what that looked and felt like. The early 2010s may not immediately evoke a specific set of cultural signifiers the way, say, the early 2000s do—at least not yet—but it was a distinct era that produced a specific type of person. I was an incubating young person during this time, and I feel very grateful that Lorde soundtracked it. I even had the buzzcut. This song is not as bad as the internet would lead you to believe! While I’m not crazy about the ham-fisted “MDMA in the back garden blew our pupils up” lyric, the song as a whole is really fun! We’re not saying it’s herbestsong—we’re saying it’s more like her 22nd best song—but it’s certainly more memorable and ear-wormy than the final third ofSolar Power, or most of the tracks from the middle ofPure Heroine. When “Green Light” came out, it took a while to latch on. When I first heard “What Was That,” I had a premonition that something similar was bound to happen:Maybe it'll be on the fifth or fifteenth listen, but this is eventually going to hit.With a sweaty-dancefloor summer looming on the horizon, I urge you to buy some “What Was That” stock. Before assembling the 2017 Avengers for theremix(remember Khalid?) Lorde debuted the original version of “Homemade Dynamite” at Coachella. I remember, because I was there, and I also remember texting friends that this was going to be her next big smash. While that prediction was a bit off-base, this song can still really get people moving. Written with Tove Lo, with production help from Canadian hitmaker Frank Dukes, “Homemade Dynamite” is one of the more sonically-rich songs from the Lorde canon. Big synth flourishes and cool laser noises, lyrics about charging drunken car crashes to the game, and DIY explosion sounds! This is also, in my opinion, Lorde’s sexiest song. It’s, crucially, the last bit of euphoria onMelodramabefore it gets into the introspective, morose stuff. As in the kind of house party it depicts, there’s always a comedown around the corner, so we might as well enjoy the high while it lasts. When Lorde’s name first entered the zeitgeist in 2013, it was usually attached to words like “ethereal” and “hypnotic,” for better or for worse. No song captures that like “The Love Club,” with its trance-inducing production and light, bouncy lyrics about how everything sucks. That—at least at the beginning—was the Lorde experience. Now, a dozen years later, it’s also fun to look back and insert conclusions to some of the open-ended questions she asked in her music, such as “I was in, but I want out / My mother's love is choking me / I'm sick of words that hang above my head / ‘What about the kid?’ It's time the kid got free.” She not only got free, she became one of the preeminent pop stars of her generation. The connective tissue ofPure Heroine—the thing that made teenagers the world over goexaaactly—is that elevated feeling of being part of the in-crowd but not actually liking any of the in-crowd. It’s not quite a too-cool-for-school thing, it’s more of a “Can you believe this is what we’re actually supposed to aspire to?” kind of vibe. On “White Teeth Teens,” she cuts this privileged crowd to its core—their hip social scene, their hollow souls, their immaculate dental hygiene. With the last two lines of the song (“I wear the robe like no one could / White teeth teens are out”) she delivers their death knell.I can play this game and be this type of person, even better than you. But having infiltrated the white-teeth-teen community, she realizes that the whole scene is a charade. I wish I had as firm a grasp on this when kids I didn’t like made me drink Smirnoff Ice. When her third album,Solar Power,dropped, pretty much every Lorde fan agreed it was her weakest project. In her newsletter, the singer herself, echoing an idea first presented by a friend, suggested that it’s “one of those works that gets made between peaks.” I love that, a gentle nudge about something we were all thinking, but were too afraid to say. That, in essence, is the song “Solar Power”. In the gulf betweenMelodramaandSolar Power, fans worried about her either becoming too successful to replicate the hunger of her early work, too blissful to recreate the brooding that made it so good, or too disillusioned by fame that she’d just pull a Frank Ocean and stop producing entirely. What we got instead was a sunny,CBD-asssong about leaving all that sadness behind. It’s George Michael meets Primal Scream, it’s acid green, aquamarine, it’s perfectly fine. Let’s move on. Yes, it’s a cover. Technically—since this was for theStop Making Sensetribute album—it's a cover of a live version of a cover. Yes, it’s also true that Lorde is one of the very best songwriters of her generation, and has plenty of original, emotionally affecting, thought provoking songs in her own catalog. But I don’t know what to tell you. This slaps. It’s also certainly the cover Lorde would want us to highlight, instead ofher attempt at Jeremih. You know when you’re taking a family photo, and after getting four or five good shots, someone inevitably goes “Okay, now let’s do a silly one?” That’s “Dominoes”—a song that greets you with, “I heard that you were doing yoga / With Uma Thurman's mother / Just outside ofWoodstock.” That rules, just like the rest of this song, which proved—along with most of the clinically divisiveSolar Power—that it’s not all darkness and gloom for this Kiwi. No Lorde song—and very few songs, in general—are better at evoking the feeling ofYayyy!If you’re the type to get yourself out of a funk by throwing on a dopamine-infused playlist and wiggling around the house, I cannot imagine a better song. By the time that littlechit-chitchhits before the first chorus, you’ve forgotten what was bringing you down in the first place. I’ve always had a pet theory that she andJack Antonoffconstructed this song in their pop laboratory with designs of taking over the radio, but then intentionally sabotaged it by throwing a few F-bombs into the outro. Because, you know, what the fuckareperfect places, anyway? One of many Lorde songs that can both stop you in your tracks and make you want to go on a three-hour drive listening to it on repeat, “A World Alone” gets my vote for her most overlooked track. Winking, extremely juvenile writing like “They make a mess, then go home and get clean,” and “Maybe the internet raised us, or maybe people are jerks” remind you of her youth, but then the last minute of the song churns through the galloping Joel Little production and solidifies “A World Alone” as a pop powerhouse. To that point, signing off with “People are talking / Let ‘em talk,” as both the last lyrics of the song and the final words spoken onPure Heroineprovide a gorgeous bookend to the album, which begins with “Don’t you think that it’s boring how people talk?” A 16-year-old terrifyingly staring down the barrel of fame has never sounded better, even if you can still kind of hear the uneasiness in her voice when she sings the word “fuck.” Lorde knew her entire life was about to change—she’d never been on a plane, and seven months later she washolding hands with Beyoncé at the Grammys—and she processed it over her signature blend of hip-hop inspired synth beats. Boy, did it work out for her. I didn’t spend much of my adolescence hanging out at tennis courts, although I do remember this one Australian kid who had one in his backyard and introduced us to fire tennis (like regular tennis, except you start by lighting the ball on fire). For Lorde, though, whomade her own childhood kingdom out of Auckland underpasses and tennis courts, the game provided the metaphorical canvas for her first post-“Royals” single. Having this song bat leadoff on her Grammy-nominated debut album was an inspired choice, and serves as a sort of thesis statement for the record. And amidst all the child prodigy talk, all the cries of next big thing, she still found room to showcase her unique sense of humor. “Making smart with their words again? Well, I’m bored,” never fails to make me laugh. I have been informed that this is a controversial choice. Look, I don’t ride forSolar Powereither, and the strange spoken word breakdown from Robyn is a swing and a miss. But to those of you who completely dismiss “Secrets from a Girl,” let’s work on finding some joie de vivre. The song that started it all. “Royals” has been part of our lives for over a decade now, streamed a billion times on Spotify, so it’s easy to forget just how…differentit sounded in 2013. Back then, a gobsmacked music-listening public were asking tons of questions about this song—oddly drowsy and energizing at the same time—and the brains behind it.Who is this person? They’re how old? Who made this beat? It sounds so haunting. Twelve years later, Lorde has shown a deft ability to make music beyond the cracked plug-ins and smoky, electropop vocals. But every time I queue up “Royals,” I’m struck at how good she was at it, and right away!Shoutout the legend George Brett. After four years away—her incredibly formative age-16-to-20 years, by the way—Lorde came roaring back with an up-tempo banger. The lead single offMelodramawas also the first time we’d heard her work with a producer other than Little, and it was none other than Antonoff, the commercial juggernaut. With its frenetic key changes and abrupt sonic shifts, this song probably shouldn’t work as well as it does. But the challenge of announcing a new era (while also trying to ensure she wouldn’t be seen as a teenager forever) demanded something bold and brash. That’s how we got the catharsis of “Green Light,” a dance floor anthem that’s become a certified hit at any millennial wedding reception.Good thing she didn’t listen to Max Martin. Is there a better chorus in Lorde’s entire discography? Is there a campier lyric than “I’m kind of over getting told to throw my hands up in the air / So there?” Is there a harder beat? (If you never tried to freestyle over “Team,” we had very different teenage experiences.) The beauty of a song like “Team” is its widespread appeal. More pure pop than “Tennis Court,” not as spooky and esoteric as “Royals,” her and Little found the sweet spot on this one (while, it should be said, still finding room for Kate Bush shit like “Now bring my boys in / Their skin in craters like the moon / The moon we love like a brother / While he glows through the room”). Everyone from seven-year-olds listening from the backseat toDavid Lettermancan agree: this is a massive tune. “Liability” is one of those songs that should come with a warning label: DO NOT LISTEN IF EVEN A LITTLE BIT SAD, WILL CAUSE SPIRAL. How else can you describe these lyrics, sung delicately over a sparse piano: The truth is I am a toy that people enjoy Till all of the tricks don't work anymore And then they are bored of me I know that it's exciting, running through the night But every perfect summer's eating me alive until you're gone Better on my own I need to go for a walk. The melancholy doesn’t stop there, though. Three songs after “Liability,” a more vengeful Lorde swings back with “Writer In the Dark,” a ballad about moving on, and also the dangers of getting involved with literary types. Lorde, playing the titular role of writer in the dark here, acknowledges that her old flame still occupies a space in her mind, that little things she sees are still a reminder of them. Then, as though her whole world suddenly snapped into focus, she ends the second verse with an epiphany that not only does she not need this person anymore, she loves her newfound life without them. “It’s not a historical document. It’s not a police record. It’s not journalism. I didn’t go to journalism school. I’m a writer,”Lorde toldThe Spinoffpodcast in 2017. “It’s about what I felt, and sometimes you can feel an element of guilt or, ‘Oh God, I shouldn’t have immortalized that person.’” I know that’s right. Ahh, the rush of young love.Clothesstrewn across the room, overanalyzing the punctuation of their every text message, the mutual lust progressing to a point where you can instantly summon them with a phone call. It’s all fairly universal for those of us searching for love in the digital age, even if—as Lorde also beautifully writes—sometimes that person is not your type at all, and you’re just a sucker. When the soaring guitars come in toward the end, I dare you not to conjure images of the ones who got away—the sweet, psychopathic crushes that definitely were not going anywhere, but put a feeling in your chest like you haven’t known since. Melodramais when Lorde really came into her own as a songwriter, and on “Hard Feelings/Loveless” she’s just showing off. “‘Cause I remember the rush, when forever was us / Before all the winds of regret and mistrust.”Are you kidding me?Then following that up with a perfect capture of the small, intimate, things you lose in a breakup (in this case, drifting through a grocery store with an ex-lover), and how tender those moments were? It can be overwhelming, which is why it’s such a great song. Then, seemingly out of nowhere, a chopped Paul Simon sample comes in and the beat drops, revealing a completely different song. If “Hard Feelings” is the shot, “Loveless” is the chaser, setting the right buzz for the back half of her best album. The three big singles made her famous, and have racked up far more listens and accolades, but this is the coolest song onPure Heroine.It scoops you up right away with that opening siren and doesn’t put you down until you’ve heard about all the things Lorde has not to do. A song about the dreariness of suburban boredom—driving around just for the sake of it, looking at the copy-and-pasted houses, buying some orangejuice—is, ironically, the brightest one on the tracklist. A song that answers the question, what if Lorde made aLana Del Reysong? While some may find the title a bit cheesy, the content is some of the realest shit she’s ever put on wax. Like, who amongst us hasn’t stared at the ceiling with some version of these thoughts—albeit much less eloquent—pinging around? Got a memory of waiting in your bed wearing only my earrings We'd go dancing all over the landmines under our town But the sun has to rise When it does, we'll divide up the papers Two former hell-raisers I'm still crazy for you, babe Much like with “Liability,” one must tread carefully around this song, lest they get pulled into a whirlpool of depression. But the hallmark of good art is creating an emotional reaction, and “Stoned at the Nail Salon” does that even with its throwaway bars. I really shouldn’t have to explain to you why “Supercut” goes bazooka, but I guess that's my job. First of all, a building, pulsing pop song that crescendoes into one hundred percent elation? That’s one of the best things the human race has going. Second of all, it’s the only song onMelodramathat Little is credited on, which is a perfect example of how the new thing is not always the best thing. And third of all, I mean, just listen to it. The yearning lyrics about cars and ribbons and fluorescence? Absolutely. The keys during the chorus that sound likePlastic Beach-eraGorillaz? Nothing wrong with that. Belting out, “But it’s just a supercut of us!” from the shower, driver’s seat, karaoke stage, etc.? Well, that’s the whole point of being alive, baby. For my money, maybe the best song ever written about being a teenager. Thinking about where I was at 17 (dumb, weird-looking, terrible writer in Sammamish, Washington), compared to now at 29 (dumb, hot, slightly better writer inNew York City) sometimes makes me emotional, and when I get in those feels I know exactly what song to reach for. “Ribs” is a flashback to the best high school party you ever attended, but also that deep pit that forms in your stomach when you realize you’re never going to see some of those people ever again. It’s a brutal confrontation of reality, and how it never matches the image you had in your head. It is Lorde’s best song, and I’ll even go a step further and say it’s one of the best songs of the 2010s.",

    "title": "Jon Hamm Stealing Fancy Watches Is All I Need From Prestige TV",
    "article_text": "This is an edition of the newsletterPulling Weeds With Chris Black,in which the columnist weighs in on hot topics in culture.Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Thursday. I am on the record as being pretty disinterested in what we as a culture call “prestige TV.” The endless amount of press, cast fashion editorials, and worst of all, the heavy-handed analysis—all of it just turns me off. I'm sureSuccessionwas fantastic, but the hoopla took me by surprise, so I never turned it on. The more you tell me to watchThe Sopranos, the less interested I am. I have seen every episode ofSex & The City, which says a lot about me. I spend my TV time glued toBravo, watchingSouthern Charm,Southern Hospitality,The Real Housewives of Salt Lake, andThe Valley. It’sthe highest-quality garbage, expertly crafted to make you feel both good and bad about yourself. I think all day—I don’t want to think with my feet kicked up on the couch at 9 PM on a Tuesday night. All of that said, a few new prestige shows have entered the ring, and against my better judgment, I have tuned in to both. They both air on the Apple TV+ streaming service; only one is actually good. The Studio(a “cringe comedy” series) starsweed-accessories dealerand hobby ceramicistSeth Rogenas the bumbling, newly-appointed head of a major Hollywood studio. Catherine O’Hara plays his former boss, a character supposedly based on Amy Pascal. The show looks fantastic, the office is perfectly appointed, hulking in size and design. Rogen’s character Matt Remick wearsBrunello Cucinellisuits and drives costly, pristine vintage cars. On paper, it should work, but Remick is too much of a doofus to bebelievableas a self-proclaimed cinephile who wields ultimate power in Hollywood and scuttles a Jonestown Massacre project fromMartin Scorseselest it step on his studio’s plans to make a Kool-Aid Man movie. Greta Lee andSarah Polleyare greatguest stars, but Olivia Wilde is not. Something about the whole thing just doesn’t work, but maybe the production value and big-name guest stars keep people tuning in. Your Friends & Neighbors, on the other hand, works perfectly.Little Dom’s regular, grey-sweatpants enthusiast, and beloved American institutionJon Hammplays Andrew \"Coop\" Cooper, a disgraced finance guy who loses his job not long after his wife, played by the always-good Amanda Peet, leaves him for a formerNBAplayer. Desperate to maintain his affluent Connecticut lifestyle, Hamm turns to crime, stealing from (you guessed it) his friends and neighbors. The show explores the eternal question, “Will a distracted rich guy notice if hisRichard Milleis missing?” Hamm has sex with fellow divorcee Samantha \"Sam\" Levitt, played byOlivia Munn, and teams up with a housekeeper, and the operation gets more sophisticated and dangerous. His teenage son, a drummer, covers Matthew Sweet with his band at a house party before the mushrooms he took altogether disable him.

    "title": "Elon Musk’s Days of White House Sleepovers, Complete with Gossip and Ice Cream with Trump, Are Over",
    "article_text": "Even the brightest of flames are bound to sputter out eventually, and lo, it would appear that the bright, brief bromance betweenElon MuskandDonald Trumpwill soon be but a wisp of smoke, quickly dissipated to nothing in the White House’s climate-controlled corridors. In a group interview with a handful of reporters at the White House on Wednesday evening, Musk spent some time reminiscing on the soon-to-be good ole’ DOGE days, whining about his office, garnished with a healthy misunderstanding of Buddhism, just for variety. Musk explained that the administration is “getting more of a rhythm,”100 days post-inauguration. Sure, if by “rhythm” he means “plummeting poll numbersand stock market,” then, yes, there has indeed been more of that. Musk said that he’d step back from DOGEing and playing video games Diablo and Path of Exile in his office on a monitor that he described as the biggest in the White House. By contrast, he sniffed that his office is “comically tiny” with “a view of nothing.” “Which is fine, makes it harder to shoot me,” Musk added. “Not a good line of sight.” It would appear that his days ofsleeping in that officeare over, however, due to an upgrade in guest lodgings: Trump frequently invites him to stay over at the White House, where he sleeps in the Lincoln Bedroom and enjoys cute little ice cream rendezvous with Trump. “We’ll be on Air Force One, and Marine One, and he’ll be like, ‘Do you want to stay over?’” Musk said of “good friend” Trump. “And I’m like, ‘sure.’ He’ll actually call, like late at night, and say, like, ‘Oh, by the way, make sure you get some ice cream from the kitchen.’” “Don’t tell RFK,” he added, invoking health and human services secretaryRobert F. Kennedy Jr. Musk, for the record, tends to enjoy caramel-flavored Haagen Dazs. Trump has historicallyvoiced a preference for cherry-vanilla ice cream, with very specific instructions for how it should be served:Two scoops for Donald, one for everyone else. (It's worth noting, too, that Trump Tower in New York hasits own ice cream shop. A “big league” scoop costs $8, and it is the proud bearer of a2.6-star Yelp rating.) As he shifts his focus from DOGE to “return to primarily running my companies, which do need me,” (read: Tesla’s profitsdeclined an eye-popping 71% in Q1, and the vehicles havebecome a scarlet letter among anti-Trumpers), Musk graded his time playing government dress-up as “60% fun, 70% fun,” though it “depends on the week.” “Being attacked relentlessly is not super fun,” he said. “Seeing cars burning is not fun.” Weird news for Elon: Those things are not exclusive to….whatever it was he did at DOGE. Remember, the mysteriousAmy Gleasonwas publicly namedas the group’s acting administrator in February, though Musk was out front wearing goofy hats and trying to fire people who didn’t work for him. He’s keeping his office, tiny though it may be, he said, and apparently his sparse business cards as well. Even his stationery doesn’t know what to call him, by the way. “They don’t put anything on my card,” Musk said. “Literally, there’s nothing on my card. It just says my name.” Useful! Just as he has perpetually declined to say who’s actually running the show at DOGE (and, honestly, what the hell they’re all doing there), Musk kept mum on the future. “It’s a way of life, like Buddhism,” he said of DOGE, which, as a weird vague government committee has pretty much nothing in common with the centuries-old belief system. “You wouldn’t ask who would lead Buddhism. Is Buddha needed for Buddhism?” HowMiriam AdelsonWent From Big MAGA Winner to Casino Loser in Trump’s First 100 Days The Truth UnderlyingPete Hegseth’s Job Security “It’s About Him”: How Trump Is Perverting thePresidential Photo Stream Inside the Case ofKim Kardashian’s Paris Robbery HowSebastian StanBecame Hollywood’s Most Daring Shape-Shifter The Ballad ofBill Belichickand Jordon Hudson JuilliardIs Going Tuition-Free Elon Musk’sBreeding SpreeIsSoMuch Wilder Than You Thought EveryQuentin TarantinoMovie, Ranked MeetElon Musk’s 14 Childrenand Their Mothers (Whom We Know of) From the Archive:Sinatra and the Mob",

    "title": "Why Are Americans So Obsessed With Protein? Blame MAGA.",
    "article_text": "TikTok content creators are hawking powders from Just Move and Ryse. Netflix is teasing its documentaryUntold: The Liver King,which tracks the rise and fall of the raw-meat enthusiast, out later this month. Influential podcast bros, from the physicianPeter Attiato thevery well-paidJoe Rogan,swap protein-heavy diet anecdotes andshare their “current state of protein supplementation.”One of this year’s most talked about shows, season three ofThe White Lotus,derived a whole thread of narrative tension from what can only be described as Chekhov’s protein shake. For decades, an American protein mania has been building. This year, it may be hitting its peak. News and takes have abounded, fromVogue’s “4 Signs You’re Not Getting Enough Protein” andGrub Street’s deep dive onadded-protein foodstoThe New Yorker’s profile of aprotein bar companyandThe New York Times’ fact-check of “big protein claims.” “I don’t have a good sense on what’s driving that right now, other than if it’s just the usual manosphere—or manomania, here in the United States,” saysPieter Cohen,an internist at Cambridge Health Alliance and associate professor at Harvard Medical School who leads the center’s Supplement Research Program. “Everyone’s letting their testosterone out these days.” One thing he’s noticed: More men than women arrive at his office “interested in protein.” It’s notonlymen who care about protein, but a mosey through recent history suggests a strong correlation between the rise of the likes of the men’s rights movement and our national lust for protein—which is how we got to the quagmire of contradiction wherein a “manosphere” helmed byDonald Trump(he of the dietdubbed by his own health secretary, the admittedlyoften incorrectRobert F. Kennedy Jr.,to be “really, like, bad”) has such a vocal contingent of intenseprotein-maxing“health” obsessives. The intertwinement of masculinity and red meat (and its attendant health properties, namely protein) is strong and deep-seated. A2023 studyfound that men were “more likely to eat foods to the extent that those foods were perceived as higher in masculinity and lower in femininity,” which correlated with foods that were seen as higher in protein. Another, from this year, found that men who have what they describe as a strong “meat-eating identity” also “tend to perceive themselves as more masculine.” An obsession with protein affords a masculine-coded cover on the feminine-coded world of body image and dieting—and a subject over which men can bond as bros. While discussing the carnivore diet, Joe Rogan andTheo Von—both members of the podcast contingent widely seen to have played a major part in turning the election for Trump—laud the powers of red meat (while acknowledging that some people do well on a vegetarian diet, “Not for me, dude,” Rogan says with grim resolve) before sliding into a tangent about Rogan’s avoidance of pizza that becomes, somehow, aggressively erotic. “If I had a couple of cocktails,” Rogan murmurs, “I probably would have grabbed a slice.” Von begins shifting in his chair. “Oh fuck yeah, boy.” “A couple of tequilas?” Rogan smiles coyly at his interlocutor. “Next thing you know, I want some pizza.” “Oh dude, I’ll”—Von grits his teeth—“I’ll do whatever after that, boy.” The so-calledLiver King,who rips into raw animal hearts, testicles, and livers with his teeth, hawks protein supplements purportedly “high in organs including blood, colostrum, and tallow” (none of which, it should be noted, is an organ). His ensuing online popularity afforded him entry into a world populated by his right-wing idols. Last year, he posteda video compilationof himself fanboying over Trump,Logan Paul,and others. According to the food historianHannah Cutting-Jones,we cantracetoday’s relationship to protein back to the 19th-century chemist and early macronutrient expert Justus von Liebig, who called it “the only true nutrient”—and, in the 1860s, promptly started making and selling his own protein supplement of sorts: Liebig’s Extract of Meat. In the 1950s and ’60s, doctors and scientists homed in on protein supplementation as an important tool in treating malnutrition in places like North Africa, India, and postwar Korea. For almost as long as there’s been enthusiasm for protein, there’s been controversy: over how it’s made, how much to get, and from where. In the mid-1970s, the FTCwas reportingthat “marketing of [protein supplement] products is almost universally dependent upon consumer misinformation and misconceptions about the nutritional characteristics of protein.” A series ofNew York Timesarticles from the same era read like the plot of a body-horror film: In1974, an animal science professor came up with a process to “recycle” cows by turning slaughterhouse waste products into a protein supplement that could be fed to “feedlot steers”; by 1977, theFDA was linking“liquid protein supplements” for humans—also made from cattle-slaughtering by-products—with the deaths of 16 women, leading to a substantial decrease in sales. There may not be, at present, deadly concerns about contaminated products. (Though it’s true that protein powders, like all supplements, aren’t under the purview of the FDA—which hasn’t stopped Robert F. Kennedy Jr. from promising to liberate them from government oversight.) But Cohen does worry about the risk to patients (“in particular, teenage guys”) who forgo a balanced diet in favor of protein shakes. He’s also concerned about the psychological effects of feeding student-athletes the idea that protein supplements are the only way to a healthy body—“a brilliant advertising campaign for the supplement industry,” he says, despite that “when we’re talking about anyone who’s not an elite athlete,” meaning the likes of NBA players or professional runners, “is there any evidence I know of that getting your protein from whole foods is inadequate, or somehow it’s better to get [it] through protein powder? I don’t know of any evidence to suggest that.” Cohen also points me to the work of his Harvard colleagueS. Bryn Austin,in the Social and Behavioral Sciences department at the School of Public Health, who is the founding director of a research and training program dedicated to eating disorder prevention. In 2022, she coauthoreda paperexamining young men’s use of protein supplements. Its findings warn clinicians to “be aware of their male patients’ use of protein powders and muscle-building supplements,” which pose “acute and long-term physical and psychological consequences.” Last year, one of her coauthoredstudiesfound that muscle-building supplements formed a pipeline to anabolic steroids in young men. The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for protein is 0.36 grams per pound of bodyweight, but some popular online health experts, like Attia, whoadvisesDavid Protein and has invested in the protein-forward deer meat company Maui Nui Venison, recommends far greater levels. He says that his practice aims forone gram per poundof bodyweight. (Andrew Hubermanhascalledthis a good starting point—though one of his own supplements of choice, and a financial incentive, is AG1, which contains a measly two grams of protein per serving.) Big Protein may have come for all of us.Mary Claire HaverandGabrielle Lyonare prominent pro-protein online personalities who target their content toward women, and an informal poll floated to an active group chat found that the respondent protein-supplement enthusiasts had women slightly outnumbering the men (sample size: five). TikTok is rife with people of all gendersranking (and selling) Ryse proteinandeating (and selling) David Protein bars. But on TikTok, at least, the videos tend to conform to aesthetic gender norms. The men often show up in tank tops that reveal bulging biceps, hefting tubs of the powder, while the women cook through “what I eat in a day” videos in sports bras and tight pants showcasing abs and what one userdescribesas “a flat stomach and fat butt.” The bodybuilding craze of the 1970s, birthed from the founding of Venice’s Gold’s Gym, fueled by new protein supplements and steroids, and popularized byArnold Schwarzenegger’s oiled muscles in 1977’sPumping Iron,coincided with an era of economic flux,widening political polarization, and rising momentum around women’s rights and gay rights—the latter of which sparked a backlashmen’s rights, or “men’s liberation,” movement. Some 40 years later, in 2014,Food Business Newscalled protein the year’s “leading food-industry buzzword,” and a report from NPD Group not only found widespread enthusiasm for the macronutrient, but that, according to an NPD analyst, “many are willing to pay, or have already paid a premium, for these products.” By 2015, psychologistswerefindingthat the overconsumption of protein among men could constitute an eating disorder. Was it correlation, coincidence, or some lean-meat canary in the proverbial coal mine that it was into this proteinous landscape that Donald Trump—burger loving, locker room talking, and all—announced his bid for the presidency? And now, amid a shrinking economy, following strides and setbacks for women’s rights via #MeToo and its backlash (including the overturning ofRoe v. Wade), as well as marriage equality, visibility, and media representation for queer and trans people with a similar subsequent “anti-woke” recoil—we have a second Trump term, MAHA, and what menswear commentatorDerek Guycallsthe “slim-fit revolution” of the manfluencer sphere. Perhaps Saxon Ratliff, played by the son of the ur-celebrity bodybuilder himself,Patrick Schwarzenegger,said it best. “Lochy, we don’t do it for the taste,” he told his beleaguered and un-swole little brother in an early episode ofThe White Lotus,watching him choke down a frothy white, freshly blended protein shake. “We do it for the high T and the BDE.” Whether our current protein path leads to an accidental brush with transcendence, or face down on the pavement as gunshots ricochet nearby, remains to be seen.

    "title": "Michael Waltz Is Out. It's Hard to Believe Signalgate Had Nothing to Do With It",
    "article_text": "Afternews brokein March that National Security AdvisorMichael Waltzaccidentally invited a journalist to a Signal chat where he and other cabinet officials discussed secret military strike plans, even some ofDonald Trump’sbiggest boosters calledfor heads to roll. Now, it looks like Waltz may be the first to the guillotine. According to reports byPoliticoandCBS News, Waltz and his deputyAlex Wongare leaving the White House as early as this week. (White House press secretaryKaroline Leavitttold Politico, “We are not going to respond to reporting from anonymous sources.”) The question of whetherWaltz should resignwas reportedly a live issue inside the Trump administration after Signalgate broke. But publicly, the president defended Waltz, who claimed thatAtlanticeditorJeffrey Goldberg’s phone number simply got “sucked in” to his phone when he was creating the unauthorized group chat. “Michael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he’s a good man,” Trumptold NBC Newsat the time. But Trump may have just been biding his time until the Signalgate scandal died down. While less is known about Wong’s reported ouster, he has been the subject of targeted attacks by far-right conspiracy theoristLaura Loomer.Loomer has sought tosmearWong as an agent of the Chinese government and has taken aim at his wife, former U.S. attorneyCandice Chiu Wong, for beingamong the prosecutorsof the January 6th rioters. Loomertook creditfor another slew of sudden firings last month, after she met with Trump in the Oval Office. And as the news of Wong’s potential departure broke Thursday, she took another victory lap. “SCALP,”she postedon X. The mystery in all of this is why Defense SecretaryPete Hegsethseems to be getting off scot-free. While Waltz may have created the ignominious chat, it was Hegseth who shared the details about the military strike in Yemen with the group. And, as it turns out, he did it not once, but twice,creating a separate Signal chatin which to fill in other unauthorized individuals, including his wife. At the same time, “chaos” has apparently beenconsuming the Pentagon. In a little over a month since Signalgate broke, Hegseth has been purging staff for alleged leaks andreportedlythreatening top officials with polygraphs in expletive-laden outbursts. Yet, so far, the toughest thingTrump has saidabout the situation is that he and Hegseth “had a talk” and that “he’s gonna get it together.” One possible (though admittedly absurd) explanation for why Hegseth is safe—for now—is there is simply too much bad news swirling around him. According to one source who spoke with CBS, the president waited to show Waltz the door in part because he wanted to cast the ouster as part of a broader reorganization, rather than signal he was bowing to public criticism. Because as we now know well, whether it comes to national security failures,tariff catastrophes, oraccidental deportations, the one thing this administration will absolutely not do is admit to its mistakes.

    "title": "Trump's Lies Are Finally Catching Up to Him",
    "article_text": "There is perhaps no one in the world better at stretching and bending the truth to fit his narrative thanDonald Trump. This is the man, after all, whose first term in office gave us the phrase “alternative facts.” But lately, Trump’s truth contortions have reached a breaking point, so much so that even he seems to struggle to keep his story straight. Nowhere is this more obvious than on the issue of tariffs. During a Cabinet meeting Wednesday,Trump had a mask-slip momentwhen he acknowledged that his trade war would likely increase product prices in the United States. “Maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls. So maybe the two dolls will cost a couple bucks more than they would normally,” Trump said. Say what you want about Marie Antoinette, but at least “let them eat cake” was snappy. But just as he appeared to be owning the impact tariffs will have in driving costs upward—precisely the opposite of hisMake America Affordable Againpromise—Trump triedto blame the flagging economic numbers on former PresidentJoe Biden.“This is Biden’s Stock Market, not Trump’s,” he wrote on Truth Social. It was the literal flip side of aJanuary 2024 postin which Trump boasted, “THIS IS THE TRUMP STOCK MARKET,” as themarket soaredto record highs under Biden. For those keeping track at home: This means it's the “Trump stock market” when Biden's president and the economy's growing and the “Biden stock market” when Trump's president and it's tanking. Still with us? Great. Trump’s outburst on Wednesday came after theCommerce Department announcedthat the US GDP shrunk 0.3% during Trump's first three months in office. That dip, theBureau of Economic Analysis wrote, “primarily reflected an increase in imports.\" In fact, the first quarter for 2025 saw the largest import surge since the pandemic, as companies scrambled to bring in foreign-made goods before Trump’s tariffs set in. By contrast, during the last three months of Biden’s presidency, GDP grew 2.4%. In his post on Truth Social, Trump tried to claim that once tariffs are in place and companies bring manufacturing to the US, the state of the US economy will turn around. But economists,who predictedthe situation would only get worse by the end of the year, aren’t buying it. Neither, it turns out, are voters. Trump’s doublespeak is so obvious that just37%of US adults now approve of his handling of the economy, according to a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll.Trump has soughtto shape this to fit his narrative of utter triumph too, writing on Truth Social this week, “The Polls from the Fake News are, like the News itself, FAKE! We are doing GREAT, better than ever before.” It is, frankly, getting a little desperate. Trump is losing his grip on the story he’s always controlled best—his own. His mixed messages on tariffs, contradictory economic claims, and increasingly obvious attempts to deflect blame have created narrative whiplash. This blatant mythmaking in the face of all evidence to the contrary is, of course, ripped from the authoritarian playbook. Is it any wonder that, according toone new poll, more than half of all Americans now view him as a “dangerous dictator?” HowMiriam AdelsonWent From Big MAGA Winner to Casino Loser in Trump’s First 100 Days The Truth UnderlyingPete Hegseth’s Job Security “It’s About Him”: How Trump Is Perverting thePresidential Photo Stream Inside the Case ofKim Kardashian’s Paris Robbery HowSebastian StanBecame Hollywood’s Most Daring Shape-Shifter The Ballad ofBill Belichickand Jordon Hudson JuilliardIs Going Tuition-Free Elon Musk’sBreeding SpreeIsSoMuch Wilder Than You Thought EveryQuentin TarantinoMovie, Ranked MeetElon Musk’s 14 Childrenand Their Mothers (Whom We Know of) From the Archive:Sinatra and the Mob",

    "title": "16 Books To Read This Month",
    "article_text": "Books—like so many things, people, ideas, these days—are under attack. In Texas, Republican RepresentativeNate Schatzlineintroduced a billlast week that could levy fines against bookstore owners for carrying volumes that include “obscene” material. Last month, on orders from world’s mostinfamous group texterPete Hegseth, the Naval Academy removed more than 400 books that were deemed to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion from its shelves. Since then, a dozen attendees of Pentagon schools worldwidehave suedHegseth for such bans and curriculum changes. (Meanwhile,Ivanka Trumpblithely posted about hervacation readsfrom Costa Rica.) On Indie Bookstore Day this weekend, stores and their visitors celebrated the particular importance of bookshops asa place to gatherand exchange ideas; some promoted initiatives to combat bans, likeEmma Straub’s Books Are Magic, which israising moneyforLauren Groff’s The Lynx to distribute books in Florida. Happily, given your local brick and mortar and online options like Bookshop.org, every day can be Indie Bookstore Day. Here, our recent favorite reads: novels about grappling with the racism of a literary hero, nonfiction about art and sex, and fascism and dreams—and much, much more. —Keziah Weir, senior editor ‘The Last Supper’ by Paul Elie Amazon Bookshop It begins asAndy Warholhas a brief audience with the new pope, John Paul II: “two Poles, two icons, two grandmasters of mass media and the public image.” It ends with ACT-UP protests, the fatwa againstSalman Rushdie—and the funeral of Iran’s Ayatollah Khomeini. In between, we come to understand why the most consequential change agents of 1980s culture were iconoclasts who, though steeped in faith, decided to use their art to question or expand upon the tenets central to their religious upbringing.Paul Elie’sThe Last Supper—a reference to Warhol’s final opus, which was an AIDS-era take on Leonardo’s masterpiece—chronicles the clash between religious convention and unconventional art, between deep belief and progressive principles. Maverick artists (Madonnaand Prince, Leonard Cohen and Sinéad O’Connor, Basquiat and U2, Toni Morrison andPatti Smith, Robert Mapplethorpe andAndres Serrano, among many others) create their vanguard visions against the backdrop of Thatcherism, the Reagan Revolution, the Moral Majority, anti-abortion activists, evangelicals, the Catholic Church, and the rise of radical Islam. The section on Rushie’sThe Satanic Versesgrew out ofa story commissioned byVanity Fair; the probing analysis ofMartin Scorsese’sThe Last Temptation of Christis a product of a memorableNew York Times Magazineprofile—and fresh reporting for this book. They comprise some of the most insightful analyses, ever, of either artist. More to the point, Elie’s synthesis of the era is virtuosic and revelatory. And his mini-narratives are set pieces, laid out with such intricate detail that the book, at times, feels as finely chiseled as a work carved from Carrara marble. (May 2025, Farrar, Straus and Giroux)—David Friend, editor of creative development ‘Honoria’ by Janice Shapiro Amazon Bookshop Many readers ofVanity Fairare familiar with the so-called Lost Generation: expat American artists and writers, bohemians and gadabouts, who resided in Europe before the Second World War and flourished and floundered, sometimes epically so. Two of the most influential tastemakers among that crowd were the arts patrons Gerald and Sara Murphy. F. Scott Fitzgerald paid them homage inTender Is the Night.John Richardson, Picasso’s biographer,divulged their secretsinVF.And now, author and illustratorJanice Shapirosummons that charmed era in a graphic novel that is enchanting and effervescent from start to finish—all from the perspective of Ida, a nine-year-old from Manhattan whose parents put her on an ocean liner to France to spend a summer with the Murphys at their beachside idyll, Villa America, in Cap D’Antibes. Inquisitive, Jewish, and out of place, Ida befriends the mysterious Honoria—the Murphys’ young daughter—and, together, the girls are beguiled by the parade of seemingly carefree but (in some cases) titanically damaged adults who come to visit: Zelda and Scott Fitzgerald, Hemingway, and Picasso. There are also cameos by Charlie Chaplin and Cole Porter, and, at one fateful dinner party, a menacing Ezra Pound. LikeThe Durrells in Corfu, that compulsively streamable series (based on the memoirs of British naturalist Gerald Durrell),Honoriabrims with lost-world magic and youthful wisdom, depicting a Xanadu where grown-ups are inscrutable and time stands still—if only for one summer in 1929. (April 2025, Fantagraphics) –D.F. ‘The Fact Checker’ by Austin Kelley Amazon Bookshop An understated and often hilarious debut novel from Austin Kelley,The Fact Checkerexplores the mysteries beating at the heart of so many factual pursuits. Kelley’s unnamed narrator works in the eponymous role at a magazine remarkably similar toThe New Yorker,a place, incidentally, at which Kelley himself once worked as a fact-checker. In pitch-perfect detail, Kelley portrays the absurdities of office life, magazine-style, as well as the sometimes poignant, sometimes surreal, intimacies the novel’s narrator develops with a host of journalistic sources, including the actor Tony Curtis, the basketball starShaquille O’Neal, and, most notably, for a story about Manhattan’s Union Square Greenmarket, a woman named Sylvia, who works at a farm called New Egypt. The fact-checker spends a night with Sylvia while trying to get to the bottom of an ambiguous quotation she supposedly told the story’s writer. The next day, in classic detective-fiction fashion, she disappears. The narrator’s search for Sylvia and the true nature of what really goes on at the New Egypt farm propels the book forward, but the novel gains its resonance from the narrator’s attempt to resolve the elusiveness of his romantic relationships and to find an answer to the mystery that lies at the core of all of us: How should we live our lives? (2025, Grove Atlantic) —David Gendelman, Research Director ‘The Third Reich of Dreams’ by Charlotte Beradt Amazon Bookshop In the late ‘60s the now-familiar exhortation, “the personal is political” became a rallying cry signaling a new way of describing interplay between personal experience on the one hand, and larger social and political and economic structures on the other. It assumed a social contract in which the individuals can actually affect political outcomes, and, conversely, where personal choices become like a microcosm of politics writ large. First published in German in 1962, Charlotte Beradt’sThird Reich of Dreams, is as remarkable as it is timely. At first troubled by her own nightmares, the author secretly recorded dreams of her friends and neighbors, both Jewish and non-Jewish, after Hitler came to power in 1933. Concealed in the spines of books, these “diaries of the night” were smuggled out of the country one by one. Poetic yet astute in her analysis, Beradt holds a lens up to the collective unconscious; she shows that once terror and total took hold, it infiltrated the depths of the unconscious. The book demonstrates that under totalitarianism, the political becomes frighteningly personal, laying siege to perhaps the last possible realm of our private life.—Eric Miles, visuals editor ‘Painted Frames’ by Malick Sidibé Loose Joints Malick Sidibe (1935-2016) was one of the most celebrated African photographers of the 20th century. Affectionately known as the ‘Eye of Bamako’, his thriving studio was deeply embedded in the Bamako community, churning out photos that were destined for the homes of his subjects or to be sent abroad to relatives.Painted Framesadds another dimension to Sidibe’s legacy. The result of a late-career collaboration with local artisans, the frames were made using thesous-verre, or reverse-glass, technique of painting that is popular in the region. Sidibe’s portraits were intended as intimate keepsakes; equal parts status symbols and sacred artefact, they were given as gifts and shared among family. Taken together their theatrical, exuberant style captures the optimism, energy, and style of post-independence Mali as it looks toward the future. (Malick Sidibé: Regardez-moiis on view at Jack Shainman Gallery, 513 W 20th Street, New York, NY, through May 31.) —EM ‘We Do Not Part’ by Han Kang Amazon Bookshop “The time is out of joint. O cursèd spite, that ever I was born to set it right!” declares Hamlet after a visitation by his father’s ghost, who has revealed his murderer to be none other than Claudius, Hamlet’s treasonous uncle turned stepfather.Hamletwasn’t the first ghost story, but it set a certain tone. When a dead person floats in, enabling the past to haunt the present, there’s a good chance the resulting narrative will show justice being sought, and possibly, restored. Newly anointed Nobel Prize winnerHan Kang’s eleventh novel,We Do Not Part,originally published in Korean in 2021 and released this year in English, is also a ghost story in which past violence returns to haunt the living. But unlike Shakespeare, Kang’s narrative doesn’t posit that excavating buried atrocities might lead to a reckoning; rather, it explores whether justice for the dead is even possible. The little-known Jeju Uprising and Massacre (1947–54) is the real-life event that animates the plot. After the end of World War II, when it was liberated from Japan’s occupation by Allied forces, the Korean peninsula became a site of geopolitical competition between the two ascending superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union. In an extraordinary act of hubris, the US—without consulting Koreans—split the country at the 38th parallel and occupied the southern half with a military government, while leaving the northern region to the Soviet Union, an agreement that was understood as a temporary trusteeship, but devolved into two separate regimes. Many Koreans wanted unification, and a populist uprising with strong support emerged on Jeju Island, which was put under martial law, subjecting anyone found within the interior zone to summary execution—including women, children, and the elderly. By the end of 1954, at least 30,000 had been killed. Kang’s novel chronicles these horrors and their aftermath through a friendship between Kyungha and Inseon, who, on a snowy night, float between the present and the past, blurring the line between the living world and the spiritual one. The supposition the novel seems to land on is simple yet profound: No, we cannot go back and save the dead, but wecanuse our grief and knowledge of the past to save the living. At a time when multiple wars rage, it’s a worthy reminder. (2025, Hogarth)—Natasha O’Neill, digital line editor ‘A World After Liberalism’ by Matthew Rose Amazon Bookshop “No liberalism worth saving can be practiced, let alone defended, in an atmosphere of ideological bullying.” In other words, the best way to inoculate yourself and your impressionable white teenage nephew to red pilling is this bitter medicine in its theoretical, historical form—one that avoids triggering the reader with any mention of its current Trumpian current—before spitting it out. At a safe distance from the news cycle, contend with the radical right’s anti-modern allure by meeting its philosophical forefathers, with their defense of order and immutable identity, with their paeans to the pride of distinct cultures and service to a sacred hierarchy. Consider their eschewing of the constant change and chaos of a progressivism that discards all that came before in search of a boring decadent utopia. Are we not born to achieve a higher spiritual ideal than the pursuit of our own selfish happiness? Must we be deformed by the supposed universal principle of an impossible equality that denies our human nature? Must we see ourselves as unique individuals championing self-expression at the expense of responsibility to our inherited community and national heritage? Do we understand that the appeal of these ideas is elevated as they are deemed blasphemous by our universities and legacy media? Matthew Rose profiles five 20th-century hard-right thinkers and their writings with a stab at objectivity, explaining their critiques of liberalism without condoning their racism, sexism, antisemitism, and Western chauvinism. Armed with the knowledge of the right’s roots in Identitarianism and Traditionalism, we can argue with renewed vigor against both the manospheric online bro and where these white men’s insistence on a patriarchal ruling caste of ostracized civilizations will lead—making a certain pill harder for the next generation to swallow. (Aug 2021, Yale University Press) —Michael Quiñones, Copy Manager ‘Wildfire’ by Philip Cheung Kris Graves Projects As reports of fires in Los Angeles’s Pacific Palisades and Altadena neighborhoods grew in early January 2025, so did the number of photographers documenting the flames, first responders, and community-lead relief efforts. Philip Cheung, a nimble and always compelling Los Angeles-based photographer, chronicled both blazes and now has an impactful book published byKris Graves’s KGP Monolith. In Cheung’s images, LA’s inherent surreality–its colossal urban sprawl nestled between epic mountain ranges and the expanse of the Pacific Ocean, verdant succulents and spindly conifer trees growing side by side–is amplified by sheets of fire and acrid smoke. The photos cannot be reduced to mere spectacle, however. Individual homeowners with garden hoses, firefighters in their gear, and those seeking aid hold their own in the landscape around them. (May 2025, KGP) —Madison Reid, associate visuals editor ‘To The Lighthouse’ by Virginia Woolf Amazon Bookshop In her introduction to my edition, Eudora Welty wrote that readingTo The Lighthousein her youth “once and forever opened the door of imaginative fiction” for her. I brought the novel with me to an artist residency earlier this year and—having only read it once before, in college—fell under its spell. You already know the premise: Mrs. Ramsay keeps house for her husband, eight children, and various guests during a single day at the family’s summer home on Scotland’s Isle of Skye, then the events of ten years pass, and finally a few of the family members return. I had remembered the structural highwire act, the cracking open and unspooling of time, but this time around was more struck by the acute attention to domesticity, the minute interactions between the family members and friends. And maybe given my reading location, it was the meditations on writing and artmaking that I underlined most fervidly. “It was a miserable machine, an inefficient machine, she thought, the human apparatus for painting or for feeling; it always broke down at the critical moment; heroically, one must force it on.” (1927) —Keziah Weir, senior editor ‘Theory & Practice’ by Michelle de Kretser Amazon Bookshop In Melbourne, 1986, the narrator ofTheory & Practiceembarks on a literature graduate degree, thinking that she’ll spend her time sinking into the work of Virginia Woolf. Instead, she’s confronted with poststructuralist theory, a seduction with a fellow student who’s in what he calls a “deconstructed relationship” of his own, and a diary entry in which her heretofore literary idol describes a Ceylonese man as “the poor little mahogany coloured wretch”—throwing the narrator into a confusion about what she desires and expects in love, lust, and literature. But before de Kretser’s novel even gets to this intellectually probing and considerably sexy scenario, it presents not one but two different beginnings, blending fiction and nonfiction, that twice turn the narrative on its head. All this in a perfectly taut 175 pages, no less.—KW From the magazine, a taster-plate of noteworthy new nonfiction. ‘Open, Heaven’ by Seán Hewitt Amazon Bookshop ‘The Hollow Half’ by Sarah Aziza Amazon Bookshop ‘Things in Nature Merely Grow’ by Yiyun Li Amazon Bookshop ‘The Dazzling Paget Sisters’ by Ariane Bankes Amazon Bookshop ‘I Regret Almost Everything’ by Keith McNally Amazon Bookshop ‘The Emperor of Gladness’ by Ocean Vuong Amazon Bookshop HowMiriam AdelsonWent From Big MAGA Winner to Casino Loser in Trump’s First 100 Days The Truth UnderlyingPete Hegseth’s Job Security “It’s About Him”: How Trump Is Perverting thePresidential Photo Stream Inside the Case ofKim Kardashian’s Paris Robbery HowSebastian StanBecame Hollywood’s Most Daring Shape-Shifter The Ballad ofBill Belichickand Jordon Hudson JuilliardIs Going Tuition-Free Elon Musk’sBreeding SpreeIsSoMuch Wilder Than You Thought EveryQuentin TarantinoMovie, Ranked MeetElon Musk’s 14 Childrenand Their Mothers (Whom We Know of) From the Archive:Sinatra and the Mob",

    "title": "Meet Marco Calvani, Loud and Proud Breakout Star of The Four Seasons",
    "article_text": "“I don’t drink alcohol,”Marco Calvanisays while scanning a bar menu on a spacious Los Angeles restaurant patio. “Well, I promised myself that I would stay away from alcohol for a couple of months. Can you believe it?” He’s asking because there’s been a lot of partying and socializing as he gears up for the rollout ofThe Four Seasons—Netflix’s new comedy series cocreated by and starringTina Fey,and based onAlan Alda’s 1981 film. Calvani spent last fall shooting the series; he spent the winter in upstate New York, working on a new project with his writing partner. He then flew to Brazil to be with his husband, Brazilian actorMarco Pigossi,who was shooting a new film. “Now we are happily rebuilding a routine,” Calvani says before ordering a mocktail. “I just started going to the gym again. It’s been two weeks. I hired a personal trainer. I’m serious—for two months I know that I’ll be here, so I’m committed.” If you didn’t know any better, it might sound like being in Hollywood is getting to Calvani.The Four Seasonsmarks his first acting credit in more than a decade, providing what is easily the highest-profile role of his career: He stars alongside industry heavy hitters like Fey,Steve Carell,andColman Domingo,who plays Calvani’s husband. But 44-year-old Calvani, who has lived in the US since 2013, doesn’t seem fazed. He’s ebullient in person, as warm and dishy as hisFour Seasonscharacter, Claude, who (mostly) maintains a bright smile even as his marriage hits a few rough patches. The performance feels so effortless that you’d never guess that Calvani stepped away from acting long ago. Still, the question remains: How did Calvani—a distinguished international playwright and theater director who just earned raves for his feature film directorial debut,High Tide—get involved with this A-list crowd when he had no plans to act again? Colman Domingo as Danny and Marco Calvani as Claude inThe Four Seasons. Calvani and Pigossi first met Domingo and his husband,Raúl,at an event for the LGBTQ+ nonprofit Family Equality in 2023. They chatted aimlessly, exchanged numbers, and then ran into each other again later that night at a house party hosted byNatasha Lyonne.That’s where they really hit it off: “We just sat down and we smoked cigarettes and talked and danced,” Calvani says. The couples stayed in touch; the following year, Domingo suddenly asked Calvani to put himself on tape. Calvani never told Domingo that he was a former actor. Domingo did not tell Calvani what the project was either. “I was like, I think Colman needs me for one of his projects with some of his friends—he needs an Italian who brings a plate of lasagna and says something Italian, then ciao,” Calvani says. “Two days later, I read this thing. It felt too big to be true—and too big forme.It sounds awful and awkward to say this now, but if I look back, I was scared.” But he went for it anyway. Calvani was in Provincetown when he got his officialFour Seasonscallback. He descended into his producer’s basement to act out scenes for Fey et al. again, and later officially landed the part. He’s spent the last few months thinking about why Domingo asked him to get on this ride in the first place. “I am joyful when I’m with people. If I’m not joyful, if I don’t feel like being positive, I just stay home. I think he and Raúl saw that enthusiasm and joie de vivre, and apparently I was a perfect host and a little bit of a clown too,” Calvani says between sips. “I don’t know if he was conscious of it, but I think Colman also felt that he was getting into a new territory himself, in this type of comedy…. I felt everybody was stretching their own skills.” Calvani thought he was done with acting way back in 2000, when he was still living in Florence. He wasn’t getting the greatest offers, to put it mildly, and his goal had always been to make his own stuff anyway. In fact, Calvani only set his sights on acting as a preteen because he’d heard someone say—he can’t remember when or where—that to be a great director, you needed to be a great actor first. “I started acting, and then I completely forgot that I wanted to be a director,” he says. Theater reminded him. Calvani wrote his first play in 2002, just after turning 21, and became incredibly prolific. He built a theater company. He started thinking about directing in the mid-2000s, around when he wrote his fourth play, then eventually took on larger productions on both sides of the Atlantic, including a fewNeil LaButeplays in New York. In 2017 he made a short movie,The View From Up Here,starring Oscar winnerMelissa Leo. His style of writing is politically charged and dramatically intense, with a strong emotional undercurrent. Until recently, it was not particularly queer. “I didn’t want to be a ‘gay writer.’ I didn’t want to be a ‘gay director.’ I realized that I was getting a lot of internalized homophobia within me,” Calvani says. “I’ve been a gay man all my life and a storyteller for most of it—25 years almost. I never put gay characters at the center of my stories. It never occurred to me to use that platform.” He catches me curiously nodding along. “It’s interesting, right? I think it’s actually crazy.” Things changed during the pandemic. Calvani was turning 40, living in New York, and feeling alienated. “I was a gay immigrant in a country that I didn’t understand anymore, and I stopped understanding myself,” he says. Calvani started writingHigh Tide,a feature about an adrift undocumented immigrant from Brazil looking for connection in Provincetown. “High Tidecame out of this need of finding my place again in a world that was changing very radically,” he explains. The resulting movie is dreamy, sexy, and boisterously gay. It stars Pigossi, who was Calvani’s partner at the time, as well as decorated American actorsMarisa TomeiandBill Irwin.It traveled the festival circuit last year and earned raves, currently sitting at 100% on Rotten Tomatoes. So Calvani was just beginning an auspicious filmmaking career when Domingo and Fey came calling.The Four Seasonswasn’t something he’d ever say no to, of course, but doing the series came with sacrifices. Calvani had to put off completing his second feature script, and mostly bowed out of theHigh Tidepress tour. “That was the toughest thing to accept. It wasn’t just, I’m back to acting—it was, I’m back to acting at the moment where my baby is coming out, and I cannot be there for it.” The production found a way for him to jet to the film’s international premiere in Rio de Janeiro before immediately returning; he made it to a few other festivals nearby. But for the most part, everything was happening simultaneously. One day during shooting onThe Four Seasons,The New York TimesreviewedHigh Tideand designated it a critic’s pick. “It was Tina’s idea to call me CP,” Calvani says. “I was CP on set. ‘Where is CP? Where is CP?’” When Calvani first got scripts forThe Four Seasons,he bristled. “All I could read was episode one, and I was like, It feels dumb to me. Why am I playing a dumb character? I couldn’t see the layers that were boiling already underneath,” he says. “Claude was written to be very flamboyant and very loud. This is my grandmother talking, but he’s verygay.” Calvani was concerned about playing a stereotype. That old hesitancy about leaning into his queerness started rearing its head again. But seeing his costars venture outside of their own comfort zones—Domingo doing comedy, Fey operating in a less joke-heavy key—gave Calvani the confidence to do his thing too. “I had an idea that being an actor was just not being afraid of anything and just being able to access everything. And to see Tina and everyone else, day one, being as nervous as I was—it was refreshing,” he says. Calvani also worked to refine his character, imbuing him with authenticity. “All the Italian-ness that’s left in the script and onscreen in the episode, it’s real,” he says. “It’s me. That’s who we are. We overreact. We are loud.” Coming out of the show, Calvani is hardly seeking his next acting project; his real hope is that theFour SeasonsPR boost helps get his next movie off the ground, given the tough climate for indie financing. But he’s open to more onscreen work, should another offer like this come his way. It’ll be tough for anything to to live up to theFour Seasonsexperience, though. The cast bonded and became fast friends. “It has an emotional depth that you don’t quite see at the beginning,” Calvani says. “We all really went deep with each other in the most organic way.” Calvani and Domingo especially radiate a moving, lived-in chemistry that remains all too rare among queer couples on television. Getting to that place required Calvani, again, to look inward—and confront some personal fears. As a US resident on a green card, the actor says he feels afraid these days just walking the streets without a passport, considering the current political climate. He’s thought hard about putting himself out there on a big-ticket show like this one, playing a proud queer immigrant. “To play an openly gay character in a pretty normalized and successful relationship on TV, and use my whole body and my face and my voice—I was scared at a time like this,” he says. He lets that heavy reality sit for a moment before beaming once again. “But maybe Claude is my resistance. Maybe that’s what I can do.” HowMiriam AdelsonWent From Big MAGA Winner to Casino Loser in Trump’s First 100 Days The Truth UnderlyingPete Hegseth’s Job Security “It’s About Him”: How Trump Is Perverting thePresidential Photo Stream Inside the Case ofKim Kardashian’s Paris Robbery HowSebastian StanBecame Hollywood’s Most Daring Shape-Shifter The Ballad ofBill Belichickand Jordon Hudson JuilliardIs Going Tuition-Free Elon Musk’sBreeding SpreeIsSoMuch Wilder Than You Thought EveryQuentin TarantinoMovie, Ranked MeetElon Musk’s 14 Childrenand Their Mothers (Whom We Know of) From the Archive:Sinatra and the Mob",

    "title": "Another Simple Favor’s Bonkers Ending, Explained",
    "article_text": "One of the biggest reveals in the tangled web that is2018’sA Simple Favor—the campyPaul Feigthriller starringAnna Kendrickas upbeat mommy blogger turned amateur sleuth Stephanie—comes when she learns that the enigmatic woman with whom she’s obsessed,Blake Lively’s dressed-to-kill Emily, is an identical twin. Even better, she’s a triplet whose third sister sadly died at birth, Emily says in a throwaway line that turns out to be the key to unlocking the newsequelAnother Simple Favor,now streaming on Prime Video. Seven years after the events of the first film, Stephanie is promoting her book,The Faceless Blonde,which details how Emily landed in prison for murdering her father and twin sister, as well as shooting her husband, Sean (Henry Golding), and attempting to kill Stephanie for uncovering her crimes. (Stephanie also slept with Sean while Emily was away killing said twin sister for the insurance money.) But interest in the scandal has waned, and Stephanie could use some inspiration for a sequel. Right on cue, Emily crashes Stephanie’s sparsely attended reading and reveals not only that she’s been released from prison, but that she’s getting married to the Mob—or at least a member of it: Italian businessman Dante (Michele Morrone,best known for Netflix’s365 Dayserotic thrillers). Emily demands that Stephanie be her maid of honor at their wedding in Capri. Should she refuse, “I’ll sue you into oblivion,” Emily vows. The frenemies trade jabs and sip cocktails, burdened only by the drunken exploits of Sean, who grumbles about having to accompany his and Emily’s son Nicky (Ian Ho) to the wedding. Then Sean is fatally injected with drugs while taking a shower in his hotel room, and more bodies follow. Dante falls into an exploding brick house of fireworks shortly after marrying Emily; a hapless FBI agent (Taylor Ortega) investigating the murders is stabbed. Stephanie is blamed for the killings, detained by local authorities and put on house arrest. But in reality, Stephanie is innocent. And so is Emily. Because the real Emily is actually locked away in a hotel room—and her believed-to-be-dead sister Charity, also played by Lively, is actually alive, and has been posing as Emily for most of the trip. Before we keep going, here’s a refresher on Emily’s demented family tree. She was born Faith McLanden—sister to Hope, who would spiral downward into addiction as an adult, and Charity, who was presumably stillborn. The girls’ devoutly religious mother, Margaret (Elizabeth Perkinstaking over forJean Smart,a casting change explained with a witty line about having work done), believes her offspring are demonic and killed their third sister in the womb. She turns a blind eye to her husband’s abusive treatment of Faith and Hope. The sisters eventually burn down the family home and kill their father, splintering apart to hide from the cops until the events ofA Simple Favor. The sequel reveals that Emily’s long-lost Aunt Linda (Allison Janney), who delivered the triplets, also kidnapped Charity right after she was born, raising her in secret. Given that she was mothered in the shadows by a total lunatic who used her as bait while conning various men, Charity is rather stunted. Lively speaks in asexy babyvoice in the role of a woman raised to brutally kill people so that Mommy can take their cash. The deranged pair’s latest ruse is to kill Emily and frame Stephanie so that they can seize Dante’s family fortunes. What Linda doesn’t bargain for is Charity’s strange fixation on her only living sibling. In an icky turn that goes even further than anything onThe White Lotusseason three, Charity tells Emily that she wants to bring her pleasure, murmuring something about both of them “being one” before drugging and molesting her sister. It’s a very disconcerting Lively-on-Lively sexual encounter that—let’s face it—reallydidn’t need to be in this movie. Soon, Emily and Stephanie each escape their respective traps and reunite. First, Stephanie taunts Emily, calling her a “sister fucker”—a callback to the first film, where Emilyrepeatedly, very justifiably teasesStephanie for sleeping with her own half-brother. Then Emily admits that her marriage to Dante was a total sham. She was supposed to wed him only to help Dante cover up his secret affair with his lover Matteo Bartolo (Lorenzo de Moor), a member of a rival Mob family. Both women are lured to a cliffside by Charity and Linda, who have a weapon pointed at tween-age Nicky’s head. Emily takes advantage of Charity’s creepy feelings towards her, convincing her sister with another groan-inducing kiss to keep both Nicky and Stephanie alive. Charity takes the bait, pushing Linda off the cliff and inexplicably agreeing to publicly take blame for every murder and return to prison as “Emily.” This nonsensical choice—everything could be sorted out by some fingerprint testing, ladies!—forces real Emily (née Faith) back into hiding, while Stephanie writes her next book and raises Nicky alongside her own son Miles (Joshua Satine,who’s been blissfully occupied at summer camp this whole time). In one final absurdity, Emily is shown roaming the streets of Italy unencumbered by any of the trauma she’s just faced or the separation from her son—wearing perhaps the most eye-catching outfit costume designerRenee Ehrlich Kalfushas ever created for these movies, with not even a baseball cap or hair-dye change to disguise her. (DeuxMoiwould have been onto Emily in a second!) While taking her midnight stroll, Emily runs into Dante’s mother, Portia (Elena Sofia Ricci), who confirms that she knows her true identity (duh) and hands her an envelope, telling her: “I have another simple favor to ask you.” With two of the three triplets alive and Emily’s next chapter as a Mafia lieutenant introduced, a third, perhaps even more bewildering movie could very well be on its way. All future character siblings beware.

    "title": "How the Women of F1 Academy Are Gunning for Racing’s Top Ranks",
    "article_text": "Courtney Crone has been on wheels since she was just a few years old. Her father had been a competitive driver, but success in motorsports is highly correlated with money. When his funds ran low, he started maintaining vintage cars for a living. Eventually, he passed the bug to his only child, a daughter, which allowed him to poke at the traditional expectations for such passions’ heirs. “He likes to joke,” Crone recalls, “and say I was this little boy and he put me on a motorcycle and it all took off from there.” Now 24, Crone belongs to a class of young women drivers at the elite tier of a steep hierarchy. Beginning this year she will compete in F1 Academy, a female-only racing series founded by Formula 1 in 2023 with an eye toward preparing its drivers to aim higher still—ideally, all the way up to F1 itself, long an all-male competition. Chambers prepares to get behind the wheel. Racing at these levels is intensely niche and intrinsically neurotic. Crone fits a recognizable pattern: bred nearly from birth and, by her own account, engaged in a lifelong mental tactical battle against herself. When we spoke she was at the Thermal Club near Palm Springs, California, a country club with a racetrack where she coaches. “Every driver’s individual in what makes them tick,” she says, including, in some instances, “just pure chaos, angry behind the wheel.” That struggle makes for great reality TV, as it turns out. The Netflix docuseriesFormula 1: Drive to Survive,which premiered in 2019, put aReal Housewivessheen on the sport’s psychological aspects, ratcheting up its anxieties and rivalries. The show made F1, in all its European trappings, a genuine pop culture phenomenon in America, with new races in Las Vegas and Miami, and created a fresh global fan base primed to understand athletes as celebrities above all else. F1 Academy managing director Susie Wolff, a former pro driver and aDrive to Survivestar in her own right—she is married to Mercedes’s billionaire team principal, Toto Wolff—saw an opportunity in the surge. Like many leading players in the sport, she lives in Monaco, but was in her London office when she reflected on her own path. “I didn’t have any outstanding female role models,” she says. Her parents encouraged her to “achieve anything that my brother could achieve,” she continues, “but I do think in this day and age I would’ve benefited hugely from having a role model that had done what I would want to achieve.” “ONE OF THE THINGS THAT EVERY DRIVER GOES THROUGH IS HAVING THE OFF-TRACK STUFF BE MORE WORK THAN THE ON-TRACK.” This year, as it gears up for its third go-around, F1 Academy will attempt to tap into the entertainment space thatDrive to Survivecarved out. Reese Witherspoon’s production company, Hello Sunshine, trailed the competitors during the second season, and a docuseries will premiere on Netflix later this year. Wolff emphasizes that she wouldn’t have wanted to be involved in the academy if she felt that it was “a diversity box-ticking exercise.” While F1 is the rare sport in which gender does not amount to a physical edge, it is rooted in long-running traditions and entrenched pipelines, especially at its upper rungs. But the profile of what makes for a successful F1 driver has begun to shift—or at least, the Netflix-viewing public has begun to acquire a different view of it. “One of the things that every driver goes through,” Chloe Chambers tells me, “is having the off-track stuff be more work than the on-track.” Chambers, 20, was born in China and raised in New York’s Hudson Valley, where her British-born adoptive father was an F1 enthusiast. When she was still in grade school, they found a track near their house and she got started. Ambitious as she was, the public-facing side of the job didn’t come naturally. “I definitely was way more on the quiet, shy side than I am now,” Chambers says. “As I’ve grown up, I’ve gained that confidence to go out and speak to people and be able to turn on my social mode.” Last season she went with Amna and Hamda Al Qubaisi, Emirati-born F1 Academy drivers and sisters, to their grandmother's house, where she spent time with birds, deer, turtles, dogs, and goats. The Witherspoon-backed cameras were rolling. “Before, I’d say, ‘Oh yeah, I’m going to go race at whatever F1 race,’ ” Chambers says, remembering interactions with classmates, “and they’d be like, ‘Oh, that's cool, but we don’t get it.’ ” “But now I post on social media,” she goes on, “and I get a bunch of messages from people that I went to high school with.” Since its premiere,Drive to Survivehas spawned a crowd of imitators. The show did not invent the behind-the scenes confessional style of sports documentary, but its runaway success in popularizing F1 has hardened the format into a distinctly modern genre, particularly in more esoteric competitive corners. There are now similarly conceived shows about professional surfing, rugby, golf, NASCAR, and tennis. Wolff’s favorite, she tells me, isTour de France: Unchained,another Netflix production that follows professional cyclists. THE SPORT’S UP-AND-COMING ATHLETES…ARE INCREASINGLY AWARE THAT THEIR RESULTS ON THE TRACK WILL ONLY ACCOUNT FOR A PORTION OF THEIR OVERALL PERFORMANCE. “That’s one of the challenges,” she says. “There’s so much content out there, there’s so much different sports. How do we break through and actually create our own fan base that people are tuning in to watch F1 Academy, that they’re educated as to what we are and why we exist?” The sport’s up-and-coming athletes, who grew up on social media, are increasingly aware that their results on the track will only account for a portion of their overall performance. In May 2020 the late rally driver Ken Block had his 13-year-old daughter, Lia, riding shotgun. The goal was to teach her to do doughnuts. He explained the technique and demonstrated. When Lia got behind the wheel, the camera caught bits of apprehension—but mostly enthusiasm. “That’s it,” Ken said near the end of his YouTube video about the exercise. “She struggled a bit but she did it, and I’m really stoked.” “My dad, most of his career was built around social media,” Lia Block tells me from her home in Park City, Utah. Ken, who also cofounded DC Shoes, found his most devout audience on YouTube. “It’s the thing to get sponsorship and get funding because motorsport, especially the F1 world, is very expensive,” Lia says. “That’s the reason why it’s so elite and not everybody can do it.” She has a composed and easy manner, a counterpoint to her self-identification as an “adrenaline junkie.” Block, who turned 18 in October and was competing in rally races by 15, was in some sense anointed. After her father’s death in a 2023 snowmobile accident, his friend and X Games star Travis Pastrana described her as a natural heir. The legacy didn’t seem to weigh on her. “You have to have some sort of fearlessness with some things,” she says, almost offhandedly. “But you also have to be dedicated. It has to be something that you want so bad that you will do anything to get it.” In this new era of F1—of most sports with commercial designs—it is a necessary attribute but perhaps not a sufficient one. The competition is the other drivers, but it is also the other Netflix series and online personalities. Still, Block thinks her prospects and those of the young women around her will ultimately hinge on a more timeless matter. “It’s such a big game playing chicken back and forth with yourself in the car,” she says. “You’re having to push those limits that usually aren’t pushed.” HAIR, LEAH CASO; MAKEUP, DANIELA GOZLAN.

Parents who had paid thousands of Hong Kong dollars in advance for their children’s vaccination at clinics under Alliance Medical Group scrambled to arrange jabs elsewhere, while the consumer watchdog on Thursday expressed “deep concern” and urged the chain to clarify its operational status. The group, which had two clinics in Tsim Sha Tsui and Sha Tin, has not officially announced its closure, but its accounts on Facebook and Instagram were no longer available as of Thursday. A WhatsApp screenshot image circulating online showed that a part-time worker was told by the group that it would cease operations from May 1. Phone calls to the group on Thursday were transferred to a voice message, which said it was closed on Sundays and public holidays. Thursday was the Labour Day public holiday in Hong Kong. The Post also visited its Tsim Sha Tsui outlet, which was closed, but furniture and other items remained.",

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 1, 2025 / 1:16 PM EDT/ CBS News Publishers Clearing House is known for giving money away in sweepstakes and other contests. Now it's offering a different kind of payout — a refund for customers who may have been deceived by the direct marketing company. The Federal Trade Commission said Wednesday that the agency has mailed checks totalingover $18 millionto nearly 282,000 PCH consumers who the FTC says were misled by the Jericho, New York, company's \"deceptive and unfair\" practices. Specifically, regulators alleged in a 2023lawsuitthat PCH used \"dark patterns\" to trick customers into thinking they had to make a purchase to enter the sweepstakes, or increase their odds of winning. The FTC also said PCH sent emails to people with deceptive subject lines suggesting they were related to official government documents, like tax forms. Christopher Irving, vice president of consumer and legal affairs at PCH, noted in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch that, while refund checks are going out now, the FTC's complaint and settlement are from two years ago. \"While we disagreed with the FTC's assertions at the time, we were glad to have resolved the matter and move forward continuing to do what we do best — provide consumers fun entertainment and games powered by our famous chance to win,\" he said. In a 2023 consumeralertafter the lawsuit was announced, the FTC reminded Americans that it is illegal for a company to tell people they are required to pay to enter a sweepstakes contest. Only PCH customers who clicked on one of the allegedly misleading emails and ordered a product are eligible for a refund, the FTC said.

    "title": "Divided Supreme Court weighs effort to create first religious charter school",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 30, 2025 / 9:00 PM EDT/ CBS News Washington —TheSupreme Courton Wednesday appeared divided over efforts in Oklahoma to create an online Catholiccharter school, a case that could open the door to public dollars flowing directly to religious schools. A ruling in favor of the school, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, could lead to the country's first religious charter school and upend laws in at least 45 states and the District of Columbia, as well as the federal charter school program, all of which require charter schools to be nonsectarian, Oklahoma's Republican attorney general, Gentner Drummond, has warned. Eight of the nine justices are considering the case, as Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself. Following arguments, it seemed likely that the outcome hinges on Chief Justice John Roberts, who focused on the level of state involvement in its charter school program during the arguments. If the Supreme Court deadlocks 4-4, it would leave intact the decision of the Oklahoma Supreme Court, which ruled that the contract establishing St. Isidore's as a Catholic charter school was a violation of state and federal law. Justices Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh appeared most sympathetic to St. Isidore's argument that excluding it from Oklahoma's charter school system unconstitutionally discriminated against the school. Kavanuagh said religious institutions can't be treated as \"second class\" and said keeping sectarian schools from operating charter schools, when the program is open to nonreligious private entities, seems like \"rank discrimination\" based on religion. \"They're not asking for special treatment. They're not asking for favoritism. They're just saying don't treat us worse because we're religious,\" he said of the school. But the three liberal justices, Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, seemed concerned that a decision allowing the religious charter school would weaken the wall between church and state. \"The state is running these schools,\" Kagan said. Jackson said charter schools are \"a creation and creature of the state.\" But there was some concern about how a ruling allowing St. Isidore's to be established as a religious charter school would impact the systems in other states, and specifically the level of oversight and control over them. Justice Neil Gorsuch warned such a result could lead states to impose more requirements on charter schools, such as mandating public officials to serve on their boards and boosting state involvement in their creation. \"Have you thought about that boomerang effect?\" he asked James Campbell, who argued on behalf of the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board, which joined St. Isidore's in the case. A decision will follow the Supreme Court'sthreerulings inrecentyears that were in favor of religious plaintiffs, which all allowed public funds to be used for religious institutions. \"This would really be the first time that the Supreme Court sanctions, if it rules in favor of the charter school, the direct flow of funds from the government and financial support from the government to a religious entity for religious activities,\" said Jessie Hill, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University who focuses on the law and religion. St. Isidore, she said, is asking the state to \"quite literally establish a religious school. It's essentially making a religious school, creating an affiliation between the religious entity and the state that we haven't seen before.\" But backers of St. Isidore argue that its position is simply an application of those decisions and would not create any new principles. \"The unifying thread is the idea that once the government decides to open up a program and to distribute benefits or to contract with people, it can't single out religious people or institutions for special disadvantage,\" said Richard Garnett, a professor at Notre Dame Law School who directs its Program on Church, State and Society. Oklahoma has offered charter schools within its public education system since 1999 and, like at least 44 other states and the federal charter school program, requires the institutions to be \"nonsectarian in its programs, admission policies, employment practices, and all other operations.\" The state has at least 30 charter schools that serve more than 50,000 students, and they received $314 million from the state and $69 million in federal funds in the 2022 to 2023 school year, according to a2023 reportfrom the Oklahoma State Department of Education. In January 2023, the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa formed the St. Isidore of Seville Virtual Charter School Inc. for the purpose of establishing and operating St. Isidore as a Catholic school, according to court records. That May, St. Isidore applied to the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board to establish it as a virtual charter school that \"fully embraces the teachings of the Catholic Church's Magisterium\" and \"fully incorporates these [teachings] into every aspect of the school.\" The school estimated initial enrollment of 500 students and projected it would receive roughly $2.7 million in state funding for its first year of operation,according to court documents. Ahead of a vote by the board, Drummondwarnedagainst approval of St. Isidore's application, and said anearlier analysisfrom his predecessor supporting the school could be \"used as a basis for taxpayer-funded religious schools, which is exactly what [St. Isidore] seeks to become.\" Drummond also warned that approving St. Isidore's application to become a charter school \"will create a slippery slope.\" \"I doubt most Oklahomans would want their tax dollars to fund a religious school whose tenets are diametrically opposed to their own faith,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, the approval of a charter school by one faith will compel the approval of charter schools by all faiths, including even those most Oklahomans would consider reprehensible and unworthy of public funding.\" Still, the charter school board voted 3-2 to approve St. Isidore's application, and in October 2023, it and the school entered in a contract establishing St. Isidore's as a charter school. That month, Drummond sued the board directly in the Oklahoma Supreme Court and asked it to rescind the charter contract and declare St. Isidore's establishment as a charter school unlawful. The attorney general prevailed before the state's highest court, which ruled that because St. Isidore's is a public charter school, it violated the state's requirement that those entities be nonreligious, as well as the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, in part because it would \"permit state spending in direct support of the religious curriculum and activities within St. Isidore.\" \"The state will be directly funding a religious school and encouraging students to attend it,\" the Oklahoma Supreme Court, which split 6-2,found. The Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board and St. Isidore's both asked the Supreme Court to review the decision, and it agreed to do so in January. The Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has in a string of recent decisions sided with religious families and institutions that challenged state-funded programs for excluding religious beneficiaries as violations of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. In 2017, the court said that Missouri violated the free exercise right of Trinity Lutheran Church Child Learning Center when it denied it grant funding to resurface its playground. Then, in 2020, the Supreme Court ruled that Montana could not exclude religious schools from a program providing tax credits to people who donate to scholarships for private-school students. Most recently, in 2022, the Supreme Court saidMaine cannot limita tuition assistance program to nonsectarian schools. Citing those decisions, Roberts said the programs at issue in Missouri, Montana and Maine were also creations and creatures of the state. But he also said they involved \"fairly discrete\" state involvement, as opposed to the \"much more comprehensive involvement\" of Oklahoma in funding and overseeing its charter schools. Infilingswith the Supreme Court, Drummond argued that the justices have drawn a clear line through those decisions: If the state offers tuition assistance that parents can direct to the school of their choosing, it cannot exclude religious private schools. But when it comes to public schools, he said, states can provide a secular education. Drummond said the Supreme Court has never held that the Constitution's Establishment Clause allows \"direct aid for religious instruction in public schools,\" and added that creating and funding a religious public school would violate that provision of the First Amendment. \"Religious education is an invaluable benefit for millions of Americans who choose it,\" Drummond wrote. \"But our Constitution has never required the creation of religious public schools. There is no basis to change that now.\" He warned that if the Supreme Court rules for St. Isidore, \"state funds will pour into religious public charter schools just as they do traditional public schools,\" and the firewall between public funds flowing to a school because of private choice versus a direct subsidy would be damaged. \"A ruling for petitioners would eliminate the buffer this court has long enforced between religious instruction and public schools — including in areas where charter schools are the only or default public-school option,\" Drummond argued, noting that the issue is direct aid. A crucial question in the court fight is whether Oklahoma's charter schools are public schools. Drummond says they are, because the state's charter schools have to comply with anti-discrimination laws; they are free, open to all students, created and funded by the state, and are subject to government regulation and oversight regarding curriculum, testing and other issues. And because charter schools are public schools, the attorney general said they are government entities. Gregory Garre, who argued on behalf of Drummond, said that St. Isidore's is seeking special status compared to secular charter schools, because it said it can only comply with laws that are consistent with its constitutional rights as a religious school under the direction of the Catholic Church. He warned that a decision in favor of the school would render the laws in nearly all states and the federal charter school program unconstitutional because they all require charter schools to be nonsectarian. Such an outcome would \"create uncertainty, confusion and disruption\" for the millions of charter school students across the country. He warned that allowing religious institutions to participate in state charter school systems would open the door to more litigation over issues like who can be admitted, who can teach at the schools and over their curriculum. But lawyers for the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board and St. Isidore disagree. Backing them in the case are Oklahoma's GOP governor,Kevin Stitt, and the state superintendent of public instruction, Ryan Walters. The board and school said St. Isidore is a privately operated school providing free publicly funded education through a contract with the state, and the Free Exercise Clause protects its right to participate in the charter school program. \"The state did not design the school. It did not create or encourage St. Isidore's religious character. It did not appoint any member of St. Isidore's board. It did not instruct the school to offer an education in the Catholic tradition. And it will not hire or supervise the school's teachers and administrators,\" lawyers for St. Isidore wrote in a filing. Campbell, who argued on behalf of the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board, told the justices that St. Isidore's was created not by the state, but by two Catholic organizations, and it's controlled by a privately selected board of directors. The restrictions in state law, lawyers for St. Isidore's and the charter school board said, amount to unconstitutional religious discrimination because Oklahoma is excluding religious observers from otherwise available public benefits and programs. And because the state's charter school program is neutrally administered, the Establishment Clause doesn't prevent public dollars from flowing to religious schools. \"This is particularly true when private choice directs government dollars to religious schools,\" they said. Garnett, of Notre Dame Law School, said that public money would only go to St. Isidore if a parent made the choice to send their child to the virtual school. \"If the court thinks that what Oklahoma has done is create a program that private entities are eligible to participate in, then it's straightforward to say once they do that, they can't discriminate on the basis of religion,\" he said. But professor Hill, like Drummond, said charter schools are public schools, and warned there's always been a line where the Supreme Court did not allow the direct flow of government funds to religious schools for religious instruction. She said the case is part of a progression that began with the Supreme Court's 2017 ruling and comes as traditional public schools are being starved of resources in many states. \"The agenda has been to require, not just allow, direct government funding of religious schools in particular,\" she said. \"Vouchers are one thing, but I do think it's a major breach in the wall of separation if the charter school wins.\" Barrett's recusal from the case could create a situation in which the Supreme Court renders a 4-4 decision, leaving the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruling intact. She did not provide a reason for her stepping aside, though it may be because the Notre Dame Law School's Religious Liberty Clinic is representing St. Isidore. Barrett taught at Notre Dame before she was appointed to the federal bench and was an adjunct professor at the law school in 2023, according to her most recent financial disclosure report. Barrett is also close friends with Nicole Stelle Garnett, an associate dean at Notre Dame Law School who authored apaperthat suggested that as a result of a June 2020 Supreme Court ruling, states with charter schools must permit religious charter schools or risk violating the Free Exercise Clause. A decision is expected by the end of June or early July. Melissa Quinn is a politics reporter for CBSNews.com.

    "title": "RT journalist speaks out after deportation from Romania (VIDEO)",
    "article_text": "The Romanian authorities accused RT journalist Chay Bowes of representing a security threat before deporting him from Bucharest on Thursday. The Irish reporter was taken by police from a flight from Dublin that had arrived in the Romanian capital, where he had traveled to cover the upcoming re-run of the presidential election. Bowes was put on a plane to Istanbul later that day. Shortly after touching down in Bucharest, a group of police officers walked onto the tarmac and boarded the plane, Bowes said. “They asked the cabin crew where I was. I identified myself, and three police came on to the plane and told me that I had to come with them, [and] that I was being detained,”he said after arriving in Istanbul. As other passengers watched“with amazement,”police escorted Bowes for an interrogation.“I was asked questions in the vehicle by the officers –where I was going and who I was going to meet. I told them I was a journalist. They wanted to know who I was going to speak to, which I declined to tell them. I said I’m here to cover the election.” Bowes said he was then taken to“a smaller interrogation room with two chairs and a table.” I was presented with a document, which was presumably stamped by a judge. They wouldn’t let me have a copy of it. They wouldn’t let me take a photograph of it. It said that I was a threat to the security of the state, and on that basis they were deporting me from Romania. Bowes denounced the deportation as a“fundamental breach”of his rights as a journalist and an EU citizen.“I entered the country completely legally – to do my job. This is really quite shocking,”he said. The presidential election in Romania will take place over two rounds on May 4 and 18. The dates were set in January after Romania’s Constitutional Court annulled the results of the initial vote held in November 2024. The original first round had been won by independent candidate Calin Georgescu, a vocal NATO critic and opponent of supplying weapons to Ukraine, who received 23% of the vote. Romania’s top court, however, cited“irregularities”in his campaign and referenced intelligence reports alleging Russian interference, which Moscow denied. It later emerged that a TikTok influencer campaign had been funded not by the Kremlin, but by the pro-EU Romanian National Liberal Party, which has governed the country for much of the past three decades. Its most prominent member, Nicolae Ciuca, was a losing candidate in the November election.",

    "article_text": "Neither democracy nor a free press exists in modern European NATO nations, journalist and ‘Going Underground’ host Afshin Rattansi has told RT. In an interview on Thursday he was asked to comment on the deportation of RT correspondent Chay Bowes from Romania. The journalist was detained upon arrival in Bucharest as he was on his way to cover the Romanian presidential election. The upcoming vote is a re-run, since last year’s election was controversially annulled following a shock win by far-right NATO skeptic Calin Georgescu, who ran as an independent candidate. Bowes’ arrest and deportation highlight“the totalitarianism of Western Europe,”Rattansi said. “The fact is: there is no democracy in these NATO nations because there is no free press. There is no free journalism,”he added. The attacks on the press in Western Europe are aimed at controlling voters’ access to information, Rattansi said. “The importance of the European Union and Britain in clamping down on journalism is to prevent their publics from understanding the issues so they can’t cast a vote with an informed opinion,”he said. On the other hand, media companies such as the BBC and Sky News are allowed in Russia, the journalist added. “They want to detain people like Chay Bowes, who reports for RT, has a show on RT. They want to detain him because they want to stop free press,”Rattansi said.",

    "title": "Ukraine willing to ‘de facto’ cede land to Russia – Trump envoy",
    "article_text": "Kiev has agreed to acknowledge Russia’s control over Crimea and four other regions – without formally recognizing Moscow’s sovereignty over them – according to US President Donald Trump’s special envoy, Keith Kellogg. In an interview on Wednesday, Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum asked Kellogg whether the US could accept Moscow’s demand that Ukraine renounce claims to territories it considers to be under Russian occupation. “Partially, yes,”Kellogg replied.“Look, the Ukrainians, Martha, have already said – they’re willing to give up the land… not de jure – forever – but de facto because the Russians actually occupied it. They’ve agreed to that,”he said.“They told me that last week.” Kellogg added that Ukraine wants a ceasefire that would mean“you sit on the ground that you currently hold.” The envoy said he met with Ukrainian officials in London on April 23 and that they had agreed to“22 concrete terms”presented by the US, including a 30-day comprehensive ceasefire. He urged Moscow to“pick up on”the proposal. Russia, however, has maintained that a full ceasefire would require Ukraine to halt its mobilization campaign and stop accepting military aid from abroad. President Vladimir Putin has also demanded that Kiev withdraw from the Russian territories it still claims. Moscow has accused Ukraine of repeatedly violating a 30-day ‘energy truce’ brokered by Trump in March, as well as last month’s 30-hour Easter truce. Crimea voted to secede from Ukraine and join Russia shortly after the 2014 US-backed coup in Kiev. The Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk, along with the regions of Kherson and Zaporozhye, followed suit after referendums in 2022. The agreement proposed by Washington reportedly includes US recognition of Russian sovereignty over Crimea, freezing the conflict along the current front lines, and acknowledging Moscow’s control over large parts of the four other former Ukrainian regions. The deal would also reportedly block Ukraine from joining NATO and initiate a phased removal of the sanctions on Russia.",

    "title": "Does Timothée Chalamet’s Kobe T-Shirt Mean He’s Cheating on the Knicks?",
    "article_text": "We don’t need to tell you twice thatTimothée Chalametloves his New York Knicks. But it can’t be easy for Timmy, as a native Manhattanite and longtime basketball fan, to navigate the tension of a bicoastal romance. Chalamet’s girlfriend, Kylie Jenner, has lived in Los Angeles her whole life, and her family has a longstanding allegiance to the Los Angeles Lakers. He’s a fixture of Madison Square Garden’s Celebrity Row; she’s been known to sit courtside at the ol’ Crypto.com Arena. And Chalamet, being the famous person and documentedhoops enjoyerthat he is, has been all over these NBA playoffs as of late. Last week, the moptopped actor ventured to Detroit for Game 3 of the Knicks’ series against the Pistons, digesting New York’s hard-fought win alongside fellow superfan Ben Stiller. As a highly connectedKnicks fanwith a love of Being Outside, it’s not surprising to see Timmy pop up in the Midwest to cheer on his guys. But then, on Wednesday night in Los Angeles, there he was again, ostensibly supporting the Lakers. That raised some eyebrows. People (read, theGQoffice) debated: Is it acceptable to have such a big part of one’s identity tied to the Knickerbockers, and then turn around and sit courtside in LA wearing a Lakers shirt? Timothée Chalamet and Kylie Jenner at the Lakers-Timberwolves game in Los Angeles on Wednesday. The ensemble he wore to the Lakers’ Game 5 loss was perfectly bicoastal. The Kobe Bryant T-shirt nodded to LA, but his loose, untied Timberlands were NYC as hell. Atop it all, a pearl-festooned tweed jacket from Chanel’s womenswear line. But the outfit isn’t nearly as controversial as his two-timing fandom. Sure, he was almost certainly just there because he’s a big-name actor dating one of the city’s most prominent starlets, not because he wanted to analyze the Lakers’ defensive rotations up close. But we still had some questions about this whole ordeal, mainly the morality of treating the Knicks like a wife and the Lakers as a mistress. In light of Chalamet’s potential fan faux pas,GQstaff writers Matthew Roberson and Eileen Cartter—whopreviously debatedthe merits of Eric Adams’s Mets-Yankees hat—put their heads together to decipher exactly what’s going on here. Matthew Roberson:Usually I would say no, but in this particular case—a well-documented Knicks fan going to a basketball game in the other city where he also spends a lot of time—I think it’s fine. If Timmy had gone to Denver for Game 5 of Nuggets-Clippers, let’s say, and was wearing a Nikola Jokić jersey, I’d be looking more askance. But a Kobe shirt at a Lakers game doesn’t tell me that he’s cheating on the Knicks; it just tells me he went to a Lakers game. A Kobejersey, meanwhile, would be doing too much. Something tells me he went through these exact same machinations as well, maybe even debating whether to go with #8 or #24, before settling on the T-shirt. Eileen Cartter: Even as a low-lift Knicks fan myself, I’m inclined to agree. When in Rome! Not to mention, Timothée is very much of the Kobe generation. Despite loving the Knicks, he would probably agree that Kobe is the GOAT. That said, I’m curious about what was going through Timmy’s head when he picked out his outfit for the game. Was he at all worried about what people might think if he wore something Lakers-adjacent—and if so, did he choose the Kobe shirtbecauseit’s relatively neutral? Did he throw on the Timbs to assert that he does, in fact, know where he came from? Did he opt for a T-shirt with a grayscale graphic to better compliment his black-and-white tweed Chanel jacket? I feel moved by this sort of sartorial tension. MR:If I’m hitting the Chalamet—double dipping with my favorite team and then a team I don’t really care about—I think I’d approach it similarly. But if I was in that situation, a guy like me is dusting off my best throwback jersey for the Knicks portion. Someone overnight this man a Jamal Crawford jersey withthe wild blue and orange trim. You want to wear something that shows you know ball, and there’s no better way to do that than with a niche uniform that the team doesn’t wear anymore, especially if the name on the back is more of a cult hero than a household name. For the LA game, I’d probably go with something that shows no allegiance or affiliation at all. Aplain white T-shirt, perhaps, would be my move underneath the outer layer. If, in this hypothetical situation, I’m Timotheé Chalamet and I’m forced to wear a shirt that pays tribute to a former Laker, I’d use my Hollywood connections to find a shirt depictingMark Madsen'sdance moves from the 2001 championship parade. EC: As a documented proponent ofEric Adams’s Mets-Yankees hat, I would have gone to a local mall and had a Knicks-Lakers tee made at one of those screenprinting kiosks. But I also appreciate the move of wearing local merch to a local game. If I’m at a Knicks game, I’m channelingChloë Sevigny and Pauly D. If I’m at a Lakers game, maybe I’d goFleamode. Chalamet, native New Yorker and stalwart of Madison Square Garden's Celebrity Row, frequently wears the merch of his hometown team. MR:I really am not a fan of these performance-style hoodies that the players wear on the bench—and it looks even weirder on Chalamet in the stands. The hood is too tight. It looks constricting, but maybe that’s the point for an A-list movie star who wants to watch notedDuneappreciator Deuce McBrideunbothered. I also wonder about how much peripheral vision the hood allows when deployed. I guess that could add to the locked-in factor, not unlike a horse wearing blinders. A real Knicks fan flies to Detroit to watch his team; adiehardKnicks fan throws on the distraction-free sweatshirt. As for the Kobe fit…sure. Chalamet’s style is not the route I would go if I was a super rich guy, but there’s nothing wrong with this outfit. The peanut-butter Timbs are a nice homage to his home city, and thelight jacketlooks like a sensible choice. EC: Sitting courtside at a basketball game is Timmy’s natural habitat; it’s where he really lets hispost-swagflag fly. Combine some combination of unusual designer grails, personality-forward hats, andswagged-out footwearin a glass and mix. In LA, the Chanel jacket made sense given Timmy’s proximity to the brand—he’s the face of its men’s fragrance, Bleu de Chanel, and wore plenty of double Cs onhis recent press tour forA Complete Unknown. In Detroit, the polyester Knicks hoodie made sense given his general taste forweirdsportswear. MR:I think that probably has more to do with their head coach, JJ Redick, being one year removed from podcasting, and having way too much dip on his chip. Timotheé Chalamet had no impact on the Lakers getting out-rebounded 54-37, no say on keeping their tallest player (Jaxson Hayes) inexplicably glued to the bench while Rudy Gobert had his best playoff game ever. If you letRudy Gobertgo off, there’s umpteen internal issues, none of which are impacted by the guy fromCall Me By Your Namebeing there. EC: This question is above my paygrade. Congrats to all winners, apologies to all losers! MR:As much as it pains me to say—because I naturally reject the idea of Boston sports as an institution—I’d still probably go with the Celtics. Maybe Kylie and Timmy will get flewed out to Beantown by the Wahlbergs. EC: See above RE: my paygrade. But I’d love to see what Timmy and Kylie would wear to a Finals game in Boston. In my dream scenario, they’d do a full Boston homage: Kylie cosplaying as Blake Lively’s character inThe Town, and Timmy going full bore in costume as Lucky the Leprechaun, the Celtics’ mascot.",

    "title": "Elon Musk’s Days of White House Sleepovers, Complete With Gossip and Ice Cream With Trump, Are Over",
    "article_text": "Even the brightest of flames are bound to sputter out eventually, and lo, it would appear that the bright, brief bromance betweenElon MuskandDonald Trumpwill soon be but a wisp of smoke, quickly dissipated to nothing in the White House’s climate-controlled corridors. In a group interview with a handful of reporters at the White House on Wednesday evening, Musk spent some time reminiscing on the soon-to-be good ole’ DOGE days, whining about his office, garnished with a healthy misunderstanding of Buddhism, just for variety. Musk explained that the administration is “getting more of a rhythm,”100 days post-inauguration. Sure, if by “rhythm” he means “plummeting poll numbersand stock market,” then, yes, there has indeed been more of that. Musk said that he’d step back from DOGEing and playing video games Diablo and Path of Exile in his office on a monitor that he described as the biggest in the White House. By contrast, he sniffed that his office is “comically tiny” with “a view of nothing.” “Which is fine, makes it harder to shoot me,” Musk added. “Not a good line of sight.” It would appear that his days ofsleeping in that officeare over, however, due to an upgrade in guest lodgings: Trump frequently invites him to stay over at the White House, where he sleeps in the Lincoln Bedroom and enjoys cute little ice cream rendezvous with Trump. “We’ll be on Air Force One, and Marine One, and he’ll be like, ‘Do you want to stay over?’” Musk said of “good friend” Trump. “And I’m like, ‘sure.’ He’ll actually call, like late at night, and say, like, ‘Oh, by the way, make sure you get some ice cream from the kitchen.’” “Don’t tell RFK,” he added, invoking health and human services secretaryRobert F. Kennedy Jr. Musk, for the record, tends to enjoy caramel-flavored Haagen Dazs. Trump has historicallyvoiced a preference for cherry-vanilla ice cream, with very specific instructions for how it should be served:Two scoops for Donald, one for everyone else. (It's worth noting, too, that Trump Tower in New York hasits own ice cream shop. A “big league” scoop costs $8, and it is the proud bearer of a2.6-star Yelp rating.) As he shifts his focus from DOGE to “return to primarily running my companies, which do need me,” (read: Tesla’s profitsdeclined an eye-popping 71% in Q1, and the vehicles havebecome a scarlet letter among anti-Trumpers), Musk graded his time playing government dress-up as “60% fun, 70% fun,” though it “depends on the week.” “Being attacked relentlessly is not super fun,” he said. “Seeing cars burning is not fun.” Weird news for Elon: Those things are not exclusive to….whatever it was he did at DOGE. Remember, the mysteriousAmy Gleasonwas publicly namedas the group’s acting administrator in February, though Musk was out front wearing goofy hats and trying to fire people who didn’t work for him. He’s keeping his office, tiny though it may be, he said, and apparently his sparse business cards as well. Even his stationery doesn’t know what to call him, by the way. “They don’t put anything on my card,” Musk said. “Literally, there’s nothing on my card. It just says my name.” Useful! Just as he has perpetually declined to say who’s actually running the show at DOGE (and, honestly, what the hell they’re all doing there), Musk kept mum on the future. “It’s a way of life, like Buddhism,” he said of DOGE, which, as a weird vague government committee has pretty much nothing in common with the centuries-old belief system. “You wouldn’t ask who would lead Buddhism. Is Buddha needed for Buddhism?” HowMiriam AdelsonWent From Big MAGA Winner to Casino Loser in Trump’s First 100 Days Trump’s LiesAre Finally Catching Up to Him The UK Has Found Another Reason to Be Mad atMeghan Markle “It’s About Him”: How Trump Is Perverting thePresidential Photo Stream The Ballad ofBill Belichickand Jordon Hudson The Truth UnderlyingPete Hegseth’s Job Security Why Are Americans SoObsessed With Protein?
