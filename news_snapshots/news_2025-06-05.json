    "title": "Trump orders Attorney General to investigate Biden's autopen use amid cognitive decline concerns",
    "article_text": "Fox News host Jesse Watters gives his take on the DOJ announcing an investigation into former President Joe Biden’s alleged use of an ‘autopen’ on ‘Jesse Watters Primetime.’ PresidentDonald Trumpcalled on Attorney General Pam Bondi to lead an investigation into whether certain individuals working for former President Joe Biden conspired to deceive the public about his mental state while also exercising his presidential responsibilities by using an autopen. In a memo on Wednesday, Trump said the president of the U.S. has a tremendous amount of power and responsibility through the signature. Not only can the signature turn words into laws of the land, but it also appoints individuals to some of the highest positions in government, creates or eliminates national policies and allows prisoners to go free. \"In recent months, it has become increasingly apparent that former President Biden's aides abused the power of Presidential signatures through the use of an autopen to conceal Biden's cognitive decline and assert Article II authority,\" Trump wrote. \"This conspiracy marks one of the most dangerous and concerning scandals in American history. The American public was purposefully shielded from discovering who wielded the executive power, all while Biden's signature was deployed across thousands of documents to effect radical policy shifts.\" He continued, saying Biden had suffered from \"serious cognitive decline\" for years, and the Department of Justice (DOJ) recently concluded that Biden should not stand trial, despite clear evidence he broke the law, because of his mental state. EXCLUSIVE: COMER HAILS DOJ'S BIDEN PROBE AS HOUSE INVESTIGATION HEATS UP President Trump called on Attorney General Pam Bondi to launch an investigation into whether former President Biden's team used an autopen and covered up the former president's cognitive decline.(Trump: Reuters / Autopen: AP) \"Biden's cognitive issues and apparent mental decline during his presidency were even ‘worse’ in private, and those closest to him ‘tried to hide it’ from the public,\" Trump said. \"To do so, Biden's advisors during his years in office severely restricted his news conferences and media appearances, and they scripted his conversations with lawmakers, government officials, and donors, all to cover up his inability to discharge his duties.\" Still, during the Biden presidency, the White House issued over 1,200Presidential documents, appointed 235 judges to the federal bench and issued more pardons and commutations than any administration in U.S. history, Trump said. The president wrote about Biden’s decision just two days before Christmas 2024, to commute the sentences of 37 of the 40 most dangerous criminals on federal death row, including mass murderers and child killers. TRUMP SAYS BIDEN DIDN'T FAVOR HIS ADMIN'S LAX BORDER SECURITY POLICY, SUGGESTS AUTOPEN PLAYED A ROLE A new book describes President Joe Biden's cabinet meetings as \"scripted\" and \"uncomfortable.\"(Paul Morigi/Getty Images for Care Can't Wait Action) \"Although the authority to take these executive actions, along with many others, is constitutionally committed to the President, there are serious doubts as to the decision-making process and even the degree of Biden's awareness of these actions being taken in his name,\" Trump wrote. \"The vast majority of Biden's executive actions were signed using a mechanical signature pen, often called an autopen, as opposed to Biden's own hand. This was especially true of actions taken during the second half of his Presidency, when his cognitive decline had apparently become even more clear to those working most closely with him. \"Given clear indications that President Biden lacked the capacity to exercise his Presidential authority, if his advisors secretly used the mechanical signature pen to conceal this incapacity, while taking radical executive actions all in his name, that would constitute an unconstitutional wielding of the power of the Presidency, a circumstance that would have implications for the legality and validity of numerous executive actions undertaken in Biden's name,\" he added. TRUMP HAS NOT DIRECTED ADMIN TO DECLASSIFY BIDEN DOCS ON HEALTH 'COVER-UP' President-elect Donald Trump shakes hands with U.S. President Joe Biden at Trump's inauguration in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda on January 20, 2025 in Washington, DC(Kenny Holston-Pool/Getty Images) The memo goes on to call for an investigation that addresses if certain individuals, who are not named in the document, conspired to deceive the American public about the former president’s mental state and \"unconstitutionally\" exercised the president’s authority and responsibilities. Specifically, Trump called on theattorney general’sinvestigation to look at any activity that purposefully shielded the public from information about Biden’s mental and physical health; any agreements between his aides to falsely deem recorded videos of Biden’s cognitive ability as fake; and any agreements between Biden’s aides to require false, public statements that elevated the president’s capabilities. The investigation will also look at which policy documents the autopen was used for, including clemency grants, executive orders, and presidential memoranda, as well as who directed Biden’s signature to be affixed to those documents. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump said last week that he thinks Biden did not really agree with many of his administration’s lax border security policies, instead suggesting that those surrounding the former president took advantage of his declining faculties and utilized the autopen to pass radical directives pertaining to the border. House Republicans, led byOversight Committee Chairman James Comer,launched an investigation earlier last month aimed at determining whether Biden, who was in declining health during the final months of his presidency, was mentally fit to authorize the use of the autopen. Comer said last week he was \"open\" to dragging Biden before the House to answer questions about the matter if necessary. Fox News Digital’s Alec Schemmel contributed to this report.

    "title": "Oilers draw first blood in Stanley Cup Final rematch with 4-3 overtime victory against Panthers",
    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. The first game of theStanley Cup Finalrematch belongs to the Edmonton Oilers, as Leon Draisaitl’s second goal of the game was the overtime winner against the Florida Panthers on Wednesday night. The 4-3 victory was a come-from-behind winfor Edmonton, as they were down 3-1 at one point in this game, but scored three unanswered goals for a statement victory on their home ice. After tying the game in the third period at three apiece, an overtime period was needed to determine the winner of Game 1, and it almost looked like another was necessary as both team’s chances couldn’t be seen in the net. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Edmonton Oilers right wing Connor Brown (28) skates past Florida Panthers center Sam Bennett (9) in the second period in game one of the 2025 Stanley Cup Final at Rogers Place.(Perry Nelson-Imagn Images) However, a costly mistake byPanthers forwardTomas Nosek saw him flip the puck over the glass in his own defensive zone, which is an immediate delay of game penalty. Now, with a man advantage, the Oilers capitalized, and it had to be Connor McDavid making the nifty saucer pass to his trusty teammate Draisaitl, who came flying in front of the net to hammer the puck past Panthers netminder Sergei Bobrovsky. EDMONTON OILERS EYE REVENGE IN STANLEY CUP FINAL AFTER RALLYING PAST DALLAS STARS IN CONFERENCE FINAL The goal, which came with 31 seconds left to play in the period, was also assisted by Corey Perry. Draisaitl started the scoring just as he finished it in Game 1, he found the back of the net with just over a minute into the first period. He was in the right place at the right time, as a shot from Kasperi Kapanen deflected off Bobrovsky and landed right onto Draisaitl’s stick, who slapped it into the net to take the one-goal advantage. But later in the first period, a controversial goal by Florida’s Sam Bennett tied the game at one apiece. Bennett was present in front of the net with two Oilers defenders around him when Carter Verhaeghe took a shot that hit off Bennett and got past goaltender Stuart Skinner. The Panthers, though, believe Bennett had goalie interference. Upon further review, it appears Bennett was tripped by Brett Kulak as the puck was being shot, leading to him falling into Skinner. The goal stood and the game was tied. Just minutes later, Brad Marchand, the Boston Bruins legend who the Panthers traded for at the deadline, took a cross-ice pass during a power play and made the perfect shot past Skinner to take a 2-1 lead.

Bennett was skating in transition when Nate Schmidt placed a perfect pass on his stick, and he did the rest for his second goal of the game. As we learned from last year’s final, the Oilers will not go down easy, and that appears to be the same theme as they came back with their own timely goals. Viktor Arvidsson took a slap shot once the Oilers entered the offensive zone, and Bobrovsky was too late to react as it whizzed past his left side and stayed true into the net.

That’s exactly what happened as Mattias Ekholm scored his first Stanley Cup Playoffs goal after Connor McDavid dished a back-handed pass to the front of the zone and it found his stick. Bobrovsky was completely out of position with bodies in front of him as Ekholm shot the puck into the net. Through two periods, it was the Panthers' dominating play on the ice, but the Oilers turned it up a notch in the third period and never looked back. They outshot the Panthers 46-32 on the night, while Skinner made 29 saves in the win as well. Follow Fox News Digital’ssports coverage on X, and subscribe tothe Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.

    "title": "Karen Read defense gets boost as plow driver testifies he saw no body in snow during Boston cop death case",
    "article_text": "Karen Read's defense attorney, Alan Jackson, grills state police Sgt. Yuri Bukhenik about the behavior of ATF Agent Brian Higgins on surveillance video at a bar less than an hour before John O'Keefe's death. Karen Read'slucky charm may be a plow driver who saw nothing during multiple passes by the address where she is accused of leaving her boyfriend, Boston Police Officer John O'Keefe, to die on the ground in a blizzard in January 2022. Brian \"Lucky\" Loughran testified Wednesday that he didn't see a body on the lawn as he cleared snow on the street in the hours after prosecutors allege the victim stopped moving. According to prosecution experts, O'Keefe's last known activity came to a stop around 12:30 a.m., and his body allegedly did not move until first responders arrived around 6 a.m. \"I saw nothing,\" Loughran told defense attorney David Yannetti, speaking of his first pass around 2:45 a.m. He cleared that side of the block, turned around at the end and saw nothing again when he went back the other way. KAREN READ JUDGE BLOCKS SANDRA BIRCHMORE MENTIONS; EXPERT SAYS CASES SHOULD BE WAKE-UP CALL FOR POLICE Canton DPW snowplow driver Brian \"Lucky\" Loughran testified that he didn't see a body on the lawn as he cleared snow on the street in the hours after prosecutors allege the victim stopped moving.(Greg Derr/Patriot Ledger via AP/Pool) He testified that he passed by 34 Fairview Road, the home of Brian Albert where John O'Keefe was found dead in the snow, in both directions multiple times between 2:40 a.m. and around 6 a.m. Prosecutors allege Read hit her boyfriend outside and drove off, leaving him to die in blizzard conditions. Loughran said he had good visibility despite the blizzard conditions due to multiple lights on the plow truck and a high seat. Asked if he saw a body in the snow, he said he did not, but he added that he did see a Ford Edge SUV parked outside the address during a later pass around 3:30 a.m. \"Loughran's adamance that there was nobody on the lawn after 2:30 a.m., one day after an active-duty officer was adamant that the taillight he saw before the [Massachusetts State Police] had it was not destroyed, are major blows to a prosecution case that already has had severe problems,\" said Mark Bederow, a New York City defense attorney closely following the case. WITNESS IN KAREN READ TRIAL DESCRIBES ‘STRANGE’ EXCHANGE BETWEEN MCCABE AND READ BEFORE BOYFRIEND'S DEATH Karen Read and John O'Keefe(Karen Read) Loughran said the Ford Edge stood out to him because he was from the area and knew the Albert family, and he said he had to maneuver around the vehicle as he cleared the road. \"For as long as I can remember, they have never parked a vehicle in front of their house,\" Loughran testified. \"They've always had enough ample parking in the driveway.\" Special prosecutor Hank Brennan asked Loughran during cross-examination about purported threats from an online blogger and inconsistencies in his timeline. Loughran said he never felt threatened by the blogger and denied having a bad memory when Brennan confronted him with multiple statements that offered different times for when the driver passed by Fairview Road. KAREN READ TRIAL REVEALS FLIRTY TEXT MESSAGES WITH ATF AGENT BEHIND BOYFRIEND'S BACK John O’Keefe(Boston Police Department) \"Mr. Loughran was adamant that he was not intimidated or threatened in exchange for his testimony, which substantially favored Karen Read,\" said Bederow, who represents Aidan Kearney, the blogger known as \"Turtleboy.\" Loughran now follows the blog but said he had met with a private investigator working for the defense before Kearney ever contacted him, but he added that he barely paid attention to the posts beforehand. \"I did not know I was being required to testify a certain way,\" he said. \"I was also, at the time, dealing with the loss of my wife. I was not paying any attention to any social media.\" Overall, he came off as sincere and sympathetic, according to Grace Edwards, a Massachusetts trial attorney who is following the case. KAREN READ'S SUV REACHED '74% THROTTLE' MOMENTS BEFORE JOHN O'KEEFE'S FINAL MOVEMENTS, CRASH EXPERT TESTIFIES Karen Read's lucky charm may be a plow driver who saw nothing during multiple passes by the address where she is accused of leaving boyfriend John O'Keefe to die.(Libby O'Neill/Boston Herald via AP/Pool) \"Lucky said, ‘I was doing my job and I did not want the attention, I did not welcome the attention,’\" she told Fox News Digital. \"I’m sure some people in the courtroom wanted to give him a hug after he said, ‘I wasn’t paying attention to social media because my wife had died.’\" Brennan played police dashcam video taken outside34 Fairview Roadthat showed heavy snowfall and the distance between the house there and Cedarcrest Road, where a plow truck drove by multiple times in the background, in an attempt to illustrate for the jurors how far the nearest pass would have been from the lawn. Loughran agreed that some of the passes were him in the plow dubbed \"Frankentruck,\" but he said he couldn't be sure at other moments. The Canton DPW snowplow nicknamed \"Frankentruck\" is shown on a screen during the Karen Read retrial on June 3, 2025.(Greg Derr/Patriot Ledger via AP/Pool) FOLLOW THE FOX TRUE CRIME TEAM ON X \"Overall, great day for the defense,\" Edwards said. \"I didn’t think there was any big moment today, and Brennan didn’t even cross Ms. Kolokithas.\" After Loughran's testimony, the defense called Karina Kolokithas, a friend of both O'Keefe and Read who saw them at the Waterfall Bar and Grille the night before his death. \"One important piece of evidence from Ms. Kolokithas was that she did not perceive Karen Read to be so intoxicated,\" Edwards said. Karina Kolokithas(Pool) SIGN UP TO GET THE TRUE CRIME NEWSLETTER Kolokithas, who said she only drank water that night, testified that she spent nearly an hour talking with the defendant and did not feel that she seemed too drunk to drive. Kolokithas also testified that it seemed strange whenJennifer McCabe, a key witness in the case, pulled Read aside at the end of the night. \"Jen went over to Karen, kind of put her arm around her, and she's like, 'Karen, you're coming with me. You're coming with me,'\" Kolokithas testified. \"And Karen's like, ‘What? Where are we going?’\" Karen Read arrives at Norfolk County Superior Court in Dedham, Mass., on May 20, 2025.(Hans Pennink for Fox News Digital) GET REAL-TIME UPDATES DIRECTLY ON THETRUE CRIME HUB That, combined with surveillance video from the bar, illustrates part of the defense's effort to sow reasonable doubt. \"The defense is trying to develop possibilities, and they were trying to get the possibility that something was going on with John O’Keefe and the other men,\" Edwards said. Kolokithas discussed another interaction that stood out to her that night: O'Keefe kissing Read on the forehead. \"I'd never seen something like that before; a boyfriend do [that] to a girlfriend in public,\" she said. \"Never saw that, so it just stood out to me. I was like, 'Wow, that's the sweetest thing I've ever seen.'\" That nugget could also boost the defense, Bederow said, after Read's team introduced evidence that ATF Agent Brian Higgins, another man at the bar that night, was exchanging flirtatious text messages with their client behind her boyfriend's back. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Kolokithas' description of John being affectionate with Karen right in front of Higgins minutes beforeHiggins seemingly was agitatedtowards John and had to be calmed down by Chris Albert, around the time Jen McCabe oddly told Karen she was leaving with her, was also helpful to the defense,\" he said. Surveillance video appeared to show Higgins and O'Keefe gesturing at one another from across the room shortly before the group left and headed to Brian Albert's house at 34 Fairview Road. There is no audio, and Kolokithas did not testify about an argument between the men. However, Chris Albert, Brian's brother, can be seen pushing Higgins' arms down during the exchange.",

    "article_text": "California high school track star Clara Adams and her father David Adams challenge her being disqualified for an ‘unsportsmanlike' celebration on 'The Will Cain Show.' MLB Commissioner Rob Manfredis aiming for the automated balls and strikes (ABS) system to be implemented next season. Manfred announced on Wednesday that he and his office will introduce a proposal to MLB's competition committee to have the system in place for 2026, agoal he had in mindlast summer. \"I do think that we’re going to pursue the possibility of changing that process, and we’ll see what comes out at the end of that,\" Manfred said at MLB headquarters on Wednesday, viaThe Athletic. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred(Mike Carlson/MLB Photos via Getty Images) \"I think that teams are really positive about ABS. You know, I do have that unscientific system that I use — my email traffic — and my distinct impression is that using ABS in spring training has made people more prone to complain about balls and strike calls via email, to me, referencing the need for ABS. That is undoubtedly true, undoubtedly true.\" The system was a full-go in spring training this year after several seasons in the minor leagues. Teams got two challenges per game but were able to retain each challenge won. Only the batter, pitcher or catcher could challenge a call, and it had to be immediately after the call with no help from the bench or other players. But there are still some kinks that need fine-tuning. \"My single biggest concern is working through the process and deploying it in a way that’s acceptable to the players,\" Manfred said. \"There’s always going to be things around the edges that we need to work through and whatever, and I want them to feel like we respected the committee process and that there was a full airing of concerns about the system, and an attempt to address those concerns before we go forward.\" It is yet another big change to the sport commissioned by Manfred, who implemented a pitch timer, larger bases and shift limits in 2023. However, fans seem to like the changes as attendance has increased in each of the last two years. It was the first time since 2011 and 2012 that attendance grew in back-to-back seasons. New York Yankees center fielder Aaron Judge (99) and manager Aaron Boone argue a call.(Wendell Cruz-USA TODAY Sports) MLB FIRST-ROUND PICK JEFF FRANCOEUR TALKS FATHERHOOD IN YOUTH SPORTS, PETE ROSE, POTENTIAL BASEBALL LOCKOUT The average ABS challenge in the minors has taken 17 seconds, so this should not affect the pace of play, which has significantly increased amid the commissioner's rule changes. \"We bargained for the right to make these kind of rule changes,\" Manfred said. \"It was a really important part of the deal from our perspective. Everybody understood what the rules of the road are. … Unlike the prior provision, there’s actually a process that is involved that you go through that you kind of have a chance to vet and talk about what should happen with the players. So I’m less reticent about that. This, however, would arguably be the biggest change of them all, and it would come at quite wild timing: a lockout is looming at MLB's collective bargaining agreement ends in December of next year.

FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said Wednesday there is nothing in theJeffrey Epsteinfile indicating he died by any other way than suicide.

We do have video. It’s not the greatest video in the world. I don’t want to set expectations on fire,\" Bongino said. \"However, the video does show in that specific block, that he goes in, made a phone call; you’ll see 12 hours of guards going in basically check on him, come back. You’ll see nobody really comes out of that bay in that area than him. There’s no one in there. \"There's nothing there in the file at all that indicates anything other than in fact a suicide,\" Bongino added.

We found some troubling, really troubling items in there that we actioned immediately, to say the least,\" Bongino said. Asked whether he thought there was a double standard in how federal prosecutors dealt with similar classified documents cases involving Hillary Clinton and former President Joe Biden, Bongino said: \"I think that's fairly clear when you look at how the two cases were handled.\" Bongino said the potential threats faced by the United States are \"dramatic.\" \"People say, ‘well, what keeps you up at night?’ Well, the answers is, I'd never sleep if I thought about this stuff all the time, but it all keeps me up at night,\" Bongino said.

    "article_text": "Why Chinese students are in the administration’s crosshairs President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed a proclamation to student visas for foreigners seeking to study or participate in exchange programs at Harvard University, the move in the ongoing feud between the White House and the Ivy League school. The proclamation directs theState Departmentto \"consider revoking\" existing academic or exchange visas of any current Harvard students who meet certain criteria. \"Admission into the United States to attend, conduct research, or teach at our Nation’s institutions of higher education is a privilege granted by our Government, not a guarantee,\" Trump said. \"That privilege is necessarily tied to the host institution’s compliance and commitment to following Federal law.  Harvard University has failed in this respect, among many others.\" The proclamation doesn't apply to foreign nationals attending other universities' Student Exchange Visa Program (SEVP) and exempts others whose entry is deemed in the national interest. STATE DEPARTMENT NOW SCRUTINIZING ALL VISA HOLDERS ASSOCIATED WITH HARVARD President Donald Trump issued a proclamation Wednesday to suspend student visas at Harvard University.(Getty Images) Last month, the State Department said that it would begin scrutinizing all visa holders associated with Harvard University, not just student visa holders. The investigation is aimed at identifying potential security vulnerabilities or other abuses of the visa system. Wednesday's proclamation cited Harvard's history \"concerning foreign ties and radicalism.\" Harvard is suing the Trump administration over its attempts to reign in the university.(Fox News) \"Harvard has failed to provide sufficient information to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) about foreign students’ known illegal or dangerous activities, reporting deficient data on only three students,\" it said. It said Harvard has also developed \"extensive entanglements with foreign adversaries,\" while receiving more than $150 million from China alone. In exchange, Harvard has \"hostedChinese Communist Partyparamilitary members and partnered with China-based individuals on research that could advance China’s military modernization.\" TRUMP SAYS HARVARD'S FOREIGN STUDENTS ARE FROM COUNTRIES PAYING 'NOTHING' FOR THEIR EDUCATION Pro-Palestinian protests at Harvard University.(Getty Images ) The Trump administration hasaccused Harvardof failing to stamp out antisemitism on campus, among other issues. The proclamation said Harvard has seen a \"drastic rise in crime in recent years while failing to discipline at least some categories of conduct violations on campus.\" Harvard officials have said theTrump administrationis retaliating against the university with moves to freeze taxpayer-funded research grants, an attempt to revoke its ability to enroll international students, to end its tax-exempt status and to open an investigation into whether it discriminated against white, Asian, male or straight employees or job applicants.

Andrew Cuomo was in the hot seat at Wednesday night's mayoral debate in New York City, fielding questions about the Department of Justice's investigation into his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. (Courtesy: WNBC/WNJU) NineDemocratic candidatestook the stage in New York City Wednesday for the first of two debates ahead of the June 24 mayoral primary, and the claws were out for former Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Cuomo's COVID-19 scandal was front and center just minutes into the debate as moderators asked the candidates how they would stand up to PresidentDonald Trumpif elected mayor. The former governor dismissed the legitimacy of theJustice Department's investigationinto his alleged false congressional testimony about decisions made during COVID-19 when pressed by moderator Sally Goldenberg of Politico. \"That's the Trump line, the MAGA line, because this was during the Trump re-election,\" Cuomo said when asked repeatedly whether he had a role in producing a contested COVID-19 report.

The Justice Department made the unusual decision earlier this year to dismiss an indictment against Adams on federal corruption charges. \"I know how to deal with Donald Trump because I've dealt with him before,\" Cuomo said on the debate stage. Cuomo touted his experience as governor, particularly in challenging Trump's agenda during his first term as president. \"I am the last person on this stage that Mr. Trump wants to see as mayor, and that's why I should be the first choice for the people of this city to have as mayor,\" Cuomo said.

    "article_text": "American Culture Project senior fellow Corey DeAngelis and former Department of Education press secretary Angela Morabito join 'Fox News Live' to discuss President Donald Trump signing an executive order to dismantle the Department of Education. A federal appeals court refused to grant the U.S.Department of Education’s(DOE) request to put a temporary halt on a district judge’s preliminary injunction last week, preventing the Trump administration from moving ahead with plans to dismantle the department. Washington, D.C., and two states previously requested the court to halt the announced DOE and Trump administration’s planned Reduction in Force (RIF) of half of the remaining employees at the DOE, as well as the closure of the department. The dismantling was announced on March 11, 2025, and two days later, the Secretary of Education, Linda McMahon, President Donald Trump and others were sued in the District of Massachusetts. Following suit, five labor organizations and two school districts did the same. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ASKS SCOTUS TO APPROVE DEI-RELATED EDUCATION CUTS The plaintiffs requested the court for an injunction against the transfer of certain functions out of the Department, which Trump announced on March 21. The District Court merged the two cases, and after reviewing the factual findings, issued an order to place a stop on the president’s actions. The Trump administration appealed the decision and requested a temporary stop to the district court’s order, but on Wednesday that request was denied.

The appellants' motion for a stay is denied.\" Republican senators, in April, introduced the \"Returning Education to Our States Act\" after Trump signed an Executive Order to close the DOE in March. If passed, the bill would redirect portions of the department to other federal agencies, such as the Departments of Interior, Treasury, Health and Human Services, Labor, Defense, Justice and State. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SIGNIFICANTLY DISMANTLED IN NEW TRUMP EXECUTIVE ORDER Education Secretary Lina McMahon announced the department would cut nearly 50% of its workforce.((Getty Images/Reuters/Fox News Digital)) \"The Department of Education was created to collect education data and advise state and local organizations on best practices,\" Sen. Mike Rounds, R-South Dakota, told Fox News Digital at the time. \"Since then, it has grown into an oversized bureaucracy that dictates one-size-fits-all policies, standards and practices for students across the nation.\" The bill came amid widespread support among Republicans to eliminate the agency, including the current sitting Education Secretary, Linda McMahon, who detailed her \"vision for eliminating the Department of Education\" in aFox News op-ed. McMahon and Rounds recently held a meeting where the \"Returning Education to Our States Act\" was discussed. DEM AGS SUE OVER TRUMP ADMINISTRATION’S DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION LAYOFFS In addition to eliminating the agency,the legislationwould also make key changes to education compliance requirements, making it so that schools would no longer be required to administer standardized tests to identify struggling schools (CSI and TSI). The bill would also allow schools more autonomy to set teacher certification standards and professional development plans.

(Courtesy of Samaritan's Purse) In a country facing war on two fronts, the Christian aid group Samaritan’s Purse is making a big impact.From building armored ambulance stations to promising a new trauma recovery center on the spot, the U.S.-based Christian humanitarian aid group is stepping into dangerous areas to help people still living with fear every day. Edward Graham, chief operating officer of Samaritan’s Purse and grandson of Rev. Billy Graham, spent June 2visiting Israel’stense northern and southern borders.He met with survivors, soldiers, medics and local leaders still trying to recover from recent attacks byHezbollah and Hamas.EXCLUSIVE: FRANKLIN GRAHAM LEADS CEREMONY AS SAMARITAN’S PURSE GIVES ARMORED 'BULLETPROOF' AMBULANCE TO ISRAEL Edward Graham, COO of Samaritan’s Purse, greets residents of Kibbutz Adamit near Israel’s northern border with Lebanon. Graham visited missile-hit communities to deliver armored ambulances and encourage rebuilding efforts.(Courtesy of Samaritan’s Purse) \"We go where other people don’t or won’t,\" Graham said during a visit to Arab al-Aramshe, a northern Israeli village hit by Hezbollah missiles and drones. \"Not just because we love you, but because God loves you.\" Before arriving, Graham flew low over the Jordan River Valley, just beyond the West Bank.\"These communities were hit up here, and they are also forgotten about,\" he said. \"But Samaritan’s Purse hasn’t forgotten them. We’ve got great relationships with local community leaders and churches in the area. These people are hurting. That’s why we’re here — to let Israel know they’re not forgotten. And God bless them.\" Arab al-Aramshe is still picking up the pieces after a deadly drone strike blew the roof off the local community center and killed a man who was trying to protect it. Shrapnel still scars the building.

It’s about restoring confidence so people feel safe enough to move back.\"\"This was a dead zone filled with alarm every day,\" said Moshe Davidovitz, mayor of the Matte Asher Regional Council and head of the Northern Conflict Zone Forum. \"We don’t just want to fix the place. We want to grow the place … but we need to be able to provide some safety.\"Thousands of people evacuated,\" Davidovitz added. \"They are refugees in their own country. While they were gone, they didn’t know what happened to their home, to their dogs, everything they left behind.\" That safety is arriving in the form of 42 armored ambulances donated by Samaritan’s Purse to Israel’s national emergency service, Magen David Adom (MDA). One of them has already been assigned to Arab al-Aramshe. Ali Wahid, a senior medic in the area, said the new ambulance makes a big difference. \"We are not afraid to respond. But now we will feel safe when we respond,\" he said. After visiting the north, Graham flew south over the Gaza Strip toward Israel’s southern border. A poster of a murdered Israeli man hangs on the wall of a burned-out home in the kibbutz of Nir Oz, near the Gaza border, after the October Hamas terror attack.(Samaritan’s Purse) \"Hamas came out and attacked the communities down here,\" he said. \"Jewish and Arab communities were hit. Today I’m seeing another ambulance exchange point location. There are still a lot of displaced people. We want to bring back confidence and security, so people can come home.\" In Nir Oz, a kibbutz where one in four residents were either kidnapped or murdered during Hamas’ brutal October 2024 attack, the damage is still overwhelming. Houses are burned and shattered. Posters show the faces of loved ones, including baby Kfir Bibas and 83-year-old grandfather Oded Lifshitz,both killed by Hamas.\"This is where they burned houses, pulled children from their parents, murdered babies,\" Graham said, standing in the ruins.\"You see the pictures of the people who are no longer here. Explosions have been going off the whole time I’ve been in this village. But the leaders here are rebuilding. They want to bring people back this summer. And Samaritan’s Purse just committed to help with a community clinic and resilience center.\" Mayor Michal Uziyahu of the Eshkol region walked Graham through the destruction. Her region lost 244 people Oct 7. Half of the hostages still held by Hamas come from her communities.\"Seventy percent of the massacre happened here,\" she said. \"Every fourth person was either murdered or kidnapped.\" Still, she insists the region willnot be defined by terror. \"We are determined to make sure that the tragedy won’t define us,\" Uziyahu said. \"This place will be filled with life again. The thing terrorists fear most isn’t tanks or fighter jets. It’s the sound of children laughing in our streets.\" Graham, moved by what he saw, offered a simple message.\"There’s been so much pain, murder and brokenness here,\" he said. \"But I’ve talked to the survivors and asked if they carry hate. And they don’t. They still love their neighbors. They want peace. I don’t even understand that myself. But I ask everyone, please keep praying for Israel. They need your prayers andour support.\" Samaritan’s Purse is building a resilience center in the Eshkol region and another in the nearby Merhavim area, home to about 4,000 children, many of whom have experienced devastating trauma.\"We never define ourselves through the tragedy,\" Uziyahu said. \"We define ourselves with life and hope.\" Along with the trauma centers, Samaritan’s Purse is building two EMS stations, one near the Gaza border, where residents bled to death during the October attacks because medics couldn’t reach them in time.The group is also installing 25 bomb shelters across Israel, 11 in the north and 14 in the south.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In the north, Graham met a mother, Sara Kleiman, and her 5-year-old son.

    "article_text": "Minnesota parent Garrett Gross opened up on the frustration of seeing his state allowing a biologically male trans athlete to dominate the girls' softball postseason during an interview on OutKick's \"The Ricky Cobb\" show. (Credit: OutKick) After a dramatic, walk-off win in Wednesday's semifinal, the Champlin Park Rebels are headed to the Minnesota High School Girls' Softball State Championship — and so is theirtransgender pitcher Marissa Rothenberger. After giving up two early runs in a shaky start, Rothenberger settled in and pitched a complete game to help No. 2-seeded Champlin Park edge past No. 6 White Bear Lake, 3-2, in the Class AAAA state semifinals. Rothenbergergave up seven hits and two runs (one earned) and struck out threein the effort. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Marissa Rothenberger celebrates in the dugout with teammates after Champlin Park's dramatic win.(Amber Harding) But it was Rothenberger's hitting that really sparked the comeback. The junior led off the fifth inning with a double that began Champlin Park's rally to tie the game at 2 apiece. Then, in the bottom of the seventh, Rothenberger — who went 2-for-3 at the plate — opened the inning with another double. Rothenberger was replaced by a \"courtesy runner,\" who eventually scored the game-winning run on a two-out, walk-off hit from junior outfielder Ava Parent. Champlin Park will face No. 4-seeded Bloomington Jefferson in the championship game on Friday at the University of Minnesota's Jane Sage Cowles Stadium. Jefferson upset top-seeded Forest Lake earlier Wednesday. But while Champlin Park celebrated its walk-off win, the scene in the White Bear Lake dugout was far different. Many of the girls were visibly emotional, some in tears, as the reality of the season-ending loss set in. One player turned to her father and asked, \"Why can't you do something?\" TRACKING THE TRANS ATHLETE HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS CONTROVERSIES SHAKING THE NATION OVER THE LAST YEAR No parents were willing to go on record, but OutKick spoke with two White Bear Lake dads in the stands who expressed deep frustration with the system that allowed their daughters to compete against a male athlete — namely, the Democrat politicians who prioritize ideology over fairness. \"You're looking at a whole team of future Republicans,\" one man said. Another dad agreed, saying this might be an eye-opening experience for the parents: \"They're like, \"Oh, they're crushing my kid's dreams? Maybe I made the wrong choices.\" Despite President Donald Trump’s executive order, the Minnesota State High School League (MSHSL) allows student-athletes to compete in events consistent with their gender identity, regardless of biological sex. MSHSL said that the eligibility of transgender student-athletes is \"determined by state law, through the Minnesota Human Rights Act and the Minnesota Constitution.\" Despite national governing bodies — like USA Softball and the NCAA — instituting female-only eligibility policies, such state-level laws create enforcement loopholes that leave parents and female athletes feeling helpless. And today in North Mankato, Minn., that helplessness was written all over the faces of the White Bear Lake players.

    "article_text": "PopStroke founder and CEO Greg Bartoli explains how Florida's 'pro-business' policies allowed his company to 'explode' during the pandemic. WWE starThe Miz will be among golfers in the field for the 36th installment of the prestigious American Century Championship celebrity golf tournament. Golfers will begin practice atEdgewood Tahoe Golf Coursein South Lake Tahoe on the border of California and Nevada July 9-13. The Miz, whose real name is Mike Mizanin, told Fox News Digital in a recent interview he’s looking to bounce back at this year’s event after finishing toward the bottom of the field last year.

Like, you name it, I am training for it. I feel very good. I feel like my swing is better than it’s ever been,\" he said. \"My understanding of the game has gotten way better. … I know what to do. It’s just more applying those rules and getting reps and reps and reps. \"So, I feel very confident, very good. I’m gonna go out there, I’m going to beat Charles Barkley this year, and I am not going to be in the tail end like I usually am on Sunday. I feel like I’m going to be at least in the middle of the pack.\" The ACC field is packed with famous athletes and actors, from Stephen Curry and Tony Romo to Colin Jost and Ray Romano. Any average Joe could easily be starstruck playing with and against those they see on the basketball court. For The Miz, most of the pressure he feels comes from the crowd and TV cameras.

So, you get an adrenaline rush when they announce your name like your Tiger Woods. \"And you get up there, and you can’t even feel your club in your hands because your adrenaline is going, your nerves are going so much. And you just pray to God that literally your swing hits the ball, and it goes straight.\" Charles Barkley is usually one of the former athletes who participates in the field. He finished 58th last year between Gary Sheffield and celebrity chef Bobby Flay. The Miz recalled the first time he played at the ACC and was paired with Barkley. \"Everyone told me, ‘Hey, at least you’ll beat Charles, right? At least you’ll beat Charles, right?’\" The Miz recalled to Fox News Digital. \"Charles doesn’t golf like you see on YouTube. That was a long time ago. He has gotten training. His swing is incredible. I watched Charles Barkley hit the ball and I went, ‘Oh, no. He’s gonna beat me, and everyone’s gonna make fun of me because everyone knows Charles for that hitch he has. But he doesn’t have that hitch anymore. He actually plays very, very well. \"So, I mean, just walking up and down the course, getting intimidated by Charles Barkley, who everyone said I was going to beat, is a moment in my mind.\" Overall, The Miz said Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course ranks in his top five of golf courses he’s played, and he looks forward to the tournament. The tournament will also raise money for local and national charities. The event is a 54-hole Stableford format in which golfers earn points for each hole based on the score to par. The golfer who achieves the most points wins.

    "article_text": "Can a $5,000 cash payment help boost the U.S. birth rate? Vietnamhas ended its two-child policy in hopes of a resurgence of youth in an aging population. Thecommunistcountry's National Assembly passed a new amendment that nullifies families from having a two-child limit, according to state media. Vietnamese families are giving birth to fewer children and the birth rate has declined to 1.91 children per woman in 2024, state media said, and this is a trend that is especially true in the urban areas like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, where there are higher living costs. MORE BABIES BORN TO WOMEN OVER 40 THAN TEENS FOR FIRST TIME IN US HISTORY Vietnamese families are giving birth to fewer children and the birth rate has declined to 1.91 children per woman in 2024.(Frank Bienewald/LightRocket via Getty Images) Vietnam’s two-child limit originated in the 1960s in Northern Vietnam to help prevent overpopulation, the Guardianreported. After the reunification of Northern and Southern Vietnam, the two-child policy was encouraged throughout the entire country to prevent overpopulation and bring about a \"golden population.\" It wasn’t until 1993 that the policy was formalized as a national policy with the goal of controlling overpopulation. According to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the proportion of citizens under 15 has declined dramatically from 43% to under 25% in comparison to the entirepopulation. DEEPLY DISTURBING STATISTICS SHOW TEXAS CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 11 LEFT STATE FOR ABORTION IN 2023 The Vietnam National Assembly has scrapped the two-child policy in order to combat the country's birth rate decline and aging population.(Nhac Nguyen/AFP via Getty Images) The study by the UNFPA shows that the population of citizens aged 15 to 64 years has increased from 53% to 69%. According to a study by Macrotrends.com, birth rates continuously dropped until 2003, and then saw a steady rise until 2013, when the free fall began again. According to state media, Vietnam's \"golden population\" started in 2007, and is expected to continue between 2038 and 2040. Today, Vietnam’s population is estimated to be more than 101 million people, making it the 16th-most populous country globally and third-largest inSoutheast Asia. The Ministry of Health has proposed raising the fine from 30 million to 100 million Vietnamese dong — which translates into American currency as $1,150 to around $4,000 — for gender-selective practices.(Nhac Nguyen/AFP via Getty Images) The Ministry of Health noted that gender-selective births have been one of the causes of the gender imbalance in Vietnam. The imbalance of male to female births grew from 103 boys per 100 girls in 2006 to 111 boys per 100 girls in 2024. To help counter this, the ministry has proposed raising the fine from 30 million to 100 million Vietnamese dong — roughly $1,150 to around $4,000 — forgender-selective practices.

The course and sexually focused questionnaire was part of a Miami-Dade College course offered to high school students,The Daily Wirereported. Titled \"Preparing for Student Success,\" the course was designed for students to develop academic goals and come up with strategies to succeed in college and was offered in Miami-Dade County, the news outlet stated.

Techniques have been developed that might enable you to change your sexual orientation. Have you considered changing?\" and \"Why do straights place so much emphasis on sex?\" \"It’s not normal.

One activity encouraged them to determine the diversity of their campus by getting statistics of how many racial minorities attend their school; another encouraged them to \"check your stereotype quotient.\" That included questions like, \"If you found out that a star professional football player is gay, would you be surprised?\" Louis Casiano is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

Instead, Pichai stressed the company’s commitment to growth through at least next year. “I expect we will grow from our current engineering phase even into next year, because it allows us to do more,” Pichai said, adding that AI is making engineers more productive by eliminating tedious tasks and enabling them to focus on more impactful work. Rather than replacing workers, he referred to AI as “an accelerator” that will drive new product development, thereby creating demand for more employees. Alphabet has staged numerous layoffs in recent years, though so far, cuts in 2025 appear to be more targeted than in previous years. It reportedly parted ways with less than100 peoplein Google’s cloud division earlier this year and, more recently,hundreds morein its platforms and devices unit. In 2024 and 2023, the cuts were far more severe, with12,000 peopledropped from the company in 2023 and at least another1,000 employeeslaid off last year. Looking forward, Pichai pointed to Alphabet’s expanding ventures like Waymo autonomous vehicles, quantum computing initiatives, and YouTube’s explosive growth as evidence of innovation opportunities that continually bubble up. He noted YouTube’s scale in India alone, with 100 million channels and 15,000 channels boasting over one million subscribers. At one point, Pichai said trying to think too far ahead is “pointless.” But he also acknowledged the legitimacy of fears about job displacement, saying when asked about Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei’srecent commentsthat AI could erode half of entry-level white collar jobs within five years, “I respect that . . .I think it’s important to voice those concerns and debate them.” As the interview wrapped up, Pichai was asked about the limits of AI, and whether it’s possible that the world might never achieve artificial general intelligence, meaning AI that’s as smart as humans at everything. He quickly paused before answering. “There’s a lot of forward progress ahead with the paths we are on, not only the set of ideas we are working on today, [but] some of the newer ideas we are experimenting with,” he said. “I’m very optimistic on seeing a lot of progress. But you know,” he added, “you’ve always had these technology curves where you may hit a temporary plateau. So are we currently on an absolute path to AGI? I don’t think anyone can say for sure.” Topics Editor in Chief & General Manager Loizos has been reporting on Silicon Valley since the late ’90s, when she joined the original Red Herring magazine.

Between February and May of this year, VCs poured $69.7 billion into North America-based AI and machine learning startups across 1,528 deals. That’s compared with $6.4 billion that VC firms invested in European AI ventures across 742 deals across the same period. Asia-based startups have fared a bit worse than their European counterparts, according to PitchBook. Between February and May, VCs invested just $3 billion in Asia-based AI startups across 515 deals. Under President Donald Trump, the U.S. hasdramatically cut fundingto scientific grants related to basic AI research, made itmore difficultfor foreign students specializing in AI to study in the U.S., andthreatened to dismantleuniversity-housed AI labs by freezing billions of dollars in federal funds. The administration’s trade policies, meanwhile, including its retaliatory tariffs, have led to a chaotic market unfavorable for risky new AI ventures. In apost on Xin March, AI pioneer and Nobel Laureate Geoffrey Hinton called for billionaire Elon Musk, who until recently advised Trump’s cost-cutting group, the Department of Government Efficiency, to be expelled from the British Royal Society “because of the huge damage he is doing to scientific institutions in the U.S.” One might expect that Europe, which has pledged to become a global leader in AI, would attract more venture capital in light of Trump’s controversial policies in the U.S., which have created uncertainty and confusion for founders, investors, and researchers alike. Moreover, the EU has committed hundreds of billions of euros to support the development of AI within its member countries and already has a number of successful, well-funded AI startups in its ranks (see Mistral, H, and Aleph Alpha, to name a few). But that anticipated shift in global investment hasn’t come to pass. There isn’t any sign of a mass VC exodus to the bloc, or of significant upticks in AI funding overseas — at least not yet. The same is true for China, which has spawned high-profile AI startups likeDeepSeekandButterfly Effect— the company behind the agentic platform Manus — but where VC activity in the country and the broader Asian region remains relatively austere. (Export controls impacting the ability of certain Asian countries to procure AI chips are almost certainly a factor.) In 2024, North American startups secured 75.6% of all VC AI funding — $106.24 billion. That share has only increased this year. So far in 2025, North American AI investments represent 86.2% ($79.74 billion) of all VC funding for AI globally. It paints a somewhat surprising picture. Even amid mounting political and regulatory headwinds under Trump’s second term, the U.S. remains the undisputed center for AI capital, meaning investors, fatigued as they may be by the administration’s unpredictability, are still counting on U.S. innovation to deliver the biggest returns, at least for now.

    "title": "What we know about Trump's latest travel ban",
    "article_text": "Donald Trump has signed a ban on travel to the US from 12 countries citing national security risks, according to the White House. The US president said the list could be revised if \"material improvements\" were made and additional countries could also be added as \"threats emerge around the world\". This is the second time he has ordered a ban on travel from certain countries. He signed a similar order in 2017, during his first term in office. Trump has signed a proclamation banning travel to the US from nationals of 12 countries: There are an additional seven countries whose nationals face partial travel restrictions: The ban takes effect on Monday at 12:01 (05:01 BST), a cushion that avoids the chaos that unfolded at airports nationwide when a similar measure took effect with virtually no notice eight years ago. The White House said these \"common sense restrictions\" would \"protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors\". In a video posted to his Truth Social website, Trump said therecent alleged terror attack in Boulder, Colorado\"underscored the extreme dangers\" posed by foreign nationals who had not been \"properly vetted\". Twelve people were injured in Colorado on Sunday when a man attacked a group gathering in support of Israeli hostages, throwing two incendiary devices and using a makeshift flamethrower. The man accused of carrying out the attack has been identified as an Egyptian national. There are a number of people from affected countries who may still be able to enter the US due to the following exemptions: In addition, the Secretary of State may grant exemptions to individuals on a \"case-by-case\" basis, if \"the individual would serve a United States national interest\". Trump's latest order, which is expected to face legal challenges, drew a swift response, at home and abroad. Somalia promised to work with the United States to address any security issues. In a statement, Somali ambassador to the US, Dahir Hassan Abdi, said his country \"values its longstanding relationship\" with America. Venezuela's Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello warned that \"being in the United States is a great risk for anyone, not just for Venezuelans\". Democrats were quick to condemn the move. \"This ban, expanded from Trump's Muslim ban in his first term, will only further isolate us on the world stage,\" Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat congresswoman from Washington, says in a social media post. Another Democrat, congressman Don Beyer, says Trump \"betrayed\" the ideals of the US' founders. Trump ordered his original travel ban during his first term in the White House in 2017. It featured some of the same countries as his latest order, including Iran, Libya and Somalia. Critics called it a \"Muslim ban\" as the seven countries initially listed were Muslim majority. The White House revised the policy, ultimately adding two non-Muslim majority countries, North Korea and Venezuela. It was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018. President Joe Biden, who succeeded Trump, repealed the ban in 2021, calling it \"a stain on our national conscience.\" Donald Trump accuses the former president's aides of covering up his \"mental state\" - a claim Biden says is \"ridiculous\". US president says the move to restrict foreign student visas at Harvard is to safeguard national security. Billionaire says the bill, which faces a key test in the Senate, undercuts efforts to slash federal spending. A judge blocked the move one day after the White House promised to swiftly deport the Egyptian family.

    "article_text": "Women using weight-loss jabs are being advised to stop if they are trying for a baby, have fallen pregnant or are breastfeeding. Drug safety experts in the UK say it's not known whether taking the medicines, such as Wegovy and Mounjaro, could harm an unborn baby. The advice already appears in patient information leaflets that come with the medicines. But there are concerns that the growing popularity of 'skinny jabs' means many women aren't using the drugs safely or getting the right advice. Natasha Major, 26, started using Mounjaro to lose weight before planning to try for her third baby in a few years' time, but was shocked six weeks later to find she was pregnant. She was taking the contraceptive pill at the time. \"I have polycystic ovaries as well, so I can't get pregnant easily or quickly. So it was an even bigger shock that I had, which didn't make any sense to me,\" she says. She then worried she could be harming the baby or it wouldn't develop properly, so she rang her GP for advice, who told her to stop taking it. \"We're over the initial shock now and really happy, just wasn't expected,\" she says. \"The last injection I took, I found out about the pregnancy three hours later and haven't taken it since then. \"I've had an early scan to make sure the pregnancy was viable and okay - baby had a little heartbeat and everything looks good,\" Natasha says. The UK drugs regulator, as well as doctors and pharmacists, are worried that popular GLP-1 medicines, known as Wegovy, Mounjaro, Saxenda, Victoza and Ozempic, are not being used safely. These prescription medicines, which are licensed to treat obesity (and Ozempic for type 2 diabetes), make people feel full by mimicking a hormone released after eating. Mounjaro also acts on another hormone linked to appetite and blood sugar control. They areonly available on the NHS to people with a very high BMI, but such is the demand for them that many people are buying them from unregulated sellers on social media or from beauty salons, without any medical advice, as a quick fix to lose weight. As a precaution, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) says women should use contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a certain period afterwards before trying to become pregnant - two months for Wegovy and Ozempic, and one month for Mounjaro. It also advises that those using Mounjaro and taking an oral contraceptive should also use a condom for four weeks after starting the drug, or switch to another method such as the coil or implant. Weight-loss jabs may make the contraceptive pill less likely to work in those who are overweight or obese, the MHRA says. Women should be told this information when they starting taking the jabs, but there are fears the message is not getting through. Natasha bought Mounjaro online and says she \"can't remember reading anything about contraception on there\". The MHRA has produced new guidance on weight-loss jabs for people taking them. It's acted now because of a very small number of reports of unintended pregnancies and complications in pregnancy made to itsYellow Card scheme, where the public can report suspected side-effects of medicines. Dr Alison Cave, chief safety officer at the MHRA, said there was evidence from animal studies \"that these medicines may harm the unborn baby\". \"But we don't know whether we have the same effects in humans, so much more data is needed to determine that.\" Women of child-bearing age are usually not included in clinical trials, which is why there is a lack of safety information for them. \"If you are taking this medicine and you are pregnant, you should talk to your doctor about stopping the medicine as soon as possible,\" she said. Sukhi Basra, vice-chairwoman of the National Pharmacy Association, said women should visit their pharmacist for advice if they are confused about when to stop using the drugs. When it comes to accessing contraception, BPAS, the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, says women in the UK \"face significant challenges\" when trying to access their method of choice. A lack of appointments, long waiting lists and high costs are just some of the barriers they face, BPAS said, as it called for a better plan for providing the choice women need.

    "title": "Badenoch launches review into possible ECHR exit",
    "article_text": "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch is to set up a commission to examine whether the UK should withdraw from a series of international legal agreements and overturn some domestic legislation which she fears may be binding the hands of British governments. Among the agreements being looked into is the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Badenoch is expected to appoint Tory peer and former justice minister Lord Wolfson of Tredegar to chair the commission, which is expected to report by autumn, when the party meets for its annual conference. Last month, the government announced plans to bring forward legislation to \"clarify\" the extent to which ECHR would impact UK immigration cases. The ECHR was established in 1950 and sets out the rights and freedoms people are entitled to in the 46 signatory countries. The treaty is a central part of UK human rights law and has been used to halt attempts to deport migrants who are deemed to be in the UK illegally. The treaty was also recently cited in a case that allowed aPalestinian family the right to live in the UK,after they originally applied through a scheme designed for Ukrainians. During the Conservative leadership election, the ECHR became a key dividing line between candidates, with Badenoch telling her party leaving the treaty would not be a \"silver bullet\" to tackling immigration. Her nearest rival Robert Jenrick, now shadow justice secretary,argued his party would \"die' unless it left the ECHR. But in February, Badenoch hardened her stance, claiming the UK would \"probably have to leave\" the treaty it continued to stop the government acting in the country's national interest. The impact of the ECHR on asylum claims and the deportation of foreign criminals will be examined as part of the Wolfson review, the BBC understands - as will the Refugee Convention. Domestic law such as the Climate Change Act, the Equality Act and the Human Rights Act are also likely to be looked at. The party leadership is worried about what is seen as a creeping sense of \"lawfare\", which senior figures believe contributes to a feeling of stasis and a lack of ability for governments to make substantive changes. Last month when thegovernment set out its plansfor tackling illegal immigration in a White Paper, ministers said they would bring forward legislation to \"make it clear that Parliament needs to be able to control our borders and take back control on who comes to and stays in the UK\". TheWhite Paperspecifically referred to Article 8 of the ECHR, the right to a family life, and said there was a need to \"strike a balance between individual family rights and the wider public interest\". Badenoch will set out her plans in a speech on Friday, just over a month on fromlocal elections in England where the Conservatives were crushed– and a series of opinion polls where support for the party had tumbled into the teens. The Tories secured 24% of the vote in last year's general election, when they won the fewest seats in their history. There is growing concern within the party about the resilience of support for Reform UK and the existential threat this poses to the Conservatives. \"It is a make or break summer,\" one former Conservative cabinet minister told me. \"We are a resilient brand but we have to stay alive. And that's far from certain at the moment.\" Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletterto keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch accuses Lord Hermer of \"calling people who disagree with him Nazis\". Victoria McCloud, who stepped down last year, said the judgement had violated her human rights.

    "title": "First trailer for Wicked sequel released",
    "article_text": "The first full-length trailer for Wicked's forthcoming sequel has been released, offering fans a glimpse of how The Wizard of Oz spin-off will conclude. Wicked: For Good will see Cynthia Erivo return as Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West, alongside Ariana Grande as Glinda the Good Witch of the North. The films have been adapted from the hugely successful Broadway and West End musical, which itself was based on Gregory Maguire's 2005 novel. However, the stage musical was split into two films for its big screen adaptation, with the second due to be released on 21 November. The two movies were shot simultaneously, at Elstree Studios in Borehamwood, between December 2022 and January 2024, with production interrupted mid-way through by the Hollywood actors' strike. Wicked wasthe highest-grossing movie of 2024 in the UK,and scored 10 Oscar nominations - winning two for best costume and production design. At 2hrs 40mins, the first film alone was almost as long as the entire length of the stage show. Erivo and Grande's chemistry and real-life friendship prompted several viral interview moments during the first film's promotional run last year, and the pair jointly opened the Academy Awards in March with a Wicked medley. But one challenge facing the sequel is that most of the best known songs from the musical, such as Defying Gravity, Popular and The Wizard And I, featured in the first film. The forthcoming sequel will feature two brand new songs,with director Jon M Chu telling Vanity Fair:\"They're great additions to this movie. They were necessary in this movie to help tell the story.\" Grande and Erivo will be joined once again by co-stars Michelle Yeoh, Jonathan Bailey and Jeff Goldblum as the Wizard. Wicked: For Good will pick up where the first film left off and cover the years after Elphaba and Glinda's decision to part ways. Elphaba is now an enemy of the state of Oz, while Glinda has become a public figure controlled by the Wizard. The new trailer shows Glinda standing on a balcony overlooking a mob of angry people carrying flaming torches searching for Elphaba. It ends with Elphaba saying she's \"off to see the wizard\" before flying on a broom into the distance. Chu said: \"Our heart was broken when Glinda can't make the choice that we want her to so badly at the end of movie one, and it feels empowering for Elphaba to fly away from society. In movie two, we get to see the consequences of those choices. The temperature is up.\" Wicked, made at Sky Studios Elstree, was one of the biggest movies of 2024. What was its impact on the UK film industry? Hospital staff say the children are \"so grateful\" to the US pop star for her thoughtful gifts. How closely have you been paying attention to what's been going on in the world over the past seven days? Selena Gomez and Nicole Kidman are also among the contenders as Hollywood's award season kicks off. Filmgoers say it was \"surreal\" to see a place they had visited appear in a Hollywood blockbuster.",

    "title": "US-Boeing crashes deal 'repugnant' - lawyer for victims' families",
    "article_text": "A lawyer representing 16 families of the victims of a fatal Boeing 737 Max crash, has told the BBC that a deal between the firm and the US Justice Department (DOJ) is \"morally repugnant\". The company has agreed to pay $1.1bn (£811.5m) to avoid prosecution over two fatal crashes that killed 346 people. Sanjiv Singh, counsel for family members of some of the victims of a 2018 Lion Air crash in Indonesia, says the deal allows Boeing to \"sidestep true criminal accountability\". Boeing has previously said: \"We are deeply sorry for their losses, and remain committed to honouring their loved ones' memories by pressing forward with the broad and deep changes to our company\". The deal includes the aviation giant paying $444.5m to families of crash victims. It will also put $455m towards improving its compliance, safety and quality programmes. Under the deal, Boeing also agreed to pay a criminal penalty of $487.2m, although half of that was already paid in 2021. \"Boeing is committed to complying with its obligations under this resolution, which include a substantial additional fine and commitments to further institutional improvements and investments,\" said a company spokesperson. If the deal is approved by a federal judge the plane maker will avoid a criminal fraud trial. \"The [DOJ] agreed that it will not further criminally prosecute the company\", said Boeing in a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing. The BBC has contacted the DOJ to request further comment on the agreement. Two 737 Max aircraft crashedin separate but almost identical accidents that killed 346 people. In October 2018, all 189 people on a Lion Air flight died after the aircraft crashed into the Java Sea 13 minutes after take-off from Jakarta, Indonesia. In March 2019, an Ethiopian Airlines flight crashed six minutes after take-off from the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa. All 157 people on-board were killed. Both crashes were linked to faulty flight control systems. In 2021, Boeingagreed to settle US fraud chargesand admitted deception over hiding information from safety officials about the design of its 737 Max planes. Relatives of the victims will have the chance to appeal this latest deal when it is considered by a federal judge. Mr Singh says the latest agreement has provoked \"visceral outrage\" from his clients and believes the current payout is insufficient. \"If you look at that $1.1bn, it's actually like Boeing paying $10 to escape criminal liability. It's as if they got a misdemeanour ticket or a parking ticket.\" The amount carriers now charge for luggage is raising the ire of politicians and consumer groups. New state-of-the-art fire engine can be at any incident at the airport within two minutes. The media giant has been under pressure as viewers move away from cable TV to streaming platforms. Workers at Reaction Engines felt they were close to completing a revolutionary jet engine. The comments come after Trump said on Friday that China had \"totally violated its agreement with us\".",

    "title": "First bacteria we ever meet can keep us out of hospital",
    "article_text": "The first bacteria our bodies meet – in the hours after we're born – could protect us from dangerous infections, UK scientists say. They have shown, for the first time, that good bacteria seem to halve the risk of young children being admitted to hospital with lung infections. The researchers said it was a \"phenomenal\" finding and could lead to therapies that boost good bacteria in babies. Our early encounters with microbes are thought to be crucial in how our immune system develops. We come out of the womb sterile, but this doesn't last for long. All the nooks and crannies of the human body become home to a world of microbial life, known as the microbiome. Researchers at University College London and the Sanger Institute investigated the earliest stages in our body's colonisation by bacteria, fungi and more. They collected stool samples from 1,082 newborns in the first week of life. The team then performed a massive genetic analysis on all the DNA in the samples to work out exactly which species were present and how common they were in each child. They then tracked what happened to those babies, using hospital data, for the next two years. One particular early inhabitant of the human body,Bifidobacterium longum,seemed to have a protective effect. Only 4% of babies with this species would spend a night in hospital with a lung infection over the next two years. Babies with different starter-bacteria were two-to-three times more likely to need to stay in hospital. It is the first data to show the formation of the microbiome affects the risk of infection. \"I think it's really phenomenal. It's amazing to be able to show this. I'm excited,\" Prof Nigel Field, from UCL, told the BBC. The most likely culprit for children ending up in hospital is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), but what joins the dots between this andB. longum? That is the \"million dollar question\" for Prof Field. We knowB. longumstarts off digesting breast milk which both contains food for the baby and encourages good bacteria. The exact details have not yet been worked out, but either the bacteria themselves or the compounds they make by digesting food are interacting with the immune system \"and are influencing the way in which the immune system matures and is able to recognise friend from foe,\" according to Prof Field. The protective bacteria were found only in babies that came into the world via a vaginal delivery rather than a caesarean. Even then they were not discovered after every vaginal delivery. The researchers say their findings do not justify the practice of vaginal seeding,  where some new parents smear babies with a swab taken from the vagina. The good bacteria seem to be coming from the end of the mother's digestive system, an idea known in the field as the \"first lick\". \"I feel pretty confident in saying that vaginal seeding is not a good thing,\" said Prof Field. However, the long-term ambition is to come up with microbial therapies – like a probiotic yogurt – that could be given to babies to set their microbiomes on a healthy path. Prof Louise Kenny, from the University of Liverpool and a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, said: \"A caesarean section is often a life-saving procedure, and can be the right choice for a woman and her baby.\" She said that while the benefit was seen only in babies born vaginally, it was not in every child born that way so \"further research is needed to create a full, nuanced picture\". Study found no evidence of significant rise with jump in demand for help down to under-diagnosis. Women also reminded that they should use the most effective contraception to avoid pregnancy while taking 'skinny jabs'. Sinead Quinn says binge eating compulsions have left her a prisoner in her home and that there needs to be reform of NI services.

    "title": "Vanuatu not planning to revoke Andrew Tate’s citizenship, government spokesperson says",
    "article_text": "Vanuatu is not planning to revoke the citizenship ofAndrew Tate, with a government spokesperson confirming that the influencer remains a Vanuatu citizen, and the government is not taking any steps to reverse that. This week investigative outlet, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP)revealed that Tate obtained Vanuatu citizenshiparound the time of his 2022 arrest by Romanian authorities on charges including rape and human trafficking. In the wake of the report,Vanuatugovernment spokesperson Kiery Manassah said the South Pacific country was looking to rescind Tate’s citizenship. However, on Thursday he told the Guardian that the country’s citizenship office had subsequently reviewed Tate’s documents and found no fault with them. “They’ve found the files and according to the records, at the time when Mr Tate was granted the citizenship, he was cleared by Interpol, and the UK, so that was the decision at the time,” he said. The review, he said, meant the government was not currently taking any further steps to revoke Tate’s citizenship. “The chairman [of the citizenship office] confirms that the way it is at the moment he [Tate] remains a citizen and for Vanuatu there are no further actions to be taken,” he said. Manassah said that Tate would never have been granted citizenship if the government had been aware of the allegations he faced at the time. “If the government had been aware of this at the start, and our processes were working, we should have not allowed him in the first place,” he said, adding that: “We can’t just go back and revoke based on information that is discovered later.” Tate, a 38-year-old misogynist influencer reportedly secured a “golden passport” through a citizenship-by-investment programme that allows foreign nationals to buy citizenship for $130,000 (£96,000), according to the OCCRP andIntelligence Online. In 2021 the Guardian detailed ina months-long investigationhow Vanuatu sold passports – and with them visa-free access to the UK and EU – tothousands of individuals. Buyers included people linked to sanctions, or facing serious allegations, or with warrants out for their arrest. Acknowledging that Vanuatu’s citizenship program has a “very bad reputation overseas” Manassah said the government would strengthen its “due diligence processes so that such instances do not happen again”. Tate, a former professional kickboxer who has amassed more than 10 million followers on X, runs an online academy where he says he teaches young men how to get rich and attract women. He was granted citizenship to Vanuatu in December 2022, the OCCRP reported, the same month that he and his brother Tristan, 36, were arrested by Romanian authorities on charges of human trafficking and forming an organised crime group.Andrew Tatewas also accused of rape. The Tate brothers, who grew up in Luton in the UK, have been under criminal investigation in Romania since April 2022. Tate’s spokesperson declined to comment to the Guardian earlier this week on the reports of his Vanuatu citizenship. According to Manassah, Tate’s citizenship could be revoked if he was found guilty. “If he has been convicted then definitely measures to revoke his citizenship, that can be determined later. That would be something the government could consider in future,” he said. For now he said: “New regulations have been signed off by the prime minister and the current chairman under [citizenship commissioner] Charles Maniel, is trying to ensure that similar incidents do not happen again and that we our improve our due diligence processes.” The Tate brothers deny the allegations they face in Romania, and an appeals court said in December that a human trafficking case could not proceed because of legal and procedural irregularities. The case has been sent back to prosecutors. The pair are due to be extradited to the UK after the conclusion of proceedings in Romania.UK prosecutors confirmed last weekthey had authorised 10 charges against Andrew Tate, including rape, actual bodily harm, human trafficking and controlling prostitution for gain, and 11 charges against Tristan Tate, including rape, actual bodily harm and human trafficking. They deny the charges. The brothers would return to Britain to defend themselves, their UK lawyer said last week.",

    "title": "Japan records lowest number of births in more than a century, as population fears grow",
    "article_text": "Japan’s struggle to encourage couples to have more children has been given greater urgency after data showed the annual number of births dropped to below 700,000 for the first time since records began more than a century ago. According to government data released this week, the number of births reached 686,061 in 2024, a decline of 5.7% from theprevious yearand the lowest since statistics were first kept in 1899. The data excludes babies born toforeign residents. The fertility rate – the average number of children a woman has in her lifetime – also fell to a record-low of 1.15, down from 1.20 in 2023, the health ministry said. That is well below the rate of 2.1 needed to keep thepopulationstable. The ministry said 1.6m deaths had been recorded in 2024, up 1.9% from a year earlier. The number of births and the fertility rate have fallen for nine years in a row, although the number of marriages was slightly up last year, two years after it dipped below half a million for the first time. The number of marriages – a key factor in influencing birth trends in a country where relatively few children are born out of wedlock – rose for the first time in two years to 485,063, up by 10,322 from a year earlier. But the downward trend seen since the 1970s remains unchanged. Japan’s birthrate has been falling since it reached the second baby boom in 1973, falling below 1 million in 2016 and below 800,000 in 2022. Last year’s figure is about one-quarter of the all-time peak of 2.7 million births in 1949. The latest figures will make uncomfortable reading for officials, as the number of births has fallen into the 680,000 range 15 years earlier than forecast by the National Institute ofPopulationand Social Security Research, according to the Kyodo news agency. If current trends persists, Japan’s population of about 124 million is projected to fall to 87 million by 2070, when 40% of the population will be 65 or over. A shrinking and ageing population could have serious implications for the economy and national security, as the country seeks to boost its military to counter potential threats from China and North Korea. The prime minister,Shigeru Ishiba, who has described Japan’s demographics as a “silent emergency”, recentlyunveiled measuresto boost the birthrate, including an expansion of child allowance and free high school education, and a guarantee that couples will receive the equivalent of 100% of their take-home pay when they take parental leave at the same time. Ishiba’s predecessor, Fumio Kishida,warnedthat the falling birthrate, combined with rising numbers of deaths, threatened Japan’s ability “to function as a society”, adding the country had reached a “now or never” moment to address its demographic crisis. Butattemptsby successive governments to ease the financial pressure on couples have had little effect, with statistics showing that people continue to marry later in life, a trend that results in smaller families. The government has been criticised for focusing on married couples rather than on younger, single people who have beenput offthe idea of marriage. Many cite poor employment prospects and job security, the rising cost of living, and a corporate culture that makes it difficult for female employees to become working mothers. A 2023 survey by the Nippon Foundation found that only 16.5% of people aged 17 to 19 believed they would get married, even though a much larger proportion wanted to do so.",

    "title": "Marine heatwave found to have engulfed area of ocean five times the size of Australia",
    "article_text": "Almost 40 million sq kilometres of ocean around south-east Asia and the Pacific – an area five times the size of Australia – was engulfed in a marine heatwave in 2024, a World Meteorological Organization (WMO) report has revealed. WMO scientists said the record heat – on land and in the ocean – was mostly driven by the climate crisis and coincided with a string of extreme weather events, from deadly landslides in the Philippines to floods in Australia and rapid glacier loss in Indonesia. The region was 0.48C hotter than the average recorded between 1991 and 2020, the WMO’s State of the Climate report stated. Satellite measurements showed sea levels were rising almost 4mm per year – “significantly higher” than the global average of 3.5mm, the report said. The WMO secretary general, Prof Celeste Saulo, said ocean heat and acidification had combined to “inflict long-lasting damage” to marine ecosystems and economies. “Sea-level rise is an existential threat to entire island nations. It is increasingly evident that we are fast running out of time to turn the tide,” Saulo said. The report said extreme events that coincided with 2024’s heat included: Extreme rainfall in the Philippines in January and February causingflooding and landslides, killing at least 93 people. Early-season heatwave in Australia resulting inrecord August temperaturesacross the country’s centre. Major flooding in Singapore and Malaysia, displacing 137,000 people and killing six. Flash flooding in March on the Indonesian island of Sumatra and major flooding in north Australia at the start of 2024. Rapid glacier loss in the west of New Guinea island, Indonesia, where the report said total ice loss could occur by 2026 or soon after. The Philippines struck by 12 tropical cyclones – double the average – with damage estimated at US$430m. Australia’ssnow season ended “abnormally early”. Ben Churchill, the WMO director for the region, said: “This is a message for stronger climate action. This report shows we’re seeing things we have never seen before.” The report found that in January, April, May and June last year, almost 40 million sq kilometres of the region’s ocean surface experienced moderate to strong heatwaves. The ocean heat also drove the fifth mass coral bleaching across Australia’s Great Barrier Reef since 2016,causing widespread coral death. Assoc Prof Alex Sen Gupta, a climate scientist at the University of New South Wales, said the heatwave was “pretty remarkable” and was part of a record-breaking jump in ocean temperatures globally that started in 2023. “We’ve really never seen anything like it and we’re struggling to explain why we saw such a big jump,” Sen Gupta said. The heatwave will have stressed many organisms in the ocean that have temperature thresholds, he said. “If you go beyond them, the organism starts to fail – they either move or die.”",

    "article_text": "Victorian woman, 50, has pleaded not guilty to three charges of murder and one of attempted murder over a fatal 2023 beef wellington lunch. Follow live updates Patterson asked about lies in messages about medical appointments A text message from Gail to Patterson on the same day is shown to the court. It said: Hi Erin. Just wondering how you got on at your appointment today? Love Gail and Don. Patterson replied the next day - 29 June 2023 - and said the appointment “went ok”. She also said she had a needle biopsy of the lump and would return for an MRI the following week.Patterson agrees this was a lie.“I didn’t have an appointment and I didn’t have a needle biopsy,” she says.She agrees she also did not have a scheduled MRI appointment.Rogers asks if Patterson anticipated Gail would convey the information about her medical appointments to Simon.“The answer to that is no because I wouldn’t expect her to tell him any of that,” Patterson says. Rogers shows the court a diary entry from Gail Patterson on 28 June 2023. The entry reads “Erin - St Vincent’s arm lump.” Patterson agrees it was a reference to her. Rogers says she told Gail prior to 28 June 2023 that she had a lump in her elbow and needed to go to St Vincent’s on this date for an appointment. “You did not have a lump in your elbow on 28 June 2023,” Rogers says. “That’s true,” Patterson replies. “You did not have an appointment at St Vincent’s on 28 June 2023,” Rogers says. “No, I didn’t,” Patterson says. Rogers says Patterson had no medical issues to discuss at the lunch. “I didn’t have a legitimate medical reason. That’s true,” Patterson replies. Patterson is asked why she accessed cancer information Rogers puts to Patterson: “I suggest you accessed these images of information about cancer in May 2023.” “I don’t think I did,” Patterson says. “It was something I was quite worried about in late ‘21, early ‘22.” Rogers says: I suggest you used this information from the internet for the purpose of educating yourself on ovarian and brain cancer symptoms. Agree or disagree? “I think I did do that at one point,” Patterson replies. She says she did this in 2021 and a period going into early 2022. Patterson denies she used this information to tell a more convincing lie about cancer. Rogers asks why she did it. Patterson says: I was concerned I had ovarian cancer. I was concerned I had something wrong with my brain. Rogers says Patterson used the cancer information to allow her to have a reason for inviting her lunch guests. Patterson says: I didn’t use any reason when I invited them. I just invited them. Patterson asked about screenshots of cancer information Rogers takes Patterson to photos, modified in May 2023, that were found on a Samsung tablet police seized from Patterson’s house. One photo includes text about ovarian cancer. Rogers says the text in the screenshot outlines what happens to the brain of someone with ovarian cancer. “I suggest you conducted an internet search on this topic,” Rogers says. Patterson agrees. Patterson says she doesn’t know if she took a screenshot of this. Another photo shows text about “stage four ovarian cancer”. Rogers suggests this was an internet search conducted by Patterson. She agrees. Patterson says she doesn’t know if it was a screenshot of this search. Another photo shows text about brain lymphoma. Patterson says she also does not know if this image is a screenshot. Patterson is asked about Facebook message with emoji Rogers takes Patterson to a Facebook message she sent in a group chat on 6 December 2022. In the message, Patterson said her in-laws were refusing to adjudicate in a dispute between her and Simon over child support payments. She also wrote: “This family I swear to fucking god.” Rogers says Patterson used the “eye roll emoji” after she wrote that Don and Gail’s advice was that Patterson and Simon should pray together. She takes her to another message and says Patterson has used the “eye rolling emoji”. Patterson says it is just an emoji with a “straight mouth”. She says: “I don’t know what I’d call it.” Rogers says Patterson was “mocking” Don and Gail’s advice, including their suggestion that the couple should pray for their children. Patterson says she was frustrated. Patterson asked about religious views Rogers takes Patterson to her prior evidence that she is a Christian. She says Patterson’s Facebook friendChristine Hunttold the trial the accused said she was an atheist and struggled with Simon coming from a religious background. Patterson says she did not feel close to Hunt. She says she did not share “anything personal” in the Facebook group chat with Hunt after 2021. Patterson denies messaging in the group chat that she was an atheist. “I suggest that’s an untruth,” says Rogers. Patterson says she did not post this. Patterson asked about ‘mushrooming’ and ‘foraging’ Rogers says Patterson lied to Stuart at Monash Health when she said she did not go “mushrooming”. Patterson says she would have asked Stuart what she meant by the phrase. She says it is not a phrase she would have used. She says “mushrooming” could mean a couple of things, including “foraging” and “other uses of mushrooms” that are not eating. Under questioning by Rogers, Patterson says she uses the word “foraging” to refer to picking and eating. Patterson denies she deliberately used foraged mushrooms in the beef wellington meal on 29 July 2023. She says she did not deliberately put death cap mushrooms in the lunch meal. Court resumes The jurors have returned to the courtroom in Morwell. Court adjourns The court has adjourned for a lunch break. Patterson’s cross-examination will resume from 2.15pm. Patterson is asked about conversation with doctor about ‘mushrooming’ Rogers saysProf Rhonda Stuart, a doctor at Monash Health, testified that she had asked Patterson while she was in hospital in the days after the lunch if she had been “mushrooming”. She also asked Patterson if she used any other fungi besides store-bought ones in the beef wellington, the court heard. Stuart said Patterson replied “no” and said she only used mushrooms from Woolworths and an Asian grocer, the court hears. Rogers says: “Do you accept Prof Stuart asked you if you had been mushrooming?” “I accept that’s what she said,” Patterson replies. Patterson says she cannot remember the conversation with Stuart. Rogers suggests Patterson lied to Stuart. Patterson says she was only asked about what was in the beef wellington. “Nobody was interested in what I did months, years ago,” Patterson says. “I would have answered any questions in that context.” Patterson says at the time she understood Stuart was only asking her questions about the beef wellington dish. Patterson says she picked wild mushrooms on or after 28 April 2023 and prior to beef wellington lunch RogerstakesPattersonto evidence byDr Laura Muldoonthat in a conversation with Patterson on 31 July while at Monash hospital, Patterson denied using wild mushrooms in the beef wellington. Patterson says: “I think I did say that.” She says she did not think it was a lie at the time. Under cross-examination, Patterson says she did pick wild mushrooms prior to 29 July 2023 – the day of the fateful lunch. She says she did pick wild mushrooms on or after 28 April 2023 and prior to the lunch. She says she did so at her Leongatha home, at Korumburra botanic gardens and from the “rail trail coming out of Leongatha”. Rogers suggests Patterson lied to Muldoon. Patterson says she was only asked if she put wild mushrooms in the beef wellington meal. Erin Patterson asked about Facebook group chat messages Rogersreturns toPatterson’sformal police interview. She takes Patterson to her answer where she denied she had foraged for mushrooms or “anything like that”. Patterson says this was a lie. Rogers takes Patterson to conversations she had with her Facebook friends in a group chat, including the wide-ranging topics they messaged about. Rogers says: “Do you agree you never told any of these Facebook friends you had foraged for mushrooms?” “I don’t know if I did or I didn’t,” Patterson says. “I don’t know if I told them or not.” Rogers asks if Patterson discussed cooking wild mushrooms with her Facebook friends. “I don’t know,” she says. Patterson says it was a group chat that had run for four years and she cannot remember everything the women talked about. Rogers says one of the Facebook friends,Jenny Hay,has testified that Patterson never discussed foraging for wild mushrooms in the group chat. Patterson says Hay “might be right”. Prosecutor Nanette Rogers SCsaysErin Pattersondehydrated mushrooms, including ones she knew to be death cap mushrooms. “No, that’s not correct,” Patterson says. Rogers puts to Patterson: You lied about dehydrating food and mushrooms because if you told the police the truth that would implicate you in the poisoned lunch. Agree or disagree? Patterson says: I agree I lied because I was afraid I would be held responsible. Rogers says to Patterson: I suggest you had been dehydrating death cap mushrooms on or after the date of purchase of the dehydrator for the purpose of putting into the beef wellingtons you served up to your four guests at the lunch. “That’s not correct,” Patterson replies. Erin Patterson denies travelling to Loch to look for death cap mushrooms Rogers says Patterson saw retired pharmacistChristine McKenzie’s post on the citizen science iNaturalist on 18 April 2023 about death cap mushrooms in Loch. “I disagree,” Patterson says. Rogers says the accused then went to Loch on 28 April 2023. Patterson says: “I don’t know if I did go to Loch that day.” Patterson denies that she went to Loch on that day to find death cap mushrooms. She denies that the photo of mushroom caps are the death caps she found at Loch on 28 April 2023. Paterson also denies that the photo shows death cap mushrooms. Patterson denies she was weighing the mushrooms to determine the fatal amount to administer. Erin Patterson says mushrooms in photo are not death caps The jury is shown another photo with mushroom caps on a tray. Rogerssays mycologistDr Thomas Maygave evidence that the mushrooms were consistent with death caps. Rogers says: I suggest to you that these were death caps that you foraged on or after 28 April 2022. Correct? Pattersonreplies: No, that’s not correct. Justice Christopher Bealehas spoken to the jury about the timeline for the remainder of the trial. Erin Patterson’strial is in its sixth week. Beale reminds jurors he previously estimated the trial would run for six weeks. “I’m not going to put a figure on how much time is left to run in this trial,” he says. He says Patterson’s evidence will “probably” run into early next week. After Patterson has completed evidence, there will be legal discussion between parties in the absence of the jury, Beale says. He says one topic is whether there will be any more evidence in the case and what directions Beale will give the jury before they deliberate. Those discussions will take a couple of days. After all the evidence is completed we will then hear closing addresses from the prosecution and defence. This will be followed by Beale’s directions to the jury, called the judge’s charge. Beale says this could take a couple of days. He says the jury can take “all the time you need” when they begin deliberating. Patterson shown photos of electronic scales Erin Pattersonis shown photos of electronic scales. One photo, showing kitchen scales underneath mushrooms laid on a tray, was extracted from a tablet police seized from Patterson’s house. Another photo of digital scales was taken by police during a search of Patterson’s house on 5 August 2023 – a week after the lunch. Rogersasks Patterson how many electronic scales she owned on 5 August 2023. “I don’t know. At least one,” she says. Patterson says daughter expressed surprise about muffins containing dried mushrooms after blind taste test Prosecutor Nanette Rogers SCturns to prior evidence thatErinPattersontoldSimonshe conducted a blind taste test with muffins cooked using dehydrated mushrooms. The court previously heard she remarked that their youngest child, who did not like mushrooms, preferred a muffin with dried mushrooms in it. Under questioning by Rogers, Patterson agrees she did the blind taste test and says afterwards she told her daughter the muffins contained mushrooms. “I said to her surprise there were mushrooms in it,” Patterson says. Rogers asks what else Patterson put mushrooms in. She says she put them in spaghetti, lasagne, stews and brownies. Patterson says: “I was trying to get extra vegetables into my kids’ bodies.” Rogerssays there is evidence fromPatterson’sFacebook friends that she told them she had been dehydrating mushrooms. Erin says she used the dehydrator for other foods and believes she told her Facebook friends about this. She says she used the appliance “to dry apples, bananas … quite a lot of different types of fruit”. Rogers asks if she took photos of fruit she dehydrated. “I don’t remember. I might have,” Patterson says. Rogers takes Patterson to a Facebook message, sent in a group chat, where she wrote she had been “hiding powdered mushrooms in everything”. Patterson says she used a Thermomix to blend the mushrooms. Rogers says: I suggest you were testing how you could hide mushrooms in food without someone noticing. Patterson: I was seeing if I could put mushrooms into my kids’ food. Rogers says she was trying to do so without them noticing. “Yes, that’s fair,” Patterson says. Asked if she was only using the dehydrator for mushrooms, Patterson says, “I disagree.”",

    "article_text": "Deputy Liberal leader calls Labor’s super tax changes ‘super big and super bad’. Follow today’s news live Get ourbreaking news email,free appordaily news podcast The deputy Liberal leader and shadow treasurer,Ted O’Brien, has committed to voting against the government’s plan to trim superannuation tax breaks for very large balances. It leaves the Greens in the box seat to negotiate with Labor to get the bill through, in an early test of how the minor party will seek to make deals in this term of government. O’Brien told Sky News the opposition would “definitely, as a Coalition, oppose this unfair super tax of Labor’s every step of the way”. He called the tax changes “super big and super bad”. The changes, which Labor proposed way back in 2023, would today affect about 80,000 Australians with more than $3m in superannuation – adding an extra 15% to the earnings in their account over $3m. Labor says the changes are fair and only affect a small number of Australians. The Coalition has strongly opposed the change, saying a failure to index the threshold means more people will be caught every year, as well as vehemently criticising the plan to tax “unrealised” gains which exist on paper in someone’s super account. O’Brien has now committed the Coalition to opposing the bill. He says it will catch people who are “asset rich but cash poor”, such as farmers who may have included their farms inside their superannuation account. The Greens now loom as Labor’s pathway to pass the bill, but the minor party says it would seek to reduce the threshold from $3m to $2m – therefore capturing more people initially – but also indexing the rate, to capture fewer lower-income earners over time. However, the Greens have also signalled their willingness for a more constructive approach in this parliament, after holding up several key Labor bills last term. Parliament returns in late July. Man’s best friend has a common enemy but their employer has a new plan to help cut down on the scores of attacks every week. Australia Post will arm posties with citronella spray to ward off dog attacks after more than 1150 dog-related incidents since November. The water-based citronella spray has been introduced as a defence measure to protect posties, after repeated appeals for dog owners to secure them during deliveries failed to quell attacks. The spray temporarily distracts the dogs and allows posties to move to safety. “Dog-related hazards”- about 35,000 of them - are also flagged in the devices carried by posties. Queensland led the nation in recent post-related dog incidents, with 388, slightly more than the 329 that took place in NSW, according to Australia Post data. Australian Associated Press Climate group chief predicts more Coalition seats will fall after Boele victory Climate 200’s executive director has praised the independent candidateNicolette Boelefor prevailing in Bradfield, and said the fundraising vehicle had already “started thinking about 2028” and the next federal election. Byron Fay, in an email to supporters this afternoon, said the Coalition couldn’t form government without the seats won by teal independents, and predicted more seats would keep falling. Fay called Boele’s close win – a margin of 26 votes – a “hard-won victory”, which he said proved “every single volunteer, every cent, and every conversation matters for independent campaigns”. Fay wrote: [Boele is] a bona fide expert on decarbonisation and energy transition and she’s going to be a brilliant addition to the crossbench. I’m so excited to see what she brings to the conversation. It’s easy to think of a seat like Bradfield as just a number in parliament, but it’s so much bigger than that. It’s clear now that the seats won by independents are an ideological firewall. The Liberal Party cannot form government without them, and if they continue to tear themselves apart over net zero and climate policy in general, they will continue to lose seats like Bradfield to extraordinary community independents like Nic. Fay told supporters to “savour the win”, adding that Boele had put in a lot of work over the whole period since she came up short in Bradfield in 2022. “We’ve started thinking about 2028 and our first strategy briefings are kicking off next week,” Fay wrote, inviting supporters to get involved. Study finds family violence program focused on perpetrators effectively reducing rates of abuse A perpetrator-focused family violence program being run out of Melbourne is effectively reducing the rates of abuse, an RMIT study has found. The Alexis Family Violence Response Model is an integrated program with Victoria police and the Salvation Army targeted at hard-to-reach victim-survivors and perpetrators through a coordinated police and social services response. A report on the program has found 78% of victim-survivor participants saw a reduction in family violence in their lives. Further to this, there was an 80% drop of perpetrators considered “serious risk” after the program’s intervention. The CEO of No to Violence,Phil Ripper, says: We need the Government to take men’s violence seriously and put domestic, family and sexual violence at the centre of their leadership. We all want to live in safe and happy families and communities. Violence and abuse are preventable. We need the government to commit to radically reshaping responses to stop family violence at its source and address this national emergency. TheBureau of Meteorologyconfirmed a series of frigid days for Sydney, just five days into winter. Sydney’s Observatory Hill recorded a maximum temperature of 14.1C yesterday, the coldest maximum since 22 June 2024. This morning, Observatory Hill saw a minimum temperature of 8.3C. It was the coldest minimum temperature since 16 September. A BoM spokesperson said: Last night and today were the coldest of the year so far.

Tasmanian Labor leader defends no-confidence motion: ‘I have to stand strong’ Dean Winter, Tasmania’s opposition leader, defended the motion of no-confidence against the premier,Jeremy Rockliff. Winter spoke to reporters just hours before the vote, saying he couldn’t “stand idly by and let this premier ruin Tasmania’s budget”. Winter said: I’m the leader of the opposition. I have to stand strong for Tasmanians, for the people that rely on us. He won in minority. It was up to him to hold those agreements together. He can’t do it. Those agreements have fallen apart. That’s why the premier will be the one, later today, potentially going to the governor and asking for an early election. A man has died after being hit by a light rail carriage in Sydney’s Surry Hills this afternoon.NSW policeresponded to reports that a pedestrian was hit by the light rail about 1.15pm. When they arrived they found a man, believed to be in his 40s, under the carriage. He was treated by paramedics at the scene but died. He has not been formally identified. An investigation into the incident has begun and police have established a crime scene. A report will be prepared for the coroner. A teenage girldied in Sydneyin May 2023 after she was trapped under a tram. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is providing consular assistance to a man detained in Bali. The Daily Telegraph reported yesterday a man from Queensland was arrested after police allegedly found 104g of marijuana during a raid of a Balinese villa. Balinese police are expected to speak at a press conference today and detail any allegations and potential charges. Indonesian law classifies marijuana as a class 1 narcotic in line with heroin and cocaine. A drug trafficking conviction could result in life behind bars, while a charge on drug possession could see a sentence of up to 12 years in prison. Separately, an Australian man wasaccused of trying to smuggle drugsinto Indonesia last month. The man, 43, was arrested after police raided his house near Bali’s Kuta Beach. They allegedly seized 1.7kg of cocaine. Bali’s police chief said a sentence could result in the death penalty or life imprisonment. Dfat is also providing the man individual consular assistance. A brief note on trade deficits and surpluses It should be noted there is nothing inherently wrong with a trade deficit. Trade is of benefit to both the sending and receiving nations. At an individual level: someone has money and wants to buy something, someone else has that thing and wants to sell it. It is a win-win: the buyer gets the product they want, and the seller gets money for the goods they produced. No one is forcing anyone to buy (or sell) anything. America’s trade deficit with most countries occurs for the simple reason that America is a rich country: Americans have a lot of money to spend and they buy more stuff from overseas than they sell to foreigners. Trump has consistently said he doesn’t like trade deficits, but most government leaders don’t believe it is a valid metric to judge economic policy. ABS confirms trade surplus with US in January 2025 TheAustralian Bureau of Statisticsissued this statement (along withthis data) today: Historically, Australia has had an annual trade deficit with the USA, importing more from the USA each year than it exports. In 2024, imports from the USA reached $50.6b and exports to the USA reached $23.8b resulting in a trade deficit with the USA of $26.9b. Trade balances between countries are typically assessed on an annual basis due to the volatility of monthly trade data. However, it is worth noting the monthly trade balance with the USA moved into surplus for the first time in January 2025 following a sharp rise in exports of non-monetary gold. The monthly surplus was maintained for three consecutive months but returned to deficit in April 2025, when gold exports returned to regular trading levels. Australia’s exports of non-monetary gold to the USA have historically risen during periods of economic uncertainty such as the global financial crisis in 2008, and the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. Despite these previous peaks, the current rise in non-monetary gold far exceeds previous export levels, and has driven the Australia-USA trade balance into a monthly surplus for the first time on record. Australia’s trade deficit with the US has been one of its key arguments to the US for relief from Trump’s universal tariff regime (along with a decades-old Free Trade Agreement, and being an unswerving security ally). Australia has been hitwith a 10% tariff on most goodsgoing into the US. Steel and aluminium imports attract a 50% tariff. Albanese will argue that tariff-free trade with the US benefits America (and Americans): these figures from the ABS support that argument. Australia’s trade deficit could help Albanese’s tariff talks with Trump AsAnthony Albaneseprepares for talks on tariffs withDonald Trumplater this month, he has an extra arrow in his quiver of arguments: Australia has returned to trade deficit with the US. Australia has, for decades, run a consistent – and large – trade deficit with the US. Put simply, Australia imports more from America than it exports to America. (This is a trade surplus from the US perspective: as Donald Trump would like it). But, for the first time on record, in January this year, Australia started running a trade surplus with the US (a trade deficit, from Washington’s perspective) driven by a massive spike in gold being sold to the US. Investors typically turn to gold in times of economic uncertainty, which the Trump Administration 2.0 has inarguably been. Australia shipped a record amount of gold to the US in January – worth US$2.9bn – the highest figure on record. However, normal levels of gold trading have resumed and the more typical trade imbalance (in America’s favour) has returned. Marine heatwave engulfed area of ocean five times the size of Australia in 2024 Almost 40 million sq kilometres of ocean around south-east Asia and the Pacific – an area five times the size of Australia – was engulfed in a marine heatwave in 2024, a World Meteorological Organization (WMO) report has revealed. WMO scientists said the record heat – on land and in the ocean – was mostly driven by the climate crisis and coincided with a string of extreme weather events, from deadly landslides in the Philippines to floods in Australia and rapid glacier loss in Indonesia. The WMO secretary general, Prof Celeste Saulo, said ocean heat and acidification had combined to “inflict long-lasting damage” to marine ecosystems and economies. Saulo said: Sea-level rise is an existential threat to entire island nations. It is increasingly evident that we are fast running out of time to turn the tide.

    "title": "Erin Patterson denies deliberately foraging death cap mushrooms and weighing fatal dose as cross-examination begins",
    "article_text": "Erin Patterson has denied deliberately foraging death cap mushrooms and weighing them to calculate the fatal dose for a person, but admitted a series of lies to police as homicide detectives investigated the fatal lunch. On her fourth day in the witness box, Patterson’s cross examination started, and the jury was told the estimate for the trial had blown out by at least a fortnight. Patterson, 50, faces three charges of murder and one charge of attempted murderrelating to poisoning four in-laws with beef wellington served for lunch at her house in Leongatha on 29 July 2023. Patterson has pleaded not guilty to murdering her estranged husband Simon’s parents, Don and Gail Patterson, and his aunt Heather Wilkinson, and attempting to murder Ian Wilkinson, Simon’s uncle and Heather’s husband. Early in her cross-examination by prosecutor Nanette Rogers SC, Patterson was shown images of mushrooms on scales. She agreed the photos appeared to have been taken by her in her home. Rogers told Patterson that Dr Tom May, a mushrooms expert who gave evidence earlier in the trial, identified with a high degree of confidence that the images showed death cap mushrooms. Rogers suggested to Patterson that an image of sliced mushrooms on a dehydrator tray placed on scales showed death caps she picked on 28 April 2023 in Loch. A public post on iNaturalist earlier that month identified them growing there, and the exact location. Erin Patterson hosts lunch for estranged husband Simon’s parents, Don and Gail Patterson, and his aunt and uncle Heather and Ian Wilkinson. Patterson serves beef wellington. All four lunch guests are admitted to hospital with gastro-like symptoms. Gail Patterson and Heather Wilkinson die in hospital. Don Patterson dies in hospital. Victoria police search Erin Patterson’s home and interview her. Ian Wilkinson is discharged from hospital after weeks in intensive care. Police again search Erin Patterson’s home, and she is arrested and interviewed. She is charged with three counts of murder relating to the deaths of Don and Gail Patterson and Heather Wilkinson, and the attempted murder of Ian Wilkinson. Jury is sworn in. Murder trial begins. Jury hears that charges of attempting to murder her estranged husband Simon are dropped. “I suggest you were weighing these death cap mushrooms so that you could calculate the weight required to calculate the administration of a fatal dose for one person,” Rogers asked Patterson, before also suggesting that she calculated the weight required for fatal doses for five people. Patterson denied both suggestions. Under questioning from her lawyer, Colin Mandy SC, earlier on Thursday, Patterson said she repeatedly lied to police during her interview with detectives on 5 August about her food dehydrator. The dehydrator was later recovered at a local tip with her fingerprints on it, and with traces of death cap mushrooms on it. “And why did you tell the police those lies on the 5th of August?” Mandy asked. “Well I had disposed of it a few days earlier, in the context of thinking that maybe mushrooms that I’d foraged or the meal I’d prepared was responsible for making people sick,” Patterson responded. “And then on the Saturday, Detective Eppingstall told me Gail and Heather had passed away, and it was this stupid kneejerk reaction to just dig deeper, and keep lying. “I was just scared. But I shouldn’t have done it.” Justice Christopher Beale told the jury that it was expected the trial would continue for at least two more weeks , with Patterson’s evidence possibly stretching into next week. The trial continues.",

    "title": "AFP should take over NT police investigation into Kumanjayi White’s death, Labor MP says",
    "article_text": "An Albanese government MP based in Alice Springs has called for Australian federal police to take over the criminal investigation into the death of Kumanjayi White, an Aboriginal man whodied last week after being restrained by Northern Territory policein the town’s Coles supermarket. The 24-year-old Warlpiri man had disabilities and was living away from his community of Yuendumu in supported accommodation. Police alleged that he was shoplifting when plainclothes officers stepped in to assist the store’s security guard. Marion Scrymgour, the member for Lingiari and one of four Indigenous MPs in the federal government, said appointing AFP detectives to investigate would enable the Yuendumu community to “have full confidence in the process”. “A criminal investigation is a job which only police can undertake, because at the end of the day it has to be a police decision to charge,” the Tiwi woman said on Wednesday. “But it doesn’t have to be NT police officers who undertake the task.” The news of White’s death came as his community was bracing for the findings of an inquest into another death in custody, the fatal police shooting of 19-year-old Kumanjayi Walker in Yuendumu, where the young men had grown up together. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email That coronial inquiryunearthed shocking racismwithin the NT force, including that the TRG elite group, now disbanded, bestowed a racist mock award known as the “Coon of the Year” on the officer who behaved “most like an Aboriginal”. Scrymgour said Aboriginal people in the NT had been “shaken” by the revelations. “Trust is a fragile thing and the coronial inquiry evidence is too recent and too jarring for it not to have consequences and implications for what is now playing out inAlice Springsin the aftermath of yet another tragic death,” she said. Many of the officers involved in the Walker investigation and coronial process had experienced “ostracism” and “resentment amongst others from within the NT Police”, she added “Having detectives from the AFP take over and complete the investigation which has recently been commenced would both extract NT detectives from a role which would inevitably subject them to scrutiny and criticism, and would enable the Yuendumu community to have full confidence in the process going forward,” Scrymgour said. Lawyers for White’s family wrote to police on Friday requesting they “appoint an independent bodyfrom another state or territory to undertake … investigations in a culturally safe manner”. Police “respectfully” rejected the request. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion The family’s calls have been back by several organisations, including the Central Land Council, which urged the federal government to withhold funding from the NT government until the demand was met. “We don’t trust this government and its police force to keep us safe,” said the CLC chair, Warren Williams, who is also White’s uncle. On Thursday NT police said the coronial investigation had been paused while a criminal investigation was undertaken to determine whether any criminality was involved. Rallies are planned in major cities across this country this weekend as pressure over who will handle the investigation intensifies. This weekmarks five yearssince similar protests swept the nation as part of the global Black Lives Matter movement, calling for an end to Indigenous deaths in police and prison custody. The protests were sparked by the murder of George Floyd, a black man who died after being restrained in the prone position by police in the US.

    "article_text": "The opposition leader has encouraged “assertive women” to join the Liberals, hitting back at controversial comments made by a party elder. Sussan Ley, the first female leader of the Coalition, said the Liberals must reflect a modern Australia after the party’s former federal president Alan Stockdale reportedly claimed women had become “so assertive” that the party might need to consider extra support for men. “There is nothing wrong with being an assertive woman, in fact I encourage assertive women to join theLiberal party,” she said in a statement on Thursday. “The Liberal party must reflect, respect and represent modern Australia and that means recognising the strength, merit and leadership of the women in our ranks.” Stockdale, who was Victorian treasurer under the former premier Jeff Kennett, made the comments at a meeting of the New South Wales Liberal Women’s Council on Tuesday night. “The women in this party are so assertive now that we may needs some special rules for men to get them preselected,” the 80-year-old told the meeting,the Daily Telegraph reported. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email He later told the Telegraph he had made “a lighthearted but poorly chosen remark”. The deputy opposition leader, Ted O’Brien, questioned Stockdale’s comments, appealing to strong women to join the Liberals. “To any of the assertive women out there, the Liberal party is your party,” he told ABC’s News Breakfast on Thursday. “We need more women engaging with our party, running for our party. “I’m proud to have Sussan Ley as our leader.” The Liberals have long beenaccused of having a “women problem”as female candidates are often placed in unwinnable positions and the party has lost support from female voter bases. This was laid bare at its landslide federal election loss in May. During the campaign, the Liberal party announced a policy requiring public servants to stop working from home. It was blamed for alienating female voters, many of whom use working from home to balance their jobs with childcare and other duties. The NSW division of the Liberal party, in particular, has been in turmoil after it failed to nominate more than 140 candidates for the state-wide local government elections in September. The federal Liberals soon took over and appointed three figures, including Stockdale, to oversee the party’s state affairs. The Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie and the former Labor premier for Queensland Anna Palaszczuk joined forces to condemn Stockdale’s remarks. “Honestly, Alan, read the room,” McKenzie told Nine’s Today show on Thursday. “It was a shocking comment – I think it’s time for Alan to head back to the Melbourne Club, have a stiff whisky and chat with the old boys about what went wrong.” Palaszczuk said she couldn’t believe it. “You’ve finally got one step forward for the Liberal party with Sussan Ley being elected [leader], and it’s three steps backwards with these comments,” she told Today. “These are not appropriate in this day and age, and honestly the Liberal party needs a good hard look at themselves, especially the men.”",

    "title": "Shein accused of ‘shaming’ customers into buying more than they can afford",
    "article_text": "Consumer watchdogs from 21 countries have filed a formal complaint to EU authorities about alleged “dark” practices by the Chinese fast fashion firmSheinincluding the “shaming” of customers into buying more than they can afford. TheEuropean Consumer Organisation(BEUC) has submitted a 29-page dossier to the European Commission citing multiple examples of “dark patterns”, or deceptive techniques designed to encourage purchases. They include alleged fake countdown timers, low-stock messages, nagging practices, creating a fear of missing out, or forced registration on the site or app. BEUC says Shein also deploys what is known as “confirm shaming”, which makes the consumer feel bad if they miss out on buying a product. Shein hit back at BEUC, claiming the consumer watchdog group was unwilling to meet the company to discuss the issues. “This unwillingness to engage is extremely disappointing, particularly in light of Shein’s growing popularity among European consumers,” it said. As part of its formal complaint, the consumer watchdog group wants the EU to force Shein to disclose the data behind claims used in its marketing such as “stocks are low”, and countdown timers to sales ending. BEUC accuses Shein of “unfair commercial practice” that it claims are “leading to severe detrimental consequences on consumers and society at large”, creating wardrobes full of barely used clothes, and production methods that may use chemicals that are harmful to the environment. It has also accused the company of promoting shopping habits that increase environmental and societal problems. “On the one hand, they promote excessive spending and trigger economic losses for consumers. On the other hand, they stir overconsumption of clothing, which often also contains harmful chemicals, hence misleading and disempowering consumers in their efforts towards the green transition. Ultimately, these practices fuel the environmental and societal problems caused by the fast fashion industry,” it said in its submission. If Shein could not provide the data behind its claims over countdown sales and stock levels, it should be forced to stop this message in the EU, BEUC said. The consumer watchdog group has also raised concerns over the “circulation of unsafe products in Europe, which may not comply with EU standards for fabrics and accessories”. The complaint comes four months after theEuropean Commissionand the network of consumer protection authorities in the EU known as the Consumer Protection Cooperation Network (CPC), launched an investigation into Shein’s compliance with Europe’s consumer laws. Sign up toBusiness Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion Last week, the EU and CPC network notified Shein it was breaching EU law in a number of areas including fake discounts, “pressure selling” and “deceptive product labels”, which suggest the product offered something special when in fact the feature was required by law. They urged Shein to respect European consumer protection laws and warned the company could face fines if it failed to address the EU’s concerns. BEUC said its complaint was complementary to the EU’s action and involved “additional evidence” about the use of dark practices and “extensive research from consumer groups across Europe”. But Shein said: “Consumers would be best served if BEUC agreed to meet with us, allow us to explain our operations, and discuss openly and transparently any concerns they have. Unfortunately, they have chosen to reject each and every one of our many meeting requests over the last several years.” The company added that it was already working constructively with national consumer authorities and the European Commission to demonstrate its commitment to complying with EU law.",

    "title": "Contraception warning over weight-loss drugs after dozens of pregnancies",
    "article_text": "Women using weight-loss drugs have been urged to use effective contraception after dozens have reported becoming pregnant while taking the medication. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has issued its first alert to the UK public regarding contraception and weight-loss medications after it received 40 reports relating to pregnancies while using drugs such as Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro. Ozempic and Wegovy, which both contain semaglutide, work by mimicking a hormone called GLP-1 that triggers an increase in the production of insulin, slows the rate at which food is digested in the stomach and reduces appetite. Mounjaro, which contains the active ingredient tirzepatide, acts on a second hormone involved in appetite and blood sugar control. Although these have been referred to as “weight-loss injections”, not all are authorised for weight loss. The MHRA said Mounjaro may reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives such as the pill in people who are overweight, and that women taking the medication should use barrier contraceptives such as condoms. It said it had received 26 pregnancy-related reports for Mounjaro. Last year theGuardian reportedthat the popularity of weight-loss drugs had resulted in an unexpected baby boom. The Facebook group “I got pregnant on Ozempic” had more than 750 members at the time. The MHRA said there had been eight reports relating to pregnancy in those taking semaglutide and nine reports for liraglutide, which is found in another weight-loss drug, Saxenda. Although it is not necessary for women in the reports to say if the pregnancy was unintentional, two of these reports said the pregnancy was such. The watchdog also said these drugs must not be taken during pregnancy, while trying to get pregnant or while breastfeeding, as there was “not enough safety data to know whether taking the medicine could cause harm to the baby”. It said that in some instances women should continue using contraception for up to two months between stopping the medicine and trying to get pregnant. Dr Channa Jayasena, a consultant in reproductive endocrinology and andrology at Imperial College healthcare NHS trust, said: “GLP-1 drugs copy the natural hormones made in the gut which make you feel full. This makes them powerful treatments to help women lose weight. “Obesity reduces fertility in women. So, women with obesity taking GLP-1 drugs are more likely to get pregnant than before they lost weight. “In addition, we think that the absorption of oral contraceptive pills may be reduced with GLP-1 drugs which slow down emptying of the stomach, though more research is needed to confirm this. “The guidance produced by the MHRA is sensible, since it highlights that women could accidentally get pregnant when taking GLP-1 drugs. “We don’t know how harmful GLP-1 drugs are during pregnancy; however, we know that other forms of weight loss like weight-loss surgery can increase chances of a miscarriage. So women are advised to do all they can to prevent pregnancy while taking GLP-1 drugs.” Dr Alison Cave, the MHRA’s chief safety officer, said: “Skinny jabs are medicines licensed to treat specific medical conditions and should not be used as aesthetic or cosmetic treatments. They are not a quick fix to lose weight and have not been assessed to be safe when used in this way. “Our guidance offers patients a one-stop shop for our up-to-date advice on how to use these powerful medicines safely. “This guidance should not be used as a substitute to reading the patient information leaflet or having a conversation with a healthcare professional as part of the prescribing process.”",

    "title": "Survey of Labour Muslim MPs shows extent of disquiet over Gaza stance",
    "article_text": "Labour is facing calls for action from a large group of its Muslim MPs, councillors and mayors, who believeKeir Starmeris mishandling the crisis in Gaza. In the first-ever survey of the party’s Muslim representatives, 77% of respondents said they believed the government shouldend all UK arms exports to Israeland 84%supported sanctionsagainst the Israeli government, the Labour Muslim Network (LMN) said. Nearly all respondents – 97% – said they supported the immediaterecognition of the state of Palestine. The results are based on an online questionnaire circulated by the LMN between 2 April and 16 May. There were 221 respondents out of 477 eligibleLabourMuslim MPs, councillors and elected mayors. The findings lay bare the political difficulties the government faces over its response to the war between Israel and Hamas and the continuinghumanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. Starmer told the Commons on Wednesday that Gaza was facing “dark days” and he vowed to consider “further action”. Last month the government suspended free trade talks with Israel and hit West Bank settlers with sanctions. Ministers have come under pressure to recognise Palestine as a statejointly with France this month. More than 140 UN countries including Spain, Ireland and Norway recognise the Palestinian state, but the UK doing so would be of major significance given that the region was under British control until 1948. Labour committed in its manifestoto recognising a Palestinian state as part of a peace process resulting in a two-state solution. The government has also been considering imposing sanctions against two hard-right Israeli ministers, Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir. The third lever that ministers have at their disposal is the export of arms to Israel, although according to government figures less than 1% of Israel’s defence imports come from the UK. In the autumn, David Lammy, the foreign secretary,suspended 30 arms export licenses, from a total of 350. Campaigners and charities havelaunched a judicial reviewover allegations that the government acted unlawfully in continuing to sell F-35 parts and components to a global pool, when some of those components might be used by Israel in Gaza in a way that the government regards as a breach of international law. Labour MPs on the left of the party called for stronger action in the Commons on Wednesday. Hamish Falconer, the minister for the Middle East, said Israel’s newly introduced measures for aid delivery inGaza were “inhumane, foster desperation and endanger civilians”. He said: “We are appalled by repeated reports of mass casualty incidents in which Palestinians have been killed when trying to access aid sites in Gaza. Desperate civilians who have endured 20 months of war should never face the risk of death or injury to simply feed themselves and their families. We call for an immediate and independent investigation into these events for the perpetrators to be held to account.” In March, Lammy told the Commons he believed Israel had broken international law by blocking aid to Gaza, but a day later he wascontradicted by Downing Street. The war in Gaza cost Labour votes in areas with large Muslim communities in the election last summer, particularly after an LBC interview in which Starmer appeared to say Israel had the right to withhold water and electricity in Gaza. Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Pro-Gaza independents defeated Labour candidatesin Dewsbury and Batley, Blackburn, Birmingham Perry Barr and Leicester South and came close in several other constituencies, including Wes Streeting’s Ilford North. The LMN survey found that 58% of Labour Muslim representatives thought the government had represented British Muslims badly so far. The results also recorded dissatisfaction with the Labour party, with 66% of those surveyed saying they did not believe Muslim representatives were treated equally compared with others in the party. A third of Muslim Labour representatives said they had directly experienced Islamophobia and more than half said they did not believe the party took Islamophobia seriously. A spokesperson for the LMN said its report was a “call to action” for “a renewed commitment to Muslim representation, rooted in equality and justice”. “Our Labour party cannot credibly claim to be an anti-racist movement while ignoring the testimonies and experiences of its own Muslim elected officials,” they said. A Labour party spokesperson said: “The Labour party is proud of the diversity of our party, including the increase in the number of Muslim MPs in the parliamentary Labour party and having the first Muslim lord chancellor in Shabana Mahmood, and the first Muslim mayor of London in Sadiq Khan. “We are the party of equality and we take any complaints of discrimination, including Islamophobia, seriously. All complaints are assessed in line with our complaints policies and procedures through our independent complaints system.”",

    "title": "UK MPs call for ban on bottom trawling in protected marine areas",
    "article_text": "Ministers must ban bottom trawling for fish in marine protected areas, an influential group of MPs has said, because the destructive practice isdevastating the seabed and marine life. The UK parliament’s environmental audit committee called for a ban to encompass dredging and mining as well as the bottom trawling of fish in the 900,000 sq km covered by nearly 180 marine protected areas. Despite the name, these areas are open for many sorts of fishing, including bottom trawling – the practice of dragging immense and heavy nets across the seabed to scoop up all in their path, most of which is discarded while prized fish such as sole, cod and haddock are kept. “Bottom trawling and scallop dredging are themost damaging forms of fishing,” said Jonny Hughes, senior policy manager at the Blue Marine Foundation thinktank and charity. “They devastate the seabed and have amongst the highest rates of bycatch of any fishing method – most of this is simply thrown away. It is absurd and misleading to call any part of the ocean that allows these activities protected.” Campaigners have been calling for years for a ban, but public outcry has intensified sincea film by Sir David Attenborough was released last month, to coincide with his 99th birthday. The film, Ocean – which was released in cinemas and will be available on streaming services in June – showed in detail some of the vital habitats raked by the massive nets that in effect plough up the seabed, leaving deep scars where it can take many years for marine life to recover. Toby Perkins, the chair of the Commons committee, said: “Ministers must ensure that marine protected areas live up to their name. [They] have all the information they need to press ahead with banning bottom trawling in the offshore protected areas where it presents the most risk. Why the delay? Our oceans cannot afford any more prevarication. It is time to act.” The UK will send representatives to a UN oceans conference later this month. Ministers have previously indicated they could take action, and there are protections in place against damaging fishing practices in about 60% of the current marine protected areas but no full ban has yet been brought in. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment,Foodand Rural Affairs said: “Our precious marine animals and habitats have been under threat for too long. This government is committed to protecting and restoring our oceans to good health.”",

    "article_text": "A fundraising drive with a target of almost £3m is under way to prevent aBarbara Hepworthmasterpiece from being sold to a private buyer and taken out of the UK. Art Fund, the charity that secures art for public collections while providing financial support for museums and the Hepworth Wakefield, is trying to secure the funds in order to keepSculpture with Colour (Deep Blue and Red)in the UK. The piece, which Hepworth created in the midst of the second world war while living in Cornwall, was sold at auction byChristie’s last March for £3.8m. But the UK government placed an export bar on the sculpture, which gives the institutions until August to match the money the private buyer – who plans to take the piece abroad – was willing to pay.ArtFund has provided £750,000 but another £2.9m needs to be found before the deadline of 27 August. Eleanor Clayton, senior curator at the Hepworth Wakefield and a Barbara Hepworth specialist, said the sculpture by the Wakefield-born artist must be kept in the UK so future generations could see it on display. She said: “Hepworth is obviously one of the most important British sculptors and really set the standard for what we think of as modern sculpture today. The piece is one of the earliest and best examples of the wooden, string-carved sculptures that she became really well known for.” Clayton added: “It’s an incredible opportunity. If we’re successful, it would be pretty much on permanent display to the public, either in Wakefield or we would lend it to important exhibitions around the country.” Sculpture with Colour (Deep Blue and Red)was made in 1943 after Hepworth had moved her family to St Ives in Cornwall with her then husband, Ben Nicholson, to escape the blitz during the second world war. Hepworth had to obtain a special permit to use wood for her sculptures and the piece was crafted using string, one of the first times she had worked in such a way. “They required a government permanent permit to carve into wood,” said Clayton. “She wrote a lot about the difficulties of actually obtaining seasoned wood that wouldn’t split immediately when she started carving. There’s only a handful of these that are still in existence.” Hepworth once said the strings represented the tension she felt between “myself and the sea, the wind or the hills” inCornwall. She worked in St Ives up to her death in a fire in 1975. Sign up toHeadlines UK Get the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning after newsletter promotion Sculpture with Colour (Deep Blue and Red) was initially bought by the “patron, socialite and connoisseur” Helen Sutherland and has always remained in private ownership. The work was cherished by Hepworth and the plaster prototype of the sculpture was the only piece she brought with her to Cornwall. Clayton said that the making of the piece was remarkable, not just because of the difficulties related to the war but also the time constraints Hepworth faced due to her domestic workload. “She was juggling childcare and domestic chores,” Clayton said. “She wrote in a letter to a friend and critic how she had to work for 30 minutes, and then she had to cook for the children, and then she’d go back to the studio and carve for another 20 minutes. Then she’d have to go and do some washing. It’s sort of astonishing that it was made within these circumstances and with the threat of war in the background.” The piece was last shown in the UK as part of the Hepworthretrospective at Tate Britain in 2015– one of the rare times it’s been seen in public. That exhibition was the first big UK staging of her work since the late 1960s. For much of her lifetime Hepworth lived in the shadow of Henry Moore – the other great British 20th-century sculptor. Clayton said Hepworth had expressly wanted her work to be seen in the flesh. “She said you have to see the sculpture in three dimensions – you have to walk around it. You can’t get the sense of it from a picture, you have to see them in person.”",

    "title": "Trump signs proclamation to restrict foreign student visas at Harvard",
    "article_text": "Donald Trump signed a proclamation to restrict foreign student visas atHarvard University, the White House said on Wednesday. The order would suspend for an initial six months the entry into the US of foreign nationals seeking to study or participate in exchange programs at Harvard. Trump declared that it would jeopardize national security to allow Harvard to continue hosting foreign students. The proclamation is the US president’s latest attempt to choke the Ivy League school from an international pipeline that accounts for a quarter of the student body, and a further escalation in the White House’s fight with the institution. “I have determined that the entry of the class of foreign nationals described above is detrimental to the interests of the United States because, in my judgment, Harvard’s conduct has rendered it an unsuitable destination for foreign students and researchers,” Trump wrote in the order. Trump’s proclamation also directs the US state department to consider revoking academic or exchange visas of any current Harvard students who meet his proclamation’s criteria. Harvard in a statement called Trump’s proclamation “yet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the Administration in violation of Harvard’s First Amendment rights.” “Harvard will continue to protect its international students.” Trump singled out Harvard’s connections with China as reason for cutting off the university from foreign students. The proclamation said Harvard was linked to research that “could advance China’s military modernisation”. The statement also said Harvard was considered the top “party school” for Chinese Communist party bureaucrats and noted that the daughter of Xi Jinping, China’s leader, attended in the early 2010s. In the early 2000s, Harvard ran a “China Leaders in Development” programme in conjunction with Tsinghua University in Beijing for Chinese government officials. “I don’t think this is going to benefitUS universitiesat all,” said a Chinese undergraduate student with an offer to study at Harvard on a master’s degree starting next term who asked that his name be withheld. “It’s causing normal people, us students, a lot of anxiety.” TheTrump administrationhas been engaged in a tense standoff with Harvard, the US’s oldest and wealthiest university, freezing billions of dollars in grants and other funding and proposing to end its tax-exempt status, prompting a series of legal challenges. Harvard argues the administration is retaliating against it for refusing to accede to its demands to control the school’s governance, curriculum and the ideology of its faculty and students. Sign up toThis Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration after newsletter promotion Harvard sued after thr homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, on 22 May announced her department was immediatelyrevoking Harvard’s Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification, which allows it to enrol foreign students. Her action wasalmost immediately temporarily blockedby a Boston court. On the eve of a hearing before her last week, the department changed course and said it would instead challenge Harvard’s certification through a lengthier administrative process. Trump’s order on Wednesday invokes a different legal authority than the earlier move by the Department of Homeland Security. The legal justification for the ban, Trump said, are sections of the Immigration and Nationality Act, “which authorize the President to suspend entry of any class of aliens whose entry would be detrimental to the interests of the United States”. Trump officialshave repeatedly raised the stakes and sought new fronts to pressure Harvard, cutting more than $2.6bn in research grants and moving to end all federal contracts with the university. The latest threat has targeted Harvard’s roughly 7,000 international students, who account for half the enrolment at some Harvard graduate schools. “President Trump wants our institutions to have foreign students, but believes that the foreign students should be people that can love our country,” the White House said in a fact sheet about the proclamation. Wednesday’s two-page directive said Harvard had “demonstrated a history of concerning foreign ties and radicalism” and had “extensive entanglements with foreign adversaries” including China. As well as the spat with Harvard, the White House has pledged to “aggressively revoke” visas for Chinese students across the country, especially those with links to the CCP or in “critical fields”.",

    "title": "Trump orders inquiry into Biden’s actions as president over ‘cognitive decline’ reports",
    "article_text": "Donald Trump has ordered an investigation into Joe Biden’s actions as president, alleging top aides masked his predecessor’s “cognitive decline”. The investigation will build on a Republican-led campaign already under way to discredit the former president and overturn some of his executive actions, including pardons and federal rules issued towards the end of his term in office. Biden issued a statement dismissing the idea of a cover-up as “ridiculous”. “Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations. Any suggestion that I didn’t is ridiculous and false.” GOP lawmakers on Wednesday sought testimonyfrom five of Biden’s top aides and advisers, including his first chief of staff, about his “mental and physical faculties”. The House oversight committee headed by the Republican representative James Comer of Kentuckywas already speaking to four others,according to reports from CBS News. A separate inquiry was launched on Tuesday by Ed Martin, a justice department attorney, into clemencies Biden issued in his final days in office to family members as well as death row inmates. Biden’s cognitive abilities during his presidency have been a Republican talking point for several years and Trump has frequently suggested that some of Biden’s actions are invalid because his aides were usurping presidential authority to cover up what Trump claims is Biden’s cognitive decline. Biden, 82, is not significantly older than Trump who turns 79 this month and has also faced questions about cognitive decline. But scrutiny about Biden’s health intensified after a disastrous debate performance going into the 2024 election that led to him dropping out. Concerns about his age and mental acuity have come into sharper focus in recent weeks following the disclosure that the former president was diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer. Reporting in numerous US media outlets and a recent book co-authored by Jake Tapper, a CNN host, have also revealed that topDemocratsand people in Biden’s inner circle had serious misgivings about his ability to do the job of president. The book is referenced in an announcement about the House oversight committee’s expanded inquiry. In a memo, Trump took aim at Biden’s use of an autopen – a mechanical device that is used to replicate a person’s authentic signature, as used by presidents for decades – to sign executive actions. The administration’s investigation will focus on “who ran the United States while President Biden was in office”, according to the memo. “This conspiracy marks one of the most dangerous and concerning scandals in American history,” Trump wrote. “The American public was purposefully shielded from discovering who wielded the executive power, all while Biden’s signature was deployed across thousands of documents to effect radical policy shifts.” Trump directed Pam Bondi, the attorney general, and David Warrington, the White House counsel, to handle the investigation. Comer requested transcribed interviews with five Biden aides, alleging they had participated in a “cover-up”. “These five former senior advisers were eyewitnesses to President Biden’s condition and operations within the Biden White House,” Comer said in a statement. “They must appear before the House oversight committee and provide truthful answers about President Biden’s cognitive state and who was calling the shots.” Interviews were requested with White House senior advisers Mike Donilon and Anita Dunn, former White House chief of staff Ron Klain, former deputy chief of staff Bruce Reed and Steve Ricchetti, a former counsellor to the president. Comer reiterated his call for Biden’s physician, Kevin O’Connor, and former senior White House aides Annie Tomasini, Anthony Bernal, Ashley Williams and Neera Tanden to appear before the committee. He warned subpoenas would be issued this week if they refused to schedule voluntary interviews. Democrats have called the investigations a distraction from issues with the current administration. In an interview with CBS Sunday Morning, the former president Bill Clinton said he believed Biden was mentally sound. “The only concern I thought he had to deal with was: ‘Could anybody do that job until they were 86?’” Clinton said. “We’d had several long talks. I had never seen him and walked away thinking ‘He can’t do this any more.’” With Associated Press",

    "title": "Democratic candidates for New York mayor spar over housing, Covid and Trump",
    "article_text": "Nine Democratic candidates forNew YorkCity mayor faced off on Wednesday evening in the first of two debates ahead of this month’s primary election. Held without a live audience, the two-hour debate focused on issues facing New York City, including housing, affordability, crime, policing, public safety, and how each candidate would handle the Trump administration if elected. From the outset, the two frontrunners, former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, and Queens Assemblyman and democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, sparred over their records. Mamdani,who has seen a recent surge in popularity, accused Cuomo of being beholden to wealthy donors and corporate interests, adding that he cared more about the “1%”, “the billionaires and the profitable corporations” than “working-class New Yorkers.” “The difference between myself and Andrew Cuomo is that my campaign is not funded by the very billionaires who put Donald Trump in DC,” Mamdani said. Cuomo, who ismounting a political comebackafter resigningfrom office in 2021 amid sexual harassment allegations,dismissed 33-year-old Mamdani as inexperienced. “He’s been in government 27 minutes” Cuomo said. If Mamdani were elected Mayor, Cuomo added, Trump would go through him like a “hot knife through butter.” The crowded debate stage also featured Adrienne Adams, speaker of the New York City Council; Brad Lander, the current New York City comptroller; Scott Stringer, the former comptroller; Michael Blake, a former state assemblyman from the Bronx; Zellnor Myrie, a Brooklyn state senator; Jessica Ramos, a Queens state senator; and Whitney Tilson, a former hedge fund manager. Cuomo was a frequent target throughout the night, with candidates launching attacks at his record, criticizing his handling ofnursing home deaths during the Covid-19 pandemicand the sexual harassment allegations. A 2021 report by the New York attorney general found that the Cuomo administrationundercounted thousandsof deaths of state nursing home residents during the pandemic. On Wednesday, Cuomo defended the report and insisted that nursing home deaths were not undercounted. “There was no doubt that my administration produced the report, and it did not undercount the deaths,” Cuomo said. He also defended himself against the harassment claims, saying, “the report was done. Nothing has come out of it.” Current New York City Mayor Eric Adams was also frequently criticized on the debate stage despite not being there. Adams announced earlier this year that he would seekre-election as an independent candidatealthough he ran as a Democrat in 2021. At one point, when asked about their biggest political regrets, City Council speaker Adrienne Adams replied, “My biggest regret is believing that Eric Adams would be a good mayor for all New Yorkers.” Mamdani said his regret was “trusting leaders of Democratic party like Cuomo.” While Cuomo answered: “the state of the Democratic party” prompting backlash from Speaker Adams. “No personal regrets?” she asked. “No regrets when it comes to cutting Medicaid or healthcare? No regrets when it comes to slow-walking PPE and vaccinations in the season of Covid to Black and brown communities? Really, no regrets?”. Cuomo pushed back, calling her claims “inaccurate” and saying that “Medicaid went up under me.” Wednesday’s debate marked the first of two scheduled Democratic primary debates before the primary election later this month. The second debate is set for 12 June. The Democratic primary election will be held on 24 June, with early voting beginning 10 days earlier, on 14 June. New Yorkers will cast their votes usingranked-choice ballot, allowing them to select up to five candidates in order of preference. The general mayoral election is scheduled for 4 November.",

    "title": "Trump issues travel ban barring US entry from 12 countries and signs order restricting student visas at Harvard – as it happened",
    "article_text": "This blog has now closed. You can read more of our US politics coveragehere Trump signs order banning citizens of 12 countries from entering the US Trump signs proclamation to restrict foreign student visas at Harvard Trump orders inquiry into Biden’s actions as president over ‘cognitive decline’ reports Donald Trump imposed a sweeping new travel ban in a presidential proclamation issued on Wednesday evening, barring entry to the United States for all nationals of a dozen countries, and restricting entries from an additional seven nations. Inthe proclamation, Trump references the travel ban he issued at the start of his first term, in 2017, which promptednationwide protests at airports, and claims that new restrictions are necessary for national security on nations where vetting or immigrants or even tourists is difficult for US officials. “I have determined to fully restrict and limit the entry of nationals of the following 12 countries: Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen”, Trump states in the proclamation. “I have determined to partially restrict and limit the entry of nationals of the following 7 countries: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela.” The banning of all citizens from Haiti is notable since, during his 2024 campaign for the presidency, Trump amplified false claims made by his running mate, JD Vance, that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio were “eating the pets of the people that live there.” The proclamation falsely claims that “hundreds of thousands of illegal Haitian aliens flooded into the United States during the Biden Administration” and this “influx harms American communities”. In fact, about 200,000 Haitians were granted Temporary Protected Status, which gives legal residency permits to foreign nationals who are unable to return home safely due to conditions in their home countries. In other words, the Haitians slandered by Trump and Vance last year were legal residents of that Ohio town. The restrictions on Afghans are also jarring, given that many of the Afghans approved to live in the US as refugees were forced to flee their home country as a result of working to support US troops there, before the full withdrawal of US forces in 2021. The agreement with the Taliban to withdraw US troops was negotiated by Trump during his first term. Last month, homeland security secretary Kristi Noemannounced“the termination of Temporary Protected Status for Afghanistan” effective 20 May. “We’ve reviewed the conditions in Afghanistan with our interagency partners, and they do not meet the requirements for a TPS designation”, Noem said. “Afghanistan has had an improved security situation, and its stabilizing economy no longer prevent them from returning to their home country.” She did not explain how Afghans who had worked for the US military during its fight against the Taliban could now be considered safe in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. This ends our live coverage of the secondTrump administrationfor the day, but we will be back on Thursday. Among the day’s developments: Donald Trumpissued a sweeping new travel ban, with the total exclusion of citizens of 12 countries from entering the United States, and the partial exclusion of nationals of seven others. Trump also ordered an investigation of the validity of the actions of his predecessor,Joe Biden, based in part on a viral conspiracy theory. In the most severe step yet in hi campaign againstHarvard University, Trump said that no visas would be issued to foreign student to study there. Elon Muskcontinued to rage-post against the spending and tax bill that Trump wants to sign. In a video statement justifying the new travel bans, Trump lumped together economic migrants who might overstay tourist visas with terrorists plotting attacks as “national security threats”. When we have more time to consider it, it might be interesting to explore what, if anything, the five nations that were included in Trump’soriginal travel ban, a list that was revised four times in his first term, but not on his new one, did in the meantime to get excluded. Those nations are: Kyrgyzstan, Nigeria, North Korea, Syria and Tanzania. We know that the leaders of North Korea and Syria have impressed Trump, but what might explain the exclusion of those other three countries from the new list? In a brief, pre-recorded White House address posted on social media on Wednesday evening,Donald Trumpargued that this week’s terror attack in Boulder, Colorado, “underscored the extreme dangers posed to our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted, as well as those who come here as temporary visitors and overstay their visas. We don’t want them.” Trump went on to claim that the new travel restrictions on 19 nations he imposed on Wednesday were necessary to prevent further such attacks. One flaw in that argument, however, is that Egypt, which is the home country of the suspected attacker, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, is not on the list. Neither is Kuwait, where Soliman reportedly lived for 17 years. Soliman had also not simply overstayed his tourist visa, but had applied for asylum before the visa expired. “Today, there are millions and millions of these illegals who should not be in our country,” Trump claimed. In itsmost recent annual reportto Congress, the Department of Homeland Security estimated that 565,155 people, or 1.45% of foreign visitors, had overstayed their visas in 2023. Trump said that on his first day back in office he had directed the secretary of state to conduct a review of “high risk regions and make recommendations for where restrictions should be imposed”. Among the “national security threats” US officials considered, Trump said, are “the large-scale presence of terrorists; failure to cooperate on visa security; inability to verify travelers’ identities; inadequate record-keeping of criminal histories and persistently high rates of illegal visa overstays”. By lumping together economic migrants who might overstay tourist visas with terrorists plotting attacks as “national security threats”, Trump appeared to invoke the power vested in him as president to defend the US from attack to justify excluding visitors from poor nations, whose citizens might be fleeing poverty or civil unrest. The nations Trump singled out as examples in his address were Yemen, Somalia, Haiti and Libya. That is, three Muslim-majority nations that were included in thetravel ban Trump imposed in 2017, and Haiti, a country the presidentreportedly referred toas one of the “shithole countries” he did not want to accept refugees from in 2018, and whose citizens hespread a malicious rumor aboutduring a presidential debate in 2024. Donald Trump ordered an investigation into Joe Biden’s actions as president, alleging that his top aides masked his predecessor’s ‘cognitive decline’ and asserting as fact a viral conspiracy theory that Biden was unaware of the contents of pardons and orders signed in his name using automatic signature technology. An autopen is a mechanical device that is used to replicate a person’s authentic signature, and presidents have used them for decades. The investigation builds on a Republican-led campaign to discredit the former Democratic president and overturn some of his executive actions, including presidential pardons and federal rules. Speculation about Biden’s cognitive abilities had been a Republican talking point for years, and Trump’s 2020 campaign even manufactured fake Biden senior moments through deceptive video editing. The former president’s declining mental acuity was, however, glaringly obvious four years later, when he was forced to abandon his run for reelection after a disastrous performance in an early debate his aides had pushed for. Subsequent reporting in a pair of books – Fight by Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes, and Original Sin by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson – revealed that top Democrats and people in Biden’s inner circle also had serious misgivings about his ability to do the duties of president. In a newpresidential memorandum, Trump directs the White House counsel, “in consultation with the Attorney General and the head of any other relevant executive department or agency” to “investigate, to the extent permitted by law, whether certain individuals conspired to deceive the public about Biden’s mental state and unconstitutionally exercise the authorities and responsibilities of the President.” “This conspiracy marks one of the most dangerous and concerning scandals in American history,” Trump says in the memo. “The American public was purposefully shielded from discovering who wielded the executive power, all while Biden’s signature was deployed across thousands of documents to effect radical policy shifts.” Read more here: In apresidential proclamation, apparently signed earlier on Wednesday in private, Donald Trump has barred foreign students from obtaining visas to enter the United States to attend Harvard University. “I have determined that it is necessary to restrict the entry of foreign nationals who seek to enter the United States solely or principally to participate in a course of study at Harvard University or in an exchange visitor program hosted by Harvard University,” Trump said in the written order. The legal justification for the ban, he said, are sections of the Immigration and Nationality Act, “which authorize the President to suspend entry of any class of aliens whose entry would be detrimental to the interests of the United States”.

A Guatemalan man who said he was deported to Mexico despite fearing he would be persecuted there for being gay was flown back to the US on Wednesday after a judgeorderedthe Trump administration to facilitate his return, his lawyer said. Brian Murphy, a US district judge in Boston, Massachusetts, had ordered the man’s return after the US Department of Justice notified him that its claim that the man had expressly stated he was not afraid of being sent to Mexico was based on erroneous information. In a court order last month, Murphy found that the deportation of the man, identified in legal filings only as OCG, likely “lacked any semblance of due process”. Read more here: AsElon Musk’s posting spree against the massive spending and tax billcontinuestorage on, the Wall Street Journalreportsthat the billionaire Republican donor’s criticism was prompted, in part, by his anger over the White House decision to withdrawn the nomination of his ally to run the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa). According to the Journal’s reporting: A senior White House official said Trump wasn’t happy about Musk’s decision to lambaste his signature legislation, describing the president as confused as to why theTeslachief executive decided to ratchet up his criticism after working so closely with the president for four months. The official said senior Trump advisers were caught off guard by Musk’s latest offensive. The uneasy alliance between the two men was also strained by a recent move by the White House to nixTrump’s nomineeto run NASA, Jared Isaacman, according to people familiar with the matter. Musk, a close ally of Isaacman, had advocated for him to get the job. The decision infuriated Musk, who complained to associates over the weekend that he had donated hundreds of millions of dollars to help get Trump elected in last year’s campaign, only to see Isaacman’s nomination pulled, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said. Musk’s frustration over the NASA episode made him more willing to aggressively criticize the tax bill, people close to him said. Jared Isaacman, the billionaire private astronaut who had been Musk’s pick to lead Nasa, suggested ina podcast interviewon Wednesday that his abrupt withdrawal as Trump’s nominee to be Nasa administrator, as he was about to be confirmed by the Senate, was an act of retribution against Musk by White House advisers. Speaking to the All-In podcast, Isaacman said that he got a call last Friday infomring him that Trump had decided to pull his nomination. “I don’t think the timing was much of a coincidence”, Isaacman said, referring to Musk’s departure from his White House role the same day. “There were some people that had some axes to grind, I guess, and I was a good, visible target.” he added. Isaacman also dismissed news reports, based on anonymous White House sources, that his past donations to Democrats had been the cause of his sudden defenestration. He suggested that it was more likely “an influential adviser coming in” and suggesting to Trump that the nomination should be killed. “I think that was exactly how it went.” A federal judge in Colorado on Wednesday temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting the family of Mohamed Sabry Soliman, the man charged in the firebombingattack in Boulder, Colorado, on Sunday. US district court judge Gordon Gallagher granted a request to halt deportation proceedings of Soliman’s wife and five children, after they weretaken into federal custodyon Tuesday by US immigration authorities. “The court finds that deportation without process could work irreparable harm and an order must issue without notice due to the urgency this situation presents,” Gallagher wrote in the order. Soliman, an Egyptian national, is facing federal and state charges over the attack on a crowd of people who were demonstrating in support of Israeli hostages who remain captive in Gaza. His family members have not been charged. Read more: Donald Trumpremains committed to passing his spending and tax bill through the US Senate, despite increasingly vocal opposition from his billionaire donor, and former aide,Elon Musk, a White House official told Reuters on Wednesday. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also told the news agency that the White House will not consult Musk on every policy decision. The report comes as Musk has ramped up his opposition to the bill, arguing against it in two dozen posts on his social media platform TwitterX in the past 24 hours. In one post to his 220 million followers on the platform, Musk rallied voters to contact lawmakers,writing: “Call your Senator, Call your Congressman, Bankrupting America is NOT ok! KILL the BILL.” He followed that witha meme imageof Uma Thurman adapted from the movie “Kill Bill”. Musk also endorsed a proposal from another opponent of the bill, SenatorRand Paul, who argued that he would vote for an alternative bill that simply maintained the tax cuts signed by Trump in 2017. However, asDonald Schneider, the former chief economist of the House Republican Ways and Means Committee, points out, Musk’s endorsement of a bill to just extend the 2017 tax cuts, which would massively benefit him personally, instead of the spending bill thatadds $2.4tn to the deficitseems to betray a “basic misunderstanding” – since a bill like that “adds $4 trillion to the deficit”. One day after sheadmittedthat she did not read the full text of the massive Republican spending bill she voted for, and would have voted against it if she had done so, far-right Georgia RepresentativeMarjorie Taylor Greenewas confronted with her change of heart by a Democratic colleague on the House oversight committee. During a hearing, RepresentativeRobert Garciadisplayeda placard with a blown-up image of a post from Elon Musk criticizing the spending bill and mentioned that Greene now said she regretted voting for it. But when he asked Greene to confirm that she was now against the bill, she refused to acknowledge what she said just yesterday and seemed to reverse her reversal. “I’m proud to have voted for that bill”, Greene said. The United States on Wednesday vetoed a UN security council resolution demanding an “immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire” in Gaza, the release of all hostages and the resumption of humanitarian aid deliveries. Before the vote the deputy US representative to the United Nations,Dorothy Shea,called the resolution“unacceptable” because it failed to include language blaming Hamas for the conflict and demanding that the Palestinian militant group disarm and leave the besieged Gaza Strip. The 14 other members of the 15-nation council voted in favor of the resolution, which described the humanitarian situation in Gaza as “catastrophic” and called on Israel to lift all restrictions on the delivery of aid to the 2.1 million Palestinians in the territory. Shea urged the UN to accept the sidelining of its own humanitarian aid agencies and support the work of the Israeli-backed, US-led Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which has led to the killings of scores of Palestinians seeking aid in its first week. Israel’s UN ambassador,Danny Danon,thanked the USfor vetoing what he called “a gift to Hamas” and a “surrender to terror”. “Hurricane season just started and we’re actively seeing the consequences of Trump’s cuts to NOAA and NWS right before our eyes”, RepresentativeMaxwell Alejandro Frost, a Florida Democrat,wrotein a social media post on Wednesday. To support his point, Frost shared avideoofJohn Morales, a veteran weatherperson with NBC’s South Florida affiliate NBC6, who argued during a broadcast this week that federal cuts to the National Weather Service would make it harder for him to provide accurate forecasts of the path of hurricanes this year, potentially putting the lives of some viewers at risk. Inan articleon the broadcaster’s website, Morales explained what prompted his warning: 2025’s hurricane season is already unprecedented. Never have we faced the combustible mix of a lack of meteorological data and the less accurate forecasts that follow, with an elevated propensity for the rapidly intensifying hurricanes of the manmade climate change era. Am I worried? You bet I am! And so are hundreds of other scientists, including all living former U.S. National Weather Service (NWS) directors, who fear a “needless loss of life” as a result of the loss of staff and resources at NWS brought on since January. Central and southern Florida’s NWS offices are currently 19 to 39 percent understaffed. While that might be barely enough on a sunny day, long stretches of impending severe weather—like a hurricane—could lead to mistakes by tired skeleton crews can only work so many back-to-back shifts. Across the country, less data is being collected by fewer weather balloon launches as a result of the staff shortages. Moralespostedthe video of his on-air warning on Elon Musk’s Twitter/X, with the comment: “Cuts have consequences.” In response to a viewer who scolded him for his warning, by writing: “Please don’t inject politics into your weather newscasts,” Moraleswrote: “Let me think about it. Okay I’m done thinking. No.” I’m at aDemocraticconference in Washington where party divisions were exposed whenpro-Palestinianprotesters stormed the stage. CongressmanRitchie Torres, a staunch supporter ofIsraelwho has publicly rejected claims of genocide inGaza, was being interviewed by journalistJosh BarroatWelcomeFest, billed as the biggest public gathering of centrist Democrats. About a dozen demonstrators marched forward and gathered around Torres with signs that included “Fire Ritchie” and “Gays against Genocide”. The New York congressman indicated that he welcomed the protesters’ right to free speech, responding: “Freedom is a beautiful thing. Thank God for freedom!” This article includes content hosted onembed.bsky.app. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as the provider may be using cookies and other technologies.

Organisers of the event including Liam Kerr - wearing a football jersey customised with former senatorJoe Manchin’s nameon the back - joined security staff in removing the protesters, who offered token resistance. As they did so, Carly Simon’s 1972 hit “You’re So Vain“ boomed from loudspeakers with an accompanying video. Once the demonstrators were gone, some audience members rose to give a standing ovation. Karine Jean-Pierre, who served as White House press secretary forJoe Biden, has left theDemocratic partyto become an independent, according to the publisher of her forthcoming book. Jean-Pierre, who served two Democratic White Houses, is expected to detail the weeks that preceded Biden’s monumental decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race, per a preview of the book, which is set to be published this fall. The book, titled Independent: A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines, promises a detailed recounting of “the three weeks that led to Biden’s abandoning his bid for a second term and the betrayal by the Democratic party that led to his decision”. Jean-Pierre did not arrive “lightly” at her decision to leave the Democratic party, according to the publisher. The book, billed as a “hard-hitting yet hopeful critique”, will make the case for “why Americans must step beyond party lines to embrace life as Independents”. Jean-Pierre’s announcement comes as the party has been forced to reckon with its decision to staunchly support Biden’s decision to seek a second term as the oldest serving president in American history and despite voter concerns about his age and mental acuity. Tensions between Jean-Pierre and the White House press corps grew tense last year, as reporters pressed for more access and transparency around the president’s health. Conservatives on a state college board reversed a decision to hire the experienced academicSanta Onoto lead the University of Florida, despite his efforts to distance himself from previous support for diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives and past criticism ofDonald Trump. The 10-6 vote followed acontentious meeting of the Florida board of governorson Tuesday when members argued over Ono’s record, including accusations he failed to protect Jewish students duringpro-Palestinian protestslast year while he was president of the University of Michigan. The rejection came a week after UF trusteesvoted unanimouslyto appoint him as the 14th president of the state’s third-largest university at a salary of $1.5m. It also followed what some critics saw as an attempt by Ono to “clean up” his record. His name wasquietly removedlast month from a letter signed by more than600 university presidentsaccusing the Trump administration of unprecedented interference in academic institutions. Ono wrote anopinion piece for Inside Higher Edin May explaining why he no longer believed DEI on campus represented equal opportunities for students. “Over time, I saw how DEI became something else – more about ideology, division and bureaucracy, not student success,” Ono wrote, taking credit for eliminating university DEI offices in Michigan. “Combating antisemitism has [also] been a priority throughout my career. I’ve worked closely with Jewish students, faculty and community leaders to ensure that campuses are places of respect, safety and inclusion for all.” At least one governor in Tuesday’s board meeting in Tallahassee was skeptical of Ono’s shifting views. And a number of conservative figures inFlorida, where the Republican governor,Ron DeSantis, has led an assault on what he sees as “woke ideology” on campuses, were previously critical of Ono’s nomination. They pointed to, among other issues, Ono’s previous support for DEI efforts, and a claim he wasslow to respondto pro-Palestinian protests at the University of Michigan’s Ann Arbor campus in April and May last year. The university hassincetaken a particularly harsh approach to cracking down on the protests. Fox Newshas some more detailabout the notice the Department of Education’sOffice of Civil Rightssent to the accrediting body that auditsColumbia University, notifying it that the Ivy League school is currently failing to meet its standards for accreditation. Accreditors determine which institutions are eligible for federal student loans and Pell grants. Per Fox News’s story: The Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE), which is a recognized accrediting body for degree-granting higher education institutions across the mid-Atlantic, ensures that its member schools – such as Columbia – meet established standards of academic quality, integrity, institutional effectiveness and more. MSCHE is one of several accrediting institutions across the country that the Department of Education deems reliable. Only institutions accredited by Department of Education-recognized accreditors are eligible to participate in Title IV federal financial aid programs, such as Pell Grants and federal work-study or student loan programs. Education secretaryLinda McMahonsaid in a statement: Accreditors have an enormous public responsibility as gatekeepers of federal student aid. They determine which institutions are eligible for federal student loans and Pell Grants.Just as the Department of Education has an obligation to uphold federal antidiscrimination law,university accreditors have an obligation to ensure member institutions abide by their standards. We look forward to the Commission keeping the Department fully informed of actions taken to ensure Columbia’s compliance with accreditation standards, including compliance with federal civil rights laws. The notice marks the latest escalation in the Trump administration’s bid to beat Columbia into line because of what it alleges is the college’s failure to protect students fromantisemiticharassment. It follows thecancellation of $400min federal grants and contracts, after which the universityyieldedto a series of changes demanded by the administration, including setting up a new disciplinary committee, initiating investigations intostudents critical of Israel’s war inGaza, and reassigning control of its Middle East Studies department. Columbia has been the epicenter of a pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel student protest movement that roiled US campuses over the last year and a half. The Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services said last month that an investigation found that the university had acted with “deliberate indifference” towards the harassment of Jewish students during campus protests. The Department of Education said it has notifiedColumbia University’s accreditor of a violation of federal anti-discrimination laws by the Ivy League school. This violation, the department said, means that Columbia has failed to meet the standards of accreditation set by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. The university did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. I’ll bring you more on this as we get it. TheTrump administrationis considering a $1,000 fee for tourists and other non-immigrant visa applicants seeking an expedited interview appointment though government lawyers have raised legal red flags over the plan, according to an official and an internal state department memo. Individuals entering the US on tourist and other non-immigrant visas already pay a $185 processing fee. The new $1,000 option the US is considering would be a premium service that allows some people to jump to the front of the line for visa interviews. The program could arrive in pilot form as soon as December, the memo reviewed by Reuters said. The proposed fee for visa appointments, which has not been previously reported, comes alongsideDonald Trump’s vision of a “gold card” that would sell US citizenship for $5m, granting faster access to those willing to pay. But the state department’s legal team said there was a “high risk” it would be rejected by the White House budget office or struck down in US courts, the memo said. Setting a fee above the cost to provide the service “is contrary to settled supreme court precedent”, the memo said. A state department spokesperson said the department does not comment on internal documents and communications. “The department’s scheduling of non-immigrant visa interview appointments is dynamic and we are continually working to improve our operations worldwide,” the spokesperson said.",

    "title": "Trump signs order banning citizens of 12 countries from entering the US",
    "article_text": "Donald Trump has signed a sweeping order banning travel from 12 countries and restricting travel from seven others, reviving and expanding the travel bans from his first term. The nationals of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen will be “fully” restricted from entering the US, according to the proclamation. Meanwhile, the entry of nationals of Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela will be partially restricted. The US president said that he “considered foreign policy, national security, and counterterrorism goals” in deciding the scope of the ban. Trump had cued up the ban in anexecutive ordersigned on 20 January, his first day back in the White House, instructing his administration to submit a list of candidates for a ban by 21 March. Trump has cited a range of justifications for the bans, including national security and concerns that visitors from those countries are overstaying their visas. But advocates and experts have said that blanket travel bans discriminate against groups of people based on ethnicity alone. They will likely result – as the travels bans did during Trump’s first term – in the separation of families. The bans on travel from Haiti, Cuba and Venezuela could be especially impactful in US communities with huge immigrant populations from those countries. “This discriminatory policy, which limits legal immigration, not only flies in the face of what our country is supposed to stand for, it will be harmful to our economy and communities that rely on the contributions of people who come to America from this wide range of countries,” said Pramila Jayapal, a Democratic representative of Washington. The decision to ban travel from these countries comes amid a wave of hardline immigration policies that Trump has issued, including the blocking of asylum claims at the southern border and cancelling temporary protected status for immigrants from a number of countries facing deep humanitarian crises. Trump has also signed a proclamation to restrict foreign student visas atHarvard Universityand ordered US consulates to conduct social media screening of every visa applicant seeking to travel to the university. In a video message released on social media, Trump said he was making good on a promise to act following therecent attack at a Boulder, Colorado, eventshowing support for Israeli hostages. The attack by an Egyptian national “underscored the extreme dangers posed to our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted, as well as those who come here as temporary visitors and overstay their visas. We don’t want them,” he said. Trump added that the list was “subject to revisions based on whether material improvements are made” and that “likewise, new countries could be added as threats emerge around the world”. Having instituted atravel banon Muslim countries early in his first term, Trump trailed his plans for a new ban during his election campaign against Kamala Harris last year. “I will ban refugee resettlement from terror-infested areas like the Gaza Strip, and we will seal our border and bring back the travel ban,” Trumpsaidin September. “Remember the famous travel ban? We didn’t take people from certain areas of the world. We’re not taking them from infested countries.” Sign up toHeadlines US Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning after newsletter promotion He was referring to the ban he imposed after taking office in January 2017, leading tochaos at airportsas protesters and civil rights attorneys rushed to help affected travelers. Trump said the ban was needed to combat terrorist threats. It wasblocked by federal courtson civil liberties grounds but the US supreme court, to which Trump would eventually appoint three hardline rightwing justices,allowedthe ban to stand. The supreme court said Trump’s ban did not target Muslims – despite the fact it originally targeted travelers from Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen, Muslim-majority countries. According to the court, the ban fell within the remit of a president’snational security powers. North Korea and Venezuela were alsoincluded. The Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair) said then: “The Muslim ban’s bigotry should have been as clear to the supreme court as it is to the Muslims demonized by it. Apparently, everyone but the supreme court can see the decision for what it is: an expression of animosity.” In 2020, shortly before the Covid pandemic drastically reduced world travel, Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Nigeria, Myanmar, Tanzania and Sudan wereaddedto the ban. In 2021, that travel ban was among measures Joe Bidenendedwithin hours of being sworn in as Trump’s White House successor.",

    "title": "Vietnam scraps two-child policy to combat falling birthrate",
    "article_text": "Vietnam has scrapped its longstanding two-child policy as it aims to reverse its declining birthrate and ease the pressure from an ageing society. All restrictions were removed this week, and couples will be free to have as many children as they choose, according to Vietnamese media. Minister of Health Dao Hong Lan said that a future shrinking population “threatens Vietnam’s sustainable economic and social development, as well as its national security and defence in the long term,” the Hanoi Times reported. Between 1999 and 2022, Vietnam’s birthrate was about 2.1 children per woman, the replacement rate needed to keep the population from shrinking, but the rate has started to fall, the news outlet said. In 2024, the country’s birthrate reached a record low of 1.91 children per woman. Regional neighbours like Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong all have declining birthrates, but their economies are more advanced than Vietnam’s. Vietnam’s working-age population is expected to peak around 2040, according to the World Bank, and it aims to avoid the trap of “getting old before it gets rich”. The country’s communist government introduced the two-child policy in 1988 to ensure it had adequate resources as it transitioned from a planned to a market economy. At the time, Vietnam was also still overcoming the effects of decades of war. Vietnam’s two-child policy was most strictly enforced with members of Vietnam’s Communist Party, according to the Associated Press, but families everywhere could lose out on government subsidies and assistance if they had a third or fourth child. As well as a declining birthrate, Vietnam is also facing significant imbalances across different regions and social groups, the Ministry of Health said. The declining birthrate is most pronounced in urban areas such as Ho Chi Minh and the capital Hanoi, where the cost of living is highest. But there are also significant disparities in gender. Last year, Vietnam’s sex ratio at birth was 111 boys to every 100 girls. The disparity between male and female births is most pronounced in North Vietnam’s Red River Delta and the Northern Midlands and Mountains, according to the World Bank, and lowest in the Central Highlands and Mekong River Delta. Vietnam prohibits doctors from telling parents the sex of their children to curb sex-selective abortions, but the practice continues, with doctors communicating via coded words, according to Vietnamese media. Left unchecked, the General Statistics Office warned there could be a “surplus of 1.5 million men aged 15-49 by 2039, rising to 2.5 million by 2059”. In a bid to reverse this trend, the Health Ministry separately proposed tripling the fine for “foetal gender selection” to about $3,800.",

    "title": "Donald Trump announces US travel ban on 12 countries, restrictions on seven",
    "article_text": "United States President Donald Trump has signed an executive order imposing a full travel ban on people from 12 countries and restricting the citizens of seven other countries, the White House said. The banned countries include Afghanistan, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Myanmar, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. In addition to the ban announced on Wednesday, there will be heightened restrictions on people from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. “I must act to protect the national security and national interest of the United States and its people,” Trump said in his order. The order comes into force on Monday, June 9, 2025 at 12:01am local time in Washington, DC (04:01 GMT). Visas issued before that date will not be revoked, the order said. In a video message released by the White House, Trump said the recent attack on a pro-Israel rally in Boulder, Colorado had “underscored the extreme dangers posed to our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted”. The president claimed there were “millions and millions of these illegals who should not be in our country”. “We will not let what happened in Europe happen to America,” he said, adding, “very simply, we cannot have open migration from any country where we cannot safely and reliably vet and screen those who seek to enter the United States”. “We will not allow people to enter our country who wish to do us harm.” \"We cannot have open migration from any country where we cannot safely and reliably vet and screen… That is why today I am signing a new executive order placing travel restrictions on countries including Yemen, Somalia, Haiti, Libya, and numerous others.\" –President Trumppic.twitter.com/ER7nGM4TO2 — The White House (@WhiteHouse)June 4, 2025 During his first term in 2017, Trump issued an executive order banning travel to the US by citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. People from the named countries were either barred from getting on their flights to the US or detained at US airports after they landed. Those affected included tourists, people visiting friends and family, students and faculty members at US institutions, and businesspeople. The order, often referred to as the “Muslim ban” or the “travel ban”, was reworked amid legal challenges until a version was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018, which banned categories of travellers and immigrants from Iran, Somalia, Yemen, Syria and Libya, plus North Korean and some Venezuelan government officials and their families. Trump defended his initial travel ban on national security grounds, arguing that it was aimed at protecting the US and claiming that it was not anti-Muslim. However, Trump had called for a travel ban on Muslims during his first campaign for the White House. Trump also signed an executive order on Wednesday to suspend the entry of foreign nationals seeking to study or participate in programmes at Harvard, accusing one of the US’s most prestigious universities of having “a history of concerning foreign ties and radicalism”. The order directs the US State Department to “consider revoking” existing academic or exchange visas of any current Harvard students “who meet the Proclamation’s criteria”. Last month, the US State Department ordered all its consular missions overseas to begin additional vetting of visa applicants looking to travel to Harvard University for any purpose, according to an internal cable seen by Reuters. Harvard has accused the US administration of retaliating against it for refusing to accede to Trump’s demands to control the school’s governance, curriculum and the ideology of its faculty and students. The visa restrictions follow earlier moves to freeze billions of dollars in grants and other funding to Harvard, end the university’s tax-exempt status and open an investigation into whether it discriminated against white, Asian, male or straight employees or job applicants. Last month, the administration revoked Harvard’s ability to enrol foreign students. While that move was blocked by a federal court in Boston, Trump’s latest order invokes a different legal authority, the Associated Press news agency reports.",

The same retailers will also have the newSwitch 2 Pro Controller, theSwitch 2 camera, first-party carrying cases, and other launch-day accessories. We’ll be publishing a ton of Switch-related coverage in the coming days —including our full Switch 2 review— but in the meantime, we’ve rounded up all the details you need to know if you want to attempt to secure a console on day one.

You can snag a Switch 2 at Walmart Supercenters starting on June 5th at 12AM ET / June 4th at 9PM PT, while supplies last. Online orders are now open, although, as expected, stock is limited and subject to availability. In terms of what’s on offer, Walmart’s launch day slate includes both thestandalone Switch 2($449) and theMario Kart Worldbundle($499), along with games and the following accessories: GameStop previously confirmed that it will have additional Switch 2 stock available both in-store and online when the console launches on June 5th.

If you do manage to obtain one, your console purchase is guaranteed. As expected, Target will offer “additional software, amiibo and accessories” while supplies last.

Despite all of the vibrant colors and singing, there’s a dark undertone in the newWicked: For Goodtrailer that speaks to how the first movie ended. Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo) has become known as the Wicked Witch of the West, and the Wizard (Jeff Goldblum) has convinced everyone in Oz that she’s a villain who’s meant to be feared. With Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh) working her own magic to create chaos across Oz and Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey) being the face of the Wizard’s hunt to find Elphaba, people are inclined to believe that she truly is a danger to them all. But the trailer makes it abundantly clear that Glinda (Arianna Grande) hasn’t bought into the negative propaganda about her good friend at all. The trailer makesWicked,part two, seem like it’s going to have no trouble standing on its own with a distinct tone and powerful renditions of the original musical’s second act songs. And when the movie hits theaters on November 21st, it’s probably going to set off a new wave of sing-alongs that we should all start getting ready for.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  June 4, 2025 / 11:29 PM EDT/ CBS News The Education Department said Wednesday that Columbia University has violated federal antidiscrimination laws and has therefore failed to meet accreditation standards. The department's civil rights office notified the Middle States Commission on Higher Education — which accredits U.S. colleges and universities — that Columbia was out of compliance, according to a news release from the Education Department. The department, citing President Trump'sexecutive orderon accreditation standards, accused the university's leaders of failing to address antisemitism on campus after the Oct. 7 attack against Israel by Hamas. \"After Hamas' October 7, 2023, terror attack on Israel, Columbia University's leadership acted with deliberate indifference towards the harassment of Jewish students on its campus,\" Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in the release. She noted that the accreditation commission has \"an enormous public responsibility as gatekeepers of federal student aid,\" and they \"determine which institutions are eligible for federal student loans and Pell Grants.\" Losing its accreditation would mean that Columbia would be ineligible to offer federal financial aid to students attending the university. \"In light of OCR's determination, Columbia University no longer appears to meet the Commission's accreditation standards,\" the department release said. A Columbia spokesperson told CBS News the school is aware of the Department of Education's concerns and has \"addressed those concerns directly with Middle States,\" referring to its accreditor. The spokesperson also said the school is \"deeply committed to combating antisemitism on our campus\" and is \"continuing to work with the federal government to address it.\" The accreditation group confirmed to CBS News it received a letter Wednesday on the Department of Education's issues with Columbia, but did not comment further. Last month, the civil rights offices of the Education Department and Department of Health and Human Services determined that Columbia had \"failed to meaningfully protect Jewish students against severe and pervasive harassment on Columbia's campus and consequently denied these students' equal access to educational opportunities to which they are entitled under the law.\" This is a developing story and will be updated. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "title": "Thousands of students in limbo as Trump admin seeks to shut down Job Corps",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News June 4, 2025 / 11:01 PM EDT/ CBS News Emily Scott is a Job Corps student in Los Angeles who is also a caretaker for her disabled mother. She is four months away from graduating from the Job Corps program as a licensed nurse. Andrea Watts of Las Vegas was homeless before finding her way to a Job Corps center in L.A. for an opportunity to obtain her high school diploma and eventually become a pharmacy technician. Both are students who are undergoing training at Job Corps, but whose careers are in limbo as the centers were abruptly shut down last week. On May 29, the Labor Department announced a \"phased pause\" in operations at99 contractor-operatedJob Corps centersnationwide. These are federally-funded centers that offer career training, housing and career assistance to more than 25,000 young people ages 16 to 24. The Labor Department program was funded by Congress in 1964 and has generally received bipartisan support. However, Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer said in a news release that the program was \"no longer achieving the intended outcomes that students deserve\" as evidenced by \"a startling number of serious incident reports and our in-depth fiscal analysis.\" On Wednesday, U.S District Judge Andrew Carter in Manhattantemporarily blockedthe Trump administration from eliminating the Job Corps program while the case plays out. The temporary restraining order was issued after Job Corps contractors sued the Trump administration Tuesday arguing the Labor Department violated federal law by shutting down the Job Corps centers, arguing the White House does not have the power to dismantle a program established and funded by Congress. A hearing is set for June 17. CBS News has reached out to the Labor Department and Job Corps for comment on the ruling. Job Corps officials told CBS News that even before the Labor Department paused operations last week, it had halted their ability to conduct background checks, effectively freezing the enrollment process. Though it was initially communicated as a pause, staff had been given dates for their last date of employment, they said. Prior to Carter's ruling, a stop in operations at all contractor-operated Job Corps centers was slated to occur by June 30. Atransparency reportreleased in April by the Labor Department found that the average graduation rate for the program was under 40%. The yearly average cost per student was $80,000 and there were over 14,000 serious incident infractions, including inappropriate sexual behavior, sexual assaults and reported drug use. The decision to pause operations aligned with President Trump's 2026 budget proposal, according to the Labor Department, and the administration's commitment to \"ensure federal workforce investments deliver meaningful results for both students and taxpayers,\" the agency said last week when it announced the pause. According to Michelle Matthews, who helps lead the L.A. Job Corps centers, the Labor Department's findings were \"unbelievable\" given that students are under strict rules and are drug tested in order to qualify. \"All of the numbers presented were inflated, deflated lies and their intent was clear from the start,\" said Matthews, adding that news of the centers' closure was communicated to students last Friday. \"That was a day I will never forget,\" Matthews told CBS News in tears. \"To see what they were going through and to know that the impact was going to be devastating.\" Students were required to abandon their dorms, but more than 50 students in the L.A. centers had nowhere to go. Matthews says she is part of the staff still working around the clock to find them housing. It was not immediately clear whether Wednesday's ruling will allow it to immediately reopen to students. Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have denounced the Trump administration's move to suspend Job Corps operations, a move they say is illegal. \"We funded the program through fiscal year 2025 and they are cutting these slots and shutting things down that Congress has already funded,\" said Democratic Rep. Jimmy Gomez of California in a phone interview with CBS News. \"The money is already there, so they should use it to help these kids finish out their degrees and certifications and then we can have a debate on what the future of Job Corps looks like.\" Gomez added that he has personally witnessed the success of the program as his two siblings are Job Corps graduates. \"The kids are in the pipeline, don't take this away from them because they don't have many opportunities as it is,\" Gomez said. In May, Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, sent a letter to Chavez-DeRemer requesting information on Job Corps contracts, background check processing and evaluation plans. \"I strongly oppose the Department of Labor's directive to pause operations at Job Corps centers in Maine and across the country,\" Collins said in a statement. \"Serving nearly 500 students in Maine, the Loring Job Corps Center and the Penobscot Job Corps Center have become important pillars of support for some of our most disadvantaged young adults.\" Scott, who has autism, was forced to drop out of college at the age of 19 to care for her disabled mother. \"I watched my whole life get put on pause and our circumstances never improved,\" Scott said. The nursing student says she's unable to pay for her training on her own if Job Corps is effectively shut down. \"My future, I don't see it, I don't see anything being different than how I started,\" Scott said. For Watts, leaving Job Corps would mean returning to Las Vegas — where she doesn't have a home — without achieving her initial hopes of becoming a pharmacy technician. \"I wanted to set an example for my future self, and I enrolled into Job Corps thinking that I would come out with a career, with my high school diploma,\" Watts said. \"But that was all just taken from me in a short amount of time.\" Nidia Cavazos is a 2024 campaign reporter for CBS News. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "title": "Trump orders investigation into Biden aides over autopen use, health \"conspiracy\"",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  June 4, 2025 / 10:22 PM EDT/ CBS News President Trump ordered an investigation Wednesday into whether former President Joe Biden's administration used an autopen machine to sign key presidential documents like pardons — months after Mr. Trump claimed his predecessor's pardons were illegitimate. In amemosigned Wednesday night, Mr. Trump told Attorney General Pam Bondi and the president's counsel to probe what he claimed was a \"conspiracy\" to \"abuse the power of Presidential signatures through the use of an autopen to conceal Biden's cognitive decline.\" The order cited a litany of executive actions by Biden — including pardons and federal judge appointments — and argued \"there are serious doubts as to the decision making process and even the degree of Biden's awareness of these actions being taken in his name.\" It then suggested that if Biden's advisers \"secretly used the mechanical signature pen,\" it would \"have implications for the legality and validity of numerous executive actions.\" Mr. Trump said the investigation should cover whether Biden's aides \"conspired to deceive the public about Biden's mental state and unconstitutionally exercise the authorities and responsibilities of the president.\" It also directed an investigation into which executive actions an autopen was used for, and who directed its use. In a statement, Biden called the attacks false and \"nothing more than a distraction by Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans.\" \"Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations. Any suggestion that I didn't is ridiculous and false,\" Biden said. Presidents haveused an autopen— or a signature-signing machine — to sign certain documents fordecades, and then-President George W. Bush's Justice Departmentsaidin 2005 that the president can legally use an autopen to sign bills into law. Mr. Trumpsaidin March he has occasionally used an autopen, but \"only for very unimportant papers.\" But Mr. Trump and hisallieshave suggested Biden's alleged use of an autopen could be illegitimate. In March, the presidentclaimeda slate of pardons issued to some Trump foes in the final days of his administration were \"VOID\" and \"VACANT.\" CBS News legal contributor Jessica Levinsonsaid in Marchthat Mr. Trump cannot revoke his predecessor's pardons, even if an autopen was involved, noting that the president's constitutional power to pardon people is extremely broad. \"This is not a gray area,\" she said on \"CBS Mornings Plus.\" Early Wednesday, Mr. Trump on Truth Socialcalledthe alleged autopen use \"THE BIGGEST POLITICAL SCANDAL IN AMERICAN HISTORY,\" aside from the 2020 presidential election, which Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed — without evidence — was rigged. Scrutiny over Biden's mental acuity while in office has ramped up in recent weeks, amid new reporting about the circumstances of Biden's exit from the 2024 presidential race. Earlier Wednesday, the Republican chair of the House Oversight Committee, Rep. James Comer of Kentucky,pushed several membersof Biden's inner circle to answer questions about the president's \"mental and physical faculties\" while serving as the chief executive.

    "title": "Trump restricts international students from studying at Harvard",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  June 4, 2025 / 9:50 PM EDT/ CBS News President Trump barred most international students from entering the United States to study at Harvard University late Wednesday — escalating the Trump administration's battle with the Ivy League school. Ina proclamation, Mr. Trump suspended the entry of foreign students or exchange visitors planning to go to Harvard, unless his administration determines somebody's entry \"would be in the national interest.\" The order also directs Secretary of State Marco Rubio to consider whether student visa holders who are already in the U.S. \"should have their visas revoked.\" The order will expire in six months, though an extension is possible. The order claimed Harvard \"is no longer a trustworthy steward of international student and exchange visitor programs,\" accusing the school of failing to report students' disciplinary records to the federal government and criticizing it for ties to researchers based in China. A Harvard spokesperson called the order \"yet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the Administration in violation of Harvard's First Amendment rights.\" \"Harvard will continue to protect its international students,\" the spokesperson told CBS News. The Trump administration has tried repeatedly to restrict Harvard's ability to enroll international students — a serious threat for a school where more than one in four studentshail from foreign countries. Last month, the Department of Homeland Security tried to take away Harvard's certification in the federal government's student visa database. A judgehalted that policyafter Harvard sued, with the school arguing the order was unconstitutional and would have an \"immediate and devastating effect for Harvard and more than 7,000 visa holders.\" And last week, the State Department ordered embassies and consulates to conduct \"additional vetting\" of anybody who wants to travel to Harvard — including current and prospective students, faculty, guest speakers and even tourists — according to an email obtained byCBS News. The Trump administration has feuded with Harvard for months, seeking to cut off billions in federal funding. The funding cutoffs came afterthe school rejectedthe government's demands to change its disciplinary practices, end diversity, equity and inclusion programs and commission an external audit of some academic departments. The government has sharply criticized Harvard's handling of pro-Palestinian protests and alleged the school has failed to deal with antisemitism on campus. But Harvard arguesit is being punishedfor First Amendment-protected speech. The administration has cracked down on international students beyond Harvard. It haltednew student visa interviewslast week in preparation for \"expanded social media vetting,\" and the State Department's email directing extra vetting for travelers to Harvard framed the policy as a \"pilot\" for other visa applicants. Meanwhile, thousands of foreign students who are already present in the U.S. have faced the termination of their student visa status, sometimes after appearing to get on the government's radar due to minor legal issues — though a judgeblocked that policy. And some international students with links to pro-Palestinian activism have been detained under a rarely used law allowing visas to be revoked if someone's presence in the U.S. poses \"adverse foreign policy consequences.\" Judges ordered the release of two students on bond — Columbia University's Mohsen Mahdawi and Tufts University's Rumeysa Ozturk — but another Columbia activist, Mahmoud Khalil, remains detained.

    "title": "Washington state father sought after 3 young daughters found dead",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  June 4, 2025 / 9:41 PM EDT/ CBS/AP A Washington state father is wanted for murder after his three young daughters were reported missing and then found dead. Police on Tuesday asked the public for help in finding the father of the girls, Travis Decker, 32. He is wanted for three counts of murder and kidnapping, according topolice in Wenatchee, about 100 miles east of Seattle. Police said it was unknown whether Decker, a former Army soldier with \"extensive training,\" was armed. Officials were still processing leads with the help of the FBI, Border Patrol and the Department of Homeland Security, the Chelan County Sheriff's Office said during a press conference Wednesday night. The sheriff's office said Decker is \"well-versed\" in outdoor survival and has been able to survive for two months at a time while off the grid. The mother of the girls -- who were identified byCBS affiliate KIRO-TVas 9-year-old Paityn, 8-year-old Evelyn and 5-year-old Olivia -- reported to police on Friday that their father didn't return them after a planned visit, police said. Over the weekend, police looked for the children and Decker, who was believed to be living out of a white 2017 GMC Sierra pickup truck with Washington plates. Decker's unoccupied truck was located Monday near a campground, police said. During a search, officers found the bodies of the three girls. Police believe the girls died from asphyxiation and reported that their wrists were zip-tied, court documents said. Anyone who may have seen Decker since Friday or knows his current location is asked to call 911. \"Due to safety concerns, do not attempt to contact or approach Decker,\" police said. The mother told police that Decker picked the girls up around 5 p.m. but had not returned them by 8 p.m., and his phone went straight to voicemail, court documents said. The detective said she \"expressed concern because Decker reportedly has never done this before and … is currently experiencing some mental health issues.\" \"What prompted her to call us was that ... he was late returning the girls and had not communicated to her that he was going to be late, which was his typical fashion and so this was out of the ordinary,\" Capt. Brian Chance said. Washington State Patrol was contacted Friday night to request an Amber Alert, but it did not meet the required criteria, Wenatchee police said. The following day, Wenatchee detectives contacted the patrol with additional information that led to the issuance of an Endangered Missing Person Alert. The lacking criteria were suspected abduction and imminent peril of death or serious injury, said Chris Loftis, director of public affairs for the state patrol. \"In this case, it was a parent with custodial privileges, and the children had not been returned home on time. But that's a rather common occurrence and not something where you just automatically assume abduction,\" he said, adding that there was no indication Decker, a custodial parent who had the children for a visit, would harm them. \"We're people too, you know, so the loss of a child, the loss of two children, the loss of three children is ... devastating,\" Loftis said. \"Everybody always looks to how we can improve.\" The alert systems are constantly evolving and this could prompt further change, Loftis said: \"Obviously it didn't work this time. Obviously we have three children that are dead.\" In an exclusiveinterview with KIRO-TV, the girls' mother, Whitney Decker, said there have never been any problems with visitations with Travis Decker in the past. According to documents filed for custodial interference, Whitney and Travis were married for seven years but had been divorced for several years. She told KIRO-TV the divorce was civil. Toward the end of the marriage, he was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, and Whitney did not believe he was on any medications for that, KIRO-TV reported, citing court filings. Travis Decker was supposed to seek mental health treatment and anger management counseling under the parenting plan, but never did, court filings showed. The Wenatchee School District said the girls were students at Lincoln Elementary. Counseling services are available for children and staff who need support. \"To allow our students, staff and families the space and privacy they need to mourn and begin healing, we respectfully ask that you do not come to the school campus except for regular school business,\" the district said. Decker joined the Army in 2013 and transferred to the Washington National Guard in 2021, Washington Military Department spokesperson Karina Shagren told The Associated Press. He was a full-time member of the Guard until 2023 or 2024, when he switched to part-time. Decker stopped attending mandatory monthly drills a little over a year ago, and the Guard was in the process of a disciplinary discharge for him, Shagren said. \"This is an absolute tragedy,\" Shagren said. \"We are mourning along with the community.\" The Chelan County Sheriff's Office, which found the truck, was leading the search in the Okanogan Wenatchee National Forest area while other teams followed up on \"potential credible information and tips\" regarding Decker's location, the agency said in a statement. The agency was working with U.S. Marshals to locate and apprehend Decker and the search continued Tuesday evening. A reward of up to $20,000 was available for information leading directly to his arrest. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "title": "Trump signs travel ban on nationals from 12 countries, restrictions on 7 more",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  June 4, 2025 / 9:37 PM EDT/ CBS News President Trump on Wednesday signed a proclamation barring travelers and immigrants from a dozen countries and restricting the entry of nationals of another seven nations, citing concerns about national security. Mr. Trump's proclamation fully bans the entry of foreigners from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. With certain exemptions, Mr. Trump's order bans citizens of those countries seeking to come to the U.S. permanently as legal immigrants, as well as temporary visa holders, like tourists. The president also partially suspended the entry of travelers and immigrants from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. That part of his proclamation applies to all prospective immigrants from these countries with visas to settle in the U.S. permanently and certain temporary visa holders. The ban is set to take effect at 12:01 a.m. on Monday, June 9. Mr. Trump said the sweeping entry restrictions were necessary to address concerns related to terrorism in the countries listed in the order, inadequate vetting of the affected nationals and the lack of cooperation on deportations among some of the nations. \"President Trump is fulfilling his promise to protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors that want to come to our country and cause us harm. These commonsense restrictions are country-specific and include places that lack proper vetting, exhibit high visa overstay rates, or fail to share identity and threat information. President Trump will always act in the best of interest of the American people and their safety,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told CBS News. Mr. Trump's decree contains certain exemptions, including for U.S. permanent residents, Afghans who assisted American forces and have special visas, diplomats, athletes and dual nationals with a passport from a country not listed in his proclamation. The announcement of the ban follows anattack Sunday in Boulder, Colorado, on marchers raising attention for Israelis taken hostage by Hamas. The suspect was identified by U.S. officials as an Egyptian national who had overstayed his tourist visa. In a video statement released by the White House Wednesday night, Mr. Trump said the Boulder attack \"underscored the extreme dangers posed to our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted, as well as those who come here as temporary visitors and overstay their visas. We don't want them.\" He said the list could be revised if countries make material improvements, and new countries could be added as threats emerge. Mr. Trump's actions echo a series of travel bans issued during his first administration that initially targeted predominantly Muslim countries. Like those orders, his latest proclamation could be subject to lawsuits. In the first month of his first term, January 2017, Mr. Trumpsigned a travel banrestricting the entry of most citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The move triggered widespread outcry, chaos at airports and legal challenges from advocates who argued the ban was discriminatory. In March 2017, Mr. Trump removed Iraq from the list and added Chad, Venezuela and North Korea. In 2020, he expanded the ban, adding immigration restrictions for nationals of Nigeria, Eritrea, Sudan, Tanzania, Myanmar and Kyrgyzstan. Chad was later removed from the list. The third version of Mr. Trump's first-term ban wasultimately upheld by the Supreme Courtin the summer of 2018, with the conservative justices citing the president's broad authority to restrict the entry of foreigners on national security grounds. The Biden administration scrapped that ban after it took office. Jennifer Jacobs is a senior White House reporter at CBS News. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  June 4, 2025 / 8:33 PM EDT/ CBS News Washington— A federal judge in Colorado temporarily blocked federal immigration officials from removing thewife and five childrenof theman chargedinSunday's attack in Boulderfrom the country or the state. U.S. District Judge Gordon Gallagher issued brief relief to Hayem El Gamal, the wife of Mohamed Soliman, and their children in order to preserve the court's jurisdiction over the case. \"Moreover, the court finds that deportation without process could work irreparable harm and an order must issue without notice due to the urgency this situation presents,\" Gallagher wrote. The judge also set a hearing on a request for a temporary restraining order for June 13 at the federal courthouse in Denver. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced Tuesday that Immigration and Customs Enforcement had taken into custody Soliman's wife and children and said they were being processed for removal proceedings from the U.S. Four of the children are minors, and the fifth is 18 years old. Federal immigration records show the wife and children are being held at a federal detention center in Dilley, Texas, designed to house families with minors. The family had lived in Colorado Springs. An Egyptian national, Soliman and his family first came to the U.S. in August 2022. He filed for asylum that September, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Soliman is facing multiple counts of attempted murder and a federal hate crimes charge for the attack Sunday that left wounded more than a dozen people who were at a march supporting Israeli hostages, including an88-year-old Holocaust survivor. He is accused of using Molotov cocktails in the attack that left multiple people burned, according to law enforcement. Witnesses said Soliman yelled \"Free Palestine\" and \"End Zionist\" during the attack. Camilo  Montoya-Galvezcontributed to this report. Melissa Quinn is a politics reporter for CBSNews.com.

    "title": "FDA to review abortion pill mifepristone for safety. Here's what to know.",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  June 4, 2025 / 8:25 PM EDT/ CBS News Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has asked Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary \"to review the latest data onmifepristone,\" raising questions about the drug commonly referred to as the abortion pill. A spokesperson for the FDA confirmed the plans in a statement to CBS News Tuesday, but did not respond to questions about when the review is scheduled to start and what exactly it will be reviewing about the medication. According toa letterpublished on social media Monday by Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, Makary's review aims to closely monitor the drug's safety. But experts say concerns about its safety are misguided, fueled in part by a report from theEthics and Public Policy Center, an advocacy group that promotes religious traditions and isfunded bymultiple right-wing organizations. Mifepristone, which is taken with a second drug, misoprostol, to end an early pregnancy, was first approved by the FDA in 2000 after \"a thorough and comprehensive review\" determined it was safe and effective,the agency says. Periodic reviews since its approval have not found new safety concerns, according to the FDA. In the Ethics and Public Policy Center report, which was not published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal,theauthors, who don't have medical training, claim the pill harms women, causing 1 in 10 patients to experience what they call a \"serious adverse event,\" including hemorrhage, ER visits, ectopic pregnancy and an undefined category of \"abortion-specific complications.\" Dr. Céline Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, said some of the instances described as \"adverse events\" are questionable. \"When you have a medication abortion, you bleed. That is normal. That is not an adverse event unless the bleeding is so significant that a woman needs a transfusion,\" she explained. \"It is to be expected that not all medication abortions will successfully eliminate the pregnancy. A surgical abortion after incomplete/failed medication abortion should not be considered an adverse event. ... An ectopic pregnancy is not caused by mifepristone and should not be considered a serious adverse event.\" Gounder added that the report lacks transparency and doesn't disclose the data source, meaning no one can reproduce and verify the findings, something Kennedy himself said he's a proponent of, noting in hisconfirmation hearingsthat he wants to replicate studies. It also lacks a comparison group, Gounder said, which is important for examining how experiences compare to pregnant women who did not take the drug. CBS News has reached out to the makers of the generic and brand name of mifepristone for comment. While it's unclear whether the latest review of the drug will impact access, this isn't the first time it has come under fire. In 2024,the Supreme Court rejected a challengetargeting the availability of the widely used pill, preserving access to the drug in its first major abortion-related ruling since thereversal of Roe v. Wade. If the challengers had prevailed, the ruling would have restricted access to mifepristone nationwide, even in states where abortion is legal. The justices unanimously ruled that the anti-abortion rights doctors and medical associations who brought the lawsuit against the FDA did not have the legal right to do so. They did not address whether the FDA acted lawfully when it took a series of steps in 2016 and 2021 that relaxed the rules for mifepristone's use. Makary had previously said that he had \"no plans to take action on mifepristone,\" which has been a target of abortion opponents and conservatives who have called on the FDA to reconsider its approval. Since it was approved, mifepristone has been taken by more than 5 million patients, according to the FDA. Medication abortions made up more than half of all abortions in the United States health care system in 2023, a study from the Guttmacher Institute, an abortion rights research group, found. In28 states, there are policies restricting accessto mifepristone in some way, according to the Guttmacher Institute, four of which prohibit the mailing of abortion pills to patients.

    "article_text": "President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he will deny visas for foreign students trying to come to the United States to attend Harvard University, his latest attack on the prominent Ivy League college. The administration tried late last month to revoke Harvard’s ability to enroll foreign students — a movethat was swiftly blocked by a federal judge. In a proclamation Wednesday, Trump said Harvard failed to present sufficient information about its foreign students to the federal government. “Harvard provided data on misconduct by only three students, and the data it provided was so deficient that the DHS could not evaluate whether it should take further actions,” Trump said, referring to the Department of Homeland Security. Harvard said it would fight to protect its international students. \"This is yet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the Administration in violation of Harvard’s First Amendment rights,\" a spokesperson for the university said Wednesday night. Trump made his pledge as heannounced what amounts to a travel ban for 12 countriesand limitations on seven others. The proclamation said the president would “restrict the entry of foreign nationals who seek to enter the United States solely or principally to participate in a course of study at Harvard University or in an exchange visitor program hosted by Harvard University.” It added that the State Department would review existing foreign students under F, M or J visas to see whether their visas should be revoked. Trump and his administration have attacked Harvard, saying it has not done enough to combat antisemitism on campus during demonstrations against the Israel-Hamas war. Harvard in April rejected Trump administration demands that included auditing viewpoints of the student body. In response, the federal governmentsaid it was freezing more than $2 billion in federal grants. The administration previously sought to limit Harvard's ability to enroll foreign students by revoking its certification in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, Harvard said. The government also sought to prohibit Harvard from sponsoring F and J visas. Harvard President Alan M. Garber respondedin a letter on May 23that Harvard was being retaliated against for refusing to surrender to the Trump administration's illegal attempts to control it and its students. \"We condemn this unlawful and unwarranted action,\" Garber said. \"It imperils the futures of thousands of students and scholars across Harvard and serves as a warning to countless others at colleges and universities throughout the country who have come to America to pursue their education and fulfill their dreams.\"",

    "title": "'Shameful': Washington murder case dismissed after DNA evidence is lost",
    "article_text": "WASHNGTON — Days before a Washington murder trial was to begin, prosecutors decided the evidence they had against the defendant — who was in custody for more than five years — was not good enough, andthe victim’s family still wants an explanation. WhenJohn Pernell was shot to deathon Nelson Place SE in July 2010, witnesses told police the retired protective service officer fought with one of four men trying to rob him and others. Pernell and his friends were setting up their barbecues for a traditional Fourth of July get-together when the men jumped a fence and announced a robbery. The investigation went nowhere until 2019, when a witness told police they should look at a man named Kavon Young. According to a document filed in D.C. Superior Court, police said DNA discovered under Pernell’s fingernails matched the DNA profile of Young. The probability the DNA did not belong to Young was one in 3.4 billion in the United States African American population. But that DNA evidence — presented in court as a match in 2019 — suddenly became a mismatch two days before trial. Prosecutors at the U.S. Attorney’s Office, the defense attorneys and the private lab that did the original testing will not say why. “It’s shameful. We have a right to know what happened,” said Pernell’s daughter, Yolanda Pernell-Vogelson. Two days before the trial was set to begin, Pernell-Vogelson and her sister, Ayana Pernell, say they got a call from Michael Spence, the prosecutor in the case, who told them the initial calculations were wrong. “To this day, [we] have not been given a full, understandable explanation as to why this has happened,” Ayana Pernell said. “I mean, we are essentially victims also.” Court records show the private lab that did the testing, Bode Technology Group Inc., lost the evidence and it cannot be retested. The judge told the prosecution and defense that at trial, the jury would be told “the government’s labs and/or agencies negligently lost the DNA extract in this case” just before the trial was set to begin. In an April 9 filing, prosecutors noted again the DNA “matched the defendant” “as reported by Bode Technology” — a result prosecutors relied upon for five-and-a-half years until deciding two days before trial it was unreliable. Bode Technology group declined to comment. Young was released in April, and NBC Washington couldn’t reach the attorneys who have been representing him. Pernell’s daughters said they wrote letters to all lawmakers in the city. “We extend our condolences to Mr. Pernell’s family and friends, including his daughters,\" Washington Deputy Mayor for Public Safety Lindsey Appiah said in a statement Wednesday. \"I’ve contacted them regarding his case, and we are investigating the matter to see if there is anything additional the District can do to be of assistance to ensure justice.”",

    "article_text": "EDMONTON, Alberta — Leon Draisaitl scored on the power play in overtime, Stuart Skinner made 29 saves and the Edmonton Oilers erased a multigoal deficit to beat the defending champion Florida Panthers 4-3 in Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Final rematch on Wednesday night. After Tomas Nosek’s penalty for putting the puck over the glass, Draisaitl’s goal 19:29 into OT sent the home fans into a frenzy and made sure the Oilers would not start this series like they did a year ago, when they fell behind three games to none. A Canada-based NHL club hasn’t hoisted Lord Stanley’s famed chalice since 1993. For a while, it looked like the Oilers would at least start the series trailing. Draisaitl’s goal 66 seconds in was followed later in the first period by Sam Bennett deflecting a shot in past Stuart Skinner after falling into him. Edmonton’s Kris Knoblauch unsuccessfully challenged for goaltender interference, with the NHL’s situation room ruling that his own player, Jake Walman, tripped Bennett into Skinner. The resulting penalty paved the way for Florida’s Brad Marchand to score the go-ahead goal on the power play. Bennett scoring his second of the night early in the second period put the Panthers up 3-1. They entered 31-0 over the past three playoffs since coach Paul Maurice took over when leading at the first or second intermission. With Connor McDavid leading the way, the Oilers rallied. Fourth-liner Viktor Arvidsson brought the crowd back to life early in the second, and fellow Swede Mattias Ekholm — playing just his second game back from an extended injury absence — tied it with 13:27 remaining in regulation off a perfect pass from McDavid. At the other end, Skinner made a handful of saves that were vital to keeping the Panthers from extending their lead or tying it late in the third. Florida counterpart Sergei Bobrovsky did the same, in between derisive chants of “Sergei! Sergei!” that followed goals he allowed. Skinner was greeted with friendlier chants of “Stuuuu” after saves, including one in the first minute of overtime on a quality scoring chance. Bobrovsky stone-cold robbed Trent Frederic nine minutes in but eventually cracked.",

    "title": "Trump orders an investigation into Biden and his alleged use of the autopen",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump on Wednesday directed a wide-ranging investigation into former President Joe Biden and officials in his administration, accusing his aides of using “autopen” signatures to cover up his \"cognitive decline\" and assert presidential power. Trump frequentlyuses Bidenas a political foil and has sought to undo a number of policies from his predecessor's administration since he returned to office. The announcement Wednesday directs the White House counsel and Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate whether anyone \"conspired to deceive the public about Biden's mental state and unconstitutionally exercise the authorities and responsibilities of the President.\" It is an escalation of an issue that Trump and his allies have frequently raised, possibly paving the way for Republicans to argue that many of Biden’s actions as president were invalid. \"This conspiracy marks one of the most dangerous and concerning scandals in American history,\" Trump wrote in a memo. \"The American public was purposefully shielded from discovering who wielded the executive power, all while Biden’s signature was deployed across thousands of documents to effect radical policy shifts.\" Trump has acknowledged using the autopen himself in office. In March, he said he turned to it “only for very unimportant papers,” such as responses to letters. “But to use them for — for what they’ve used them for is terrible,” he added, referring to the Biden administration. In Wednesday's memo, Trump further contendedthat if Biden’s aides “secretly” used the pen to conceal his alleged decline while they were taking executive actions in his stead, “that would constitute an unconstitutional wielding of the power of the Presidency, a circumstance that would have implications for the legality and validity of numerous executive actions undertaken in Biden’s name.” Biden defended his record in a statement Wednesday, arguing that the probe was a “distraction” from Trump and Republican lawmakers. “Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations. Any suggestion that I didn’t is ridiculous and false,” Biden said. Trump has previously claimed without evidence that Biden used an autopento sign pre-emptive pardonsfor the members of Congress who investigated the events surrounding the Jan. 6, 2021, attack at the U.S. Capitol, rendering them “void.” Autopens have long been a mechanical tool to reproduce signatures in the White House, with Barack Obama being the first president to use itto sign legislation, according to The Associated Press. Previous administrations have pointed to a 2005Office of Legal Counsel memostating that the president “need not personally perform the physical act of affixing his signature to a bill he approves and decides to sign in order for the bill to become law.” Biden has frequently defended himself against claims about his mental fitness and memory. Former special counsel Robert Hur said in a report last year that Biden would probably present to a jury as a \"sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory\" in explaining his decision not to prosecute Biden after an investigation of his handling of classified documents. Bidenrejected Hur's claimsabout his memory shortly after the report was released last year, saying, \"My memory’s fine.\" In an interview with ABC’s “The View” in May, Biden againdenied having suffered from mental decline when he was president. “They are wrong,” he said of the allegations. House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., is also investigating Biden and has asked several former White House aides to appear for transcribed interviews.",

    "article_text": "Spoilers ahead for the ending of the first “Wicked” movie and the Broadway musical. The witches of Oz are back — this time, for good. The“Wicked” storylinecontinues, as the trailer for the long-awaited second movie dropped Wednesday, giving fans a glimpse into how Glinda and Elphaba’s story ultimately plays out. The “Wicked: For Good” trailer brings back the film’s beloved and star-studded cast, including an update on Cynthia Erivo’s Elphaba and Ariana Grande’s Glinda friendship, as well as the love triangle dynamic between Jonathan Bailey’s Prince Fiyero. Michelle Yeoh as Madame Morrible and Jeff Goldblum as the Wizard are also seen in the first look, showcasing the power they have over Oz. Fans can also get excited as they hear teases of songs featured in the sequel, including “No Good Deed” and “For Good.” “Wicked: For Good”is set to hit theaters Nov. 21. Unlike the first half, which matches the soundtrack to Act 1 of the Broadway musical, the second “Wicked” film features two new songs, composer Stephen Schwartz previously told TODAY.com. The title for the second half of the story comes from the heart-wrenching ballad between Glinda and Elphaba, “For Good,” which is historically sung at the end of the stage show. Though the detailed plot line for the next “Wicked” movie has not yet been fully revealed, it’s expected to follow the musical — similar to the initial release.",

    "title": "Andrew Cuomo faces attacks from all sides as New York City Democrats hold a raucous mayoral debate",
    "article_text": "A casual viewer could be forgiven for mistaking Democrats’ first New York City mayoral debate for the roast of Andrew Cuomo. All eight of his primary opponents took turns throwing verbal daggers Wednesday evening at Cuomo, who arrived on the debate stage at 30 Rockefeller Plaza with multiple suitcases of baggage to go with his status as the polling frontrunner. Cuomo, the former governor, has consistently led polls of the nine-candidate field, leveraging his name recognition as a longtime public official in New York and the scion of a storied political family. He resigned as governor in 2021 amid multiple sexual misconduct allegations and an investigation into the claims, but he is now attempting a comeback in New York City, where Democratic Mayor Eric Adams is running for re-election as an independent. Cuomo’s front-runner status in the Democratic primary made him a constant target Wednesday night at the debate hosted by NBC New York, WNJU Telemundo and Politico. When Cuomo sidestepped a question about a 2021 report from the state attorney generalaccusing him of undercounting nursing home deathsduring the Covid-19 pandemic, his opponents laughed in his face and jeered him. When Cuomo cited “the state of the Democratic Party” when he was asked to name his biggest regret in his political career, Adrienne Adams, speaker of the New York City Council, pounced. “No regrets when it comes to cutting child care?” Adams asked. “No regrets when it comes to slow-walking PPE and vaccinations in the season of Covid to Black and brown communities? Really, no regrets?” And when Cuomo was asked about allegations of sexual harassment and responded by attacking his opponents for calling for the defunding of police, former state Assemblyman Michael Blake turned to the cameras to speak directly to the women of New York. “Every woman watching tonight: He was just given a chance to actually address the clear claims that were stated and ignored it,” Blake said. Cuomo would later repeat his denial of the allegations, which mushroomed into an investigation led by state Attorney General Letitia James; it found that Cuomo had harassed 11 women and subjected some of them to unwanted touching and groping. Each candidate took a different tack attacking Cuomo, 67. His most viable opponent, according torecent polls, is state Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, democratic socialist, who cast Cuomo as having been bought and paid for by billionaires. “The difference between myself and Andrew Cuomo is that my campaign is not funded by the very billionaires who put Donald Trump in D.C.,” said Mamdani, 33. After Cuomo dodged difficult questions about his controversies, Mamdani said he is “allergic to any accountability or acknowledgment of a mistake.” Cuomo did not hang back, instead trying to give as good as he was getting when he was attacked. And Mamdani, the youngest candidate onstage, also received his own slew of barbs. After he confidently proclaimed, “I am Donald Trump’s worst nightmare,” Cuomo replied, “Donald Trump would go through Mr. Mamdani like a hot knife through butter.” “He’s been in government 27 minutes. He passed three bills. That’s all he’s done,” Cuomo said, contrasting his own experience with that of his opponent, who is less than half of his age. State Sen. Jessica Ramos got a jab in Mamdani when she was asked about her biggest regret. “I regret not running for mayor in 2021,” she said. “I had been in the Senate for two years. I’d already passed over a dozen bills. I thought I needed more experience, but turns out, you just need to make good videos,” she said, poking fun at Mamdani’s social media strategy, which has propelled his candidacy. Issues, including the city’s housing crisis and public safety, took a back seat to bickering, with debate moderators struggling to control the nine candidates’ speaking over one another and jousting for airtime ahead of the June 24 primary. In addition to Cuomo and Mamdani, who has burst onto the New York City political scene on a progressive platform, candidates jockeyed for position in the city’s unpredictable ranked-choice voting system, which allows voters to choose multiple candidates and rank them on their ballots. The stage also included the current and former city comptrollers, Brad Lander and Scott Springer; state Sens. Ramos and Zellnor Myrie; and former hedge fund executive Whitney Tilson. While candidates outlined their proposals on major issues facing the city, like housing and public safety, quarrels overshadowed the substance. The city’s most recent Housing and Vacancy Survey, conducted last year, found that the vacancy rate for apartments in the city dropped to 1.4%, thelowest rate since 1968. When it comes to units that cost less than $2,400 per month, the vacancy rate is below 1%. While Mamdani, Blake and Ramos have vowed to freeze the rent of rent-stabilized apartments, which arehome to nearly 1 million New Yorkers, Tilson, the businessman on the stage, came at the issue from a different angle. \"I think we need to drop rents by 20% by unleashing the private sector to build a lot more housing,\" he said. Despite recent encouraging crime data from the city, which showed arecord low264 shootings citywide from January to May, the issue was a point of contention. Candidates presented their plans to combat crime in the subway system, which has become a front-of-mind concern for New Yorkers after a series of high-profile and gruesome acts of violence, including a woman’s death after she was set on fire last year. Myrie called for 150 police-clinician teams to patrol subway cars and platforms at all hours of the day. Cuomo made a promise about his first month in office, should he become mayor.  \"In my first 30 days, I will take every homeless person off the trains and the subway stations and get them the help they need,\" he said. Blake called for 1,000 mental health professionals on the subways and streets, increasing bandwidth for police officers to handle other issues. \"The police will indicate they were not trained on addressing mental health,\" said Blake, who served in the Obama administration.",

    "title": "Texas hospital that discharged woman with doomed pregnancy broke the law, inquiry finds",
    "article_text": "WASHINGTON — A Texas hospital that repeatedly sent a woman who was bleeding and in pain home without ending her nonviable, life-threatening pregnancy violated the law, according to a newly released federal investigation. The government’s findings, which have not been previously reported, were a small victory for 36-year-old Kyleigh Thurman, who ultimately lost part of her reproductive system after being discharged after receiving no help from her hometown emergency room for her dangerous ectopic pregnancy. But a new policy the Trump administration announced Tuesday has thrown into doubt the federal government’s stance on hospitals' denying women emergency abortions, even when they are at risk for serious infection, organ loss or severe hemorrhaging. Thurman had hoped the federal government’s investigation, which was concluded last year and issued a report in April, would send a clear message that ectopic pregnancies must be treated by hospitals in Texas, which has one of the nation’s strictest abortion bans. “I didn’t want anyone else to have to go through this,” Thurman said in an interview with the Associated Press from her Texas home this week. “I put a lot of the responsibility on the state Women around the country have been denied emergency abortions for their life-threatening pregnancies after states swiftly enacted abortion restrictions in response toa 2022 rulingfrom the U.S. Supreme Court, which includes three appointees of President Donald Trump. The guidance issued by the Biden administration in 2022 was an effort to preserve access to emergency abortions for extreme cases in which women were in medical emergencies. It directed hospitals — even ones in states with severe restrictions — to provide abortions in those emergency cases. If hospitals did not comply, they would be in violation of a federal law and risk losing some federal funds. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency responsible for enforcing the law and inspecting hospitals, announced on Tuesday it would revoke the Biden-era guidance around emergency abortions. CMS administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz saidin a social media poston Wednesday that the revocation of the policy would not prevent pregnant women from getting treatment in medical emergencies. “The Biden Administration created confusion, but EMTALA is clear and the law has not changed: women will receive care for miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, and medical emergencies in all fifty states—this has not and will never change in the Trump Administration,” Oz wrote, using the acronyms for the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act. The law, which remains intact and requires doctors to provide stabilizing treatment, was one of the few ways that Thurman was able to hold the emergency room accountable after she didn’t receive any help from staff at Ascension Seton Williamson in Round Rock, Texas, in February 2023, a few months after Texas enacted its strict abortion ban. Emergency room staff observed that Thurman’s hormone levels had dropped, a pregnancy was not visible in her uterus and a structure was blocking her fallopian tube — all telltale signs of an ectopic pregnancy, when a fetus implants outside of the uterus and has no room to grow. If left untreated, ectopic pregnancies can rupture, causing organ damage, hemorrhage or even death. Thurman, however, was sent home and given a pamphlet on miscarriage for her first pregnancy. She returned three days later, still bleeding, and was given an injected drug intended to end the pregnancy, but it was too late. Days later, she showed up again at the emergency room, hemorrhaging because the fertilized egg growing on Thurman’s fallopian tube ruptured it. She underwent an emergency surgery that removed part of her reproductive system. CMS launched its investigation of how Ascension Seton Williamson handled Thurman’s case late last year, shortly after she filed a complaint. Investigators concluded the hospital failed to give her a proper medical screening exam, including an evaluation with an OB-GYN. The hospital violated the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, which requires emergency rooms to provide stabilizing treatment to all patients. Thurman was “at risk for deterioration of her health and wellbeing as a result of an untreated medical condition,” the investigation said in its report, which was publicly released last month. Ascension, a vast hospital system that has facilities across multiple states, did not respond to questions about Thurman’s case, saying only that it is “is committed to providing high-quality care to all who seek our services.” Doctors and legal experts have warned that abortion restrictions like the one Texas enacted have discouraged emergency room staff from aborting dangerous and nonviable pregnancies, even when a woman’s life is imperiled. The stakes are especially high in Texas, where doctors face up to 99 years in prison if convicted of performing an illegal abortion. Lawmakers in the state are weighing a law that would remove criminal penalties for doctors who provide abortions in certain medical emergencies. “We see patients with miscarriages being denied care, bleeding out in parking lots. We see patients with nonviable pregnancies being told to continue those to term,” said Molly Duane, an attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights that represented Thurman. “This is not, maybe, what some people thought abortion bans would look like, but this is the reality.” The Biden administration routinely warned hospitals that they needed to provide abortions when a woman’s health was in jeopardy, even suing Idaho over its state law that initially prohibited nearly all abortions, unless a woman’s life was on the line. But CMS’ announcement on Tuesday raises questions about whether such investigations will continue if hospitals do not provide abortions for women in medical emergencies. The agency said it will still enforce the law, “including for identified emergency medical conditions that place the health of a pregnant woman or her unborn child in serious jeopardy.” While states like Texas have clarified that ectopic pregnancies can legally be treated with abortions, the laws do not provide for every complication that might arise during a pregnancy. Several women in Texas have sued the state for its law, which has prevented women from terminating pregnancies in cases where their fetuses had deadly fetal anomalies or they went into labor too early for the fetus to survive. Thurman worries pregnant patients with serious complications still won’t be able to get the help they may need in Texas emergency rooms. “You cannot predict the ways a pregnancy can go,” Thurman said. “It can happen to anyone, still. There’s still so many ways in which pregnancies that aren’t ectopic can be deadly.”",

    "title": "Trump announces travel ban on 12 countries and partial restrictions for 7 others",
    "article_text": "In a return of one of themost controversial policiesof his first term, President Donald Trumpsigned a proclamationWednesday banning nationals from a dozen countries, including Afghanistan, Haiti and the Republic of Congo, from entering the United States. Trump framed the new restrictions, which primarily target African and Asian countries, as necessary to fortify national security and combat terrorism. \"As President, I must act to protect the national security and national interest of the United States and its people. I remain committed to engaging with those countries willing to cooperate to improve information-sharing and identity-management procedures, and to address both terrorism-related and public-safety risks,\" the proclamation read. Nationals of 12 countries will be barred from entering the United States: Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. Several of the countries on the list, according to Trump’s proclamation, regularly declined to accept the return of their nationals or had visa overstay rates the administration deemed “unacceptable” and indicative of “a blatant disregard for United States immigration laws.” Others on the list, like Sudan, Yemen and Somalia, were included for inadequate screening and vetting measures, the proclamation noted. An additional seven countries came under partial travel restrictions, in which entrance into the country under several visa programs was suspended but an outright ban was not implemented. Those countries are Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. Theproclamation includes exemptionsfor any lawful permanent resident of the United States, recipients of Afghan Special Immigrant Visas, diplomatic visas, immediate family member immigrant visas and visas “for ethnic and religious minorities in Iran.” It also included exceptions for adoptions, dual nationals traveling on passports from unrestricted countries and athlete or members of athletic teams traveling to the country for the World Cup or the Olympics. The travel restrictions are set to go into effect at 12:01 a.m. ET Monday. The travel ban risks worsening already strained geopolitical tensions, with the United States' role on the global stage having been shaken in recent months by Trump's efforts toenact tariffson dozens of countries nationwide,cut humanitarian aidto poorer nations andforce countriesto accept immigrants he's seeking to deport whilepunishing thosethat do not. Ina video the White House sharedWednesday night, Trump called the travel restrictions \"a key part of preventing major foreign terror attacks on American soil.\" He began the message by pointing torecent violence in Boulder, Colorado,where a man injured at least 12 demonstrators in what city officials calledan antisemitic attack, as justification for a renewed travel ban. “A recent terror attack in Boulder, Colorado, has underscored the extreme dangers posed to our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted, as well as those who come here as temporary visitors and overstay their visas. We don’t want them,” Trump said. The suspect in the attack,Mohamed Sabry Soliman, is from Egypt, and he entered the country on a tourist visa before he applied for asylum. His tourist visa expired as his asylum case was pending. Egypt is not on the list of countries under the newly announced travel bans. Soliman's family were taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Tuesday and were being processed for removal proceedings, according to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. A judge subsequently issued an order Wednesday toprevent the deportation of Soliman's wife and five children. Trump added that his administration considered “the large-scale presence of terrorists, failure to cooperate on visa security, inability to verify travelers identities, inadequate record-keeping of criminal histories, and persistently high rates of illegal visa overstays” in determining the countries that would be affected by the ban. Alex Nowrasteh, the vice president for economic and social policy studies at the Cato Institute, a nonpartisan and independent public policy research organization, noted that even though Trump cited terrorism-related concerns in announcing the new restrictions, terrorist attacks by people from the 12 countries facing outright bans are rare. “Asingle terroristfrom those countries murdered one person in an attack on US soil: Emanuel Kidega Samson from Sudan, who committed an attack motivated by anti-white animus in 2017. The annual chance of being murdered by a terrorist from one of the banned countries from 1975 to the end of 2024 was about 1 in 13.9 billion per year,” Nowrastehwrote. The new travel restrictions mark the return of one of the most divisive policies of Trump's first term, a 2017 travel ban that he called one of his “most successful policies\" Wednesday. During his first term, Trump similarly banned foreigners from six Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States, citing terrorism concerns. Despite Democratic backlash and several legal challenges to the effort, the Supreme Court ultimately upheld the policy in a split decision, with Chief Justice John Roberts making it clear that the ability to regulate immigration falls within the president’s purview. The president can block non-nationals from coming into the United States, Roberts said at the time, if the determination is made that allowing them to enter “would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.” Meanwhile, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in her dissent that based on the evidence in the case, “a reasonable observer would conclude that the Proclamation was motivated by anti-Muslim animus.” Iran, Libya, Somalia and Yemen are the only countries included across both of Trump’s travel bans. Those restrictions remained in place until Jan. 20, 2021, when then-newly elected President Biden overturned them after hesigned a proclamationtitled “Ending Discriminatory Bans on Entry to The United States.” Trump has for years expressed a desire to limit immigration from Haiti and African nations,deriding themas \"shithole\" countries and making clear his preference for European immigrants in discussing the visa lottery system at a White House meeting in 2018. Shortly after he took office for the second time, Trump limited refugee admissions from almost all countries, including Afghanistan, Sudan, the Republic of Congo and Myanmar. In May, however, he granted refugee status to 59 South Africans from the white ethnic group thatruled South Africa during apartheid. TheSupreme Courtallowed the Trump administration Friday torevoke the temporary legal statusof more than 500,000 immigrants that was granted by the Biden administration, making them subject to deportation. Those parolees came from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. The Trump administration canceled an extension of Haiti’s Temporary Protected Status in February after the Biden administration extended the designation into 2026 because of violence and political turmoil on the island. It has also undertaken similar attempts to end TPS for the millions of Venezuelans who entered the country under the protection.",

    "title": "NBA Finals: Insiders break down the matchup between 'the two hardest-playing teams'",
    "article_text": "OKLAHOMA CITY — There are many ways to describe the NBA Finals. Some see Oklahoma City vs. Indiana as the small-market Finals. To others, it’s known as the fiscal Finals — a rare championship matchup between non-luxury-tax-paying teams. On the court, it is a showdown between two of the league’s best guards, Thunder MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Pacers All-Star Tyrese Haliburton. Yet how these teams reached this point, just four victories from a title, can also be captured in a different way. “It’s the two hardest-playing teams in the NBA,” a Western Conference coach told NBC News. Since Jan. 1, the Thunder own the NBA’s best record and the Pacers the second-best, in large part because of how each has blitzed the rest of the league through its frenetic pace and pressure. The Thunder's harassing defense has become one of the best in playoff history at forcing steals. Indiana, meanwhile, plays as if driven to push the ball upcourt as fast as possible. It’s common for teams to play fast off opponents’ turnovers and missed shots — but the Pacers have lived up to their name by running hard even after made baskets, and in the process they have created flurries of scoring opportunities that have knocked off the Eastern Conference’s No. 1 (Cleveland) and No. 3 (New York) seeds en route to the team’s first Finals appearance in 25 years. NBC News spoke with NBA insiders to help analyze the series, which begins with Thursday’s Game 1. All were afforded anonymity in exchange for their candor and analysis, which their teams don’t permit them to voice publicly. The Pacers are “organized chaos,” said a scout for a Western Conference team. “They suck you into their style of play, where it’s not going to be a lot of defense but they’re just going to race the ball up and down the court, spread you out, shoot 3s, get to the basket, try to turn you over and just get in a rat race type of game. If you can match up with teams that struggle to do that, like New York, then you’re going to have a good chance to win. “The problem with Oklahoma City is they can play multiple ways. They enjoy playing fast, but they also can slow it down and use Shai in the halfcourt. It’ll be a chess match to see which style of play wins out. Who breaks first and wants to play one way and not the other?” Oklahoma City, which won 68 regular-season games to earn the West’s top seed, was a heavy favorite to reach the Finals all season, even though it had the second-youngest roster ever to do so. The Thunder ranked No. 1 in defense during both the regular season and the postseason, owing to their phalanx of strong defenders. The challenge begins beyond the 3-point arc, where Lu Dort was successful during Oklahoma City's 2-0 record against Indiana during the regular season at limiting how often Haliburton touched the ball. The rim, meanwhile, is protected by Isaiah Hartenstein and Chet Holmgren. “I think OKC is so strong defensively that they can kind of take you away from your first and second options,” an Eastern Conference scout said. “They’ve found a way to identify players that fit the modern style of play, which is being able to defend and shoot, and then you have obviously a transcendent MVP who can create opportunities for others.” The West scout said some teams construct defenses around a few excellent players, while others try to elevate five otherwise average defenders through a system that makes the whole greater than the sum of its parts. “But I think with OKC, you’re getting kind of both,” the West scout said. “You’re getting great individual performance while also very well-connected with each other. And it shows in the off-the-court stuff with them, where they like being with each other, like playing for one another.” Haliburton on Wednesday called the Thunder “historically great on both sides of the ball.” “This is the best team in the NBA,” he said. “It’s been the best team in the NBA all year. They’re well-coached. They just do everything so well. There’s no shortcuts to beating this team.” Beating Indiana will require Oklahoma City to do the one thing no one has yet to do consistently — force the Pacers to beat themselves. Indiana's preferred pace is fast, yet it rarely turns the ball over. In the postseason, Indiana has gone 6-2 on the road by owning the highest road assist-to-turnover ratio, and it has assisted on a playoff-high 65% of its baskets because it plays lineups often with five players capable of hitting 3-pointers, including center Myles Turner, whose ability to shoot \"always messes teams up from a matchup perspective,\" the West coach said. That offensive depth makes the Pacers trickier to guard than Oklahoma City's past playoff opponents; it could focus its defensive efforts to take away Ja Morant of Memphis, Nikola Jokić of Denver and Anthony Edwards of Minnesota. Though Oklahoma City is heavily favored to win the series, Indiana can't be underestimated, an executive for an Eastern team said. \"They understand how they’re playing, and they’re very stubborn in their approach,\" he said. \"They kind of grind you with the way they play. They wear you down.\" Both franchises reflect the realities of the modern NBA, in which the league’s collective bargaining agreement with its players has instituted rules aimed at penalizing teams that build expensive rosters by making it harder to draft or make trades when their payrolls cross a certain threshold. Though Oklahoma City has a star in Gilgeous-Alexander and the Pacers claim Haliburton as their own, both have found success in building deep teams that can punish opponents by coming at them in waves of long arms and fresh legs. “It’s why the day of the aging superstar will be over in the next two years,” the West coach said. “Indiana’s best talent for the majority of their roster is how hard they play. TJ McConnell, Aaron Nesmith, Benedict Mathurin, throw Pascal Siakam in there — they’re just junkyard dogs, and they do it every single night.”",

    "title": "Trump issues new travel ban covering a dozen countries",
    "article_text": "By NPR Washington Desk , Asma Khalid President Trump announced a travel ban Wednesday on 12 countries and a partial ban on seven others.Tasos Katopodis/Getty Imageshide caption President Trump on Wednesday signed a proclamation banning travelers from 12 countries and partially restricting travelers from seven others, starting on Monday, June 9. The White House said the action was needed to protect the United States from terrorist attacks and other national security threats, and said the countries lacked screening and vetting capabilities. The full ban applies to foreign nationals from Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. The partial ban applies to people from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela. In avideo statement posted on social media, Trump said the firebombing attack in Boulder, Colo., underscored why the ban was needed. The man charged with that attack is from Egypt, which is not one of the countries listed in the travel ban. \"In the 21st century, we've seen one terror attack after another carried out by foreign visa overstayers from dangerous places all over the world,\" Trump said in the video statement. Shawn VanDiver with #AfghanEvac, a nonprofit that helps resettle Afghans in the United States, said that while the Trump administration carved out an exception for special immigrant visas for Afghanswho were employed by or on behalf of the U.S. government, \"tens of thousands of Afghans with pending cases—especially family members—will now be blocked from reaching safety, regardless of their loyalty to the United States or prior vetting.\" This new travel ban is the result of anexecutive orderTrump signed on his first day back in the White House. That order called on various agencies, such as the U.S. State Department, to help identify \"countries throughout the world for which vetting and screening information is so deficient as to warrant a partial or full suspension.\" Trump also sought to identify how many people from those countries were admitted during the Biden administration, to possibly retroactively suspend their visas. Trump actively campaigned last year on restoring the travel ban he enacted in his first term. He described it as \"unbelievably successful\" in preventing terrorism attacks. The backstory for that first ban is long and complicated. In December 2015, as he was first running for president, Trump made a dramatic statement calling for a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\" Then, a few days after he first took office, on Jan. 27, 2017, Trump signed anexecutive orderthat barred travel fromseven Muslim-majority countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The ban was technically temporary — the text specified 90 days. But the outcry was immediate and swift. There was mayhem at airports and protests around the country as people who had existing visas were detained. There was no mention of the word \"Muslim\" in Trump's executive order, but critics say it was clearly advertised as such during his campaign. The ban faced legal challenges. And was blocked by a court. The Trump administration made some minor revisions, dropping Iraq from the list and allowing exceptions for green card holders and people with pre-existing visas. But courts alsostruck downthat revised version. Ultimately, after multiple revisions, in the summer of 2018, the Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision backedTrump's travel ban. In that third iteration that the court upheld, Trump expanded the list of prohibited travelers beyond the Muslim-majority nations to also include people from North Korea and government officials from Venezuela. The day he was inaugurated in 2021, then-President Joe Biden rescinded Trump's travel ban. He signed a presidential proclamation titled, \"Ending Discriminatory Bans on Entry to the United States.\" But now it seems that was only temporary. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Udon, publisher of Street Fighter, Mega Man, Elden Ring, and other videogame comics and art books, is the latest to cut ties with bankrupt distributor Diamond Comics",
    "article_text": "Diamond has been the main comics distributor across the US since 1997. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Until 2020, Diamond Comic Distributors held a near-monopoly on getting comic books to retailers in the US. Publishers like Marvel, DC, Dark Horse, Image, Viz, Boom, and Udon all sold their comics exclusively through Diamond, though hearingretailers grumbleabout them—often claiming books arrived damaged, late, or not at all, especially in small-town shops—was common. When Diamond announced it would cease shipments during the Covid-19 pandemic in March of 2020, DC took it as an opportunity to jump ship, switching to Lunar Distribution and UCS Comic Distributors for its monthly releases and Penguin Random House for book-sized releases. One by one other publishers followed,including Marvel, until Diamond declared bankruptcy in January of 2025. Udon was one of the last publishers to remain with Diamond (alongside Dynamite, which would rather like to retrievehalf a million dollars it claims Diamond owes), but now Udon has declared it's found an alternative as well. Udon has halted all shipments to Diamond in favor of Lunar Distribution, with its Manga Classics imprint now being distributed by Simon & Schuster. \"With the current state of uncertainty and lack of communication from the new owners to both retailers as well as many publishers, we have to do what is best to serve our customers,\" Udon chief of operations Erik Ko said. \"We realize this is a deep inconvenience for many retailers, but we're trying to do our best to serve our partners and fans, while minimizing risk and moving forward in an uncertain time.\" This has affected the first issue of Udon's new series Mega Man Timelines, which has been pushed back a month to a June 25 release. Udon's future comics, manga, and art books will be distributed though Lunar, which presumably includes any more of the Capcom-licensed books it's famous for—like Street Fighter, Darkstalkers, and Final Fight—as well as its books based on games likeElden Ringand Persona.

    "article_text": "Help with today's Wordle if you need it. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Set a new record for your dailyWordlegame with our help. Maybe—just this once—you could click down to today's answer, and guarantee yourself an instant win. Or if that feels a bit unfair, you could spend some time with our general tips instead. Our exclusive hint for the June 5 (1447) puzzle can help too if you need something specific, without being handed the answer. A great start gave me just the confidence boost I needed to be brave today, and the guesses I made because of my good mood soon led me towards today's answer. I'm in no danger of setting a new record time, but I enjoyed working my way through that one. Make sure you use today's hint if you need to give yourself a lift. This is a fact, something already known. This could be information used to draw conclusions from, or to calculate something. No, there is not a double letter in today's puzzle. If you're new to the daily Wordle puzzle or you just want a refresher after taking a break, I'll share some quick tips to help you win. There's nothing quite like a small victory to set you up for the rest of the day. You're not up against a timer, so you've got all the time in the world—well, until midnight—to find the winning word. If you're stuck, there's no shame in coming back to the puzzle later in the day and finishing it up when you've cleared your head. Another Wordle sorted. The answer to the June 5 (1447) Wordle isDATUM. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Keeping track of the last handful of Wordle answers can help to eliminate current possibilities. It's also handy for inspiring opening words or subsequent guesses if you're short on ideas for the day. Here are the last 10 Wordle answers: Wordle presents you with six rows of five boxes every day and the aim is to figure out the correct five-letter word by entering guesses and eliminating or confirming individual letters. Getting off to a good start witha strong wordlike ARISE—something containing multiple vowels, common consonants, and no repeat letters—is a good tactic. Once you hit Enter, the boxes will show you which letters you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second guess should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. With a bit of luck, you should have some coloured squares to work with and set you on the right path. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used, you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it wassold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes. When baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do. She's now PC Gamer's word game expert, taking on the dailyWordlepuzzle to give readers a hint each and every day. Her Wordle streak is truly mighty.

    "title": "'The will to resist is in your hands': Final Fantasy Tactics director makes statement on the political backdrop of the original and the 'inequality and division' that persists today",
    "article_text": "With an FF Tactics remaster coming, designer Yasumi Matsuno recalls the economic disaster that shaped the original. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A Final Fantasy Tactics remasteris really happening, and will release on PS4, PS5, and Steam this September. With the announcement, Square Enix has published statements from the remaster's development leads, and the internet has responded in particular to comments from Yasumi Matsuno, writer and director of the 1997 original. Matsuno outlined the economic and political context within which he wrote the Final Fantasy Tactics story—a Japan in which \"many were robbed of hope\" amideconomic stagnation—and noted that \"inequality and division are still deeply rooted in our society\" today. Here's Matsuno's full statement, which wasposted to X: Nearly 30 years ago, the collapse of Japan's bubble economy engulfed the nation's financial institutions in mountains of bad debt, triggering a wave of corporate bankruptcies, a sudden and extreme rise in unemployment rates, and stagnation of Japanese society as a whole. It was an era when many were robbed of hope, when dreams were measured by their price tag. Against this historical backdrop, I crafted a story. It was the story of Ramza, a young man who fought tirelessly against the entrenched social class system. It was the story of Delita, who sought to take advantage of this confusion and despair to advance his own social position. It was a story of a peculiar destiny, in which friendship and betrayal intertwine. And now, in 2025—a time when inequality and division are still deeply rooted in our society—I offer this story once again. The will to resist is in your hands. The Final Fantasy Tactics remaster is officially called Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles. It'll be out September 30, and will include two versions of the game. The \"classic\" version \"stays true to the original in almost every aspect, but includes some handy features such as auto save,\"says Square Enix. Alternatively, the \"enhanced\" version adds voiced dialogue, an updated UI, and other new features and changes. There is, unfortunately, no way to turn off the backdrop of inequality and division that shaped either version. Tyler grew up in Silicon Valley during the '80s and '90s, playing games like Zork and Arkanoid on early PCs. He was later captivated by Myst, SimCity, Civilization, Command & Conquer, all the shooters they call \"boomer shooters\" now, and PS1 classic Bushido Blade (that's right: he had Bleem!). Tyler joined PC Gamer in 2011, and today he's focused on the site's news coverage. His hobbies include amateur boxing and adding to his 1,200-plus hours in Rocket League.

    "title": "Bloodstained is back after 6 years with 3D cutscenes that look like they're from a different era of videogames",
    "article_text": "Why is everyone made out of plastic? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I almost didn't recognize Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement as a Bloodstained game, partly because it's been six whole years since the last one and partly because the aesthetic is all over the place. The past six years have also been full of Castlevania-likes that feature a lot of the same gothic imagery and it feels like every five minutes a new soulslike with evil knights and dragons shows up. But when the title finally appeared, it was clear that the OG, Koji Igarashi, was back with a new game. I'm not entirely convinced on the look yet, however. The original Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night mixed visual styles too: there are 2D treasure chests plopped into 3D hallways as if they've been painted onto the scene. Damage numbers and items are the same way, but all the monsters and NPCs are rendered in full 3D. It's a weird style that doesn't really commit to a fully retro look or a fully modern look and instead sits uncomfortably somewhere in between. The new game is going for a similar style, but leans even harder into having fully 3D models, except now they all have cel-shading—even the treasure chests. It looks slightly more cohesive until the moment a cutscene plays and it feels like you've been transported to 2010. Outside of the 2.5D levels, the character models are weirdly soft and lack details in a way that would fit right in with Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. It's not even ugly, it's just jarring compared to the rest of the game. It certainly sticks out though, which I guess is expected for a game that is a prequel to the Bloodstained we got in 2019. I kind of admire not going for a full-on reboot and sticking to the style that was already established. I just think games like Blasphemous and even Hollow Knight feel more coherent and tied to the Castlevania lineage. Maybe none of that will matter while you're busy playing with The Scarlet Engagement's dual protagonists. You won't pick one of the two characters at the beginning of the game or anything; you play as both of them at the same time. According to thePlayStation Blog,you will have direct control over either Leonard or Alexander and the other one will hop in to assist. The idea of having even more options for combat by figuring out how to combo attacks with both of them admittedly sounds pretty fun. If it is, I'll forgive it for whatever is going on with those cutscenes. TheSteam pageis already up, but we won't be able to see how it all comes together until 2026.

    "title": "Whites to become minority in UK in 40 years – study",
    "article_text": "White Britons will become a minority in their own country in less than four decades, a recent study has suggested. The UK has seen a massive influx of legal and illegal migration under successive Conservative and Labour governments, with a record high of 906,000 new arrivals in 2023, according to The Telegraph. In 2022, the census revealed that London and Birmingham had become minority white cities. In an article on Tuesday, the newspaper cited an analysis by professor Matt Goodwin of Buckingham University, showing that the share of white Britons in the total population of the UK will slide from the current 73% to 57% by 2050. The study predicts they will slip into minority by 2063, and by the end of the century, the white population in the country may shrink to around 33%. The analysis goes on to project that six in ten people in the UK will be foreign-born or have at least one immigrant parent by the end of the century. The share of Muslims in the UK population is expected to rise from the current 7% to 19.2% within the same period. Goodwin told The Telegraph that his study factors in migration, as well as birth and death rates among various ethnic and religious groups, based on Office for National Statistics and census data. The author of the study told the newspaper that his findings raise“enormous questions about the capacity of our country and leaders to unify people around a shared sense of identity, values, ways of life, and culture.” He also noted that the concerns that his study is liable to spark among many Britons“will need to be recognised, respected and addressed if the UK is to avoid considerable political turbulence and polarisation in the years and decades ahead.”",

    "title": "Trump orders probe into who really ran country under Biden",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump has ordered a sweeping investigation into his predecessor’s administration, directing the Department of Justice to examine whether unelected aides effectively governed the country during Joe Biden’s presidency. The probe into Biden’s final acts in office will scrutinize the use of autopen signatures on official documents, including the commutation of 37 death sentences and pardons granted to family members and political allies, according to an executive directive published by the White House on Wednesday. “Given clear indications that President Biden lacked the capacity to exercise his Presidential authority, if his advisors secretly used the mechanical signature pen to conceal this incapacity, while taking radical executive actions all in his name, that would constitute an unconstitutional wielding of the power of the Presidency,”Trump’s order stated. The investigation centers on allegations that Biden’s cognitive decline allowed staffers to make key decisions without his direct input. Investigators have been tasked with determining whether there was a coordinated effort within the Biden administration to conceal the president’s health issues from the public, including possible conspiracies to suppress evidence of cognitive decline and to artificially portray him as fit for office. Trump has previously accused Biden’s senior aides of potentially committing“treason at the highest level”if they exploited his predecessor’s alleged cognitive decline to implement policies he may not have personally supported. The Justice Department investigation aims to determine whether all executive actions were authorized by Biden himself. Attorney General Pam Bondi and White House Counsel David Warrington have been tasked with leading the inquiry. Trump’s critics have claimed that the probe is politically motivated and lacks substantive evidence, while legal experts note that the use of autopen for presidential signatures is legally permissible and has been used by multiple previous administrations. The Trump administration maintains that the device has never been employed to this extent. The issue of Biden’s health – and his cognitive abilities in particular – was thrust into the national spotlight during his reelection campaign last year, when critics highlighted the veteran politician’s unsteady gait, apparent memory lapses, and difficulty articulating his thoughts. Matters came to a head after a disastrous debate against Trump in June 2024, after which a growing number of Democrats called on him to withdraw from the race. Biden formally stepped down the following month. Last month, Biden's office revealed that he had been diagnosed with an“aggressive form”of prostate cancer. Many commentators, including Trump, alleged that the illness had developed over several years and that Biden’s inner circle deliberately withheld the diagnosis from the public. US Senator Ron Johnson, who chairs the Homeland Security investigative subcommittee, has launched a separate probe into a potential cover-up relating to the former president’s health.",

    "article_text": "The European Commission will now allow member states to redirect pandemic recovery funds they have struggled to claim for use in bloc-wide security and defense initiatives – with significantly less oversight and fewer bureaucratic hurdles. The EU established the €650 billion ($740 billion) Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) in 2021 to support green energy and growth-oriented projects in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, to receive the funds, member states must prove their projects meet specific benchmarks. Roughly half of the fund remains unspent, with the Commission’scommuniqueon Wednesday warning that the deadline to“provide evidence”is looming in September 2026. In order to“easily secure”their share of the remaining funds before time runs out, countries can now instead channel RRF-backed money into various EU“defense”projects, such as the European Defence Industry Programme (EDIP) or satellite communications initiatives, Politico reported on Wednesday. “These alternatives could help the Recovery Facility to deliver additional important benefits from common European priorities, including in the areas of security and defense,”EU Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis said. The Commission’s memo claimed that“specific projects would subsequently be selected and supported under EDIP, for the benefit of the Member State concerned, with implementation occurring over a longer time horizon.” Kiev is specifically listed as one of the main beneficiaries of EDIP, an initiative designed to subsidize the bloc’s defense industry and enhance“joint procurement with and for Ukraine,”according to an ECfactsheet. Originally a €1.5 billion program, EDIP also aims to“use windfall profits from frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine.” Brussels has spent almost €50 billion supporting Kiev through various EU programs since the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022, in addition to billions contributed by individual member states, according to data from Germany’s Kiel Institute. In March, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen presented a plan to mobilize up to €800 billion ($875 billion) in debt and tax incentives for the military-industrial complex to“rearm”the bloc against the perceived“Russian threat.”Last month, the Council of the European Union endorsed a €150 billion ($170 billion)militarization plan, dubbed SAFE (Security Action for Europe), to raise funds for military purposes without direct approval from the European Parliament. Russia has repeatedly dismissed claims it plans to attack Western Europe as“nonsense,”accusing the West of using scare tactics to justify diverting public funds toward military spending. Moscow has warned that foreign involvement and arms deliveries only obstruct any peace efforts and embolden Kiev. The Kremlin has also criticized the EU’s militarization drive, warning that it risks triggering a broader conflict in Europe.",

    "article_text": "World World United Nations Security Council members vote on a resolution calling for a ceasefire and unrestricted humanitarian access in Gaza, at UN headquarters in New York City on Jun 4, 2025. (Photo: AFP/Leonardo Munoz) UNITED NATIONS: UN Security Council members criticised the United States on Wednesday (Jun 5) after itvetoed a resolution calling for a ceasefire and unrestricted humanitarian access in Gaza, which Washington said undermined ongoing diplomacy. It was the 15-member body's first vote on the situation since November, when the US - a key Israeli ally - also blocked a text calling for an end to fighting. \"Today, the United States sent a strong message by vetoing a counterproductive UN Security Council resolution on Gaza targeting Israel,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement after Wednesday's 14 to 1 vote. He said Washington would not support any text that \"draws a false equivalence between Israel and Hamas, or disregards Israel's right to defend itself. \"The United States will continue to stand with Israel at the UN.\" The draft resolution had demanded \"an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza respected by all parties\". It also called for the \"immediate, dignified and unconditional release of all hostages held by Hamas and other groups\", and demanded the lifting of all restrictions on the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza. Hamas, whose unprecedented attack inside Israel on Oct 7, 2023 sparked the war, condemned the \"disgraceful\" US veto, reiterating accusations of \"genocide\" in Gaza, something Israel vehemently rejects. The veto \"marks a new stain on the ethical record of the United States of America,\" the group said in a statement, accusing Washington of \"legitimising genocide, supporting aggression, and rationalising starvation, destruction, and mass killings\". Pakistan's ambassador to the UN Asim Ahmad meanwhile said the failed resolution would \"remain not only a moral stain on the conscience of this council, but a fateful moment of political application that will reverberate for generations\". China's ambassador to the UN Fu Cong said \"today's vote result once again exposes that the root cause of the council's inability to quell the conflict in Gaza is the repeated obstruction by the US.\" The veto marks Washington's first such action since US President Donald Trump took office in January. Israel has faced mounting international pressure to end its war in Gaza. That scrutiny has increased over flailing aid distribution in Gaza, which Israel blocked for more than two months before allowing a small number of UN vehicles to enter in mid-May. The United Nations, which warned last month the entire population in the besieged Palestinian territory was at risk of famine, said trickle was far from enough to meet the humanitarian needs. \"The Council was prevented from shouldering its responsibility, despite the fact that most of us seem to be converging on one view,\" said France's ambassador to the UN Jerome Bonnafont. Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian ambassador to the UN, said after the Security Council vote he would now ask the General Assembly to pass a resolution calling for a ceasefire. Israel's ambassador to the UN Danny Danon however said that the Palestinian plan to put the resolution to a vote at the General Assembly, where no country can veto it, was pointless, telling countries \"don't waste more of your energy\". \"This resolution doesn't advance humanitarian relief and undermines it. It ignores a working system in favor of political agendas,\" he said. \"The United Nations must return to its original purpose-promoting peace and security-and stop these performative actions,\" Rubio said.

    "title": "Two Jurong hospitals to explore integration with district cooling system",
    "article_text": "Singapore Singapore If the project goes ahead, Ng Teng Fong General Hospital and Jurong Community Hospital will be the first in Singapore's healthcare sector to connect to a district cooling system. Ng Teng Fong General Hospital and Jurong Community Hospital will be the first public healthcare institutions to explore the feasibility of integrating with Keppel's district cooling system plant. (Photo: JurongHealth Campus) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Two hospitals in Jurong could become the first in Singapore’s healthcare sector to use a district cooling system for air conditioning, following the signing of an agreement with asset operator Keppel on Thursday (Jun 5). Under the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), Ng Teng Fong General Hospital and Jurong Community Hospital – part of the JurongHealth Campus – will explore the feasibility of integrating with Keppel’s district cooling system. The system will complement and further optimise their existing efficiency measures, potentially yielding financial savings and reducing their carbon footprint, both hospitals said in a press release. The hospitals currently rely primarily on a centralised chilled water supply for an array of needs, which include round-the-clock cooling for operating theatres, intensive care units and medical equipment. Healthcare institutions also need standby chillers in case of disruptions. To optimise energy use, the district cooling system uses technologies such as thermal energy storage and intelligent control, the hospitals said. The system can also provide more reliable and consistent cooling, minimising the risk of disruptions to operations and improving patient comfort. Unlike conventional cooling systems, where each building has its own chiller, the district cooling system plant generates chilled water and distributes it through underground pipes to a network of buildings for air conditioning. At Ng Teng Fong General Hospital and Jurong Community Hospital, the chilled water will be distributed to critical cooling zones such as laboratories and intensive care units. Heat exchangers will transfer the chilled water to their internal air handling units, then return warm water to Keppel’s plant for re-chilling, re-cooling and reuse. Besides the hospitals, Keppel's district cooling system will serve future developments in Jurong Lake District, including offices, business parks and residences. As different types of buildings use the cooling system at different times of the day, the demand for cooling is spread out, reducing peak demand and increasing energy efficiency. The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) awarded Keppel the contract to develop the district cooling plan there in June 2023. Keppel has estimated the contract will generate approximately S$950 million (US$738 million) for the company over 30 years, according to the release. The plant has a capacity of about 29,000 refrigeration tonnes (RT), roughly equivalent to the cooling capacity of around 19,000 1.5-tonne household air conditioning units. It will provide chilled water and cooling services to an estimated 1.4 million sq m of gross floor area, or close to 200 football fields. Ms Cindy Lim, CEO of Keppel's infrastructure division, said the district cooling system is expected to lead to a further 2 per cent optimisation in energy efficiency.\"With these energy savings and cost optimisation, a total life cycle cost savings of more than S$7 million over 30 years are expected,\" she added. Associate Professor Dan Yock Young, the CEO of both hospitals, said that healthcare services consume \"significant amounts of energy and water\" and generate medical waste. \"As one of the key contributors to the climate crisis, it is imperative for us to look into optimising energy efficiency,\" he said. He added that the district cooling plant could reduce the need to replace and maintain chillers. This could, in turn, free up some of the hospital's rooftop and plant room space, which are occupied by cooling towers and standby chillers, for other meaningful activities such as patient care and therapy. Chief sustainability officer of both hospitals, Mr Ng Kian Swan, called the MOU a “leap forward” as both institutions “explore ways to save the planet”. “The collaboration could set a new benchmark in the healthcare sector,” he said.

    "article_text": "Sustainability Sustainability A school of fish swim above a finger coral colony as it grows on the Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Cairns, Australia, on Oct 25, 2019. (Photo: REUTERS/Lucas Jackson) SINGAPORE: Unprecedented heatwaves in the Southwest Pacific affected more than 10 per cent of the global ocean surface in 2024, damaging coral reefs and putting the region's last remaining tropical glacier at risk of extinction, the UN's weather body said on Thursday (Jun 5). Average 2024 temperatures in the region - which covers Australia and New Zealand as well as southeast Asian island states like Indonesia and the Philippines - were nearly half a degree Celsius higher than the 1991-2020 mean, the World Meteorological Organization said in an annual report. \"Much of the region saw at least severe marine heat wave conditions at some point during the course of 2024, particularly in areas near and south of the equator,\" said the WMO's Blair Trewin, one of the report's authors. Extreme heat over the year affected 40 million sq km of ocean, and new temperature highs were set in the Philippines and Australia, the report said. Ocean surface temperatures also broke records, while total ocean heat content was the second-highest annual average, behind 2022. An unprecedented number of cyclones, which experts have attributed to climate change, also caused havoc in the Philippines in October and November. Sea levels continue to rise more quickly than the global average, an urgent problem in a region where more than half the population live within 500m of the coast, the report added. The report also cited satellite data showing that the region's sole tropical glacier, located in Indonesia on the western part of the island of New Guinea, shrank by up to 50 per cent last year. \"Unfortunately, if this rate of loss continues, this glacier could be gone by 2026 or shortly thereafter,\" said the WMO's Thea Turkington, another of the report's authors.

Lee took office on Wednesdayjust hours after riding a wave of anger over a brief martial law imposed by Yoon Suk Yeol to win the snap election. The attempt at military rule led to Yoon's ouster and sent shockwaves through Asia's fourth-largest economy. In brief remarks open to the media, Lee told the carry-over cabinet left by the caretaker government that was in place followingYoon's impeachment in Decemberthat there was no time to waste in getting to work as the people were facing hardship. Lee has so far only nominated a political ally and legislative veteran as prime minister and is racing to form a cabinet and staff his office to maintain continuity in administration.

Kim Min-seok, whose appointment as prime minister requires parliamentary approval, said on Wednesday the country was facing even more economic turmoil than during the Asian financial crisis of 1997, complicated by unfavourable external factors. \"Today, the economy is heading downward and stagnating, which is why I believe it's much more difficult,\" he told reporters. The previous government had made little progress in trying to assuage crushing US tariffs that would hit some of the country's major export-reliant industries, including autos, electronics and steel.

    "title": "Quality of teacher training matters more than duration of NIE programme, aspiring educators say",
    "article_text": "Singapore Singapore The Ministry of Education says shorter postgraduate teacher training at the National Institute of Education will not be less rigorous. Students having a lesson in a classroom in Singapore. (File photo: CNA/Raj Nadarajan) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Reducing the duration of postgraduate teacher training in Singapore from 16 months to 12 could make a difference in attracting applicants, but won't be as important as making the programme both effective and efficient, aspiring educators said. Earlier this week, Education Minister Desmond Lee announced that the training period for the National Institute of Education’s (NIE) Postgraduate Diploma in Education (PGDE) would beshortened by four months. This is part of a regular review of teacher preparation programmes, according to the Ministry of Education (MOE) and NIE. “The review builds on the strengths of the current PGDE, and will not affect the rigour of the programme,” the agencies told CNA in response to queries about the change. The review - by educators and leaders from MOE and NIE - is ongoing, with details and the start date of the shorter diploma programme to be announced later. In 2016, the PGDE programme was extended from 12 months to 16 months. CNA spoke to three prospective teachers and one teacher who recently completed the programme, about the significance of the the latest change. Mr Linus Chen, currently in the programme, believes a shortened course could still be effective as long as useful classes are retained. These include educational psychology and subject-specific classes, though there are others that feel redundant due to overlaps, the 26-year-old told CNA. He said the contract teaching stint before starting the programme was “very, very important”, both for schools to assess trainees and for trainees to see if they are suited to teach. According to MOE, this stint generally lasts at least four months. The ensuing 16-month NIE programme then includes another two stints of teaching in schools – four weeks of teaching assistantship, then 10 weeks of teaching practice towards the end of the course. “To be very frank, the best way to learn is to do it on the job,” said Mr Chen. “Trying to learn teaching without having real students is like trying to learn driving without having a car.” What is valuable about NIE's programme is having time to reflect on past teaching experiences and sharing ideas with friends, he added. A junior college teacher who switched careers and attended the NIE programme last year also said the teaching stint before the course was the “most valuable part”. Shortening the NIE course is unlikely to make a difference to the quality of the programme, said the man, who declined to be named. “Teachers usually (give) feedback that most of what is taught in NIE is not applicable on the ground in schools anyway,” he added. “Some other modules that took place during our year at NIE felt unnecessary or cursory, so I do feel the efficiency of the training duration – rather than the length – is what should be looked into.” From 2022 to 2024, around 390 student teachers enrolled in NIE’s postgraduate diploma programme each year. They were either fresh graduates or hailing from different industries. In announcing the review, the education minister said it was to meet the learning needs of an “increasingly diverse\" teaching force. Mr Lee also said MOE was redoubling efforts to attract teachers and welcome people with different life experiences and skills, including those making a career switch. One mid-career switcher who has applied to NIE's programme said the four-month reduction would make a “tangible difference” for him. It would make the programme “less daunting” for new applicants from a “sunk cost perspective”, said the man, who took a pay cut to join teaching. He declined to be named in this article. He too said that what mattered more was making the training effective and helping teachers adapt to the real classroom environment. “I can only hope that the truncation of the training period is due to a meaningful consolidation of training content, and not a removal of important training opportunities,” he said. One teacher-in-training currently in the NIE programme said those who want to hit the ground running may be incentivised to take up a shorter course. The junior college teacher who attended last year, however, told CNA he did not expect the shorter duration to make a big difference for those passionate about teaching. NIE associate professor in policy curriculum and leadership Jason Tan, who is not involved in the review, noted that the postgraduate programme faces the challenge of equipping both fresh graduates and mid-career professionals, who may have varying degrees of exposure to training and education, with the necessary skills. Anecdotally, he has observed more mid-career professionals training to become teachers, though this is not a recent phenomenon. Back in 2008, MOE already moved to raise salaries and speed up promotions for mid-career switchers. At the time, there were 6,600 mid-career teachers, making up 22 per cent of the education service. Ultimately, a shorter training period is just one consideration influencing job seekers' decisions, Assoc Prof Tan pointed out. Other factors like macroeconomic trends and the emergence of new fields of work also impact the relative attractiveness of teaching as a career, and these are not within MOE’s control, he said. MOE and NIE told CNA the ongoing review will refresh teacher preparation in two key ways. First, it will strengthen professional learning support both during the diploma programme and when teachers enter schools. With a focus on integrating theory and practice, student teachers will learn through \"different modalities, opportunities for personalised and collaborative learning and integration of skills and knowledge across different courses and learning experiences”. Upon graduation, new teachers will receive more structured support through “bite-sized, practice-oriented learning sessions that draw on their daily classroom teaching”. “This will enable them to better contextualise their learning within authentic classroom experiences,” said MOE and NIE. Second, student teachers will have more flexibility and autonomy to shape their learning. “For example, while all teachers take core courses essential to teaching, new teachers will be able to select electives aligned to their needs and interests,” said MOE and NIE. Assoc Prof Tan cautioned against viewing the shortening of the NIE programme duration as a “simplistic\" move. He expects it to involve a rethinking of course structure and offerings, for new teachers to strengthen their skills in priority areas. For possible electives, he pointed to six practice areas prioritised in the SkillsFuture for Educators professional development roadmap. These are: Assessment to identify and address learning gaps; supporting special needs students; inquiry-based learning using questions and evidence; digital pedagogy; differentiated instruction for students with different needs; and character and citizenship education. Electives could let new teachers explore these areas in more depth while being trained in core competencies, he said. These core competencies are likely to include assessment of learning and performance; parent engagement; teacher-student relationships; and educational psychology and pedagogical practices, among others.

Videos of the incident showed the huge male elephant, known as Plai Biang Lek, briefly stopping in front of the shop, located next to a main road near the Khao Yai National Park in northeastern Thailand, before ducking his whole body inside. The elephant stopped in front of the shop’s counter, calmly snatching and chomping snacks, and did not flinch as the national park workers tried to shoo him away. The elephant later backed out of the shop still holding a bag of snacks with his trunk. He left little damage behind, except mud tracks on the floor and the ceiling of the shop.

In a video posted on social media, Kamploy Kakaew, the shop owner, appeared amused as she described the moment the elephant rifled her shop. She said he ate about nine bags of sweet rice crackers, a sandwich and some dried bananas she had bought that morning. Kamploy said the elephant left without hurting anyone after getting his snacks. Danai Sookkanthachat, a volunteer park worker familiar with the elephant, said Plai Biang Lek, who is about 30 years old, is a familiar sight in the area and has been known to enter people’s houses in search of food. This was the first time he had seen him going into a grocery store. \"After he left the shop, he went on to open a bedroom window of another house,\" he told The Associated Press. Danai said wild elephants in the Khao Yai National Park area have been coming out of the woods to ransack people’s kitchens for many years, but this year he has started seeing them going into more random places to find food. There were an estimated 4,000 wild elephants in Thailand in 2024, according to the Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation. As farmers push into forests for agriculture, elephants have been forced to venture out of their shrinking habitats in search of food, leading to confrontations that can turn deadly.

    "article_text": "Business Business Workers transport soil containing rare earth elements for export at a port in Lianyungang, Jiangsu province, China, on Oct 31, 2010. (Photo: REUTERS/Stringer) WASHINGTON: A group representing auto suppliers in the United States called on Wednesday (Jun 4) for immediate action to addressChina's restricted exports of rare earths, minerals and magnets, warning the issue could quickly disrupt auto parts production. China, which controls over 90 per cent of global processing capacity for rare earths used in everything from automobiles and fighter jets to home appliances, imposed restrictions in early April requiring exporters to obtain licenses from Beijing. The tighter restrictions followed the opening of a trade war between the US and China after President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Chinese imports. In a statement to Reuters, MEMA, the Vehicle Suppliers Association said parts companies are facing \"serious, real-time risks\" to their supply chains. \"The situation remains unresolved and the level of concern remains very high,\" the group said. \"Immediate and decisive action is needed to prevent widespread disruption and economic fallout across the vehicle supplier sector.\" Subscribe to our Chief Editor’s Week in ReviewOur chief editor shares analysis and picks of the week's biggest news every Saturday.This service is not intended for persons residing in the E.U.

The White House did not immediately comment. On May 9, the supplier group raised urgent concerns about the Chinese restrictions in a joint letter with the trade group representing General Motors, Toyota, Volkswagen , Hyundai and other major automakers. \"Without reliable access to these elements and magnets, automotive suppliers will be unable to produce critical automotive components, including automatic transmissions, throttle bodies, alternators, various motors, sensors, seat belts, speakers, lights, motors, power steering, and cameras,\" MEMA and the Alliance for Automotive Innovation wrote to the Trump administration in the letter, which was first reported by Reuters. Rare-earth magnet exports from China halved in April as companies grappled with an opaque application process for permits that sometimes require hundreds of pages of documents. In a social media post last Friday, Trump accused China of violating terms of a deal reached in May to temporarily dial back the tariffs both sides imposed on each other and other trade restrictions. US auto companies are already feeling the impact of the restrictions. Ford shut down production of its Explorer SUV at its Chicago plant for a week in May because of a rare-earth shortage, the company said.

Dawn Yeoh is in the running for Top 10 Most Popular Female Artiste at Star Awards 2025. (Photos: Mediacorp, Instagram/Dawn Yeoh) This audio is generated by an AI tool. By now, you should know thatDawn Yeoh's evil role as Kang Si Li in Emerald Hillis one of the most prominent characters from the Mediacorp blockbuster. But is the hype surrounding the 39-year-old actress' character enough for her to bag a trophy at the upcoming Star Awards on Jul 6? Yeoh sure hopes so. Despite being in the industry for two decades, Yeoh has not snagged a single award at the annual ceremony. This year, she'sin the running for Top 10 Most Popular Female Artiste. \"Actually I really yearn for it, but I dare not harbour too much hope because I'm afraid the disappointment will only be bigger,\" she told zaobao.sg. Yeoh, however, thinks it will be very heartwarming if she clinches her first Top 10 trophy while her Emerald Hill husband Romeo Tan wins his final one at the same time. If Tan wins his 10th Top 10 this year, he will move on to become an All-Time Favourite Artiste at the next Star Awards. According to Yeoh, playing Kang Si Li was a turning point in her career as it helped her gain attention from audiences outside of Singapore. \"That day I was at a forum and went to the booth for Chinese media company Tencent. The staff all could recognise me and said: 'San Shao Nai Nai (third young mistress, Yeoh's other title in the show) is here',\" she recalled excitedly. Yeoh was so overwhelmed by that incident that she was moved to tears. \"To be finally seen after being in the industry for 20 years feels like a weight has been lifted off my chest,\" she said. She is now hoping to take on even more baddie roles in the future, especially after seeing the change in how the audience perceive such characters. \"In the past the villains were all criticised and hated on, but nowadays people are able to appreciate the complexities and charm of the characters. I don't mind playing villain roles at all, as long as I can have a breakthrough and unleash my potential,\" said Yeoh. Besides acting, Yeoh is currently also a live streamer under director Jack Neo's Star Live Mall. She previously co-founded e-commerce platform Sibay Shiok with Terence Cao in 2021 before they both joined forces with Jack. When asked about balancing acting and being an entrepreneur, Yeoh then emphasised that she \"doesn't want to let go of either\" sides of her career. \"If I have the ability and luck, I hope that I can go steady and far in both areas,\" she said, adding that more clients have taken interest in content involving her recently. At the same time, Yeoh, who has received invitations to star in other upcoming Mediacorp dramas, is sieving through scripts and looking to go for auditions in the near future. San Shao Nai Nai may not have had a good ending in Emerald Hill,but it seems like her real life is turning out great.

(Photo: REUTERS/Kham) HANOI: Vietnam has submitted a document responding to US trade requests and expressed its \"determination and goodwill\" in finding a common voice on the issue, its Ministry of Industry and Trade said in a statement on Thursday (Jun 5). The ministry did not disclose what it had proposed to Washington. Vietnam has been slapped with 46 per cent \"reciprocal\" tariffs by the Trump administration. Though they have been paused until July, if they come into effect they could seriously undermine a growth model that relies on exports to the US, its top market. The statement came as Vietnamese trade minister Nguyen Hong Dien and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer met in Paris to prepare for the third round of negotiations for a trade agreement between the two countries, scheduled to take place before the end of next week, the ministry said. The Trump administration wanted countries to provide their best offers on trade negotiations by Wednesday as officials sought to accelerate talks with multiple partners ahead of a self-imposed deadline in just five weeks, according to a draft letter to negotiating partners seen by Reuters. \"The two ministers agreed to speed up the negotiation process, focusing maximum efforts to achieve the best results in the third round of negotiations,\" the Vietnam trade ministry statement said.

(Photo: Orang Laut SG) This audio is generated by an AI tool. To celebrate Singapore's indigenous islander heritage, Orang Laut SG is launching its firstHari Orang Pulaufestival on Jun 14. It will be held at West Coast Park from 10am to 9pm with performances, film screenings and even activities such as learning how to catch fish. Organised with support from the National Heritage Board, the one-day event–which means \"Islander Day\" in Malay–was envisioned as a celebration of culture, heritage and the stories of Singapore’s Orang Pulau, the broader term for indigenous communities who lived on the offshore islands. Thelineup of activitiesincludes cultural performances such as joget dangkung, a photo exhibition showcasing daily life out at sea,as well as workshops on traditional maritime skills led by experienced fishermen from the Orang Laut community. Participants can learn age-old techniques, such as using bubu traps and jaring (gill nets), to catch fish. Other highlights include film screenings focused on regional coastal communities, such as the 1959 film Bawang Putih, Bawang Merah; panel discussions on intercultural history and fun games and competitions. All activities are free to the public. “We want to let people in Singapore know that many of us Orang Pulau and Orang Laut are still here,” said Firdaus Sani,the founder ofOrang Laut SG,a platform dedicated to telling the stories of the indigenous people of the sea and seafaring inhabitants of Singapore’s offshore islands. These islanders not only include the Orang Laut but also other ethnic groups such as Malay, Bugis and even Chinese traders who once settled on the islands. Many of them developed unique, island-specific knowledge and skills, especially in areas like foraging and fishing. A post shared by Orang Laut SG (@oranglautsg) The 37-year-old Firdaus, who also runsThe Black Sampansocial enterprise,is an Orang Laut descendant himself. His maternal grandparents lived on Pulau Semakau until they were relocated to the mainland in 1977. Growing up, he would often visit the island with his grandparents, where he learnt about their traditions. According to Firdaus, in the 1970s, the inhabitants of five islands around Singapore would gather annually for a sports festival called Pesta 5 S–referring to the islands of Pulau Sudong, Pulau Semakau, Sekijang Bendera (now known as St John’s Island), Pulau Seking, and Pulau Seraya. One island would take turns hosting the festival every year. A post shared by Orang Laut SG (@oranglautsg) Half a century has gone by since then. Descendants of these native islanders are now scattered across Singapore and beyond. But the “jiwa orang laut” or \"the spirit of the people of the sea\" in Malay, lives on. Firdaus founded Orang Laut SG during the pandemic. In 2023, he and his team, which included fellow descendants of Orang Laut and Orang Pulau, organised an event called Panggilan Anak Pulau (Calling From Island Descendants) at The Projector. The event drew 200 to 300 attendees and offered a platform for islanders, their descendants and their supporters to connect and share stories. This year, Hari Orang Pulau is set to build on that momentum and Firdaus said he hopes it will reach a wider audience. His aim is to make it an annual affair that will contribute to ongoing conversations about Singapore's rich and layered history. “This event is for former islanders, their descendants and anyone who wants to connect with Singapore’s history and the different communities that shaped our identity,\" he said. \"Hari Orang Pulau is the start of a larger, long-term vision for the native islanders of this country, and I'm very excited to see where this event will bring us.\" Copyright© Mediacorp 2025.

    "article_text": "Singapore Singapore The 41-year-old woman is said to have lied to the school's principal and vice principal about her residential address. The State Courts building in Singapore. (File photo: CNA TODAY) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: A 41-year-old woman was charged in court on Thursday (Jun 5) with giving false information in order to enrol her daughter in a school in the north of Singapore during the Primary 1 registration in 2023. The Singaporean woman was handed one amalgamated charge of giving false information to a public servant and two counts under the National Registration Act and National Registration Regulations. She cannot be named due to a gag order imposed by the court to protect her daughter's identity. Between Jun 24 and Sep 20, 2024, the woman allegedly gave false information about her residential address to the school's principal and vice principal so that they would continue allowing her daughter to be enrolled in the school under Phase 2C of the 2023 Primary 1 registration exercise. The given address was less than 2km away from the school. During P1 registration, priority is given to Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents who live closer to the preferred school when there are more applicants than vacancies, according to the Ministry of Education. The address used for Primary 1 registration should be the child's parents' official residential address, as reflected on their NRICs. The woman's two charges under the National Registration Act and National Registration Regulations are for giving false information when she reported a change in address to a registration officer. She is said to have done so on two occasions, Jun 17, 2023 and Jul 3, 2024. On both occasions, the woman gave the same address that she provided to the school principal and vice principal. Appearing in court unrepresented, the woman said she will plead guilty and will not be engaging a lawyer. Her plead guilty mention has been fixed for Jul 18. In a parliamentary reply in 2018, the Ministry of Education said that in the last ten years, there were fewer than 10 cases of parents falsifying information for the purpose of Primary 1 registration. It added then that in cases where the parent is convicted of the charge, the child who was previously registered in a school based on false information would be transferred to another school with available vacancies. If convicted of giving false information to the registration officer, the woman may be jailed for up to two years, or fined up to S$3,000 (US$2,300), or both. If convicted of giving false information to a public servant, she may be jailed for up to two years, or fined, or both.

(Photo: REUTERS/Ann Wang) BEIJING: China's services activity expanded at a slightly faster pace in May, with new orders growing more quickly than in April, though new export orders declined due to uncertainty stemming from US tariffs, a private sector survey showed on Thursday (Jun 5). The Caixin/S&P Global services purchasing managers' index (PMI), rose to 51.1 in May from 50.7, remaining above the 50-mark that separates expansion from contraction. The reading was broadly in line with China's official survey, which showed services activity edging up to 50.2 from 50.1 the previous month. The Caixin PMI is considered a better read of trends among smaller, export-oriented firms, particularly along the east coast, while the official PMI primarily tracks large and medium-sized enterprises, including state-owned companies. China's economy grew faster than expected in the first quarter, and the government has maintained its annual growth target of around 5 per cent.

Last week authorities in Guangzhou, the capital of the southern Guangdong province, attributed a cyberattack on an unnamed technology company to the Taiwan government, saying Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party supported the \"overseas hacker organisation\" responsible. In response, Taiwan said Beijing was peddling false information, and that it was China that was carrying out hacking against the island. China views Taiwan as its own territory. Taiwan's democratically elected government rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims.

    "title": "Race for robotic supremacy: US and China battle to build world’s most advanced humanoids",
    "article_text": "World World As both Washington and Beijing push for robotics development, analysts say it is difficult to pinpoint who is in the lead. This audio is generated by an AI tool. BEIJING / SAN FRANCISCO: The battle is on between the world’s two biggest superpowers to build the most advanced humanoids. In April,a half-marathon between humans and robots– the first of its kind globally – was held in Beijing. Some of the participating humanoids, clad in running shoes, successfully crossed the finish line while others struggled from the beginning. Over in the United States, American tech giant Nvidiaheld its annual AI developer conferencein March where a range of robots were showcased, including Neo Gamma – a humanoid designed for household tasks like watering plants and vacuuming carpets. As both Washington and Beijing push for robotics development, analysts say it is difficult to pinpoint who is in the lead. Reports have named leading humanoid manufacturers as almost exclusively from both countries, such as Tesla from the US and Chinese firm Unitree Robotics. But one thing is clear – the lucrative market is shaping a new era where humans and machines co-exist in ways that were previously unimaginable. According to a report released last month by Morgan Stanley Research, the global humanoids market could surpass US$5 trillion by 2050. The report also stated that more than 1 billion humanoids could be in use by then, with China likely to have the highest number of 302.3 million, followed by the US at 77.7 million. Chinese humanoids first shot to stardom early this year when they danced on the screens of millions at the Spring Festival Gala, capturing international headlines. Manufacturers have entered mass production, aiming to produce more than 1,000 units this year with a domestic output value of about US$610 million. Much of that success is owed to its well-established supply chain, government policies and funds that helped drive the robust development of the robotics sector. China had 451,700 smart robotics firms by the end of 2024, marking a staggering 206 per cent increase from 2020, according to official data. \"This sort of advancement and progress, it sort of reflects a mix of public private cooperation in China that's supported by its world class and high value STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) talent pool, as well as decades-long and mature manufacturing infrastructure,” said Ray Wang, a Washington-based analyst focusing on the US-China technology competition and the semiconductor industry in Asia. He also pointed to China’s growing train of entrepreneurship and innovation in advanced technology, which he said would facilitate a lot of innovation. The momentum continued at this year’s annual Zhongguancun tech forum held in Beijing, where robots took centre stage. Set against the backdrop of the trade war with the US, manufacturers were keen to show off their mechanical inventions. These included Qingfei Technologies’ Nia – the forum’s customer service robot powered by AI. The company’s CEO Wei Yufei told CNA that she hopes robots can take over some service-related roles from humans, such as in education or even emotional companionship. Analysts said they are optimistic about the future for robotics in China, especially as the country faces increasing societal and geopolitical challenges. Wang noted that the Chinese government saw the development of humanoid robots as a “critical solution” for structural demographic challenges, including its ageing population and declining fertility rates. “In the context of US-China strategic competition, they believe that (humanoid robots are) a frontier technology to set it as a national priority to develop,” he added. “They believe this is a thing that they really need to compete and develop in a competition with the United States.\" In the US, Tesla CEO Elon Musk earlier announced plans to produce about 5,000 units of its humanoid robot Optimus this year. Both Tesla and Nvidia, the world’s largest chipmaker by revenue, have touted robots as the next big thing. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang claimed earlier this year that humanoid robots are less than five years away from seeing wide use in manufacturing facilities. In his keynote speech in March at Nvidia’s GPU Technology Conference in San Jose, Huang said “the time has come for robots”. “Physical AI and robotics are moving so fast. Everybody pay attention to this space. This could very well likely be the largest industry of all,” he added. Other major players like Microsoft, Google and OpenAI have waded in as well, but they are not the only ones. US-based startup Figure AI announced in February that it secured US$675 million in funding from some of the biggest names in tech, including Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. The company aims to build the world’s first commercially viable humanoid worker. Another US-based startup - 1X Technologies, which is behind the Neo humanoid robot – said it aims to “solve a lot of the problems we have today” in relation to labour shortages. “That journey starts in the home,” said the company’s CEO and founder Bernt Bornich. “Competition is important, because I hope that if we have this interview in five years, we're still ahead, and the world will look very different, and hopefully we can all help each other just move the field.” Analysts said that China and the US have both been making strides in the field, making it tough to say definitively who is at the forefront. Bob O’Donnell, president and chief analyst at market research firm TECHnalysis Research, said China has seen a lot more development of raw components and other elements like motors and sensors. “On the other hand, in the US, we've seen a lot of software development over the last several years,” he added. “And this market is evolving very quickly, because we started out with industrial robots and robotic arms for manufacturing and things like that. And we're rapidly deploying that, taking some of that technology, and obviously putting it in humanoids.” However, matters have become more complicated amid the current geopolitical climate, with the US having imposed sweeping tariffs on imported goods as well as semiconductor export controls on China. Even though this could impede collaboration, experts said humanoid development is set to continue. “A lot of these technological advancements are being replicated very quickly - somebody makes an advancement here, and it happens there,” noted O’Donnell. “There's a phrase that a lot of people say: It takes a village. Well, it takes an entire world to help build these robotics.” Subscribe to CNA’s Morning Brief An automated curation of our top stories to start your day.

    "title": "'Wicked: For Good' Trailer: Toto, We’re Not at Shiz Anymore",
    "article_text": "Ozians, it’s almost time to follow the yellow brick road again.Wicked: For Good—the second film adaptation of the beloved Broadway musical, once again starringCynthia ErivoandAriana Grande—soars into theaters on November 21, 2025. AndVanity Fairhas your exclusive first look at all thingsElphaba and Glindaahead of the trailer’s release. “I can’t believe we’re here. That’s crazy to me,” saysJon M. Chu,logging on to Zoom as “Chutanium 2.0.” TheWickeddirector can hardly contain his excitement. “What’s nice about movie two is it’s so different from movie one that it doesn’t feel like we’re talking about what you just saw. It’s the new chapter.” Chu knows he’s got some big ruby slippers to continue to fill. Inspired by the musical of the same name, which was based, in turn, on the novel byGregory Maguire,the firstWickedfilm was botha critical darlinganda commercial behemoth. It quickly became the all-time highest-grossing film adaptation of a Broadway musical, scoring 10 Oscar nominations, including nods for both Grande and Erivo. It ultimately took home Oscars for costume and production design, as well as a Golden Globe for cinematic and box office achievement. “I think we always had the bar very high for us,” Chu says. “Thank God, because the alternative universe was not a fun one to be living in. I’m glad I’m in this multiverse.” SinceWickedtackled act one of the Broadway musical,Wicked: For Goodtakes on the second act, which covers a period years after Elphaba and Glinda’s decision to part ways. Elphaba, now an enemy of the state of Oz, has taken to the western skies and the woods, while Glinda has become a public figure controlled by the Wizard (Jeff Goldblum) and Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh). “Our heart was broken when Glinda can’t make the choice that we want her to so badly at the end of movie one, and it feels empowering for Elphaba to fly away from society,” Chu says. “In movie two, we get to see the consequences of those choices. The temperature is up.” AlthoughFor Goodfinds the witches in a very different stage of life, Chu shot part one and part two simultaneously in the UK. “A lot of movie two was shot before some of the stuff in movie one,” Chu says. This forced Erivo and Grande to do some serious work to plot out the time jumps. “We had big boards with what timeline we’d be in, and they had notes all over their script so we could all be in sync of where we’re at,” he says. Rather than getting whiplash, the stars handled the time shifts like the pros they are. Chu likens the process of editingFor Goodto delving into a time capsule, and teases that some aspects of the sequel will shed light on choices made in part one. “Things that you may have noticed in movie one, you’ll see why those things are there,” he says. “It is designed to be seen big and felt deeply.” Finding actors who could handle all ofWicked’s sprawling story was paramount for Chu. “Casting-wise, we had to have people who could handle both sides of Galinda, both sides of Elphaba,” he says. “You can do the fun Shiz version of these characters, but can you go to the next level? Can you land the plane? This plane is big, and the world is big.” In other words: Toto, we’re not at Shiz anymore. Or as Chu puts it: “Kids gonna grow up.” Cynthia Erivo, Ariana Grande, and Jon M. Chu on the set ofWicked: For Good Of course, part of the magic ofWickedisStephen Schwartz’s indelible score. The first act has many of the musical’s most popular songs—including “Defying Gravity,” “The Wizard and I,” “Popular” itself, and “What Is This Feeling?”—but Chu has a message for those less familiar with the second half of the score: “There are some bangers.” He name-checks the act two opener, “Thank Goodness,” and “For Good,” which gives part two its name. “‘No Good Deed’ is just a fucking banger,” he adds, blushing at his own foul language. “I don’t even know how to use safe words for that. Cynthia on that thing is just ridiculous. And ‘As Long as You’re Mine’—it’s just gorgeous.” And a few surprises are also in store. “I think it’s been reported we have two new songs,” he says. (Oh yes,it has.) But Chu stumbles a bit in trying to describe those tunes, written by originalWickedcomposer Schwartz, without giving too much away. “They’re great additions to this movie. They were necessary in this movie to help tell the story,” he says finally. “To have Stephen Schwartz back behind the keys—it’s pretty extraordinary to watch him work.” Chu also givesVFmore details about the fateful night that he, Erivo, Grande, and Schwartz met for the first time after the two stars were cast. “When we first met, the girls came to my house in person and sang ‘For Good’ on my piano,” he says. “The other half of the story that we never tell is that Stephen played their songs for them for the first time there as well.” (Yes, each witch will receive her own new number—“I think I can say that,” says Chu.) “He’s sitting there, and he is like, ‘Would you guys like to hear the songs I’m thinking of for you?’ And they were like, ‘Yes, please.’” In the trailer, you can hear Erivo trill a snippet of a melody that will be thrillingly unfamiliar to anyWickedsuperfan. Might it come from one of the new songs? Chu won’t say. In the trailer, we also see Grande’s Glinda in a white wedding dress, potentially walking down the aisle to meetJonathan Bailey’s Winkie prince, Fiyero—something that never happens in the stage musical. (Remember: Glinda calls Fiyero her “fiancé” during “Thank Goodness”—not her husband.) Is a wedding in store for Grande’s character? “It’s life or death for all of them, so a wedding seemed appropriate,” Chu says. He also hints at Glinda’s relationship with Fiyero and friendship with Elphaba, and how a wedding might up the ante for all parties involved. “It’s harder to forgive certain things in certain scenarios,” he says. “It makes it more complicated.” Grande as Glinda inWicked: For Good And then there’s Elphaba. The trailer shows her in the forest, casting spells. “I think anyone who knows the second act of the show wants a bit more of what Elphaba has been through,” Chu says. “It felt right to see what it feels like to lead that life, to ultimately go into ‘No Good Deed’ and decide, You know what? If they want me to be wicked, I will be wicked. What kind of decisions does she make when she’s not within the Emerald City, or participating in society as usual? We get to see her rebel base…. We go there.” Oh, and if you liked Elphaba’s flying during “Defying Gravity,” hold on to your sharp black hat. “If you think Elphaba flew in movie one, in movie two, sheflies,” he says. The film also sees the more prominent arrival of another major character: Dorothy Gale. In the stage play, Dorothy is only seen as a shadow behind a scrim, but in the trailer, we see the girl and her crew walking down the yellow brick road and approaching the Wonderful Wizard of Oz. “That intersection is the place that we were first introduced into Oz,” Chu says of Dorothy. “We tread lightly, but try to make more sense of how it impacts our girls and our characters than maybe the show does.” In case change makes you nervous, Chu adds some reassurance: “We’re delicate. We’re delicate. We’re delicate.” Ultimately,Wickedisn’t about Dorothy—it’s about the enduring friendship of Elphaba and Glinda and how it shifts and changes over time. “I think the meat of whatWickedis all about happens in movie two. To me, this is why this story exists,” Chu says. “This is where our childhood dreams collide with our adult selves.” Erivo as Elphaba inWicked: For Good A few months remain before we reach the other side of the rainbow. That’s fine by Chu, who shares that he’s still doing “little tweaks here and there” onWicked: For Good.“We’re almost there. We’re inches away,” he says. “I have a couple choices of things to flip around in the timeline; I can’t quite tell. So I’m at the very last moment. They’re trying to rip the movie away from me right as we speak. I will not let it go until they rip it out of my hands.” With the success ofWicked,Chu is more aware than ever that his work on part two is under a microscope. “What I’ve learned is that people are paying attention to every frame, and we paid attention to every frame,” he says. “Usually, when you do a movie, people don’t pay attention as much as you want them to…. Thank God people care. The worst is when they don’t care about what you’re doing.” Although he appreciates viewers’ attention to detail, he’s working overtime this go-round to avoid giving his critics any ammo. “Everybody, time to step your game up,” he says ofWicked: For Good.“When we’re in VFX reviews, I’m like, ‘Guys, this is going to be a meme. So if you’re not proud of this and you don’t want to see this repeated a thousand times in your feed, then just get it right.’ It allows us to all push ourselves again and not rest on our laurels.” While he’s in the editing bay, the ladies have a press tour on which to embark. From“holding space”to theirtriumphant performance opening the 2025 Oscars, Erivo and Grande already took the culture by storm. This time, however, they’ll be going even bigger, putting on a live concert ofWickedsongs that will air on NBC, which Chu believes will be a “history-making event.” And in the meantime, the first movie is returning to theaters for one day on June 4, for all those who can’t wait till November for their nextWickedfix. “We want to finish this story in the way that this beautiful memory ofWickedcan actually come full circle and can be with you for the rest of your life,” he says. “We want you to look at both movies in the end and feel like it was one all along.” As his time in Oz winds down, Chu can’t help but reflect on how it’s changed his and so many others’ their lives. “We’re different people. I’ve had three kids,” he says, discussing developments in his life since he began his work onWicked.“The movie that we could have screwed up very quickly became a part of people’s hearts, and they became a part of ours.” An Exclusive First Look atWicked: For Good The Dizzying Rise of MAHA WarriorCalley Means, RFK Jr.’s Right-Hand Man The UnsinkableKathy Bates From RFK Jr. to Patrick Schwarzenegger, a Brief Guide tothe Kennedy Family All theCast MembersThat Might LeaveSNLThis Fall Rick Steveson Rejecting Fascism at Home and Fears of Trump Abroad Mariska Hargitay Was “Living a Lie” for 30 Years.

    "article_text": "Government is expected to release details of its test results later on Thursday, insider reveals Hong Kong authorities are under increasing pressure to verify whether the freshwater supply at a public housing estate contains bitumen, a substance banned from use in pipes, with experts calling for an investigation to trace the source of mystery black particles and determine if contractors have violated any rules. A source said the government would hold a press conference on Thursday afternoon to release more details of their test results. The water issue at two public rental and subsidised estates at Queen’s Hill in Fanling has escalated after laboratory tests commissioned by at least two media outlets detected bitumen in the supply. So far, the government has not disclosed the source, six days after residents complained about the black specks found in tap water. “Bitumen is not allowed to be used as part of the inner coating of water pipes,” Wong King, executive president of the International Institute of Utility Specialists, said during a radio programme. He also said that the incident was not normal, urging authorities to trace the origin of the bitumen and whether any parties had violated any rules.",

    "article_text": "Healthcare in Hong Kong should operate as a true system rather than as an inefficient, disaggregated environment with competing stakeholders Avoiding this crisis requires a transformation in cooperation between healthcare providers, insurers and health authorities, underpinned by technology integration across the whole system. Ignoring the impact of Covid-19, healthcare costs rose by 23 per cent in the five years to 2023, with taxpayer-funded costs increasing from 50 per cent of the total to 52 per centand out-of-pocket costs averaging 30 per cent of total spending for that period. Government healthcare spending grew by 28 per cent, and insurance funding has not reduced the burden on taxpayers and out-of-pocket costs. Relative contributions to healthcare funding from private and employer-based insurance schemes have not grown meaningfully in the past five years, averaging 17 per cent of total spending. Health insurers are struggling with profitability because of inflation in medical costs, leading them to increase premiums. This constrains the take-up of private insurance, adding a new dimension to the sustainability problem.",

    "article_text": "President Donald Trump claimed Elon Musk \"had no problem\" with the bill; the billionaire says he never saw it before it was passed. Democrats are moving to embrace former Department of Government Efficiency leader Elon Musk as he publicly spats with PresidentDonald Trump, despite many party voters and lawmakers railing against Musk for months as a \"fascist\" or \"dictator\" for taking a hatchet to the federal government's overspending and fraud within the Trump administration. \"If Biden had a big supporter criticize him, Trump would have hugged him the next day,\" Democrat California Rep. Ro Khanna posted to X on Thursday of Musk's criticisms of the \"big, beautiful bill.\" \"When we refused to meet with @RobertKennedyJr, Trump embraced him & won. We can be the party of sanctimonious lectures, or the party of FDR that knows how to win & build a progressive majority.\" Khanna told Politicoon Wednesday that Democrats should \"ultimately be trying to convince [Musk] that the Democratic Party has more of the values that he agrees with.\" WHITE HOUSE STANDS BY TAX BILL AFTER MUSK CALLS IT A 'DISGUSTING ABOMINATION' \"A commitment to science funding, a commitment to clean technology, a commitment to seeing international students like him,\" he added.

Ritchie Torres told the outlet on Wednesday, \"I’m a believer in redemption, and he is telling the truth about the legislation.\" Torres said Musk has \"done an enormous amount of damage\" and \"there are Democrats who see his decimation of the federal workforce and the federal government as an unforgivable sin.\" \"Couldn’t agree with Elon more: kill the bill,\"Jon Favreau,who served as former director of speech writing for former President Barack Obama, posted to X in response to Musk calling on lawmakers to \"kill\" the legislation. JONATHAN TURLEY WARNS DEMOCRATS 'SHREDDING' THEIR OWN BELIEFS WITH 'DANGEROUS' ANTI-MUSK CAMPAIGN Musk is in the midst of publicly trading barbs with Trump over the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which is sweeping legislation currently making its way through Congress and aims to fund the president's agenda. \"I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore,\" Musk posted to X on Tuesday. \"This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.\" In addition to Democrats who don't support the bill, Musk has also found himself aligned with members of the House Freedom Caucus, which is considered the most conservative voting bloc within the lower chamber, as well as staunch fiscal conservatives in the Senate, such as Republicans Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and Wisconsin Sen. Ron. Johnson, who have publicly rebuked the legislation.

Many also took issue with Musk on inauguration day for delivering what dozens of media outlets described as a \"Nazi-style salute\" to Trump supporters. \"If you’re cool and want to defend the ‘Sieg Heils’ and the Nazi salutes … whatever you want to do, that’s on you,\" Democrat New York Rep.

I’m not with the Nazis.\" Hundreds protest outside a Tesla showroom to show their disapproval of Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency.(Michael Nigro/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images) \"I never imagined we would see the day when what appears to be a Heil Hitler salute would be made behind the Presidential seal,\" New York Rep.Jerry Nadler tweeted in January. \"This abhorrent gesture has no place in our society and belongs in the darkest chapters of human history. I urge all of my colleagues to unite in condemning this hateful gesture for what it is: antisemitism.\" \"He's incompetent. He's a thief. He's a Nazi. And people don't trust him,\" former Democrat New York Rep. Jamaal Bowman said of Musk in March. \"He’s a Nazi nepo baby who breaks everything he touches,\" Massachusetts Democrat Rep. Ayanna Pressley said in February as Musk announced cuts to the federal government via DOGE. \"And right now he’s locked himself in a room with grandpa’s Social Security check.\" Massachusetts Sen.

Musk, since stepping down from his DOGE role in May after his 130 predetermined days as a special government employee ended, ramped up his criticism of the bill on Wednesday, including encouraging lawmakers to \"kill the bill.\" On Thursday, Trump directly addressed Musk's comments, saying in an Oval Office meeting with the chancellor of Germany that he was \"disappointed\"by Musk's attackson the legislation and said he was unsure how their friendly relationship would fare through the criticisms. Trump added that Musk's disapproval of the bill was allegedly tied to its cuts to electrical vehicle mandates. Musk is the CEO of electric vehicle company Tesla. MUSK SAYS TRUMP WOULD HAVE LOST 2024 ELECTION WITHOUT HIM AS 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' FEUD CONTINUES \"I'm very disappointed because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here, better than you people.

    "article_text": "Netanyahu accused French President Emmanuel Macron, U.K. Prime Minister Kier Starmer and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney of siding with Hamas. Credit: Roi Avraham (GPO) / Sound credit: Nir Sharf (GPO) Israel is facinga deepening political crisis that could soon bring down Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition, as one of its key ultra-Orthodox partners threatens to leave the government and back an opposition-led motion to dissolve parliament next week.  In a dramatic escalation on Thursday, the Council of Torah Scholars today instructed the Agudat Yisrael party to submit its own bill to dissolve the Knesset. Recent Israeli opinion polls indicate that Netanyahu's coalition would likely lose power if elections were held today. The crisis centers on long-standing tensions over military conscription exemptions for ultra-Orthodox (Haredi) men. While most Israelis are required to serve – three years for men, two for women – Haredi men have long been granted exemptions, a policy increasingly seen as untenable amid theongoing war in Gaza. TRUMP ADMIN STANDS BY ISRAEL, REJECTS UN RESOLUTION BACKED BY UK AND FRANCE Protesters in Tel Aviv after the bodies of six hostages were returned to Israel. Sept. 1, 2024.(Reuters/Florion Goga) Haaretz political correspondent Amir Tibon said, \"The real crisis shaking Netanyahu’s coalition isn’t just religion versus state – it’s the war in Gaza, and who will be forced to fight it. Discrimination against those who serve in the military is one of the few issues that unites a vast majority of Israelis – and they want it to end.\" According to IDFestimates, there are approximately 60,000 ultra-Orthodox men of conscription age. \"The crisis stems from theOctober 7 massacre,\" said Amit Segal, political correspondent for Israel’s Channel 12. \"Before the war, many Israelis already resented Haredi draft exemptions. Now, with the IDF short on soldiers, that anger has reached a boiling point.\" Segal said Netanyahu’s coalition is currently eyeing Oct. 21, 2025, as a possible election date, but warned that if the ultra-Orthodox parties leave, early elections could become inevitable. \"It’s unlikely the ultra-Orthodox parties will topple the government – they’re in their ideal coalition,\" he stated. \"But if they do leave, elections in October are likely.\" IDF forces are seen operating in Rafah, a city in the Gaza Strip.(IDF Spokesman's Office) In March, Israel’s Supreme Court ruled that the draft exemptions were unconstitutional and ordered the government to resolve the issue. But Netanyahu’s coalition – which relies heavily on the 18 seats held by the ultra-Orthodox parties Shas and United Torah Judaism – remains split. The Haredi parties are demanding new legislation that would enshrine the exemptions in law. Without it, they threaten to quit. ISRAELI AMBASSADOR LASHES OUT AT UN OFFICIAL, CONDEMNS UK, FRANCE, CANADA STATEMENT ON AID If those parties walk, Netanyahu’s coalition could collapse, Segal explained, \"The prime minister has seven weeks until the Knesset enters a months-long recess and will fight to survive until then. But with a bill to dissolve the Knesset set to be presented next week, there’s no guarantee he’ll reach July 27 as prime minister.\" Dozens of protesters stage a demonstration inside Jerusalem's ultra-Orthodox Mea Shearim neighborhood, calling for the community to be drafted to the IDF.(Eyal Warshavsky/SOPA Images/Sipa USA/Sipa via AP Images) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The bill, introduced by opposition party Yesh Atid, led by former Prime Minister Yair Lapid, is set for a vote on June 11. It needs 61 votes to pass – a number that could be reached if even a few coalition members defect. Meanwhile, former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has announced a political comeback with a new party, tentatively called \"Bennett 2026.\" Israeli media polls suggest Bennett would win 24 to 28 seats if elections were held today, overtaking Netanyahu’s Likud, which is projected to receive only 19 to 22 seats.

    "article_text": "Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs Spokesperson Oren Marmorstein says Hamas is \"extremely afraid\" that the new humanitarian aid initiative could cause the terror group \"to lose its grip\" on the people of Gaza. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a U.S. andIsraeli-backed group, has been the subject of backlash since before it began distributing aid last month. Since the beginning of its operations there have been reports of violent incidents near distribution sites. Recently, the IDF admitted that troops shot \"suspects\" who failed to heed orders to back away from the soldiers. One of the most vocal critics of GHF has been the United Nations, with U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Tom Fletcher urging the world to let his agency handle the situation. However, Israeli officials have pushed back on the U.N. narrative, saying that GHF is distributing aid without letting Hamas benefit.

Marmorstein blamed Hamas for spreading \"fake news\" and \"fake information\" to take down the GHF. On Wednesday, the U.S. vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution that called for an immediate ceasefire, the return of all hostages and the lifting of all restrictions on humanitarian aid entering the Strip. Israel has repeatedly asserted that without limitations on aid entering Gaza, Hamas would be able to enrich itself and keep control over the area. In remarks ahead of the veto, U.S. Chargé d’Affaires Dorothy Shea criticized the resolution, saying it failed to \"acknowledge the disastrous shortcomings of the prior method of aid delivery, which allowed Hamas to enrich itself at the expense of Palestinians, and failed to get food and water to those who needed it most.\" The United States again vetoes a U.N.

    "title": "Germany's Merz to 'adapt' to Trump during high-stakes meeting on tariffs, defense",
    "article_text": "President Trump welcomes the German leader to DC to discuss top issues including tariffs and trade. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is set to meet with PresidentDonald Trumpon Thursday as major geopolitical issues ranging from war in Europe, the Middle East and massive trade disputes are expected to be discussed. Germanyand the Trump administration, both during his first term and again upon re-election, have butted heads with both sides expressing public frustration with one another. But recentpositive chatsbetween Merz and Trump suggest the meeting on Thursday will remain cordial as Berlin looks to make headway when it comes to lifting Trump’s 25% tariff on imported vehicles and parts, as well as the existing 10% tariff on all goods, which was temporarily lowered from 20% earlier this year.

Nations like France and the U.K. have successfully toed the line when it comes to maintaining a relationship with Washington under the Trump presidency, while also drastically expanding relations to decrease future dependence on the U.S. Germany’s Merz is also expected to attempt to strike this balance – a strategy he said he had already begun working on when speaking with German media earlier this week.

But despite efforts to bolster relations with Trump from afar, Oval Office meetings with the president are anything but predictable, as witnessed by theexplosive interactionduring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s February visit, as well as when the president accused South African President Cyril Ramaphosa’s government of committing \"genocide\" last month, though no party in South Africa, including the party that represents the Afrikaners, have substantiated these claims.

While Germany does spend more than 2% of its GDP on defense,Merz has backedthe call to spend up to 5%, and he could use this to rally Trump to increase his support for Kyiv, and push for greater European involvement in future peace talks.

Kathy Hochul’s office is the daughter of a former Chinese journalist whose archived biography says he worked for the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) \"Education Department of the News Bureau of the Central Propaganda Department\" as a deputy director and served in multiple leadership roles at state-run media outlets, a Fox News Digital investigation found. Fan Xiaojiang, or Elaine, is currently serving as the chief of staff for Democrat Scott Stringer’s mayoral campaign and has been involved in Democrat politics in New York for more than a decade, including serving as Hochul’s director of Asian affairs between October 2021 and November 2023,according to her Linkedin profile. Thelatest campaign finance filingshows that she has been paid more than $120,000 by the Stringer campaign since last August. Stringer's campaign declined to comment for this story. Fan, who is originally from Beijing, was recognized by the City University of Hong Kong’s Centre for Communication Research in a 2021 press release promoting her role in the Hochul administration. The press release called her an \"alumnus\" and boasted about her being \"one of the very few Asian-American leaders who hold a senior position in the state’s government.\" BOMBSHELL REPORT SUGGESTS 'CHINESE SPIES' INFILTRATING PRESTIGIOUS US UNIVERSITY: 'WIDESPREAD CAMPAIGN' New York Gov. Kathy Hochul(AP Photo/Julia Nikhinson/File) The press release went on to quote professor Jonathan Zhu, a former supervisor, who said that \"Elaine is the third generation of a journalist’s family in China, with her grandfather and father each playing a distinguished role in the respective eras of the nation’s history.\" Fox News Digital can now exclusively confirm that this press release was referring to Fan Dongsheng, her father, and Fan Changjiang, her late grandfather. When reached for comment on whether Elaine’s father influenced her to go into the media, Zhu confirmed to Fox News Digital that Dongsheng was her father and said, \"Although I have never eyewitnessed what Fan Dongsheng told his daughter about career choice, his influence on her is obvious and imaginable.\" He went on to say that Dongsheng visited the university that his daughter attended a \"few times, including a talk to our faculty members and graduate students on his experience in launching and operating Huasheng Monthly, one of the earliest online news websites in China.\" Prior to jumping into state government in 2014 as the \"Queens Borough Director & Citywide Asian American Affairs\" for Stringer’s comptroller office, Elaine was the \"Chief Reporter\" for Ming Pao Daily News for almost a decade between 2005 and 2015, according to her Linkedin profile. A few years before she joined the media outlet, the Jamestown Foundation, a nonpartisan defense policy think tank,sounded thealarmabout the media outlet being \"heavily influenced\" by the Chinese government and revealed that sources told them that the Chinese Consulate in New York was their \"true boss.\" This would not be the first time that someone from the Fan family would work for a media outlet influenced by the Chinese government. Fan’s father served as the president and editorial director of China Press, or Qiaobao, in New York between 1999 and 2005, according to multiple archived online bios. COZY TIES BETWEEN TOP NEWSOM ALLY AND CCP OFFICIAL UNEARTHED ON NETWORKING SITE: 'SHE HELPED ME A LOT' Experts raised concerns to Fox News Digital about Elaine Fan's (third from left) ties to the CCP.(Victoria Ng/Instagram) China Press was not only designated by the State Department during President Donald Trump’s first term as \"state-backed propaganda\" and a \"foreign mission,\" but the Hoover Institution also sounded the alarm, saying in a2020reportthat the \"state-owned China News Service and the Overseas Chinese Office of the State Council dispatched editorial personnel to the United States\" to found Qiaobao. The elder Fan also served as the \"director of the Special Editorial Department of the Chinese News Agency,\" which now refers to the Xinhua News Agency, a top state-run propaganda outlet, according to the Hoover Institution. Multiple bios said he was also the deputy director of the \"Education Department of the News Bureau of the Central Propaganda Department.\" According to a Chinese government websitereviewed by Fox News Digital, the CPD is the \"organization primarily responsible for monitoring content to ensure that China's publishers, in particular its news publishers, do not print anything that is inconsistent with the Communist Party's political dogma.\" After leaving state-owned media, Dongsheng held multiple leadership roles at the Cheung Kong School of Journalism and Communication at Shantou University, a Chinese university that has sections on their website that promote the CCP \"Party Building Work\" and hosted a themed life meeting a few years ago on \"Strive like an outstanding Communist Party member\" The editor of China Brief at the Jamestown Foundation expressed deep concerns when Fox News Digital reached out about Fan’s familial ties to the CCP, saying she \"comes from an illustrious family of CCP journalists.\" \"Her grandfather was one of the more prominent propagandists of the CCP's struggles from the 1930s onwards, while her father worked for a range of party publications managed under the central propaganda department in Beijing,\" Arran Hope told Fox News Digital. \"This included a stint in the United States, where her daughter now works as chief of staff to mayoral candidate Scott Stringer, following a stint as a reporter for another party outlet here. Fan has not distanced herself from her family legacy, quite the opposite. In 2017, for example, she delivered a speech at a journalism school in the PRC (People's Republic of China) named in her grandfather's honor.\" SCHUMER SPOTTED POSING FOR PHOTO WITH CCP OFFICIAL AS WARNINGS SWIRL ABOUT CHINA INFLUENCE China's national flag(Adek Berry) \"More concerning for New York City's voters, she appears to be actively involved in the party's United Front system, which seeks to promote the party's preferences and control both within and without the PRC. She has given speeches at events organized by the PRC Consulate in New York that celebrate United Front organizations in the city,\" he continued. \"These events call for promoting reunification with Taiwan as well as advocating for the ‘motherland’ and its interests. To have somebody whom PRC diplomats clearly view favorably in such a senior role in New York politics should be cause for concern.\" Elaine Fan's late grandfather joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1939 and had leadership roles at multiple state-owned media outlets, including as the editor-in-chief of the Xinhua News Agency, deputy director of the General Administration of Information and president of the People's Daily News Agency, according to multiple bios on Baidu. In addition to her father and grandfather, Fan's uncle, Fan Xiaojian, joined the CCP in 1976 and has held multiple roles in the CCP, including as the chief economist and director of the finance department of the ministry of agriculture between 1998 and 2000. Hewas also a delegateto the 17th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and was a member of the 11th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which Fox News Digital previously reported was \"designed to liaise with non-Communist Party members – and ultimately see them work with the CCP to advance its interests,\" according to a 2021 report from The Diplomat. During her tenure in the Hochul administration, Elaine attended several events hosted by the Chinese Consulate in New York City and multiple groups that make up China's United Front, which works to \"co-opt and neutralize sources of potential opposition to the policies and authority of its ruling,\"according toa U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission report.

She also attended an event called \"An Evening of Chinese Culture\" hosted by the New York Mets and Sino-American Friendship Association in 2023, which received backlash. According to an August 2022 op-ed from the Washington Post’s deputy opinion editor, \"China experts have identified\" SAFA as \"being involved in United Front work – a global effort to propagandize on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party.\" In 2021, Hochul gave a shout-out to Fan while announcing that Chinatown was a $20 Million New York City region winner for revitalization, saying she \"forgot to mention Elaine Fan is now my Director of Asian Affairs.\" She then told the crowd to \"Make sure you get to know Elaine Fan as well.\" Hudson Institute Fellow Michael Sobolik spoke to Fox News Digital about the totality of Fan's links to the CCP, saying, \"This isn't complicated.\" \"If Elaine Fan ever worked for CCP-controlled state media, she shouldn’t be welcome in U.S. electoral politics. If Scott Stringer lacks discernment to insulate a campaign from potential vectors of CCP influence, how can he protect New York City from that malign influence in public office?\" In September 2023, Chinese Consul General Huang Ping in New York hosted a reception at the consulate to celebrate the 74th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, which included several officials, including Fan, whodelivered remarksat the reception. Hochul’s ties to Elaine Fan aren’t the first time that her office has faced scrutiny over concerns about CCP influence. Hochul faced backlash last year after it was revealed that her former deputy chief of staff, Linda Sun, was indicted on charges of \"violating and conspiring to violate the Foreign Agents Registration Act, visa fraud, alien smuggling, and money laundering conspiracy,\" according to a Department of Justice press release in September. Chinese President Xi Jinping(Ju Peng/Xinhua via Getty Images/File) Sun’s lawyers have repeatedly denied the charges, but the indictment revealed some damning communications between Sun and Huang Ping, who left his role as the consul general of the New York City Chinese consulate weeks after the indictment against Sun was announced. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fox News Digital hasextensively reportedon Ping, who was spotted making visits to top universities, speaking with elected officials and carousing with top media outlets despite his long history of pushing CCP narratives and publicly denying human rights violations against China's Uyghur population. The unsealed indictment revealed that a speechwriter for then-Lt. Gov. Hochul wanted to mention the \"Uyghur situation\" in China for her 2021 Lunar New Year message, but the plight of the minority group being persecuted by the Chinese government was ultimately omitted after Sun overruled the speechwriter. The indictment says Sun revealed to Ping what the speechwriter wanted to include but insisted that she would not let her boss mention Uyghurs after admitting that she was \"starting to lose her temper\" with the speechwriter. Ping appeared to chalk up the speechwriter’s suggestion as a clueless American who had never visited China and that U.S.-China relations could \"sour\" because of \"people like the speechwriter,\" the indictment said, prompting Sun to concur that the speechwriter had never visited China. Ping would go on to post Hochul’s Lunar New Year message days later on his Facebook page, which did not mention Uyghurs.

    "title": "Would Donald Trump have won the 2024 presidential election without Elon Musk's help?",
    "article_text": "'America Reports' co-anchors Sandra Smith and John Roberts have the latest on the response from the White House. As the once-strong alliance between PresidentDonald Trumpand billionaire Elon Musk rapidly disintegrates, the two titans are not only trading fire over the president's \"big, beautiful\" tax cuts and spending bill. Trump and Musk, who spent the first four months of the president's second administration as a special White House advisor steering the recently created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), are also blasting each other over which one of them should get the credit for Trump's decisive 2024 election victory. The president, speaking with reporters Thursday, argued, \"I think I would have won\" even without Musk's help on the campaign trail last year. Musk, the world's richest personand the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, went all in for Trump last summer and autumn. MUSK UNLEASHES EPSTEIN CLAIM AGAINST TRUMP AFTER BEING BOOTED FROM DOGE Elon Musk receives a golden key from President Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C., May 30, 2025, on his last day as a special advisor to the president.(Reuters/Nathan Howard) He endorsed the GOP presidential nominee in July right after the assassination attempt against Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania. Musk became the top donor of the2024 election cycle, dishing out nearly $300 million in support of Trump's bid through America PAC, a Trump-aligned super PAC. Much of the money was used for get-out-the-vote efforts and ads in the crucial battleground states as Trump and Kamala Harris faced off for the presidency. TRUMP SAYS HE'S ‘VERY DISAPPOINTED IN MUSK FOR OPPOSING ’BIGGEST TAX CUTS IN HISTORY' Musk concentrated much of his efforts on Pennsylvania. He joined Trump for the first time on the campaign trail at an Oct. 5 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, then held five town halls in the Keystone State later in October. Tesla CEO Elon Musk jumps on stage Oct. 5, 2024, as he joins Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump during a campaign rally at the site of an assassination attempt on Trump in Butler, Pa.(Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images) And Musk set up a war room of sorts in Pittsburgh. Trump, mentioning how Musk campaigned for him in Pennsylvania, pointed to his White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, who was co-chair of Trump's 2024 campaign. The president noted that \"Susie would say I would have won Pennsylvania easily anyway.\" Musk, apparently watching Trump's comments in real time, quickly fired back on X, which Musk renamed after buying Twitter. \"Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would controlthe Houseand the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,\" Musk wrote. \"Such ingratitude.\" MUSK-TRUMP 'BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL FEUD SPIRALS OUT OF CONTROL Tom Eddy, the GOP chairman in Erie County, a longtime crucial swing county in northwestern Pennsylvania, told Fox News that Musk \"helped Trump significantly. I really think so. He had money and he had a name.\" But Eddy added that \"my gut feeling would be that Trump is basically saying, ‘Look. I won the election. These people helped me, but I won.’ That's what he's trying to bring across.\" Veteran Republican strategist John Brabender, who served as a media consultant to the 2024 Trump campaign, told Fox News Digital that \"Elon and many others played an important role in helping the president win states all across America.\" \"But the bottom line is there’s only one constant and one person who is most responsible, by far, and that’s President Trump. That’s who people voted for,\" Brabender added. Longtime Republican consultant Dave Carney, a veteran of numerous GOP presidential campaigns over the past few decades, said the president and Musk are both right. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Carney, who steered Preserve America, another top-spending Trump-aligned super PAC, told Fox News that Trump \"might have won without the help, but you can't underestimate how important that help was.\" Pointing to Preserve America, Musk's America PAC and MAGA Inc, which was the main Trump-aligned super PAC, Carney said they all deserved \"a tremendous amount of credit\" and \"just made it easier\" for Trump to sweep all seven battleground states and win the White House. Carney also highlighted the Musk-aligned super PAC's \"unprecedented field effort, mail and other communications … to turn out these low-propensity Trump voters.\" Paul Steinhauser is a politics reporter based in the swing state of New Hampshire.

    "title": "Trump travel ban 2.0 is built to survive court challenges, experts say",
    "article_text": "State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss President Donald Trump implementing a travel ban on several countries and signing a proclamation restricting foreign students at Harvard. PresidentDonald Trump’s sweeping new travel ban may prove more legally durable than its 2017 predecessor as immigration advocates prepare for a likely court battle they’re not expected to win. Trump’s latest travel ban expands on the policy he imposed during his first term targeting seven Muslim-majority nations, a measure the Supreme Court upheld in a 5-4 ruling. Like its predecessor, the new order relies on the same immigration statutes but may rest on firmer legal ground this time. Attorney Neama Rahmani, a California-based former federal prosecutor who specializes in immigration, told Fox News Digital he anticipated thatimmigrationrights groups would likely sue over Trump's new order. \"But they’ll lose,\" he said, because \"it’s stronger than the last ban.\" TRUMP BANS TRAVEL TO US FROM SEVERAL COUNTRIES TO ‘BLOCK DANGEROUS FOREIGN ACTORS’ Donald Trump speaks during a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Fla., on Dec. 16, 2024.(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) Rahmani pointed to allegations that the last ban violated religious liberties because it singled out Muslims. This new one included \"all sorts of countries,\" Rahmani said. Trump imposed full or partial bans on 19 countries in his new proclamation, including Muslim-majority countries like Afghanistan and Iran but also non-Muslim-majority countries like Haiti, Venezuela, Eritrea and Burundi. \"You don't have Trump saying that he's imposing a Muslim ban. Those words during the campaign, and even after he was elected, were used against him,\" Rahmani said, adding that the Supreme Court is also \"slightly different\" and a \"better audience\" for Trump this time around. The 5-4 split in Trump v. Hawaii fell along ideological lines and came before Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh, both Trump appointees, were confirmed to the bench. Although theSupreme Courthas historically given presidents wide latitude over foreign policy and national security, in 2017 the dissenting justices argued the ban amounted to unjustified religious animus disguised as national security. \"The Court’s decision … leaves undisturbed a policy first advertised openly and unequivocally as a 'total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States' because the policy now masquerades behind a façade of national-security concerns,\" the dissent read. SUPREME COURT TO DEBATE TRUMP RESTRICTIONS ON BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP AND ENFORCEMENT OF NATIONWIDE INJUNCTIONS Activists protest on the anniversary of the Supreme Court's ruling upholding the Trump administration's restriction on travel to the U.S. from predominantly Muslim countries, June 26, 2019, in Washington, D.C.(Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images) Democrat lawmakers and immigration rights critics have argued that Trump's new proclamation is rooted in bigotry. Sarah Mehta, deputy director of policy and government affairs for immigration at the American Civil Liberties Union, told Fox News Digital in a statement that she believed it was designed to \"further eviscerate lawful immigration pathways under the false guise of national security.\" \"We saw the chaos that ensued from the first Trump administration’s Muslim ban, and this executive order will only build on that reign of terror to target people solely based on their nationality or religious beliefs,\" Mehta said. Trump said in his proclamation that the restrictions were necessary to prevent terrorist attacks and mitigate other public safety risks because the countries had unreliable screening and vetting processes. Additionally, some had a high occurrence of visa overstays or were uncooperative when it came to accepting their citizens back from the United States, Trump said. Ilya Somin, who is one of the attorneys challenging Trump’s sweeping tariffs in the U.S. Court of International Trade, wrote in anop-edthat it would be \"nearly impossible to challenge this new travel ban on the grounds that it is motivated by ethnic or other bigotry\" because of the Supreme Court’s prior ruling. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Somin floated the possibility of challenging the ban on other grounds, including the nondelegation doctrine, which puts limits on how much power Congress can transfer to the executive branch. He noted as an example that two courts have thus far shunned the president’s attempts to bypass Congress and take tariffs into his own hands. However, Somin conceded that the travel ban presents a higher hurdle than the tariffs case. While the Constitution explicitly gives Congress power over tariffs, Somin said, it \"does not clearly\" say which branch of government has jurisdiction over immigration restrictions.

Former President Joe Biden's personal doctor is being subpoenaed to testify amid allegations of a cover-up of his cognitive decline during his term in theWhite House. Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Committee, is compelling Dr. Kevin O’Connor to appear for a deposition on June 27. The subpoena is part of the investigation into the cover-up of Biden’scognitive declineand potentially unauthorized issuance of sweeping pardons and other executive actions.

Comer recently requested O'Connor to voluntarily appear for a transcribed interview, but the doctor refused, according to the subpoena. Previously, the White House blockedthe doctorfrom appearing for a separate interview to discuss Biden's medical assessments and \"involvement in the Biden family’s influence peddling racket, but the Biden White House blocked his testimony,\" a committee news release states. \"Among other subjects, the Committee expressed its interest in whether your financial relationship with the Biden family affected your assessment of former President Biden’s physical and mental fitness to fulfill his duties as President,\" the subpoena states. \"Given your connections with the Biden family,3 the Committee sought to understand if you contributed to an effort to hide former President Biden’s fitness to serve from the American people.\" LONE BIDEN OFFICIAL BREAKS SILENCE ON COGNITIVE DECLINE AS CABINET STAYS MUTE President Joe Biden walks along the Colonnade at the White House in Washington, D.C., with his physician, Dr. Kevin O'Connor, on Aug. 28, 2023.(Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP) Biden's health and mental state were frequent concerns while he was in office, but have been heavily scrutinized following his departure from the White House after his recent prostate cancer diagnoses. He received clean bills of health while serving as president, according to O'Connor's annual reports on the president's state of health. O'Connor has overseen Biden's health since 2009 and built a close relationship with the president and his family, Fox News Digital previously reported. \"I have never had a better commander than Joe Biden,\" O’Connor said in a profile interview with his alma mater,New York Institute of Technology Collegeof Osteopathic Medicine, when Biden served as vice president. \"All politics aside, he approaches his craft with such honor. He’s 100 percent ‘family first.’ He’s ‘genuinely genuine.’\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP He remained out of the spotlight during Biden's tenure until the spring of 2024, when speculation mounted among both conservatives and Democrats that the president's mental acuity was slipping, with pundits and the media subsequently demanding to hear directly from O'Connor on the state of Biden's health.

USA Todayran an article on Wednesday with the headline, \"Boulder suspect’s daughter dreamed of studying medicine. Now she faces deportation.\" The article’s subheading said Soliman’s teenage daughter, Habiba Soliman, \"moved to the U.S. hoping to study medicine\" but \"then her father, Mohamed Soliman, was charged with a hate crime in an attack aimed at peaceful Jewish demonstrators.\" After intense criticism online, the outlet appears to have changed the article’s headline to now read, \"Habiba Soliman wanted to be a doctor.

    "article_text": "Fox News host Jesse Watters gives his take on the DOJ announcing an investigation into former President Joe Biden’s alleged use of an ‘autopen’ on ‘Jesse Watters Primetime.’ Former PresidentJoe Bidenonly signed one pardon by hand during his final weeks in office, and it was his most controversial one. The Justice Departmentis reviewing the list of people granted pardons by Biden amid new concerns about his use of an autopen to automatically sign documents and concerns about his state of mind and mental acuity in his final months in office. Biden used his final weeks as commander in chief to grant clemency and pardon more than 1,500 people in what his White House described as the largest single-day act of clemency by a U.S. president. HERE ARE BIDEN'S MOST CONTROVERSIAL PARDONS, MAINLY SIGNED USING AUTOPEN Biden appears to have signed those final pardons, including preemptive pardons for members of his family, Dr. Anthony Fauci, Gen. Mark Milley and members and staff of the House committee investigating Jan. 6. But the former president signed one by hand for his son. Biden pardoned his son Hunter in December 2024 after vowing to the American people for months he would not do so. Hunter Biden was found guilty of three felony gun offenses during special counsel David Weiss’ investigation. The first son was also charged with federal tax crimes over his alleged failure to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes. Before his trial, Hunter Biden entered a surprise guilty plea. Former President Biden in December 2024 announced a blanket pardon that applies to any offenses against the U.S. that Hunter Biden \"has committed or may have committed\" from Jan. 1, 2014, to Dec. 1, 2024. \"From the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department’s decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted,\" the former president said. \"There has been an effort to break Hunter — who has been five and a half years sober, even in the face of unrelenting attacks and selective prosecution. In trying to break Hunter, they’ve tried to break me — and there’s no reason to believe it will stop here. Enough is enough.

Weiss, in the report, blasted the president's decision to pardon and the press release to the public that \"criticized the prosecution of his son as ‘selective,’ ‘unfair,’ ‘infected’ by ‘raw politics’ and a ‘miscarriage of justice.'\" \"This statement is gratuitous and wrong,\" Weiss wrote in his report. \"Other presidents have pardoned family members, but in doing so, none have taken the occasion as an opportunity to malign the public servants at the Department of Justice based solely on false accusations.\" In another section of the report, Weiss noted that, in light of the presidential pardon, he \"cannot make any additional charging decisions,\" adding it would be \"inappropriate\" to discuss \"whether additional charges are warranted.\" TRUMP ORDERS ATTORNEY GENERAL TO INVESTIGATE BIDEN'S AUTOPEN USE AMID COGNITIVE DECLINE CONCERNS \"Politicians who attack the decisions of career prosecutors as politically motivated when they disagree with the outcome of a case undermine the public's confidence in our criminal justice system,\" Weiss wrote. \"The President's statements unfairly impugn the integrity not only of Department of Justice personnel, but all of the public servants making these difficult decisions in good faith. \"The President's characterizations are incorrect based on the facts in this case, and, on a more fundamental level, they are wrong.\" President Donald Trump speaks at U.S. Steel Corporation's Mon Valley Works-Irvin plant in West Mifflin, Pa., on May 30.(AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson) Biden's use of an autopen for signatures is under investigation by Attorney GeneralPam Bondi. PresidentDonald Trumpdirected Bondi to investigate whether certain individuals working for Biden conspired to deceive the public about his mental state while also exercising his presidential responsibilities by using an autopen. In a memo Wednesday, Trump said the president of the U.S. has a tremendous amount of power and responsibility through the signature. Not only can the signature turn words into laws of the land, but it also appoints individuals to some of the highest positions in government, creates or eliminates national policies and allows prisoners to go free. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"In recent months, it has become increasingly apparent that former President Biden's aides abused the power of Presidential signatures through the use of an autopen to conceal Biden's cognitive decline and assert Article II authority,\" Trump wrote. \"This conspiracy marks one of the most dangerous and concerning scandals in American history. The American public was purposefully shielded from discovering who wielded the executive power, all while Biden's signature was deployed across thousands of documents to effect radical policy shifts.\" He added that Biden has experienced \"serious cognitive decline\" for years, and the Department of Justice recently concluded Biden should not stand trial despite clear evidence he broke the law, because of his mental state. \"Biden's cognitive issues and apparent mental decline during his presidency were even ‘worse’ in private, and those closest to him ‘tried to hide it’ from the public,\" Trump said. \"To do so, Biden's advisors during his years in office severely restricted his news conferences and media appearances, and they scripted his conversations with lawmakers, government officials, and donors, all to cover up his inability to discharge his duties.\" Fox News Digital's Greg Wehner contributed to this report.

    "article_text": "President Donald Trump responds to Elon Musk's criticism of his 'big, beautiful bill' in the White House. Billionaire Elon Musk dropped a serious bomb on social media on Thursday when he made allegations that PresidentDonald Trumpwas in the Jeffrey Epstein file. \"@RealDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files,\" Musk wrote on X. \"That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!\" Musk followed the post with another, saying, \"Mark this post for the future. The truth will come out.\" The former \"First Buddy\" dropped the allegation in response to a back-and-forth series of social media messages between him and Trump. PRESIDENT TRUMP TEASES ‘LAST DAY, BUT NOT REALLY’ FOR ELON MUSK AT DOGE: OVAL OFFICE PRESSER SET FOR FRIDAY \"This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful BIll because it does not include the policies he wanted,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said. \"The President is focused on passing this historic piece of legislation and making our country great again.\" The White House said a source familiar with the Epstein matter said it is widely known that Trump kicked Epstein out of his Palm Beach Golf Club. The source also pointed out that the administration released the Epstein files, which included Trump’s name, and nothing was new about Musk’s revelation. \"If Elon truly thought the President was more deeply involved with Epstein, why did he hang out with him for 6 months and say he ‘loves him as much as a straight man can love a straight man?'\" the source said. ELON MUSK IN ‘SHOCK’ OVER DEMS' ALLEGED ‘HATRED AND VIOLENCE,’ LAMENTS 'DERANGED' ATTACKS ON TESLA PLANTS Elon Musk speaks at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Oxon Hill, Maryland, on Feb. 20.(AP/Jose Luis Magana) Shortly after Musk posted about Trump being in theEpstein file, Trump posted his response to Truth Social. \"I don’t mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago. This is one of the Greatest Bills ever presented to Congress,\" Trump said, turning his attention to the \"big, beautiful bill\" that is before the Senate. \"It’s a Record Cut in Expenses, $1.6 Trillion Dollars, and the Biggest Tax Cut ever given. If this Bill doesn’t pass, there will be a 68% Tax Increase, and things far worse than that.\" \"I didn’t create this mess, I’m just here to FIX IT. This puts our Country on a Path of Greatness. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" the president added. Trump lambasted Musk on Thursday afternoon, saying he asked the former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) head to leave. \"Elon was ‘wearing thin,’ I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!\" Trump said on Truth Social. AG PAM BONDI SAYS FBI DELIVERED 'TRUCKLOAD' OF EPSTEIN FILES AFTER SHE PUT OUT HARD DEADLINE A file photo provided by the New York State Sex Offender Registry shows Jeffrey Epstein on March 28, 2017.(New York State Sex Offender Registry via AP, File) Musk's bombshellallegation against Trump comes months after a trove of files pertaining to the Epstein case were released. In February, Attorney General Pam Bondi sent a letter to FBI Director Kash Patel explaining the delay in the release of documents and placing blame on an FBI field office in New York. Bondi said she requested the full Epstein case file before Patel was confirmed as the head of the FBI and received about 200 pages — far fewer than the number of pages released last year in a civil lawsuit connected toGhisalaine Maxwell, the trafficker’s former lover and convicted accomplice. JEFFREY EPSTEIN LIST: AG PAM BONDI RELEASES HIGHLY ANTICIPATED DOJ DOCUMENTS Attorney General Pam Bondi speaks to reporters outside the White House in Washington, D.C., on May 7.(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) Although Bondi pushed for the release of the full dossier, which included records, documents, audio and video recordings, and materials related to Epstein and his clients, the request remains unfulfilled. One of the key pieces that remains unreleased is a client list, though Bondi claimed in February it was on her desk to be reviewed. The documents that have been released so far include flight logs, an evidence list, a contact book and a redacted \"masseuse list\" believed to refer to Epstein’s victims. Many people named in the documents have never been accused of Epstein-related wrongdoing. However, some have, like Maxwell; Prince Andrew, who has denied allegations of wrongdoing; and Jean-Luc Brunel, a French modeling agent who, like Epstein, died in a jail awaiting trial. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Epstein, Maxwell and unnamed co-conspirators allegedly abused young women and underage girls between 1996 and his death in 2019, according to the lawsuit. Citing police documents, it alleges that Epstein recruited girls between 14 and 16 as well as students at Palm Beach Community College for \"sex-tinged sessions.\" Maxwell is appealing her conviction while serving a sentence at a federal prison in Tallahassee. She is due for release in the summer of 2037. Fox News Digital’s Andrew Mark Miller and Mike Ruiz contributed to this report. This is a developing story. Please check back for updates.

FIRST ON FOX:AHouse fiscal hawkwants to create a payment plan for congressional emergency spending to create accountability for the \"no rules apply\" funding stream. Rep. Marlin Stutzman, R-Ind., is set to introduce the Emergency Spending Accountability Act that would add guardrails to last-minute funding meant for national emergencies, like natural disasters, the COVID-19 pandemic or other spending meant to fill the gaps in the appropriations process. SENATE WEIGHS TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' AS POLICY GROUP BACKS CBO, PROJECTS $3 TRILLION DEBT INCREASE Rep. Marlin Stutzman, R-Ind., is set to introduce the Emergency Spending Accountability Act.(Fox News Digital) Stutzman told Fox News Digital that lawmakers will go about the usual budgeting process, passing stopgap spending bills or colossal, omnibus spending packages, but that \"somewhere in between\" there’s always extra money pushed out the door for emergencies. \"Whenever there's an emergency, Congress always overreacts,\" he said. \"And I believe they pass these big spending bills under the guise of an emergency, national emergency, andspend moneythat we don't take into consideration through our budget process.\" WHITE HOUSE INSISTS FEMA IS TAKING HURRICANE SEASON 'SERIOUSLY,' BLASTS 'SLOPPY' REPORTING Rep. Marlin Stutzman, R-Ind.(Getty Images) He said that when he first came to Washington in 2010, the national debt was $9 trillion. After leaving the House and returning during last year’s election cycle, that number has since ballooned to more than$36 trillion. And since the early 1990s, more than $12 trillion in emergency spending has added to the ever-growing deficit. The lawmaker said that the money dedicated for emergency use was rarely ever paid back, and he argued that the taxpayer dollars were sometimes not used for actual emergencies. 'HE'S NOT A BIG FACTOR': TRUMP'S SENATE ALLIES DISMISS ELON MUSK'S CALLS TO 'KILL THE BILL' Stutzman’s legislation, which so far has seven House Republican co-sponsors, would require the federal government to pay off the balance of future emergency spending by 20% each year for five years after an emergency following a green-light from lawmakers to open up the cash flow. His bill would also stipulate that any emergency spending would have to comport with the criteria laid out by the Balance Budget and Emergency Control Act of 1985, which laid out a five-point roadmap to justify that emergency spending be necessary, sudden, urgent, unforeseen and not permanent. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP He understood that there is always a need for emergency spending, giving the examples of the pandemic and of Hurricane Sandy, which blasted through the East Coast more than a decade ago, but he noted there should be offset cuts to account for the spending and better planning on how the taxpayer dollars would be used. \"Most companies and family budgets, they always have a rainy-day fund or an emergency fund that they can tap into if they need it for unexpected costs and expenses, but that's not the way Washington works,\" Stutzman said. \"So that's the idea.\" Alex Miller is a writer for Fox News Digital covering the U.S. Senate.",

    "article_text": "Sen. Adam B. Schiff of California battled EPA Administrator Lee M. Zeldin at a Senate EPW Committee hearing. Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., faced pushback after calling on White House counsel David Warrington to release financial disclosures for senior officials, prompting a Trump aide to suggest he start by requesting the same from longtime Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. \"The American people remain highly concerned aboutNancy Pelosi’slong, documented history of insider trading and eagerly await Adam Schiff refocusing his political stunt on serious issues, like Pelosi’s portfolio,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai toldABC Newsafter it inquired about Schiff’s letter. In a letter to Warrington and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, Schiff expressed \"continued and growing concern regarding… failure to submit any financial disclosure reports for senior White House officials to the Office of Government Ethics within the statutorily mandated period.\" Schiff demanded the White House turn over a list of officials required to file \"new entrant\" reports, an explanation for \"failure to transmit\" such reports for certification and any late-filing fees imposed for \"delinquent filings.\" ‘WATERMELON HEAD’: TRUMP TROLLS DEMOCRATIC SEN. ADAM SCHIFF From left: Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.; Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.; and President Donald Trump.(Getty Images) He noted that he had signed on to a bicameral April letter that included fellow Californian Rep. Mike Levin, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and several other Democrats asking for similar information. In comments to Fox News Digital on Thursday, the White House pushed back again on Schiff, saying that all officials there who are required to file public reports continue to comply with their obligations. \"… including the obligation to file periodic transaction reports disclosing the purchase or sale of certain securities,\" said Taylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman. \"For decades, administrations of both parties, including the first Trump Administration, have fulfilled this obligation, recognizing that public trust in government depends on robust, enforceable transparency standards,\" Schiff said in a statement. KASH PATEL ENRAGES ADAM SCHIFF IN CLINTONIAN BATTLE OVER THE WORD ‘WE’ \"However, senior officials in this administration have repeatedly failed to disclose assets and business entanglements, as well as potentially misused their official positions for personal gain. \"Transparency and compliance with ethics laws are essential.\" In that regard, Desai’s initial response highlighted ongoing criticisms of Pelosi, whose net worth is reportedly north of $120 million, and who has been accused of wrongful financial transactions over her 38 years in the House. Pelosi, a California Democrat, kept walking when asked on the Hill about the matter last month by a Fox News Digital reporter. However, Pelosi spokesman Ian Krager told Fox News Digital that the former speaker \"does not own any stocks, and she has no prior knowledge or subsequent involvement in any transactions.\" Asked in Mayby another reporterabout supporting any stock trading ban that might make its way through Congress, Pelosi replied, \"if they do, they do,\" and indicated \"sure\" when asked if she would support such a bill.

    "title": "'KILL BILL': Elon Musk's conservative evolution puts him at odds with Trump on key legislation",
    "article_text": "Senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought testifying in a House budget hearing as Congress moves to codify DOGE cuts. Tech tycoon and former DOGE chiefElon Musk's political evolution has shifted to the right after he jumped into the election fray as a staunch ally of President Donald Trump on the campaign trail and ultimately as the leader of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk's conservative genesis on the public stage has put him at odds with the president as he rails against the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which Trump has touted as legislation that would translate into big tax breaks for Americans across the pay brackets and subsequently called on Republican lawmakers to swiftly pass it. Musk, who is considered America's wealthiest resident, is publicly criticizing the sweeping legislation just days after his departure from DOGE and the federal government. The \"big, beautiful bill\" is currently making its way through the Senate and would fund Trump's agenda, including strengthening border policies andending taxeson overtime and tips. \"I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore,\" Musk posted Tuesday to X. \"This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.\" ELON MUSK WARNS EXCESSIVE SPENDING WILL PLUNGE US 'INTO DEBT SLAVERY' Elon Musk watches as President Donald Trump meets South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.(AP/Evan Vucci) He added the next day that the bill's \"immense level of overspending will drive America into debt slavery!\" This was followed by a stream of X posts calling on Americans to encourage their lawmakers to \"kill the bill\" as well as a \"KILL BILL\" meme of the 2003 movie with the same name. Musk has found himself aligned with members of the House Freedom Caucus, which is considered the most conservative voting bloc within the lower chamber, as well as staunch fiscal conservatives in the Senate, such as Republican Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and Wisconsin Sen. Ron. Johnson, who have publicly rebuked the legislation. ELON MUSK 'DISAPPOINTED' BY TRUMP'S SPENDING BILL, SAYS IT UNDERMINES WHAT DOGE IS DOING Paul said Monday that its potential passage would increase the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, calling the bill a \"terrible idea\" that bucks conservative ideas. The national debt currently stands at about $36 trillion. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), an independent government agency, published a June report that the bill would increase the deficit by $2.4 trillion throughout the next decade. \"I want the tax cuts to be permanent. But at the same time, I don't wanna raise the debt ceiling five trillion,\" Paul told CBS' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday.\"The GOPwill own the debt once they vote for this.\" Trump has admonished the criticism from fiscally conservative Republicans, arguing that Paul, for example, was on the verge of siding with the \"Radical Left Democrats\" and encouraging a 68% tax hike on Americans if he votes against the legislation. \"Rand will be playing right into the hands of the Democrats, and the GREAT people of Kentucky will never forgive him! The GROWTH we are experiencing, plus some cost cutting later on, will solve ALL problems. America will be greater than ever before!\" Trump posted Saturday to Truth Social of Paul. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., speaks during a nomination hearing with the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on April 3.(Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) Musk, in an earlier public rebuke of the bill, remarked that he was \"disappointed\" it passed the House in May as it \"undermines the work that theDOGE team is doing.\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Tuesday saidthat Trumpis aware of Musk's views on the bill, but that the legislation still has the president's full endorsement, when asked by Fox News' Peter Doocy about Musk's X post claiming the bill was a \"disgusting abomination.\" \"The president already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill,\" Leavitt said. \"It doesn't change the president's opinion. This is one big, beautiful bill and he's sticking to it.\" Leavitt also pushed back in the briefing Tuesday that the CBO's prognostication for the bill is likely wrong, citing a history of missing the mark on budget predictions. \"The Congressional Budget Office has been historically wrong,\" Leavitt said. \"In fact, they predicted the Trump tax cuts from the president's first term in 2017. Their prediction was wrong by half a trillion. Those tax cuts had nearly a half trillion dollars more of revenue than the Congressional Budget Office scored. And I would also point out, I don't think many people know this, there hasn't been a single staffer in the entire Congressional Budget Office that has contributed to a Republican since the year 2000. But guess what? There have been many staffers within the Congressional Budget Office who have contributed to Democrat candidates and politicians every single cycle.\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., also slammed the report for employing static scoring as opposed to dynamic scoring, which in \"layman’s terms is they don’t give us any credit for the extraordinary economic growth that will be spurred along by this bill.\" Static scoring evaluates the fiscal impact of a policy change without considering how the change will affect the economy overall, while dynamic scoring broadens the scope of a study to include how a policy change would affect the economy. A White House official told Fox News Digital that Musk and Trump have historically seen eye-to-eye on political issues more than they differ, adding they continue to share many political views when asked if Musk has gone further to the right than Trump since his work within the administration. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt listens during a briefing with reporters at the White House in Washington, D.C., on May 9.(Alex Brandon/The Associated Press) Trump spoke publicly about Musk's criticisms on Thursday from the Oval Office during a meeting with the chancellor of Germany, remarking he was \"disappointed\" with Musk's rebukes. \"I'm very disappointed, because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here, better than you people,\" Trump said in the Oval Office. \"He knew everything about it. He had no problem with it. All of a sudden he had a problem, and he only developed the problem when he found out that we're going to have to cut the EV mandate, because that's billions and billions of dollars, and it really is unfair.\" \"Elon and I had a great relationship,\" he added. \"I don’t know if we will anymore.\" Musk's leadership of DOGE came to an official end on May 28 as his time as a special government employee ran dry of its 130 predetermined days. While in the role, Musk became a common target of liberal ire as he led efforts to remove fraud, corruption and overspending from federal departments and agencies across the government, which included cutting government programs and mass layoffs. All in, DOGE touts that it has saved an estimated $180 billion through initiatives such as grant or contract cancellations, workforce reductions or stamping out fraud. Musk's efforts on DOGE have been celebrated by conservatives and Republicans, who frequently campaign on cutting government fat. \"It is time to cut red tape, hold the unchecked federal workforce accountable, ensure programs are efficient, & work with@DOGE to tackle waste, fraud, & abuse,\" House Oversight Chair James Comer, R-Ky.,posted on Xin December 2024 ahead of DOGE's official launch. \"Iowans elected me with a mandate to cut Washington’s pork!\" Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, said in December 2024. \"From billion-dollar boondoggles to welfare for politicians and trillion-dollar slush funds, my decade-long investigations have exposed levels of abuse that are almost too insane to believe.\" GOP SENATORS EXPRESS 'CONCERNS,' 'SKEPTICISM' OVER TRUMP'S SPENDING BILL AFTER MUSK RANT The tech billionaire behind Tesla and Space X previously described himself as a Democrat and centrist before making a public political shift to the right amid Trump's run for the presidency and inauguration — including repeatedly taking stances that fall in line with conservative ideology. Musk endorsed Trump for the presidency in July 2024, after Trump faced his first assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. He later joined the political fray through campaign events promoting Trump's candidacy in key battleground states. Before Trump's win, Musk railed from the campaign trail that the federal government had become bloated with overspending and red tape that he said hampers private sector innovation. Elon Musk gestures as he steps on stage during a rally for former President Donald Trump at Madison Square Garden in New York on Oct. 27, 2024.(Angela Weiss/AFP via Getty Images) \"Tomorrow, I will tell the story of how SpaceX was forced by the government to kidnap seals, put earphones on them and play sonic boom sounds to see if they seemed upset,\" Musk posted to X in October 2024, teasing he would elaborate on his government over-regulation experiences from a campaign event. Trump touted during the election cycle that Musk would likely serve as his \"Secretary of Cost-Cutting\" if he won re-election, teeing up fanfare around Musk's anticipated efforts to take a hatchet to the federal government's budget. Musk's political evolution, most notably when it comes to fiscal issues, followed the tech tycoon touting in 2018 on X, \"True socialism seeks greatest good for all.\" He added in 2020 that \"socially,\" he is \"very liberal,\" continuing that he is \"economically right of center, maybe, or center,\" The New York Times previously reported. WHITE HOUSE STANDS BY TAX BILL AFTER MUSK CALLS IT A 'DISGUSTING ABOMINATION' In addition to slamming the \"big, beautiful bill\" in recent days, Musk has posted a handful of X messages celebrating free market champion Milton Friedman and beloved conservative economist Thomas Sowell. As Trump's tariff policies were rolled out in April, Musk posted a video clip of Friedman explaining that an item as simple as a pencil is the result of free market economics and supply chains across the world. Musk shared the video with no caption. \"Literally thousands of people cooperated to make this pencil,\" Friedman, who died in 2006, was seen saying in the video. \"People who don’t speak the same language, who practice different religions, who might hate one another if they ever met. When you go down the store and buy this pencil, you are, in effect, trading a few minutes of your time for a few seconds of the time of all those thousands of people.\" President Donald Trump listens to a question during an event in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C., on May 19.(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta) \"The operation of the free market is so essential, not only to promote productive efficiency, but even more to foster harmony and peace among the peoples of the world,\" he said. Musk also recently shared a quote from Sowell on the history of slavery in the U.S. \"It's one of many evils that the left tries to localize when it's a universal evil,'\" Sowell was seen saying in a video post on X that was reshared by Musk on Jan. 11 withthe caption \"True.\" ELON MUSK CRITICISM OF TRUMP TAX BILL FRUSTRATES SOME REPUBLICANS: 'NO PLACE IN CONGRESS' Musk also doubled down on strong endorsements of the Second Amendment while on the campaign trail, posting on X in October 2024 that \"tyrannical government\" works to take guns from citizens in an effort to snuff out free speech. \"Theright to bear armsis there to protect free speech and stop a tyrannical government from taking your rights away! That’s why the first thing that all tyrants do is disarm the people, just like Chavez did when he was first elected. After that, no more real elections in Venezuela,\" Musk posted to his X account in October 2024. Elon Musk greets President Donald Trump as they attend the NCAA men's wrestling championships in Philadelphia on March 22.(Nathan Howard/Reuters) Musk had previously praised America's Second Amendment, including in 2022 when he said he \"strongly (believes) that the right to bear arms is an important safeguard against potential tyranny of government.\" His comments while on the campaign trail rallying support for Trump, however, found renewed praise among conservatives in 2024 as they found additional common ground with the tech billionaire.

President Donald Trump called Minnesota Gov.Tim Walza \"sick puppy\" who should not have landed on the Democrats' 2024 presidential ticket. \"He's a sick puppy, that guy, that poor guy. I feel sorry for him,\"Trump saidThursday from the Oval Office while meeting with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. \"But, they made a bad choice with him.\" Trump's comments followed a reporter asking Trump about his relationship with Elon Musk after the former Department of Government Efficiency chief repeatedly assailed the \"big beautiful bill,\" the sweeping legislation that will fund the Trump administration's agenda and touted by the president as key legislation that demands GOP unity for passage. Musk was a key ally of Trump's during the campaign cycle, holding rallies in the top seven battleground states to rally support, including in Pennsylvania.

Tim Walz is shown at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August 2024.(Getty Images) Trump remarked that the Democrat Party should have tapped Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro to join former Vice PresidentKamala Harrisas her running mate on the presidential ticket, but instead chose Walz. \"Elon endorsed me very strongly. He actually went up andcampaigned for me. I think I would have won. Susie would say I would have won Pennsylvania easily anyway, even if the governor had the real governor, not the governor, for a Minnesota,\" Trump said before calling Walz a \"sick puppy.\" FAILED VP CANDIDATE TIM WALZ SKEWERED AFTER HINTING AT POTENTIAL 2028 PRESIDENTIAL RUN \"But if you picked Shapiro or anybody else, I spoke to him recently about his, you know, his house being set on fire, which was terrible.

President Donald Trump(Evan Vucci/Associated Press) Walz joined Harris on the Democrat ticket in August 2024, just days after PresidentJoe Bidendropped out of the race in July 2024 amid mounting concerns over his mental acuity, giving way to Harris at the top of the ticket. The Harris campaign had just more than 100 days between Biden dropping out and rallying support for the Harris-Walz ticket before Election Day on Nov. 5. Afterthe election, Walz revealed he would run for president in 2028 if the opportunity presented itself. \"Well, I had a friend tell me, ‘Never turn down a job you haven’t been offered,’\" Walz told the New Yorker in March when asked if he would run for president.

    "article_text": "Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought addresses Democrats' criticism that DOGE is a 'big scam' and lays out his goals for the department's cuts 'The Story.' A federal judge on Thursday ordered theTrump administrationto restore millions of dollars in grant funding for AmeriCorps and to reemploy thousands of employees, ruling that the administration's abrupt dismantling of the organization violated federal law. U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman agreed to reinstate thousands of terminated AmeriCorps employees across 24 U.S. states and D.C., which sued the administration earlier this year over the steep cuts to the agency ordered by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. She also ordered the Trump administration to restore hundreds of millions of dollars in congressionally approved funding for AmeriCorps programs, which were also slashed by DOGE earlier this year. Boardman sided with plaintiffs in ruling that the Trump administration likely violated administrative procedures by ordering the abrupt cancellations and terminations, without a proper notice or comment period. SUPREME COURT RULES WISCONSIN UNCONSTITUTIONALLY DISCRIMINATED AGAINST CHRISTIAN CHARITY Protesters hold signs during a May Day demonstration and march in San Francisco, California.(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) While the decision does not require the Trump administration to keep the jobs in place indefinitely, it does require it to provide adequate notice before doing so. AmeriCorps, an agencycreated by Congressmore than two decades ago, had an operating budget of roughly $1 billion prior to this year, when it found itself squarely in the crosshairs of DOGE, the agency previously headed up by Elon Musk and tasked with eliminating wasteful spending. In granting the preliminary injunction Thursday, Boardman said the 24 states have adequately demonstrated they are likely to suffer \"irreparable harm\" from the gutting of AmeriCorps, absent court intervention, and that the balance of equities \"heavily favors\" plaintiffs seeking injunctive relief. \"Any harm the defendants might face if the agency actions are enjoined pales in comparison to the concrete harms that the States and the communities served by AmeriCorps programs have suffered and will continue to suffer,\" she said in the ruling. 100 DAYS OF INJUNCTIONS, TRIALS AND 'TEFLON DON': TRUMP SECOND TERM MEETS ITS BIGGEST TESTS IN COURT Protesters rally outside the headquarters of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management on Feb. 5, 2025, in Washington, D.C.(Alex Wong/Getty Images) The preliminary injunction comes after DOGE in April abruptly announced it would be putting roughly 85% of allAmeriCorps stafferson leave. It also announced mass Reduction of Force, or RIF, for AmeriCorps staff, and sent notice that they were planning to cut $400 million in grants and other funding from the agency. In their lawsuit, attorneys general from the 24 U.S. states and D.C. urged the court to reverse the cuts and terminations across AmeriCorps, citing the risk of irreparable harm, as well as the administration's failure to properly notify employees of their terminations. Plaintiffs alleged that the Trump administration and DOGE had acted beyond the scope of their authority in gutting AmeriCorps, an agency created by Congress, without proper notice. They also asked the judge to halt the cuts to roughly $557 million in congressionally approved funding. Importantly, the judge said Thursday that the order only applies to the states that joined the lawsuit. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The news was praised on social media by New York Attorney General Letitia James, who described it as a victory, noting: \"Over 200,000 AmeriCorps staff and volunteers work hard every day to care for our communities.\" \"This ruling ensures their valuable work can continue,\" she said. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapirosaidthe decision to halt the cuts to AmeriCorps will \"help communities respond to natural disasters, support seniors and veterans, and keep our trails clean across Pennsylvania.\" Breanne Deppisch is a national politics reporter for Fox News Digital covering the Trump administration, with a focus on the Justice Department, FBI, and other national news.",

    "article_text": "Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., breaks down his findings about the TSA ‘Quiet Skies’ program on ‘The Will Cain Show,’ after reports alleged DNI Tulsi Gabbard was on the agency’s watch list. EXCLUSIVE:The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is ending the Quiet Skies program, which left some Americans subject to additional screenings at airport security. The department says the agency was overly politicized to either benefit or hurt specific people and ran a bill of roughly $200 million annually. According to DHS, the program kept a watchlist as well as a list of people exempted. The department says Quiet Skies has not prevented any terrorist attacks but will continue to use other methods to assure safe air travel. \"It is clear that the Quiet Skies program was used as a political rolodex of the Biden Administration — weaponized against its political foes and exploited to benefit their well-heeled friends. I am calling for a Congressional investigation to unearth further corruption at the expense of the American people and the undermining of US national security,\" DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement. GABBARD SLAMS 'POLITICALLY MOTIVATED' SURVEILLANCE AS EFFORT TO 'INTIMIDATE' HER FOLLOWING CRITICISM OF HARRIS Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem during the Coast Guard Academy commencement in New London, Connecticut, on May 21.(Reuters/Michelle McLoughlin) DHS says that the list of exemptions of people who avoid \"security policies\" included \"foreign royal families, political elites, professional athletes, and favored journalists.\" The program that started in 2010 was seen as a terror prevention method, and it faced escalating scrutiny from the left and right, including groups like the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). \"TSA’s critical aviation and security vetting functions will be maintained, and the Trump Administration will return TSA to its true mission of being laser-focused on the safety and security of traveling public. This includes restoring the integrity, privacy, and equal application of the law for all Americans,\" Noem continued. FEDERAL AIR MARSHALS SURVEILLED TRUMP CABINET MEMBER GABBARD IN 2024, RAND PAUL SAYS Travelers make their way through Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Arlington, Virginia, on May 24, 2024.(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) In 2018, the ACLU asked theTransportation Security Administration(TSA) for more information about the program. \"The TSA is engaging in covert surveillance of travelers and raising a host of disturbing questions in the process. While the program’s existence is now public, the TSA has kept nearly everything else about the program secret,\" Hugh Handeyside, senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s National Security Project, said in a 2018 news release. \"Travelers deserve to know how this surveillance is being implemented, what its consequences are for Americans, and for how long the TSA is retaining the information it gathers. What we’ve seen so far is troubling, which is why we’re demanding that the TSA hand over records it’s been hiding from the public. This is a much needed step towards transparency and accountability for an agency with a track record of using unreliable and unscientific techniques, such as ‘behavior detection,’ to screen and monitor travelers who have done nothing wrong,\" he added.

    "article_text": "U.S. Department of Health and Human Services officials Dr. Mehmet Oz, Marty Makary, Jay Bhattacharya and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. discuss the issues they believe may contribute to chronic diseases in the United States on ‘Special Report.’ Scientists say a species of bacteria rewrites the history of when an infectious and potentially deadly disease first arrived in the Americas. And it was long before the arrival of European explorers. Researchers from the Institut Pasteur in Paris, France, with help from a U.S. university, recently announced in a news release that a second species of bacteria is also responsible forthe diseaseknown as leprosy, or Hansen's disease, in the Americas. In years past, many believed that the bacterium known asMycobacterium lepraecaused leprosy and that it was only spread in America by early European explorers and settlers. However, the revelation of a second bacterium puts that theory of blaming the settlers on its head, as an existing strain was already on the continents calling the New World home. FIRST KNOWN CASE OF RARE MPOX STRAIN CONFIRMED IN UNITED STATES The Institut Pasteur in Paris announced that they have found a second species of bacteria responsible for the disease in the Americas.(Netflix/Paramount) The bacteriumMycobacterium lepromatosisexisted and infected humans for 1,000 years prior to Europeans arriving, researchers say. Dr. Maria Lopopolo, the first author of the study and researcher at the Laboratory of Microbial Paleogenomics at the Institut Pasteur, said it changes everything about leprosy in the Americas. \"This discovery transforms our understanding of the history of leprosy in America. It shows that a form of the disease was already endemic among Indigenous populations well before the Europeans arrived,\" she said in the release. POTENTIALLY DEADLY ZOONOTIC VIRUS FOUND IN THE US, SPARKING CONCERNS OF SPREAD TO HUMANS Scientists at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, alongside the French National Centre for Scientific Research and the University of Colorado, conducted the study.(iStock) The study — led by scientists from the Laboratory of Microbial Paleogenomics at the Institut Pasteur, alongside the French National Center for Scientific Research, and the University of Colorado in the U.S. — began afterMycobacterium lepromatosiswas found in a Mexican patient in 2008, and red squirrels in the British Isles in 2016. Using advanced genetic techniques to reconstruct the genomes ofMycobacterium lepromatosisfrom ancient individuals from Argentina and Canada, scientists found that the two strains from the different regions were genetically close in theMycobacteriumgenome family tree, meaning that the bacteria spread rapidly throughout the continent. The release stated that the results confirmed thatMycobacterium lepromatosishad already spread throughout North and South America. The researchers were able to study over 800 different DNA samples from ancient human remains and recent medical cases showing signs of leprosy.(iStock) Researchers worked in collaboration with indigenous communities, various international institutions and archaeologists, according to the release, and were able to study over 800DNA samplesfrom ancient human remains and recent medical cases showing signs of leprosy. Nicolás Rascovan, the lead author of the study at theInstitut Pasteur, said that the research proves that human history can be changed. \"We are just beginning to uncover the diversity and global movements of this recently identified pathogen,\" he said. \"This study allows us to hypothesize that there might be unknown animal reservoirs.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP TheCenters for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) says leprosy can affect the nerves, skin and eyes of patients, and is treated with antibiotics.

Rapinoe made it known that the 2023 tournament would be her last World Cup, and while she wished it ended differently, she noted feeling \"so lucky and so grateful to play as long as I have.\" Off the pitch, Rapinoe has been outspoken, including after the 2019 victory where she said \"I'm not going to the f---ing White House,\" while President Donald Trump was in his first term. She also told her Team USA peers to \"think hard\" about going to the White House before facing France in the quarterfinal, prompting Trump to tweet out \"Megan should WIN first before she TALKS! Finish the job! We haven't yet…\" \"Megan should never disrespect our Country, the White House, or our Flag, especially since so much has been done for her & the team. Be proud of the Flag that you wear. The USA is doing GREAT!\"Trump added in his tweetsat the time. Rapinoe also commented on an earlier episode of her podcast with Bird after Trump beat former vice president Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, saying she felt \"overwhelmed\" that he would be back in office.

I’m thinking about the potential of mass deportations if that is going to happen, and just like the general chaos that’s going to be sown is really overwhelming.\" In 2023 appearances with Team USA in her career, Rapinoe scored 63 goals and had 73 assists with her two World Cup titles. She also had 56 goals and 34 assists in her 13-year professional league in the WPS and NWSL. Fox News' Connor McGahan contributed to this report.

    "title": "Riley Gaines, activist athletes call for prosecution against officials letting males in women's sports",
    "article_text": "Former NCAA swimmers Riley Gaines and Kylee Alons, and their attorney William Bock, told Fox News Digital that they would all support criminal prosecution against officials allowing trans athletes to play in women's and girls' sports. Thursday marked exactly four months since President Donald Trump signed the \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports\" executive order. Butincidents of trans inclusionin girls' and women's sports continue to persist across the country. Democrat-stronghold states like California, Maine, Minnesota, Oregon and Washington haveopenly defiedthe order and deferred instead to their state laws on the issue, resulting in national controversies involving biological males competing in and often dominating high school girls' sports in recent months. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM The Trump administration has launched investigations and even filed lawsuits to counter this wave of incidents. But press secretary Karoline Leavitt has suggested the administration could go a step further. In an April 18 press conference, while discussing Maine's defiance on the issue, Leavitt asserted Trump's order and Title IX as federal law, noting that violators could be \"prosecuted.\" Since then, many Democrat-controlled states like Maine and California have refused to acquiesce to Trump's demands. Former NCAA swimmer and conservative influencer Riley Gaines, the leading figure in the national movement to keep males out of women's sports, told Fox News Digital that she would support prosecution as a response to the issue. \"I would love to see prosecution because I believe what is happening is criminal,\" Gaines said. \"The way that we have been told that a man's feelings matter more than our physical safety, than our rights to participate, to call ourselves champions, I believe that is a criminal action, therefore I believe it is a criminal offense. \"Someone somewhere has to be made an example of, otherwise you will have the woman-hating Democratic Party continue with full steam ahead. Gaines, who infamously tied with trans swimmer Lia Thomas in the 2022 NCAA women's championships, was only one of many women who were impacted by Thomas' participation. The event was hosted at the Georgia Institute of Technology and Gaines said she believes that the school's president, Angel Cabrera, is one of the first that should be in line for prosecution over the issue. \"I believe university officials should be charged. I believe certainly that in the state of Georgia, that the Georgia Tech president, who has continued to be very smug, who has continued to not attest or answer to any of the claims that we are making that happened on his pool deck,\" Gaines said of those who should be prosecuted. Fox News Digital has reached out to Georgia Tech for comment. Gaines leads a lawsuit against theNCAAover her experience with Thomas alongside several other women's swimmers who competed in the 2022 championships. Those plaintiffs include former University of Kentucky swimmer Kaitlynn Wheeler and former University of North Carolina swimmer Kylee Alons. Wheeler and Alons both agree with Gaines in supporting criminal prosecution against officials who have allowed trans athletes to compete in women's sports. \"I think that if schools, official states, whatever it is, are knowingly defying the law and violating Title IX especially by forcing girls to share locker rooms, change in front of boys, lose out on their opportunities, everything Title IX is supposed to stand for, I think there should be serious consequences,\" Wheeler told Fox News Digital. \"We're not just talking about policy disagreements, this is about knowingly stripping rights away from women and girls. If you break federal law there should be consequences like Riley said, and if that means prosecution in some of these states, then yeah, bring it on.\" OREGON GIRLS OPEN UP ON ‘TRAUMATIC’ TRANS ATHLETE EXPERIENCES THAT PUSHED THEM TO FIGHT BACK Alons questioned how one could not be in favor of prosecution against those officials. \"When you see the harm that this is causing women and girls, how could younot want to support prosecuting defying this?\" Alons told Fox News Digital. \"There's just so much harm being done and obviously there is a law for a reason, because it is causing harm so I would definetely support more action than just empty threats.\" The attorney representing Gaines, Wheeler, Alons and other women in their lawsuit against the NCAA, William Bock of the Independent Council on Women's Sports, not only supports the notion of prosecuting officials letting the issue continue, but believes it's \"necessary.\" \"At this point there's no excuse, the executive order has been in place since February 5,\" Bock told Fox News Digital. \"People have known for four months now, and if three-four months later, you're still knowingly defying federal law, then of course a prosecution makes sense, and it's evidently necessary to protect women.\" So far, Trump's enforcement of his executive order has only extended to a funding freeze to the University of Pennsylvania, where Thomas competed, temporary funding pauses against Maine that have since ended, and a Department of Justice lawsuit against Maine too. Trump's administration has launched investigations against three other state high school sports leagues (California, Minnesota and Massachusetts) and the DOJ has given California a deadline of this upcoming Monday to amend its policies that allow trans athletes in girls' sports. Gaines, Wheeler and Alons all find Trump's stance on the issue \"refreshing\" but would generally like to see more action. \"Hopefully we'll see enough with the warnings, that's how I feel,\" Gaines said. \"We're ready to see some action.\" Wheeler added, \"The executive order is a good start, but we need more than that signature, we need really enforceable protection that will supersede his presidency… it's a step in the right direction, but we're not satisfied.\" At the college level, Trump's executive order resulted in a change to the NCAA's gender eligibility policy just one day after the order was signed. Unlike the old policy, the new policy asserts that only females can compete in the women's category in official competition. However, the new policy has come under heavy criticism by women's rights activists since it was signed for offering no tangible outline of how it will enforce the policy, and a lack of enforcing gender testing. In late March, Ithaca College in New York admitted to letting a trans athlete compete in a Division III rowing competition, telling Fox News Digital that the participation of the trans athlete was due to a \"misunderstanding\" by the coaching staff about what was considered an official NCAA event, and referenced the policy's allowing of male practice players. Ithaca College competes in the I Eights Grand Final during the Division III Rowing Championship held at Nathan Benderson Park on May 29, 2021, in Sarasota, Florida.(Justin Tafoya/NCAA Photos via Getty Images) The NCAA has provided a statement to Fox News Digital, saying the competition the Ithaca trans athlete competed in \"will be considered a mixed team and not eligible to compete against women’s teams. Ithaca stated their intent to adhere to the policy which allows for practice opportunities and the NCAA appreciates Ithaca’s responsiveness.\" But the NCAA did not indicate that the results of the event would be voided or that Ithaca would face any consequences. The initial goal of the Gaines vs. NCAA lawsuit was to force the governing body to keep biological males out of women's college sports entirely. In the wake of the policy change, the lawsuit's goal remains intact but also expanded. \"We've reached out to the NCAA and their attorneys and we've given them the opportunity to resolve this matter at least, if we can't reach an agreement on accountability for the past, to put in place a policy that actually protects women and has some enforceability behind it and ensures that only women participate in college women's sports,\" Bock said. \"We put that in writing and they haven't gone down that route with us… their policy is toothless and ineffective and doesn't protect the rights of women.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Bock added that their lawsuit will also be seeking monetary damages for all the female athletes who have been affected. \"These are significant damages and there were several hundred women were harmed and we think that a jury in Georgia is going to find that damage amount very significant.\" Follow Fox News Digital’ssports coverage on X, and subscribe tothe Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.

But Kass reportedly wrote to Belichick, \"This is a book segment that looks at your life in football and what people can learn from you to achieve success in their own lives.\" After Belichick reportedly wanted to turn down the interview, another text Kass wrote reportedly said, \"I wouldn't be this insistent if this wasn't so important to book sales and without risk.\" Kass is also said to have told Belichick he spoke to a CBS producer \"about sticking to the book and shared that if they do, they'll get a great interview, and he was really open, saying he's not interested in going beyond the book.\" Belichick released a statement saying he was \"surprised\" about getting the questions about his relationship and that when Hudson had stepped in, she was doing her job. He also accused CBS of creating a \"false narrative\" with \"selectively edited clips.\" Bill Belichick and Jordon Hudson(Getty Images) \"I agreed to speak with ‘CBS Sunday Morning’ to promote my new book, ‘The Art of Winning — Lessons from My Life in Football.’ Prior to this interview, I clearly communicated with my publicist at Simon & Schuster that any promotional interviews I participated in would agree to focus solely on the contents of the book,\" he said at the time. \"Unfortunately, that expectation was not honored during the interview.

She was not deflecting any specific question or topic but simply doing her job to ensure the interview stayed on track. Some of the clips make it appear as though we were avoiding the question of how we met, but we have been open about the fact that Jordon and I met on a flight to Palm Beach in 2021. \"The final eight-minute segment does not reflect the productive 35-minute conversation we had, which covered a wide range of topics related to my career.

Imane Khelif, the boxer at the center of theOlympic gender controversy, is skipping a boxing tournament in the Netherlands after World Boxing announced mandatory sex testing for all athletes. The Algerian boxer, who won gold at the Paris Games last summer amid scrutiny over her eligibility, did not register in time for the event before applications closed on Thursday. Khelif had intended to return to international competition at the tournament in Hotel Eindhoven before World Boxing announced its new sex testing policy last Friday.

Excluding athletes based on controversial ‘gender tests’ certainly does not fit in with that,\" Dijsselbloem wrote in a letter addressed to the Dutch Boxing Federation and International Boxing Federation. \"We are expressing our disapproval of this decision today and are calling on the organization to admit Imane Khelif after all.\" 3 Wire Sports, citing medical documents from chromosome tests given by the International Boxing Association (IBA) before the 2022 and 2023 world championships, reported that Khelif’s DNA showed \"markers with male karyotypes.\" The International Olympic Committee (IOC) derecognized the IBA amid concerns about the organization's governance, financial reliance on Russian state energy firm Gazprom and integrity of the bouts. \"Chromosome analysis reveals Male karyotype.

This decision, made after a meticulous review, was extremely important and necessary to uphold the level of fairness and utmost integrity of the competition.\" The IBA added that Khelif underwent two tests: one in 2022 and the other in 2023. The IBA said Khelif appealed the decision to the Court for Arbitration of Sport but withdrew during the process, making the \"IBA decision legally binding.\" Throughout the controversy, Khelif has maintained that their gender is female.

    "article_text": "Keyshawn Johnson weighs in on whether the Pittsburgh Steelers are hurting their future by waiting on Aaron Rodgers. Aaron Rodgershas made his decision for the 2025 season, as he reportedly informed the Pittsburgh Steelers he will sign with them, per multiple reports. The veteran quarterback told Pittsburgh that he will fly to them on Friday, where he intends to sign before the team's minicamp next week, perNFL Network. Rodgers also plans on participating in minicamp to get accustomed to his new teammates and coaches before preparing on his own for the rest of the summer, the report added. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers looks on during the game against the Los Angeles Rams at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., on Dec. 22, 2024.(AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File) This offseason, theNew York Jetsmade the decision to move on from Rodgers after a failed two-year tenure with him at the helm. His first season didn't go according to plan after suffering a torn Achilles in Week 1, but a 5-12 record last season wasn't what anyone at One Jets Drive believed would be the result with a healthy Rodgers under center. In turn, Rodgers was on the free agent market for any quarterback-needy team. However, the same issue the Jets faced when they were looking to trade for Rodgers with the Green Bay Packers hung over his availability: retirement. AARON RODGERS TALKS POSSIBILITY OF RETIRING WITH PACKERS As teams needing a quarterback made moves — theNew York Giants, Las Vegas Raiders and Seattle Seahawks were among those in search of a new signal caller — the Steelers remained available by the time of the NFL Draft. Rodgers and the Steelers had been connected throughout the offseason, being a favorable team with a veteran head coach and a playoff pedigree. Rumors only heated up once the team waited until the sixth round to select Ohio State quarterback Will Howard instead of taking someone like Shedeur Sanders in earlier rounds to potentially be their franchise man. Head coach Mike Tomlin called his meeting with Rodgers on March 28 \"productive,\" and NFL Network reported Thursday that \"contract parameters have been in place for months.\" New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers answers questions from reporters after the game against the Jacksonville Jaguars at EverBank Stadium in Jacksonville, Florida, on Dec. 15, 2024.(AP Photo/Phelan M. Ebenhack) Rodgers has noted publicly that he has told teams he will play for $20 million this season. What exactly the Steelers have in those contract parameters remains to be seen. When he signs, Rodgers will be in charge of Arthur Smith's offense that won't feature wide receiver George Pickens in 2025, as he was traded this offseason to the Dallas Cowboys. Pittsburgh, though, reached a deal with the Seahawks to land Pro Bowler D.K. Metcalf to assume that top wide receiver role. Rodgers will also be working with tight end Pat Freiermuth, receivers Robert Woods and Calvin Austin, and a young, dynamic backfield of Jaylen Warren and third-round pick Kaleb Johnson.

(Credit: OutKick) Transgender pitcherMarissa Rothenberger ledChamplin Park High School to Minnesota's state softball championship game after a pair of playoff wins on Wednesday. The pitcher's dominance this season has prompted a lawsuit by threeanonymous opposing playersamid a national divide over the legality of trans athletes in girls' sports. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Transgender pitcher Marissa Rothenberger.(Amber Harding) One of the players involved in the lawsuit reacted to the pitcher's run to the championship game in an exclusive statement to Fox News Digital, provided by her attorneys at Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF). \"It is upsetting to see a male athlete dominating our sport and taking opportunities away from girls who have worked hard all season to make it to the championship game in the state tournament. On top of the unfairness, it is oftentimes a risk to play a physical sport like softball against a male athlete,\" the statement said. \"I am proud of the girls who played hard, and at the end of the day deserve it more than a boy, but I hope that more people will continue to stand up for female sports and take the rights of women and girls seriously.\" The anonymous player's team did not reach the championship game, the ADF said. ADF attorney Suzanne Beecher weighed in on the situation as well. \"A male’s belief about his gender doesn’t erase the physical advantages over female athletes. And every girl competing deserves the chance to experience the thrill of victory,\" Beecher told Fox News Digital. \"What happened tonight was not only unfair but put every female athlete at risk of getting injured due to the clear differences in biology from male to female. We filed a lawsuit against Minnesota officials to upend their radical policies that hurt female athletes across the state and restore their opportunities in a fair and safe competition.\" Rothenberger pitched both the quarterfinal and semifinal on Wednesday, and even hit two doubles in the semifinal to help spark a comeback.

Due to data privacy laws, the District is not able to provide public comment regarding a specific student athlete,\" a statement from the Anoka-Hennepin School District stated. \"In addition, the District is named in an active lawsuit which limits what information can be shared.\" Meanwhile, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison's office has released a statement responding to the lawsuit against the state over Rothenberger's participation in the girls' softball season. \"In addition to getting exercise and the fun of competition, playing sports comes with so many benefits for young people. You build friendships that can last a lifetime, you learn how to work as part of a team, and you get to feel like you belong,\" Ellison said. \"I believe it is wrong to single out one group of students, who already face higher levels of bullying and harassment, and tell these kids they cannot be on the team because of who they are. I will continue to defend the rights of all students to play sports with their friends and peers.\" After PresidentDonald Trumpsigned the \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports\" executive order, the Minnesota State High School Leagueannounced itwould defy federal law by allowing transgender athletes to continue playing in women's sports. Ellison then claimed at a press conference on April 22 that he received notice from the Department of Justice threatening legal action if the state did not follow the executive order, so the attorney general decided to sue first.

    "title": "Major data broker hack impacts 364,000 individuals’ data",
    "article_text": "Cybercriminals are sending fake meeting invitations that seem legitimate. Americans’ personal data is now spread across more digital platforms than ever. From online shopping habits to fitness tracking logs, personal information ends up in hundreds of company databases. While most people worry about social media leaks or email hacks, a far less visible threat comes from data brokers. I still find it hard to believe that companies like this are allowed to operate with so little legal scrutiny. These firms trade in personal information without our knowledge or consent. What baffles me even more is that they aren’t serious about protecting the one thing that is central to their business model: data. Just last year, we saw news of a massive data breach at a data broker called National Public Data, whichexposed 2.7 billion records. And now another data broker, LexisNexis, a major name in the industry, has reported a significant breach that exposed sensitive information from more than 364,000 people. Join the FREE \"CyberGuy Report\": Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to myfree \"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\"when you sign up! A hacker at work(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) LexisNexis filed anotice with the Maine attorney generalrevealing that a hacker accessed consumer data through a third-party software development platform. The breach happened on Dec. 25, 2024, but the company only discovered it months later. LexisNexis was alerted on April 1, 2025, by an unnamed individual who claimed to have found sensitive files. It remains unclear whether this person was responsible for the breach or merely came across the exposed data. MASSIVE DATA BREACH EXPOSES 184 MILLION PASSWORDS AND LOGINS A spokesperson for LexisNexis confirmed that the hacker gained access to the company’s GitHub account. This is a platform commonly used by developers to store and collaborate on code. Security guidelines repeatedly warn against storing sensitive information in such repositories; however, mistakes such as exposed access tokens and personal data files continue to occur. The stolen data varies from person to person but includes full names, birthdates, phone numbers, mailing and email addresses, Social Security numbers and driver's license numbers. LexisNexis has not confirmed whether it received any ransom demand or had further contact with the attacker. An individual working on their laptop(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) CUSTOM DATA REMOVAL: WHY IT MATTERS FOR PERSONAL INFO ONLINE LexisNexis isn’t a household name for most people, but it plays a major role in how personal data is harvested and used behind the scenes. The company pulls information from a wide range of sources, compiling detailed profiles that help other businesses assess risk and detect fraud. Its clients include banks, insurance companies and government agencies. In 2023, the New York Times reported that several car manufacturers had been sharing driving data with LexisNexis without notifying vehicle owners. That information was then sold to insurance companies, which used it to adjust premiums based on individual driving behavior. The story made one thing clear. LexisNexis has access to a staggering amount of personal detail, even from people who have never willingly engaged with the company. Law enforcement also uses LexisNexis tools to dig up information on suspects. These systems offer access to phone records, home addresses and other historical data. While such tools might assist in investigations, they also highlight a serious issue. When this much sensitive information is concentrated in one place, it becomes a single point of failure. And as the recent breach shows, that failure is no longer hypothetical. A hacker at work(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) MASSIVE DATA BREACH EXPOSES 184 MILLION PASSWORDS AND LOGINS Keeping your personal data safe online can feel overwhelming, but a few practical steps can make a big difference in protecting your privacy and reducing your digital footprint. Here are 7 effective ways to take control of your information and keep it out of the wrong hands: 1. Remove your data from the internet:The most effective way to take control of your data and avoid data brokers from selling it is to opt for data removal services. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.Check out my top picks for data removal services here. Get afree scanto find out if your personal information is already out on the web. 2. Review privacy settings:Take a few minutes to explore theprivacy and security settingson the services you use. For example, limit who can see your social media posts, disable unnecessary location-sharing on your phone and consider turning off ad personalization on accounts like Google and Facebook. Most browsers let you block third-party cookies or clear tracking data. The FTC suggests comparing the privacy notices of different sites and apps and choosing ones that let you opt out of sharing when possible. 3. Use privacy-friendly tools:Installbrowser extensionsor plugins that block ads and trackers (such as uBlock Origin or Privacy Badger). You might switch to a more private search engine (like DuckDuckGo or Brave) that doesn’t log your queries. Consider using a browser’s \"incognito\" or private mode when you don’t want your history saved, and regularly clear your cookies and cache. Even small habits, like logging out of accounts when not in use or using a password manager, make you less trackable. GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE 4. Beware of phishing links and use strong antivirus software:Scammers may try to get access to your financial details and other important data using phishing links. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. 5. Be cautious with personal data:Think twice before sharing extra details. Don’t fill out online surveys or quizzes that ask for personal or financial information unless you trust the source. Create separate email addresses for sign-ups (so marketing emails don’t go to your main inbox). Only download apps from official stores and check app permissions. 6. Opt out of data broker lists:Manydata brokersoffer ways to opt out or delete your information, though it can be a tedious process. For example, there are sites like Privacy Rights Clearinghouse or the Whitepages opt-out page that list popular brokers and their opt-out procedures. The FTC’s consumer guide,\"Your Guide to Protecting Your Privacy Online,\"includes tips on opting out of targeted ads and removing yourself from people-search databases. Keep in mind you may have to repeat this every few months. 7. Be wary of mailbox communications:Bad actors may also try to scam you through snail mail. The data leak gives them access to your address. They may impersonate people or brands you know and use themes that require urgent attention, such as missed deliveries, account suspensions and security alerts. HR FIRM CONFIRMS 4M RECORDS EXPOSED IN MAJOR HACK For many, theLexisNexis breachmay be the first time they realize just how much of their data is in circulation. Unlike a social media platform or a bank, there is no clear customer relationship with a data broker, and that makes it harder to demand transparency. This incident should prompt serious discussion around what kind of oversight is necessary in industries that operate in the shadows. A more informed public and stronger regulation may be the only things standing between personal data and permanent exposure.

    "article_text": "An aircraft is redefining air travel by eliminating traditional windows. With the unveiling of Otto Aviation’s Phantom 3500, humans are heading toward afuture of windowless jets. The aircraft is redefining air travel by eliminating traditional windows in favor of a sleek, aerodynamic design, something many engineers are surely happy about. It’s a radical approach, but it’s one that, on top of improving fuel efficiency and reducing drag, will still offer some of the best views using digital technology. Join the FREE \"CyberGuy Report\": Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to myfree \"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\"when you sign up! Phantom 3500(Otto Aviation) Most travelers don't realize that windows are structural weak points in an aircraft. They require extra reinforcement, add weight and disrupt the smooth flow of air over the fuselage (the main body of the plane). This increases drag, a resistance force that makes flight less efficient. By removing windows, thePhantom 3500's surfaceallows air to flow with minimal turbulence, helping the aircraft achieve what Otto Aviation describes as \"full laminar flow characteristics.\" HYPERSONIC JET PROMISES NYC TO LONDON IN UNDER AN HOUR This is a major contributor to its impressive aerodynamic performance. The windowless design is not just for aesthetics. Otto Aviation specifically engineered the fuselage to optimize laminar flow, using lightweight materials and smooth surfaces to further reduce drag and fuel consumption. Phantom 3500(Otto Aviation) SOLAR-POWERED AIRCRAFT ACHIEVES GROUNDBREAKING 22-HOUR AUTONOMOUS FLIGHT A common concern with windowless aircraft is claustrophobia. To address this, the Phantom 3500 features high-definition digital screens along the cabin walls and ceiling. These displays stream real-time video from cameras mounted on the aircraft's exterior, offering passengers a panoramic, immersive view of the skies. Otto Aviation refers to this system as Super Natural Vision, a proprietary technology that replaces traditional windows with state-of-the-art digital displays, seamlessly integrating real-time external views for a unique in-flight experience. The spacious, luminous cabin measures 800 cubic feet with a 6-foot-5-inch ceiling, comfortably accommodating four or more passengers in a luxurious, flexible layout. The cabin can seat up to nine passengers, depending on configuration, and is designed to maximize comfort and functionality. Freed from the constraints of window placement, the interior can be customized for relaxation, productivityor entertainment, ensuring passengers enjoy the journey as much as the destination. Phantom 3500(Otto Aviation) CHINESE WEARABLE EVTOL JETPACK MAKES HISTORIC FIRST FLIGHT The Phantom 3500 builds on flight tests from Otto’s Celera 500L prototype and Dassault Systèmes’ 3DEXPERIENCE platform. By sustaining laminar flow, the aircraft aims to improve fuel efficiency by 35%. This allows it to maintain high-speed performance while consuming less fuel, making it one of the most aerodynamically efficient aircraft ever developed. It operates in the transonic range (Mach 0.8–1.2), balancing speed and efficiency. It can also reach a cruising altitude of 51,000 feet, significantly higher than most commercial airliners, which typically fly between 30,000 and 40,000 feet. Thanks to its streamlined fuselage and optimized aerodynamics, the Phantom 3500 burns 50% less fuel than conventional business jets. This reduction in fuel consumption translates to lower operating costs and a significant decrease in carbon emissions. The Phantom 3500’s wings achieve complete laminar flow, allowing for smoother airflow and reduced drag, enabling the aircraft to take off from runways as short as 3,500 feet, nearly doubling the number of accessible airports in the U.S. alone compared to similar-sized jets.

    "title": "DAVID MARCUS: Why Navy ships should not be named for gay rights icons",
    "article_text": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth praises President Trump’s push to revive the warrior ethos at the Pentagon and slams the previous administration’s failure to do so. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegsethkicked off Pride month this year with a shot across the bow of wokeness, as his plan torechristen a Navy shiphonoring gay rights icon Harvey Milk has emerged. Milk was one of the first openly gay elected officials in the country as a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1978, and in that same year he was gunned down, leaving him a legacy as a martyr to the cause of gay liberation. Let’s be clear about two things. First, Hegseth is absolutely trolling the woke left with this move and its timing. Secondly, he is absolutely right to do so, because a navy vessel has nothing to do with men having sex with each other and that is the only thing painting \"Harvey Milk\" on the side of the ship implies. NAVY SHIP USNS HARVEY MILK TO BE RENAMED AS PART OF PENTAGON'S 'WARRIOR CULTURE' SHIFT Harvey Milk is not a hero to everyone in the United States. One can wholeheartedly support equal rights without celebrating homosexuality, and asking naval officers and civilians to serve on the USNS Harvey Milk does just that. The ship, which transports oil, isn’t named after Milk, who happened to be gay; it's named after Milkbecausehe was gay, and Hegseth is correct that this is wildly inappropriate. Why not the USNS Liberace? Think of the boon it would be to the domestic chandelier industry. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered the renaming of a U.S. Navy ship named after San Francisco gay rights activist Harvey Milk.(Fox News / The Will Cain Show and U.S. Navy's Military Sealift Command website) Progressives seem deeply confused these days about why they don’t appeal to young men, and I would like to submit that the USNS Harvey Milk is a pretty good example of why. You take some 18-year-old guy, maybe he watched \"Top Gun Maverick\" a few too many times and wants to be a warfighter, then you point and say, there’s your ship, it celebrates dudes making out with dudes. Let’s face it, most sailors in the Navy do not want to be sitting in a diner in 25 years wearing a ballcap that proudly states they served on the \"Harvey Milk,\" and that’s OK. Predictably, former House Speaker and San Francisco's own Rep. Nancy Pelosi decried the decision to rename the ship, calling it, \"a shameful vindictive erasure of those who fought to break down barriers…\" Close-up of American politician and Gay rights activist Harvey Milk (1930 - 1978) as he campaigns for a position on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, San Francisco, California, September 1977. (Photo by Janet Fries/Getty Images)(Janet Fries/Getty Images) Is there an element of revenge in Hegseth’s action? There might be, because for decades now Americans have been forced to swallow the bizarre notion that who you have sex with is something to be proud of, as if we should all applaud. For decades now, every June at ballgames and in TV ads, on municipal buildings and subway trains the rainbow flag has been everywhere, demanding your consent to celebrate gayness. In recent years, as the teal of the trans flag has bled into the rainbow, we have once again been told that we must accept an absurd lie that men can become women, as if this was just some a priori truth. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Not this time, and as America rejects the trans movement, it is also realizing that bending over backwards every June to cheer on homosexuality makes no sense in a society where gay people face little to no discrimination. A warship has one purpose, to help to destroy our enemies. Everything about the vessel should be directed towards that goal, including the name emblazoned on it. \"Harvey Milk\" fails that test. Throughout the first quarter of the 21st Century, progressives have made enormous gains in American society, and they have generally assumed that once their new norms are established, they cannot be undone. Hegseth, as he has done before by restoring the names of army bases changed by progressives, is showing thatwe can indeed go back. History is not a one-way ratchet that only turns left. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Progressives are firmly convinced that everything is an occasion for activism, that their preferred lifestyle and worldview should be threaded into every aspect of our lives. This is wrongheaded in general, but especially so in regard to warfare. Hegseth is popular with soldiers and vets alike because he understands that his primary job is to kill the enemy while keeping his guys alive. It's not to promote gay rights, it's not to foster social justice, it is to destroy. By all means, name a community center or a clinic after Harvey Milk, but not a warship. Those willing to put their lives on the line aboard deserve better.

    "title": "GREGG JARRETT: Biden, the 'marionette president' and the case of the runaway autopen",
    "article_text": "Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy has the latest on the Department of Justice investigating former President Joe Biden’s pardons and his alleged autopen usage on ‘The Faulkner Focus.’ There is mounting evidence that Joe Biden waspresident in name onlyduring much of his time in office. In his stead, a cabal of top White House staffers appears to have secretly operated a de facto presidency, making crucial decisions without a shred of constitutional authority. If proven true, it would call into question thevalidity of pardonsand executive orders issued under his name but without his knowledge or consent. For this reason, it is imperative that Biden’s closest advisers answer questions under oath and others in his orbit be forced to disclose what they knew or observed. TRUMP ORDERS ATTORNEY GENERAL TO PROBE BIDEN'S AUTOPEN USE AMID COGNITIVE CONCERNS The Department of Justice (DOJ) has launched an investigation into the pardons, commutations and clemencies granted in the waning days of Biden’s presidency, including preemptive pardons gifted to a half dozen members of his own family along with his shifty son, Hunter Biden. The probe focuses on whether the elder Biden was competent and whether others were taking advantage of his seemingly diminished mental state. At the same time, the House Oversight Committee is intensifying its own inquiry into the alleged \"cover-up\" of Biden’s cognitive decline. Of particular interest in both investigations is \"the potential unauthorized use of autopen\" for many executive actions, saidOversight Chairman James Comer. House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., is demanding three high-ranking staffers in former President Joe Biden’s White House appear for transcribed interviews on their suspected roles working \"behind the scenes\" to \"cover-up\" the former president’s significant mental decline during his term.(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File and Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) Did rogue actors commandeer the device from a clueless Biden to advance their own political and personal agendas? Was national security jeopardized in the process? Let’s call it, \"The Case of the Runaway Autopen.\" Solving it won’t be easy, given Washington’s proclivity for concealment, deception, obstruction and lies. Comer has requested that five former Biden aides, including his physician Kevin O’Connor, sit down for transcribed interviews.  If they resist, subpoenas will be issued. While Biden might assert Executive Privilege to keep them mum, President Trump could override the privilege just as Biden did to Trump after his first term. Assuming he is sentient, Joe might now wish he had not done so. The issue of whether pardons and executive orders could be invalidated is not as simple as some legal experts have opined. They assert, for example, that nothing can be done because there is no constitutional mechanism to revoke or overturn pardons once granted. That is only half true. WHAT IS AN AUTOPEN? THE SIGNING DEVICE AT THE HEART OF TRUMP'S QUESTIONING OF BIDEN PARDONS There is a well-established legal basis for annulling documents. It is founded in common law.  It is called fraud. Under statutory law, it is known as forgery. (See 18 USC 471 and 495). Each are crimes that would render the signed instruments inoperative and unenforceable. Just ask the U.S. Supreme Court, which long ago declared unanimously, \"There is no question of the general doctrine that fraud vitiates the most solemn contracts, documents, and even judgments.\" (United States v. Throckmorton, 98 US 61, (1878))  There exists no exception for presidential documents. But let’s back up. (DOJ/Getty) An autopen is a mechanical device that activates a robotic arm with a pen attached. It imitates a person’s signature, although it is identifiable by a consistent impression on the paper. Past presidents have utilized the autopen for a variety of documents. It is perfectly legal but with an important caveat —there must be consent by the purported \"signator.\" In this case, that’s Biden. If the 46th president never consented or, worse, had no knowledge of the autopen’s use for any given document bearing his signature, it could be deemed null and void under law. If Biden was not even competent or mentally fit to provide knowing consent, the result is the same. Two decades ago, the Justice Department formally approved presidential deployment of the autopen, but only if a President personally \"directs\" a subordinate to affix his signature to a specified document. However, the DOJ cautioned that the chief executive may never \"delegate\" the actual decision to approve and sign any document with the device. That right rests exclusively with a president. The sheer volume of suspected Biden autopen usage merits closer scrutiny. The growing number of descriptive accounts of his worsening mental infirmities and incoherence magnifies the need for an intensive investigation. If his aides deliberately obscured their boss’s health problems, did they also circumvent his permission for orders issued under his name? Did they act on their own because they knew Biden was not cognizant or otherwise feared his confused response? Americans deserve honest answers. But expecting to get them from highly secretive political operatives is fanciful at best. House Speaker Mike Johnson recently recounted his first private meeting with Biden last year during which the President had no idea that he signed an executive order weeks earlier pausing the exports of liquified natural gas. When Johnson pressed him, a stunned Biden insisted, \"I didn’t do that!\" The speaker patiently explained that he did and a copy could be retrieved, yet the President insisted, \"No, I didn’t do that.\" \"He genuinely did not know what he had signed,\" said Johnson later. \"And I walked out of that meeting with fear and loathing because I thought, ‘We are in serious trouble —who is running the country?’ Like, I don’t know who put the paper in front of him, but he didn’t know.\" It is possible that the executive order was signed by autopen without the consent or knowledge of the president. In the alternative, did Biden sign something that he was incapable of understanding? Perhaps his aides willfully misrepresented its contents. Or maybe Biden was so mentally impaired that he couldn’t remember what he had for breakfast, much less having signed an export ban that cratered American GDP by upwards of $200 billion. It is beyond curious that the preemptive pardons handed out like Halloween candy to Dr. Anthony Fauci, members of the J-6 committee and six of Biden’s immediate relatives all bear the unique marks of an autopen. By contrast, Hunter Biden’s pardon almost certainly resembles his father’s genuine and shaky signature. Why the difference? Did Biden verily approve or direct the group pardons? Or did someone command the autopen without assent? Hunter Biden's sweeping pardon was reportedly the only pardon signed by his father's hand. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)(Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) There is substantial and compelling evidence that Biden was sliding further and further into mental decay as his presidency progressed. Americans are right to wonder just who was running the country. Biden himself seemed to answer the question during several of his rare public outings. In one memorable appearance he said, \"Sorry, but I’ll get in trouble with my staff if I don’t do this the right way.\"  In another, a confused Biden turned to staffers and asked, \"Am I allowed to take questions? Where’s my staff?\" On a still another occasion he mumbled with regret, \"I thought when I got to be President, I’d get to do things I wanted to do, but my staff tells me what I can’t do.\" These are stunning confessionals. There is no need to recite the myriad of instances where Americans witnessed a faltering and enfeebled Biden wandering around a stage lost and bewildered. He was not \"compos mentis.\" His mental faculties dwindled. His ability to think and communicate vanished. It all came crashing down on the night of June 27, 2024. The disastrous presidential debate reinforced the truth of his withering condition. It is increasingly apparent that a coterie of unelected White House aides who connived to hide Biden’s declining state were the ones making vital decisions behind the scenes. They reportedly called themselves the \"Politburo,\" a nod to the ruling committee of the communist party in the former Soviet Union. The symmetry is not coincidental; it is revealing. They maneuvered and manipulated in a culture of dishonesty. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION With Biden mentally incapable of fully performing the demanding duties of his high office, it seems that others took it upon themselves to arrogate his authority. This would constitute a shameful abuse of power that contravenes our constitutional framework. It merits comprehensive investigations by both Congress and the Department of Justice. In responding to the probes, Biden issued a statement on Wednesday insisting, \"I made the decisions about pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations,\" adding that \"any suggestion that I didn’t is ridiculous and false.\" The denial is no surprise. But is it more of the same pretense and cover-up that came to define his presidency? Did Joe even write that statement? CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Almost five years ago in my August 2020 podcast, I warned that if Joe Biden was elected, he would become a \"Marionette President\" controlled by unscrupulous White House puppeteers making critical decisions for the nation. I wasn’t prescient, only paying attention to what was plainly visible. What is so confounding —and equally alarming— is how long the deceitful charade lasted. As it slowly unravels, we are reminded that calculating lies rarely endure the engine of truth.

    "title": "Ukraine crushes Putin’s bombers, but can China and Russia do the same to the US?",
    "article_text": "Retired Army Lt. Col. Chuck DeVore discusses Ukraine drone strikes targeting Russian airbases on 'The Will Cain Show.' WithOperation Spider’s Web,Ukraine inflicted the worst attack on Russian air power since World War II. The final damage is yet to be determined, but one tally is nine Tu-95s and three Tu-22M3 bombers gone, along with an A-50 \"Mainstay\" radar plane and an unlucky An-22 transport plane. Whatever the final count, the strategic impact is clear. Never before have drones taken out a big chunk of a nuclear-capable bomber force. Unlike tanks, Russian PresidentVladimir Putincannot replace his bombers because none are still in production. They’ll be chopping up the wreckage for parts once the smoldering carcasses cool down. Here’s what Putin’s lost, and why the U.S. should beworried about drone threatsfrom China. UKRAINE’S SURPRISE ATTACK SHOWS IT MAY TAKE A ‘MAJOR DRONE STRIKE’ TO CHANGE US DEFENSE POLICY, EXPERTS SAY Before Sunday, Russia’s air force had about 55 Tu-95 Bear bombers and as many as 57 Tu-22 bombers.Russia’s bombersare not aeronautically impressive, but they deliver lethal Russian cruise missiles, hypersonic missiles and, of course, they can be armed with nuclear weapons, too. In this image taken from video released June 1, 2025, by a source in the Ukrainian Security Service shows a Ukrainian drone striking Russian planes deep in Russia's territory.(Ukrainian Security Service via AP) The Tu-95 \"Bear\" is that ugly, four-engine plane with contra-rotating propellers and the long refueling probe above the cockpit. Since 2007, Putin has used the Bear to harass U.S. and NATO airspace. Don’t forget a pair of Tu-95 Bears barged into Alaskan airspace along with two Chinese planes last year, which is typical behavior for them. The Tu-22M3 \"Backfire\" is a supersonic jet that was supposed to be sleek, but turned out gawky like most Soviet designs. The Tu-22’s Cold War mission was to launch high-speed cruise missiles at U.S. Navy ships. Instead, Tu-22 squadrons ended up bombing Syria a decade ago. The Tu-95 and Tu-22 squadrons no doubt thought they were hotshots. Until Sunday. UKRAINE’S 'SPIDER’S WEB' DRONE STRIKE BURNS OVER 40 RUSSIAN WARPLANES, MOSCOW CALLS IT 'TERRORIST ATTACK' Ukraine’s reason was clear enough. Russian tactics are vile. Armed Tu-95s and Tu-22s take off from their bases, reach altitude, fly to a designated point, and launch cruise missiles against Ukraine, all while staying inside the sanctuary of Russian airspace. Ukraine’s air defenses do a great job knocking down inbound missiles and drones. But they can’t reach far enough to take out the bombers while in flight. During Putin’s blitzes of Ukraine’s cities, the A-50 \"Mainstay\" dome-mounted radar plane monitors Ukraine air defenses and provides command and control for Russian bombers launching missiles. Ukraine has already shot down two A-50s and the drones got another on Sunday. Good riddance. Ukraine’sdrone strike was an important blow.But this is an attack that must be taken seriously by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and planners in the Pentagon, as they revive America’s industrial base. What stunned me was the timing:near-simultaneous attacksat multiple Russian bases. By using 117 drones smuggled into Russia, the close-in attacks achieved surprise and left no time for the Russians to activate electronic warfare or other defenses. Apparently, unsuspecting Russian truckers said they were hired to deliver modular houses. Then the lids of their cargo loads opened and drones flew out. RUSSIA LAUNCHES LARGEST AERIAL ATTACK OF UKRAINE WAR, KILLING AT LEAST 12 Even more consequential was the reach of the strikes. Belaya airbase is in Siberia, 3,000 miles from Kyiv, near Lake Baikal. They lost 4 Tu-95s, 3 Tu-22s and the A-50. Olenya airbase is up on the Kola peninsula near Murmansk. The local Barents Observer photographed columns of oily black smoke billowing into the air, probably from the 5 Tu-95s, hitting that base. Putin should have known better. Ukraine’s drones hit the Kremlin in May 2023. Other attacks have damaged Su-24 and Su-30 fighters parked in occupied Crimea.Ukrainehas hit Russian bombers with smaller drone attacks, like one in August 2023 that claimed two Tu-95s. Russian Tupolev Tu-95 Strategic Bomber fly during a military parade marking the Belarus Independence Day in Minsk. A pair of Russian Tu-95 Bear-H bombers were intercepted flying in international airspace near Alaska.(Reuters) Yet beyond question, the coordinated drone strike of June 1, 2025, opened a new chapter in drone warfare. \"Yesterday was a really good example of just how quickly technology is changing the battlefield,\" Army Chief of Staff General Randy George said Monday, June 2. Operation Spider’s Web should send a chill down the spine of every U.S. base commander. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Right now, the U.S. military also needs to be asking: what if a Russian or Chinese \"fishing vessel\" off the coast of Guam or Virginia Beach pops open drones to attack U.S. bombers or fighters lined up on runways? B-52s and B-1s are based mainly in the heartland, and the B-2s live in climate-controlled hangars in Missouri. However, the bombers sit out on host nation runways when deployed around the globe on Bomber Task Force missions. PENTAGON ANNOUNCES NEW COUNTER-DRONE STRATEGY AS UNMANNED ATTACKS ON US INTERESTS SKYROCKET It's not just trucks and containers launching drones. In May, China showed off its Jiu Tan drone carrier, an unmanned plane with an 82-foot wingspan that carriers up to 100 smaller drones. To an American fighter pilot, China’s drone mothership is one big fat target, but you get the idea. Enemy drones can come from anywhere. It takes tremendous intelligence and surveillance and help from AI to keep track of all the possible Chinese attack vectors. Even more consequential was the reach of the strikes. Belaya air base is in Siberia, 3,000 miles from Kyiv, near Lake Baikal. They lost 4 Tu-95s, 3 Tu-22s and the A-50. Olenya airbase is up on the Kola peninsula near Murmansk. ThePentagonfinished a classified counter-drone strategy last December and has many ways to protect our planes against drones. Close in, the Army and Marines have systems like the Coyote, a 24-inch drone that intercepts other drones. Fighter jets are a great counter-drone weapon. Central Command deployed F-15s to Diego Garcia to protect B-2 and B-52 bombers. Back in January 2024, Navy F/A-18EF Superhornets from the USS Eisenhower shot down five Houthi drones with air-to-air missiles.

    "title": "DR MARC SIEGEL: Grandma and Grandpa are turning golden years into a high time and it’s not safe",
    "article_text": "Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel breaks down the latest reports on marijuana use and outlines its potential side effects on 'The Ingraham Angle.' With over50 million peoplein this country using cannabis in the past year, and the numbers continuing to skyrocket, it is disturbing to discover that the latest group to jump onto this bandwagon are a vulnerable group who can least afford to use weed from the perspective of their health; namely grandma and grandpa. Indeed, theelderly over 65are using marijuana products more and more, an increase of close to 50% from 2021 to 2023, with a total of 7% of seniors current users, according to new research just published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine. But it is clear to me there are several misconceptions feeding this increased usage, the first being that marijuana is somehow safer than alcohol or cigarettes. In fact, another study just published from the University of California San Francisco reveals that THC, the active ingredient inmarijuana products,damages the lining of blood vessels (which can lead to hypertension, heart attacks and strokes), just as much as cigarette smoke does. MORE SENIORS ARE USING CANNABIS THAN EVER BEFORE DESPITE HEALTH RISKS, RESEARCH SHOWS And too often bothalcohol and marijuanaare combined, especially problematic in elderly drivers who may already be exhibiting subpar performance. Deadly car crashes involving both alcohol and marijuana have more than doubled in the U.S. over the past two decades and the number continues to rise. Marijuana is rising in popularity among seniors. FILE: Marijuana plants are seen at an upstate growing facility, Washington County, New York, May 12, 2023.(AP Photo/Hans Pennink, File) Another misconception is that marijuana is safe for people who can’t sleep or are having anxiety problems. In fact, cannabis can lead to IQ decline, poorer learning or processing, and tap cognitive reserves, especially problematic in seniors who may already be showing signs of cognitive decline. And regularcannabis usewith higher amounts of THC can worsen anxiety and even lead to psychosis in those with underlying mental health problems. Another false idea prompting increased cannabis use is that the amount of THC in a cannabis product is a constant, when in fact the active psychoactive ingredient in cannabis keeps increasing in concentration. 20th century weed was far less potent than today’s 30-50% THC content weed. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION This generation’s cannabis is hardly the same product as last generation’s. And keep in mind that older people metabolize chemicals in their body more slowly, meaning that the psychological and physical impact is greater for a longer period of time. HEAVY CANNABIS USE COULD POSE THIS THREAT TO THE BRAIN But the notion that bothers me the most as a practicing internist is, thatcannabis is supposed to be medically usefulfor chronic pain or sleeplessness and that somehow this sanctions its use for everything. In fact, even the medical uses of marijuana products have never been proven. If cannabis helps for chronic pain, it is a most often a minimal effect, which doesn’t justify the side effects. And yet, medical marijuana’s widespread acceptance has led to pressure for full legalization and increased recreational use (now fully legal in 24 states with more to follow). CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The last thing we need among our cherished older people who are trying to hang on to optimal functioning as long as possible is something addicting that actually  pushes them in the direction of suboptimal performance. Regular use can also lead toCannabis Use Disorder,where a person becomes addicted to a substance that they crave, that they develop a tolerance to, and which is difficult to stop without withdrawal symptoms. And if an elderly person takes more and more THC-laden gummies to help them sleep, they may become more anxious as a result, or even psychotic.

    "title": "REP BRETT GUTHRIE: GOP fights to protect Medicaid for America's most vulnerable while Democrats fearmonger",
    "article_text": "California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom is proposing to reign in some aspects of offering Medicaid to illegal immigrants in the state, as Republicans and Democrats in the legislature have starkly different views on the policy overall. It’s been almost two weeks since the House of Representatives passed the\"One, Big, Beautiful Bill\" Act (OBBBA).Yet, we continue to hear constant fearmongering by my Democrat colleagues. I’ll remind you that the OBBBA makes tremendous strides in providing further tax cuts for middle-class, working families, promoting American manufacturing and energy dominance, and importantly, protecting the integrity of our healthcare programs to support our most vulnerable Americans. It is a top priority of House Republicans to eliminate the waste, fraud and abuse in the programs and safeguard expectant mothers, their children, low-income seniors and especially individuals living with disabilities who are receiving Medicaid coverage. Regrettably, Democrats continue to fuel the falsehood that 13 million individuals will lose healthcare coverage under OBBBA. TRUMP PUSHES 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' AS SOLUTION TO FOUR YEARS OF BIDEN FAILURES: 'LARGEST TAX CUT, EVER' According to theCongressional Budget Office,millions of ineligible individuals are receiving benefits through Medicaid, with 1.6 million people enrolled in two state Medicaid programs at the same time (and getting care paid for in both states), 1.4 million illegal immigrants, and 1.2 million enrollees who no longer qualify for eligibility. CBO also assumes there are 4.8 million able-bodied adults without dependents who would rather lose Medicaid coverage than choose to work or give back to their communities. Continuing to direct scarce resources to these ineligible recipients ultimately takes away from Americans truly in need. Demonstrators calling for preservation of Medicaid funding, are removed from the House Energy and Commerce markup of the FY2025 budget resolution in Rayburn building on Tuesday, May 13, 2025.(Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) Through the OBBBA, Republicans are strengthening the Medicaid program by removing ineligible beneficiaries and sustaining the program for our most vulnerable Americans. When states are no longer paying for those who shouldn’t be enrolled in the first place, that frees up money they can invest for those who actually need the care most. As chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, please allow me to tell you the truth: pregnant women, children, seniors, and individuals living with a disability are protected under this legislation. NATIONAL DEBT TRACKER: AMERICAN TAXPAYERS (YOU) ARE NOW ON THE HOOK FOR $36,215,207,426,690.65 AS OF 6/4/25 During our 26-and-a-half-hour marathon markup, Democrats shared stories using scare-tactics, not facts. The Democrats cited story after story about vulnerable individuals who rely on Medicaid for their daily care – like children and people with disabilities and their families – and the fact is, this bill does not impact them. If anything, we are protecting Medicaid for them. Every vulnerable American who needs Medicaid should be protected and have access to care. That’s why House Republicans have thoughtfully curated a bill that realigns incentives in Medicaid for states to care for the most vulnerable over individuals who aren’t eligible for the program, including illegal immigrants. While Medicaid is predominantly funded by the federal government, states are in the driver’s seat and contribute at least a third of all Medicaid costs, ultimately determining which individuals are covered, what services they receive, and how much taxpayers pay for their care. Our bill reverses a Biden-Harris policy that prohibited states from removing ineligible individuals from their rolls. GOP RAILS AGAINST 'BLATANTLY FALSE' DEM CLAIMS ABOUT MEDICAID REFORM IN TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' When top-down mandates from Washington crowd out state decision-making, states lose their ability to focus their efforts on core services for vulnerable populations. Our bill changes this. For example, the commonsense community-engagement requirements, also known aswork requirements,require that states ensure that able-bodied adults without dependents are either working a part-time job, participating in educational programs, or volunteering in their community for 80 hours per month in order to receive Medicaid benefits. Additionally, the bill repeals oppressive Biden-Harris era mandates that forced states to impose unrealistic staffing requirements for nursing homes that were set to close facilities and severely restrict access to care. The Biden-Harris regulators also prohibited states from following standard procedures to disenroll people who are ineligible for coverage, or even fraudulently enrolled, in Medicaid. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The rational policies in the House bill that stops coverage for illegal immigrants and allows states to remove deceased and duplicative enrollees, and otherwise ineligible beneficiaries from state Medicaid programs further ensures our federal dollars are serving the population that Medicaid was created to protect. As chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, please allow me to tell you the truth: pregnant women, children, seniors, and individuals living with a disability are protected under this legislation. We must remember that even with the Energy and Commerce Committee’s title creating savings of over $1 trillion, we still don’t halt the rapid pace at which the Medicaid program is growing. WINNERS, LOSERS AND GRAB-BAGS FROM HOUSE GOP’S NARROW PASSAGE OF ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL’ While the Committee’s savings help to slow the growth of the program, Medicaid is projected to grow by an estimated 25% by 2034. Over the next decade, spending in the program is expected to increase by over $1 trillion above inflation. Only Washington Democrats would say that increased funding is a cut. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Every dollar misspent on illegal immigrants and ineligible individuals in the Medicaid program means less money going to our children, our pregnant women and mothers, individuals who are disabled, and seniors. It is disappointing that Democrats are prioritizing politics through lies and fearmongering instead of actually helping the most vulnerable Americans. House Republicans make no apologies for our continued fight to strengthen government programs that have since been riddled with waste, fraud, and abuse. Republican Rep. Brett Guthrie represents Kentucky's 2nd Congressional District in the United States House of Representatives. He is chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.",

    "title": "SEN JOHN CORNYN: Congress must reimburse Texas for Biden’s border security malpractice",
    "article_text": "Fox News senior White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich has the latest on the White House's response to the antisemitic terror attack on 'Special Report.' The government’s most basic duty is to keep its citizens safe.President Joe Bidenwoefully neglected to fulfill this obligation, allowing our borders to be overrun by millions of unvetted illegal immigrants, criminal aliens and cartels smuggling deadly synthetic opioids. Far from Washington, border states like Texas were left to suffer the consequences. Texas spent billions of dollars on Operation Lone Star in an attempt to abate this catastrophe. We all oweGov. Greg Abbotta debt of gratitude for doing what the Biden administration wouldn’t, but we also owe Texas a monetary debt. Now the bill is due: it’s time for the federal government to pay Texas taxpayers back. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and former President Joe Biden From the moment he arrived at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, President Biden reversed the previous administration’s successful immigration policies: he ended PresidentDonald Trump’s \"Remain in Mexico\" policy; directed DHS to halt construction of the border wall, instead using federal funds to store wall materials; and ended Title 42, the COVID-era policy that was our last line of defense against the migrant surge. TRUMP’S DESIGNATION OF CARTELS AS TERRORISTS ENDS THE FICTION THAT MEXICO IS A TRUSTWORTHY ALLY President Biden oversaw a crisis on our southern border that far surpassed illegal migration numbers from prior decades. In Biden’s four years, CBP encountered over 10 million illegal immigrants. More than 1.7 million known gotaways evaded Border Patrol entirely and are freely roaming somewhere in the interior of our country. Hundreds of thousands of Americans died from overdose of synthetic opioids, including fentanyl, a drug manufactured with Chinese precursor chemicals and smuggled through our open border by drug cartels. Innocent Americans such as Laken Riley and Jocelyn Nungaray died at the hands of illegal migrant criminals. Despite theimmigration authoritiesthat were already available to President Biden, he threw up his hands, claiming that there was nothing more he could do – all while his Homeland Security secretary reassured the public that the border was \"secure.\" But facts don’t lie. The whole world knew America’s borders were wide open. This tragic crisis was felt most acutely in Texas. My state shares the longest border with Mexico, and with the president missing in action in the midst of a disaster, Gov. Abbott had to intervene. IF WE CAN’T DEPORT ILLEGALS, HERE'S HOW WE CAN MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO STAY Under Operation Lone Star,Texas law enforcementapprehended over half a million illegal immigrants, including more than 50,000 criminal arrests. They built more than 240 miles of border barriers, seized over half a billion deadly doses of fentanyl and reduced illegal immigration into Texas by 87%, according to the governor. However, these efforts cost upwards of $11 billion, a pretty penny for Texans to pay for the basic safety and security that the federal government owes its people. If there is any lingering question that President Biden’s policies are to blame for the mess we saw at our southern border, consider President Trump’s swift success in reversing the damage. As soon he was elected and even before he took office, the migrant flows began to subside. In the first two weeks of 2025, CBP encounters were nearly 50% lower than they were at the same point in 2021, at the start of the Biden administration. In President Trump’s first 100 days in office, daily border encounters decreased by 95%. I REPRESENT A BORDER DISTRICT THAT WAS SWAMPED BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. WHAT I'M SEEING NOW MIGHT SURPRISE YOU This dramatic sea change resulted from President Trump andHomeland SecuritySecretary Kristi Noem’s commonsense policies. On day one, President Trump declared a national emergency at the southern border. He ended President Biden’s \"catch and release\" policy and reinstated his own tried-and-tested \"Remain in Mexico\" policy. ICE arrests have increased by more than 600%, while arrests of criminal migrants have doubled. The Trump administration’s policies are a welcome change from the past four years of disaster under the Biden administration. But the damage Texas experienced and the financial sacrifice we made for the good of the country must be fully repaid. The federal government under President Biden created this crisis, and Congress must rectify it. Texans have had to bear the brunt of open borders, rampant crime and deadly fentanyl for four years, costing the state billions of dollars to fill in for our absentee commander in chief. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION In late January, Gov. Abbott asked Congress to reimburse Texas for the $11.1 billion that Texas taxpayers spent. I immediately began working in partnership with President Trump, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Texas Republicans in the House, to ensure Congress fulfills this request through the reconciliation bill, also known as the \"One Big Beautiful Bill.\" Rep. Chip Roy attends President Donald Trump's address to a joint session of Congress at the U.S. Capitol on March 4, 2025.(Win McNamee/Getty Images) Texas Republicans make up the largest Republican delegation in the U.S.House of Representatives; thus the speaker could not pass a bill without support from this key voting bloc. It was unacceptable that the initial text of the legislation released by the House did not reimburse Texas. But thanks to coordinating efforts with Congressman Chip Roy, R-Texas, language to reimburse states like Texas was added to the legislation during the amendment process, and the House passed these provisions in the One Big Beautiful Bill. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The next hurdle is to shepherd our reimbursement provisions through the Senate. I will continue working with Leader Thune, Gov. Abbott and President Trump to ensure the Senate includes even stronger language in the One Big Beautiful Bill and that Texas specifically will be rightfully repaid for Operation Lone Star. I will continue fighting to ensure this language remains in the final version of the One Big Beautiful Bill that will go to the president’s desk. The road to victory is long, but if there’s one thing us Texans know how to do it’s to stay the course and defy the odds. President Biden abdicated his responsibility as commander in chief at thesouthern border.

    "title": "MORNING GLORY: Antisemitism is shameful and evil. None of us should ever be neutral on such hate",
    "article_text": "Ruthie Blum, senior contributing editor at JNS and former adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, says a recent rise in antisemitism is a 'sign of a decaying society.' An attack on any Jew in America is an attack on every Jew in America. It does not matter if the victim of the intended violence was murdered, maimed or escaped unharmed. It does not matter in the least if the targeted Jew was an American, an American-Israeli, a Jew from a third country, or a gentile mistaken for a Jew or an Israeli, or a supporter of either the Jewish people or the state of Israel. ANTISEMITIC VIOLENCE ERUPTS IN AMERICA AS SOME INVOKE INTIFADA AND TARGET JEWS The perpetrators of the violence are all evil. Deeply evil. Diseased in mind and soul. Video stills of a man later identified as Mohamed Soliman throwing an incendiary device into a group of pro-Israel supporters (off camera) in Boulder, Colorado, Sunday, June 1, 2025. Soliman was subsequently arrested by police.(Alex Osante) Their accomplices, whether in the display of action or via expressed or unexpressed sympathy —and including the apologists thereof attempting to explain motives — all are evil. As a Catholic Christian, I believe in Hell. Those who indulgeantisemitismin act or word or in the silence of their mind are headed to Hell absent genuine repentance. For antisemitism is the exact opposite of Christian beliefs and practice. RISE IN ANTISEMITIC EXTREMISM FUELS WAVE OF TERROR PLOTS IN THE UNITED STATES SINCE 2020 The \"Church, mindful of the patrimony she shares with the Jews and moved not by political reasons but by the Gospel's spiritual love,\" stated the document, \"Nostra Aetate of the Second Vatican Council in 1965, \"decries hatred, persecutions, displays of antisemitism, directed against Jews at any time and by anyone.\" So, let’s hear this in some homilies this Sunday and from the pulpits of Protestant churches. The Catholic Church’s doctrine was unequivocal in its condemnation of antisemitism: \"At any time.\" By \"anyone.\" Including, of course, theattacks on Jews in Boulder, Colorado,on June 1, 2025, the murder of two Israeli diplomats in Washington, D.C. on May 21, 2025, outside the Lillian and Albert Small Capital Jewish Museum, and the firebombing of the home of Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro on April 13, 2025. Antisemitism extends far back in the U.S. to the numerous attacks against Jews on American campuses and streets since October 7, 2023, and to the long trail of antisemitic violence before that horrific massacre which came primarily from the far right, including the attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, on October 27, 2018, and the attack on April 27, 2019, atChabad of Poway synagoguein Poway, California. BOULDER TERROR ATTACK LATEST IN ANTISEMITIC INCIDENTS RISING ACROSS US IN 2025 The\"Unite the Right\" rallyin Charlottesville, Virginia, in August of 2017, like its predecessor proposed march of the Nazis in Skokie, Illinois, in 1976, are more recent examples. (The march in Skokie never happened but was moved to Chicago after extensive litigation upholding the right of the antisemites to march.) Those are just incidents in my memory. American antisemitism has a long and shameful history. People gather to light candles in a makeshift memorial to honor Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, who were killed as they left an event at the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, during a candlelight vigil outside the White House in Washington, Thursday, May 22, 2025.(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, file) But so too does non-Jewish opposition to antisemitism have a distinguished pedigree which includes, most famously, President George Washington’s 1790 letter to the Jewish congregation in Newport, Rhode Island. US POLITICIANS, JEWISH GROUPS CONDEMN 'HORRIFYING' BOULDER TERROR ATTACK: 'VILE, ANTISEMITIC ACT OF TERROR' The \"father of our country\" wrote then that the new nation he was helping build would give \"to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance.\"President Donald Trump’s condemnationsof the violence directed at Jews has been equally unequivocal. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Good. There has always been clarity on this issue. Too many, however, dodge the horror. Where is the non-Jewish chattering class today? Mostly silent or mumbling or posting attempts to link the criminals to Trump, or Elon Musk or a dozen different excuses. \"But, but, but\" is the first refuge of the Jew hater afraid to go public. There are some notable exceptions to the quiet or the equivocal. \"The Editors\" podcast from National Review of June 2, titled \"Horror in Colorado,\" set an excellent bar of condemnation, but it has far too few equivalents in either the conservative or legacy press. Indeed, there are many accomplices to the ancient evil online and in print. Five for Fighting’s John Ondrasik released a reimagined version of his hit song \"Superman\" to honor Israeli hostages held in Gaza and raise global awareness. The music video features a childhood photo of hostage Alon Ohel dressed as Superman.(Five for Fighting) Silence is indeed complicity right now, and outright complicity in knowingly platforming antisemitism is especially repugnant at a moment when diseased minds seem poised to follow the examples of the criminals in D.C. and Boulder. Match meet gasoline. Who and where, exactly, is today’s equivalent of the French journalist and novelist Émile Zola played a key role in defending Alfred Dreyfus through his famous \"J'accuse\" open letter, published in the newspaper L'Aurore in January 1898. (If you’d like to learn the outline of the Dreyfus affair, try the excellent 2013 novel by Robert Harris, \"An Officer and a Spy.\" The complicated persecution of Dreyfus can be difficult to trace more than 125 years after the fact, but Harris does it for the reader in an excellent example of the good that historical fiction can do to repair the damage done by the collapse of elementary and secondary education in world history in the U.S.) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP There are columnists and platforms of note. Have they filed yet? There are athletes and musicians and actors who are quick to rally to popular causes which trigger cascades of virtue signaling. Have they posted? I have yet to see a hashtag or open letter demanding the shaming and shunning of antisemitism in America. Perhaps such a statement is circulating now and about to appear. Perhaps a \"We Are the World\" is even now being rehearsed, recorded and set for release that will condemn this latest American variant of the ancient evil. Thus far, though, the silence is deafening. Singer-songwriter John Ondrasik of \"Five for Fighting\" has set the example. Will anyone else from the vast community of media join him?

    "title": "Educational Choice for Children Act: A tax break for the rich, not a lifeline for students",
    "article_text": "Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., discusses the House passing the ‘big, beautiful bill’ on ‘Hannity.’ Like many Americans this summer, I’ll be heading to a football stadium to see Beyoncé deliver two hours of magic on herCowboy Carter Tour. I paid a premium for those tickets – and I’m OK with that. It was my choice – not something I can deduct from my taxes or expect to be federally subsidized. That’s the way it should be. The same goes for my guilty pleasure: \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians.\" I don’t mind watching the antics of one of America’s most famous (and wealthiest) families, but I’d never ask taxpayers to help fund their children’sprivate school tuition. Instead of helping students in underfunded schools, measures like the ECCA divert public dollars to families who already have access to private education.(iStock) And yet, some in Congress think that’s precisely what we should do. TRUMP'S DECISION TO GUT THE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT IS NOT ONLY ILLEGAL, IT'S WRONG A proposal quietly tucked into the House GOP’s reconciliation package, part of what’s being marketed as PresidentDonald Trump’s \"Big, Beautiful Bill,\" would give wealthy individuals and corporations a 100% federal tax credit for donations to private school scholarship funds. This proposal – the Educational Choice for Children Act (ECCA) – effectively allows wealthy donors to turn tuition into a tax write-off. That’s right. This plan, currently before the U.S. Senate, would allow billionaires to \"donate\" to their kids’ private schools – and then receive every cent back in tax relief, at the expense of American taxpayers. This is not a small-dollar program. The measure could siphon more than $10 billion away from federal revenues, funds that could otherwise strengthen our nation’s public schools. Now, I don’t think Blue Ivy Carter or North West needs our help getting into elite institutions. However, the backers of this bill, such as House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik, have argued that it’s primarily about helping working-class students escape \"low-performing\" schools. A FAILING NATION'S REPORT CARD PROVES NEED FOR SWEEPING CHANGE \"It will encourage more individuals and businesses to invest in our children’s futures,\" Stefanik said, \"by establishing a 75%federal tax creditfor qualified charitable contributions made to nonprofit schools with proven success.\" That sounds good – until you look at the evidence. In practice, measures like ECCA have the opposite effect. Instead of helping students in underfunded schools, they divert public dollars to families who already have access to private education. We’ve seen it happen in more than 20 states, where private schools receive more than $1 billion each year through similar tax credits, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. A 2023 report in St. Louis Today revealed that most students receiving vouchers in Missouri were already attending private schools, while only 35% came from public schools. In other words, this isn’t about opportunity. It’s about entitlement. WHY I DEDICATED MY BOOK ON SCHOOL CHOICE TO RANDI WEINGARTEN Every year, public schools educate nearly 50 million students – more than 90% of the nation’s children. These taxpayer-funded institutions have produced extraordinary alumni, including the CEOs of Apple, Walmart and the majority of Fortune 500 companies. Public schools are where kids learn how to live and work in a diverse democracy. They’re not perfect, but they are essential. Educators know thisbetter than anyone. A 2024 Pew Research Center survey of more than 2,300 public school teachers found that most feel underpaid, under-supported and under-resourced. Respondents also reported a deep commitment to their students and their profession. More than half of these educators said they wished the public understood the difficulty of their job. Teachers across the U.S. are clear: students don’t need more \"choice\" – they need more investment. As one Kentucky educator told the Louisville Courier Journal earlier this year, \"If lawmakers actually stepped into our classrooms, they’d see what we’re doing with so little. Give us more counselors, working air conditioning, and reading specialists – don’t hand tax breaks to people who already have advantages.\" MY VISION FOR ELIMINATING THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION These educators are on the front lines. They’re not asking for handouts. They’re asking for fairness – and for policies that reflect the real needs of public school communities. It’s worth noting that the original pitch behindvoucher programs– dating back to the early 2000s – was to help low-income families in struggling urban districts. But decades of research have shown that voucher students don’t perform significantly better in reading or math than their public school peers. Meanwhile, the programs have drained resources from the very schools most in need of help. That’s not reform. That’s abandonment. The concept of \"school choice\" has become a catch-all for undermining public education without explicitly stating so. But make no mistake: this is a wealth transfer in disguise, and ECCA is its latest vehicle. As a son of immigrants and a proud product of public schools, I know firsthand what public education can offer. I’ve seen how classrooms can unlock potential and teachers can change lives. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION I’ve also seen what happens when we neglect those systems and call it innovation. This isn’t just bad policy. It’s a betrayal of the American promise. Let’s be clear: families have every right to choose private or religious schools for their children. But they shouldn’t expect the rest of us to foot the bill.Tax dollarsshould be allocated where the need is greatest – schools that serve all students, regardless of their ZIP code, income or background. At a time when the country feels increasingly divided, our public schools are one of the few places where kids from every walk of life still come together. That’s something worth protecting, not defunding. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Or, to borrow a phrase from Queen Bey herself, what’s happening with this bill is more than just a bad idea. It’s a requiem for the American ideal. Let’s not let it play out.

The IPO pop demonstrates public market investors’ interest in cryptocurrencies and stablecoins in particular amid the Trump administration’s supportive stance on crypto assets. The significant surge in Circle’s first-day trading could prompt institutional investors to set higher IPO prices for upcoming listings. Imminent IPOs include Omada Health, which is pricing on Thursday, and Klarna, a fintech that’s set to list next week. The company’s IPO share price set its initial market value at $6.1 billion, a figure that fell short of Circle’s last private market valuation of $7.7 billion from 2021 when the company raised a $400 million Series F, according to PitchBook data. But the big pop cleaned that up, and then some. Circle’s market capitalization (excluding employee options) stood at $16.7 billion by the close of trading. And the company raised about $1.1 billion in the offering. Circle joins a growing list of companies whose IPOs are priced below their private market highs, including recent “down-round” offerings from health techHinge, contractor platformServiceTitan, and social networkReddit. So that’s not likely to dissuade startups looking for signs that now is the right time to go public. Circle’s successful IPO comes three years after Circle’s previous attempt at going public. The stablecoin issuer had plans to combine with a SPAC in 2022 at a $9 billion valuation.

And while many predicted the Trump-Musk pair-up would eventually sour, it’s still worth asking and trying to answer, “How did we get here?” Until recently, Musk has been a key figure in Trump’s inner circle. The connection has affected broad swaths of the government, notably through theDepartment of Government Efficiency, an organization created by an executive order and advised by Musk. Musk, once a fixture at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, and in the White House, has now turned against the president. The source of his discontent: theOne Big Beautiful Bill Act, a 1,038-page piece of legislation that was passed May 22 by the House of Representatives. It now heads to the Senate, the next step in the bill’s path toward becoming a law.Days later, Trump withdrew his nomination of Jared Isaacman, Musk’s pick to head NASA — a move widely viewed as evidence of their faltering relationship. But even through the end of the month, Trump and Musk publicly played nice. The mood shifted — in a public, scorched-earth kind of way — this week. “I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore,” Muskwroteon X on Tuesday. “This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.” I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore.This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination.Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it. The bill is presented as an effort to cut taxes and invest in American businesses. However, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO)estimatesthat while the bill will cut taxes by $3.7 trillion, it will increase the national debt by $2.4 trillion over 10 years and raise the country’s debt ceiling by$4 trillion. This impact on the country’s existing debt crisis has two Republican senators, Rand Paul (R-KY) and Ron Johnson (R-WI), breaking from their party’s stance tooppose the billin its current state. The bill’s impacts are vast; among numerous other effects, it removes taxes from Social Security income, tips, and overtime pay. The bill also makes massive cuts to federal healthcare programs like Medicaid and SNAP. The CBO estimates that, by making massive cuts to federal healthcare programs, almost11 millionmore people will lack health insurance by 2034. The bill would also make the effects of Trump’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act from his first term permanent, thougheconomists have foundthat these cuts had more benefit for the richest Americans than the poorest. Additional tax cuts in Trump’s new bill are also expected tobenefit wealthy familiesmore than those in need. Musk isn’t wrong when he says some representatives who voted for the bill are already regretting it. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) admitted that she had not read the thousand-page bill in its entirety andregrets endorsing itbecause it would prevent individual states regulating AI for the next decade. The dispute between Trump and Musk escalated further Thursday, when the president was asked about the Tesla and SpaceX leader’s rejection of the bill. Trump claims that Musk was deeply familiar with his plans for the bill but recoiled when he learned it would negatively impact his business. “He only developed a problem when he found out that we’re going to have to cut the EV mandate,” Trump said, referring to policies that incentivize the production and sale of electric vehicles, like the ones Tesla makes. “That’s billions and billions of dollars.” Musk went on to claim that Trump only won the election because of his help. Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate. “Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,” Musk said on X. The two entrepreneurs have continued to make jabs at each other on their respective social media platforms — and it’s escalating. “Elon was ‘wearing thin,’ I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!” Trump wrote on Truth Social. In another post, Trumpadded, “The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!” Muskposteda screenshot of Trump’s post and added that he would decommission SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft as a result of the president’s statement. Musk has continued on with a barrage of posts on X against the president, who he spent$288 millionto help elect. Musk thenaccusedTrump of being in the Epstein Files, referring to the financier Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual exploitation of children. Trump has not responded to the allegation. Musk alsodeclaredthat the Trump tariffs will cause a recession in the latter half of this year, and he posted an agreement with another user’s post saying thatTrump should be impeached. While the public fight has launched frantic levels of posting on X, popcorn emojis, and memes declaring that “the girls are fighting,” the fallout between the world’s richest person and a sitting U.S. president promises to have broader implications for the tech industry. Following Trump’s lead, other tech billionaires like Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and Apple CEO Tim Cook donated to Trump’s inauguration fund. Trump’s policies have already had negative repercussions for some of these companies’ businesses through enforcing heavy tariffs on international imports.

If confirmed, this would be the second failed mission of the HAKUTO-R commercial lunar exploration program, two years aftera previous crash that had already shattered hopes. This loss will be particularly felt in Japan;ispace, the company behind HAKUTO-R and the currently missingResilience landerthat carried Tenacious, is apublicly listedJapanese company. But it is also a blow to Europe: The European Space Agency (ESA)supportedthe mission; and the rover was designed, assembled, tested, and manufactured by ispace-EUROPE out of Luxembourg. Luxembourg isn’t just ispace-EUROPE’s base — it’s the reason the entity was created in 2017. As part of itsSpaceResources.luinitiative, the tiny country became the second in the world after the U.S. to adopt a law giving companies the right to own resources extracted from space. Had Tenacious’ Luxembourg-based operators managed to drive it around on the moon, the rover would have captured video and gathered data. One of its missions would have been to collect lunar soil, called regolith, as part of acontract with NASA, to which it was supposed to transfer ownership of the samples. “I think this will be very helpful to nail down what it means to commercialize space resources and how to do this on a larger scale, both in terms of volume and of global participation and coordination,” ispace-EUROPE CEO Julien Lamamy told TechCrunch on the eve of the landing attempt. Winning such a contract from NASA was also a first for a European company. But it took some coaxing to get Lamamy to brag about the agile team of 50 people from 30 nationalities that made this unique little rover. Despite a resume that includes time at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and MIT, Lamamy is not one to boast. In our conversation, he admitted he had to “channel his inner American” to explain his team’s achievements. But that’s also because ispace is willfully collaborative. For instance, the lightweight scoop that was meant to collect regolith for NASA was made byEpiroc, a mining equipment provider out of Sweden. “We could have done this ourselves. Instead, we saw the opportunity to engage a terrestrial industry to think about space,” Lamamy said. “The more people participate, the better.” More people are participating in Luxembourg’s space ecosystem, too. The Luxembourg Space Agency (LSA) was established in 2018, and the country actively supports the sector, which has gone from niche to mainstream since the Space Resources Law was adopted. “Even better than that, there are many companies now established downstream of ispace in the value chain,” Lamamy said. He cited the example ofMagna Petra, a startuppartneringwith ispace on ​​mining Helium-3, a rarefied resource, from the lunar surface. “Our ambition is to develop a space sector that is highly integrated with our industries on earth and opens up new market opportunities, both in space and on Earth,” Luxembourg’s Minister of the Economy, SMEs, Energy and Tourism, Lex Delles,said in a commentwhen ispace-EUROPE announced the completion of its rover. That ambition is being fueled by money. Tenacious was developed with co-funding from the LSA through an ESA contract with the Luxembourg National Space Program,LuxIMPULSE. Tax incentives or direct aids are available both for startups and for multinational companies, according to research from Deloitteon Luxembourg’s space industry. Tenacious was designed to be both small and light, weighing about five kilograms — half the weight of NASA’sSojourner Mars rover. By selecting mass-efficient and power-efficient components, Lamamy explained, his team was able to build a very small system that is cheaper to manufacture and to send to the moon. This made its payload inherently limited, but designed to reach up to one kilogram. As part of the Resilience mission, Tenacious’ payload included the scoop required for the NASA mission, and perhaps unexpectedly, a miniature red house. Known asThe Moonhouse, this small sculpture of a Swedish cottage was supposed to symbolically become the first house on the moon, a project that artist Mikael Genberg has been pursuingsince 1999. “It’s not about science or politics, it’s about reminding us of what we all share — our humanity, our imagination, and our longing for home. A red house gazing back at “The Pale Blue Dot,” as Carl Sagan once described our fragile planet,” The Moonhouse’s site stated. Lamamy’s team had prepared to be in charge of successfully dropping and photographing The Moonhouse in a good spot, and took the role seriously. As part of the rover testing it conducted on Earth, both on itstesting site in Luxembourgand inseveral European locations, including Spain’s Canary Islands, the operators had rehearsed the procedure several times. Although poetic, this may have seemed less of a priority to NASA, but not to Lamamy. “That’s an interesting paradigm shift; yes, we’re going to the moon to improve our knowledge of the moon from a scientific and commercial perspective, but we are also there to open access to artists, entrepreneurs, educators, and that’s also a very exciting element to the mission.” Unfortunately, this will now likely have to wait.

This town wasn’t big enough for the two towering egos of billionaire Elon Musk and President Donald Trump, and now they’re duking it out publicly, albeit from their own separate corners of the web. Musk is taking to his own social media platform, X, to take jabs at Trump, and Trump is firing back on Truth Social and Fox News. The squabble comes a few days afterMusk stepped down from leading DOGE, and after Musk repeatedly disparaged Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill,” a spending package that House Republicans passed in May. Musk has called the bill “a disgusting abomination,” saying it would significantly increase the federal budget deficit by up to $3.8 trillion in additional debt over the next decade through increased defense spending, immigration enforcement measures, and tax cuts. The Trump tariffs will cause a recession in the second half of this yearhttps://t.co/rbBC11iynE In a way, the siloed nature of this shouting match feels poetic. It exposes the cracks in the Musk-Trump political alliance and underscores how powerful social media and loyal fan bases have become in shaping policy narratives and swaying voter perception. Trump is doing what he often does, trying to discredit a potential rival. For Musk, it’s more of a gamble. Tesla has already taken a hit from his political grandstanding and flirtations with the Trump administration. More of the same could further damage his business. Or it could cement his status as an anti-establishment voice — a tech mogul who doesn’t need traditional power structures to influence the American political landscape. Musk has suggested in X posts that he would unseat politicians who backed Trump’s budget bill in the 2026 midterms. Pinned to the top of his X account is apollasking if it’s “time to create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle?” Two hours after the post, 82.3% of nearly 1 million voters said “yes.” Musk said just a couple weeks ago that he would be taking a step away from politics to focus on his businesses. And it’s those businesses that Trump seems keen to punish. On Truth Social, Trump accused Musk of going “CRAZY” because the administration “took away his EV mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!).” Trump, here, is referring to the EV tax credit under former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. There never was a mandate that forced anyone to buy EVs. Trump’s spending bill would end the tax credit by the end of this year. On X, Musk countered that claim, and said he never had eyes on the bill before it passed the House. Trump also said that Musk blew up after the president refused to put someone Musk “knew very well to run NASA” because he didn’t think it would be “appropriate.” He suggested that the easiest way to save money in the federal budget, “billions and billions of dollars,” would be to “terminate Elon’s governmental subsidies and contracts.” Musk’s businesses have been awarded at least $38 billion in government contracts, loans, subsidies, and tax credits over the next two decades, with nearly two-thirds pledged in the last five years, per a FebruaryWashington Post report. In light of the President’s statement about cancellation of my government contracts,@SpaceXwill begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediatelypic.twitter.com/NG9sijjkgW Axios reportedWednesday part of Musk’s frustration with Trump’s spending bill and the administration at large was failing to win favorable treatment for his ventures. Not coincidentally, Muskspent more than $260 millionto get Trump elected. As the fight between Musk and Trump develops, it’s starting to get personal. “Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,”Musk postedin response to a video of Trump throwing shade at Musk on Fox News. “Such ingratitude.” A few hours later, Musk decided to drop “the really big bomb.” “[Donald Trump] is in the Epstein files,” Musk wrote on X. “That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!” A number of politicians, including Republican senators, have called for Trump to release government files on financier Jeffrey Epstein, who was implicated in a child sex abuse ring and later committed suicide. Musk said that his aerospace company, SpaceX, would begindecommissioningits Dragon spacecraft “immediately” in response to Trump’s threat to cancel contracts awarded to the billionaire’s companies. (NASA uses Dragon for some missions.)

Srinivas said that the AI search engine is seeing more than 20% growth month-over-month. “Give it a year, we’ll be doing, like, a billion queries a week if we can sustain this growth rate,” Srinivas said. “And that’s pretty impressive because the first day in 2022, we did 3,000 queries, just one single day. So from there to doing 30 million queries a day now, it’s been phenomenal growth.” Srinivas went on to note that the same growth trajectory is possible, especially with thenew Comet browserthat it’s working on. “If people are in the browser, it’s infinite retention,” he said. “Everything in the search bar, everything on the new tab page, everything you’re doing on the sidecar, any of the pages you’re in, these are all going to be extra queries per active user, as well as seeking new users who just are tired of legacy browsers, like Chrome. I think that’s going to be the way to grow over the coming year.” Srinivas said the reason Perplexity is developing Comet is to shift the role of AI from simply providing answers to actually completing actions on your behalf. He explained that when you get an AI-powered answer, it’s essentially four or five searches in one. On the other hand, AI performing an action would be getting an entire browsing session done with one prompt. “You really need to actually have a browser and hybridize the compute on the client and the server side in the most seamless way possible,” he said. “And that calls for rethinking the whole browser.” He went on to explain that Perplexity isn’t thinking of Comet as “yet another browser,” but as a “cognitive operating system.” “It’ll be there for you every time, anytime, for work or life, as a system on the side, or like, just going and doing browsing sessions for you,” Srinivas said. “And I think that’ll fundamentally make us rethink how we even think about the internet. Like, earlier we would browse the internet, but now people are increasingly living on the internet. Like a lot of our life actually exists there. And if you want to build a proactive, personalized AI, it needs to live together with you, and that’s why we need to rethink the browser entirely.” While the company hasn’t revealed too much about the browser,Srinivas said in Aprilthat one reason Perplexity is developing its own browser is to track user activity beyond its own app so that it can sell premium ads, which would essentially mirror what Google quietly did to become the giant it is today. It’s currently unknown when exactly Comet will launch, butSrinivas previously said on Xthat it will launch in the coming weeks. Comet will have a native virtual meets recording, transcription and searches over them. Won’t be part of the first release, but very fast follow up.

The two companies announced Thursday plans to roll out drone delivery to more than 100 Walmart stores in five new cities: Atlanta, Charlotte, Houston, Orlando, and Tampa. Walmart is also adding Wing drone deliveries to its existing market in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. The expansion signals Walmart’s growing confidence in drone delivery. Greg Cathey, who is senior vice president of Walmart’s U.S. Transformation and Innovation department, said drone delivery would remain a key part of its “commitment to redefining retail.” “We’re pushing the boundaries of convenience to better serve our customers, making shopping faster and easier than ever before,”Cathey said in a blogposted Thursday. The expansion also marks a turning point for Wing, from Alphabet X graduate to commercial enterprise. Wing partnered with Walmart in 2023 andlaunched a pilot programto test on-demand drone delivery at two stores in the Dallas metro area that reached about 60,000 homes. It has since grown to 18 Walmart Supercenters in Dallas-Fort Worth. The expansion announced Thursday is nearly a five-fold increase of Wing’s operations with Walmart. “We’re decidedly out of the pilot and trial phase and into scaling up this business,” Wing CEO Adam Woodworth told TechCrunch in a recent interview. “We’ve always been the type of company that wants to do something well and stay focused. And so this is the next big bite at the apple. It’s a much bigger bite than we’ve taken before.” Woodworth said the pilot program in Dallas-Fort Worth, and specifically how it scaled, helped form Wing’s drone delivery strategy in the retail sector. “We figured out how the expansion worked out and looked in DFW, and now we’re sort of copy-pasting that across more markets,” he added. Woodworth wouldn’t say whether Wing was profitable yet or when it would be. But he did say the company is focused on how to scale its deliveries while keeping its expenses in check. Wing’s hypothesis is to build a business centered on small, lightweight, automated, low-cost airplanes — aka drones. There are fixed operational costs tied to those physical assets such as flight operations and training. The crux, and what Wing is trying to navigate, is how to scale the number of drones and flights without adding even more personnel. “The more places you can be operating, the more you can be flying, the more you can defray those costs. This is a meaningful step in that direction,” he said, adding that Wing is trying to keep its resources flat as the scale continues to go up. Wing is also pushing into the restaurant food delivery sector through itspartnership with DoorDash. The two companies paired up in 2022 to launch drone deliveries in Australia and have since worked together inDallas-Forth Worthandmore recently in Charlotte.

The complaint accuses Deel of targeting, infiltrating, and compromising four other competitors, in addition to Rippling. The revised complaint doesn’t name all of the four other alleged victims, except cryptocurrency-based tax and payroll compliance company, Toku.Toku is suing its competitor LiquiFi, also allegingcorporate espionage and that Deel was involved. Rippling’s revised complaint alleges that “Victim-3 is a startup accelerator that previously partnered with Deel.” The complaint doesn’t name, or even imply, who that is. (Y Combinator backed both Rippling and Deel but there’s no indication this refers to the VC firm. YC has not yet responded to our request for comment.) The complaint also says that there are one or more additional victims who are “major competitors of Deel” in the employer of record market. A source familiar with the investigation believes that more witnesses will soon come forward at these other companies to offer details. A Deel spokesperson called the claims in Rippling’s original lawsuit “far fetched” adding that “its amendment fails to correct any of the myriad fatal flaws in its original complaint.” Rippling’s amended suit also alleges that Deel’s CEO Alex Bouaziz was the direct mastermind of it all,sharing screenshots of messagesas its evidence. And, although this is a civil suit, Rippling is now implying that this could be a criminal matter. “This case is about a criminal syndicate that operated from the shadows of a multibillion-dollar technology company — Deel,” the complaint reads. Rippling’s amended lawsuit is now suing Deel under the federal racketeering (RICO) statute, as well as the Defend Trade Secrets Act, and California state law. The lawsuit directly names Alex Bouaziz; his father Philippe Bouaziz — who is chairman and chief financial officer; and Deel’s chief operating officer, Daniel Westgarth. It’s important to note that the lead attorney for Rippling is Alex Spiro of white-shoe law firm Quinn Emanuel. Spiro is a former prosecutor for the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office. (He’s so well known in the legal world that hehas his own Wikipedia page.) Using words like “criminal syndicate” in a civil case would be a deliberate choice. According to the source familiar with the case, federal prosecutors are now actively looking into the allegations against Deel as well. A spokesperson from Deel denies this, “We are not aware of any active investigations into our business. As detailed in our lawsuit, Rippling has a long history of making false or sensationalized allegations to governmental authorities about competitors, which prompt ‘inquiries’ from the government that Rippling then leaks to the media.” An investigation, in whatever form it may exist, is not, however, a conviction. But should charges be filed, Rippling is doing its best to set up Bouaziz himself as one of the people responsible. The complaint even goes so far as to repeatedly use the colorful language “the Bouaziz Racketeering Enterprise.” Other than that, much of the amended complaint reiterates what Rippling has already alleged. To recap: a Rippling employee confessed to being a paid spy for Deel in anaffidavit that reads like a Hollywood movie.The employee admitted in court to taking sales leads, product roadmaps, customer accounts, names of superstar employees, and whatever other information was asked for. The employee was caught in a Rippling-set honeypot, both he and Rippling say. Rippling is suing Deel, alleging misappropriation of trade secrets, tortious interference, unfair competition, and more, largely based on the spying allegations. Deelhas counter-suedin a case that is less about denying Rippling’s charges and more about making several of its own claims about Rippling. For instance, earlier this week, Deel filed an amended lawsuit that claimed thatRippling was spying on Deel by having an employee “impersonate”a customer to obtain non-public product information.The Deel spokesperson called Rippling’s amended filing a “rehash,” and insisted on the superiority of its own allegations.  “We are winning in the marketplace, we stand by our own lawsuit, and we will be vindicated in court as well.” Grab some fresh popcorn.

The comment comes just a few weeks after Bloomberg reported thatOpenAI was acquiring Windsurf for $3 billion. Earlier this week, Windsurf said thatAnthropic cut its direct access to Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3.7 Sonnet, two of the more popular AI models for coding, forcing the startup to find third-party computing providers on relatively short notice. Windsurf said it was disappointed in Anthropic’s decision and that it might cause short-term instability for users trying to access Claude via Windsurf. Windsurf declined to comment on Kaplan’s remarks, and an OpenAI spokesperson did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request. The companies have not confirmed the acquisition rumors. Part of the reason Anthropic cut Windsurf’s access to Claude, according to Kaplan, is because the company is quite computing-constrained today. Anthropic would like to reserve its computing for what Kaplan characterized as “lasting partnerships.” However, Kaplan said the company hopes to greatly increase the availability of models it can offer users and developers in the coming months. He added that Anthropic has just started to unlock capacity on a new computing cluster from its partner, Amazon, which he says is “really big and continues to scale.” As Anthropic pulls away from Windsurf, Kaplan said he’s collaborating with other customers building AI coding tools, such as Cursor — a company Kaplan said Anthropic expects to work with for a long time. Kaplan rejected the idea that Anthropic was in competition with companies like Cursor, which is developing its own AI models. Meanwhile, Kaplan says Anthropic is increasingly focused on developing its own agentic coding products, such as Claude Code, rather than AI chatbot experiences. While companies like OpenAI, Google, and Meta are competing for the most popular AI chatbot platform, Kaplan said the chatbot paradigm was limiting due to its static nature, and that AI agents would in the long run be much more helpful for users.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Bonfire Social, a new framework for building communities on the open social web, launched on Thursday during theFediForum online conference. While Bonfire Social is a federated app, meaning it’s powered by the same underlying protocol as Mastodon (ActivityPub), it’s designed to be more modular and more customizable. That means communities on Bonfire have more control over how the app functions, which features and defaults are in place, and what their own roadmap and priorities will include. There’s a decidedly disruptive bent to the software, which describes itself as a place where “all living beings thrive and communities flourish, free from private interest and capitalistic control.” In other words, its mission is to build social software where people get to make the decisions, not Big Tech platform makers like Meta or Google. The organization itself runs as a nonprofit funded by donations and grants, and it doesn’t take venture capital. Its code is open source, and it works in collaboration with the communities and researchers that use it to build and enhance online digital spaces. Bonfire Social, now offered as a 1.0 Release Candidate ahead of the public release, is just one representation of what Bonfire offers. Bonfire calls it a “flavor.” Each flavor is a preconfigured bundle of Bonfire extensions, features, and defaults, sort of like a starting template. When a community opts to run a particular “flavor,” it gets to govern the app as it sees fit, adding its own extensions and determining its own roadmap for product changes. This puts the social software back under users’ control, instead of being subject to the whims of a platform maker with ever-changing feature sets and algorithms. The organization is already developing other flavors, like Bonfire Community and Open Science, and the Bonfire software lets any other community create their own version. In Bonfire Social, users will recognize familiar features, like feeds and tools to follow users, share posts, create user profiles, flag or block content, and more. However, it also offers other tools and features that traditional social networks may not have, like tools for customizing feeds, support for nested discussions, the ability to host multiple profiles per user, rich-text posts, and access control features. Custom feeds are a key differentiation between Bonfire and traditional social media apps. Though the idea of following custom feeds is something that’s been popularized by newer social networks like Bluesky or social browsers like Flipboard’s Surf, the tools to actually create those feeds are maintained by third parties. Bonfire instead offers its own custom feed-building tools in a simple interface that doesn’t require users to understand coding. To build feeds, users can filter and sort content by type, date, engagement level, source instance, and more, including something it calls “circles.” Those who lived through theGoogle+ era of social networksmay be familiar with the concept of Circles. On Google’s social network, users organized contacts into groups, called Circles, for optimized sharing. That concept lives on at Bonfire, where a circle represents a list of people. That can be a group of friends, a fan group, local users, organizers at a mutual aid group, or anything else users can come up with. These circles are private by default but can be shared with others. Another unique feature on Bonfire Social is Boundaries, which let you control who can see or engage with your content. For instance, you could share a post with a number of your circles, but only allow one specific circle’s members to comment. Bonfire also supports threaded conversations (nested discussions) where replies can branch out into their own sub-threads. This can be useful for communities where deeper discussions and collaboration are more valuable than those where everyone competes for attention. Plus, Bonfire users can customize the app using one of the 16 built-in themes, or they can design their own layout and pick their own colors and fonts. Accounts on Bonfire can also host multiple profiles that have their own followers, content, and settings. This could be useful for those who simply prefer to have both public and private profiles, but also for those who need to share a given profile with others — like a profile for a business, a publication, a collective, or a project team. Other features available at launch include PWA support for mobile devices, community blocklists, custom emoji support, full-text search (with opt out), direct messages, private group discussions (also with nested threads), and more. Extensions, which add different features, can be enabled or disabled by both admins and users. Admins simply decide what the defaults are. That means users could turn on or off features they don’t like, even core features such as likes or boosts (the federated version of the retweet/repost). Because Bonfire is built on ActivityPub, it also federates with Mastodon, PeerTube, Mobilizon, and others. The software is meant to be self-installed, though work todevelop a hosting networkis under way. For those who just want to kick the tires,a demo instance is available.

Existing investors also piled in, an Anduril spokesperson tells TechCrunch. Anduril has now doubled its valuation to $30.5 billion with this Series G raise. The spokesperson says the round was over 8x times oversubscribed, meaning many more investors wanted to buy than the amount of stock Anduril was selling. Anduril, which makes autonomous weapons and software to control them, says the new funding was raised after the company doubled its revenue in 2024 to about $1 billion. The company is also enjoying a tailwind from being granted the U.S. Army’s enormous contract for developing new AR/VR headsets for soldiers. The contract was originally granted to Microsoft with a total $22 billion budget but was reassigned to Anduril in February. That contract is such a big deal, it even caused Anduril founder Palmer Luckey to publicly forgive his former employer Meta last week as the two companiesannounced a partnershipto create devices for the project.

With this new app, users can now use Snapchat across mobile, web, tablets, and Apple Watch. Users can now preview an incoming message and also reply using the keyboard, Scribble, Dictation, or an emoji. The company says the new app will allow users to do things like quickly let their friend know they’re “here” when meeting up at a restaurant or glance down and send a quick reply while on a run. While you could already preview Snapchat messages on your Apple Watch by enabling them on your iPhone, there wasn’t a way to respond to them until now. “The number of devices we use in our daily lives has grown,” Snap wrote in a blog post. “Already we’re seeing our community enjoy using Snapchat across surfaces including tablet and web, in addition to mobile, and this builds on our commitment to making Snapchat available across all the devices you use, including wearables.” Thursday’s announcement marks a shift in thinking for Snapchat, as Snap CEO Evan Spiegel said years ago thathe wasn’t too keenon the Apple Watch’s small screen, noting that people would probably prefer to look at a picture on their phone, rather than their Watch. Snapchat is now focused on using its watchOS app to enable users to quickly respond to messages, not to view images or videos.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us A major development showcasing the potential for the open social web was unveiled Thursday at the online conference known asFediForum. ThemakersofBridgy Fed, the tool that connects decentralized open social networks, like Mastodon and Bluesky, developed anew project called Bouncethat will allow users to migrate their social network followers across networks powered by different protocols. This is a significant step toward making the open social web a more viable alternative to the locked-in ecosystems provided by tech giants like Meta, Snap, Google, TikTok, and X — and where you may be able to delete your account and export your data when you leave, but not actually migrate your account to a new app. Today, Mastodon, Bluesky, and other social services that run on their protocols (ActivityPub and the AT Protocol, respectively) allow users to move their accounts within their protocol network. That means a Mastodon user canmigrate their account to another Mastodon server, while Bluesky allows users to move their accounts and datafrom one Personal Data Server (PDS) to another. (The latter is still a work in progress because you can move off of Bluesky’s PDS but not back to it!) However, it hasn’t been possible for users to move their accounts or retain their followings by moving from one network to another. Nowled by a nonprofit called A New Social, the makers of Bridgy Fed have developed technology that will make this type of migration possible. The tech builds on Bridgy Fed to allow users to “move” their Bluesky account to their Mastodon profile’s bridged account (an account that listens for your Mastodon posts and then replicates them on Bluesky so your Bluesky followers can see them), then take the bridged account and “move” it to the user’s Mastodon profile. How all this works under the hood is technically complicated because both platforms have different ways of handling migrations. That’s why Bridgy Fed has to function as something of a middleman, enabling the transition with servers of its own, custom-built for the purpose of bridging and moves. Currently a proof-of-concept, the technology will launch into beta in a few weeks — but not for the casual user. “I don’t want to go as far as saying it’s a tech demo, but it was really important to prove that this is possible,” says New Social’s CEO and executive director, Anuj Ahooja. There are some complications at present, too. You can’t move back to Bluesky’s PDS because the social network hasn’t built out that technology yet, for starters. Also, if someone on Bluesky who isn’t bridged interacts with your “moved” account, you won’t see that once you’re on the Mastodon side. But the team is working on developing a feature that will notify you of off-bridge interactions, Ahooja says. In addition, Bounce alerts you to how many of the people you follow aren’t bridged, so if they ever do bridge, you can re-follow them. Ultimately, the team hopes the technology in Bounce would be obscured from the everyday open social user, who could instead decide simply what app they want to use and then go through a few short steps to move their following. And while today, Bounce supports Bluesky, Mastodon, and Pixelfed (an ActivityPub-based photo-sharing app), the longer-term goal would be to support any open social platform and protocol, whether that’s a long-form blogging platform like Ghost, or even other networks like those running on Nostr or Farcaster. “We’re trying to create an interface for the open social web to handle some of these tougher movements that you have to make,” explained Ahooja. “So, if you’re unhappy with something Bluesky is doing — or even if you’re not unhappy, but you feel like a platform on the ActivityPub side is doing something that you really needed to do…[you could] do these couple of clicks on Bounce,” he added. Bounce is the third project from A New Social. In addition to Bridgy Fed, the organization also launched asettings pagea few weeks ago that makes the process of preparing to bridge easier and allows you to set a custom domain for your account. The overall goal at A New Social is to shift the power of social networks back to the people, not the platform makers, by giving them tools that let them move their account and their followings, and leave if a platform ever fails them in some way. This motto of “People not Platforms” is nowemblazoned on merchA New Social sells, like tees, hoodies, hats, cups, and stickers that help monetize its efforts, alongside itsPatreon.

Monday.Last year’s eventwas notable for its focus on AI, and this year, there is considerable pressure on the company to build on its promises. As in previous years, the company will focus on software updates and new technologies, including the next version of iOS, which isrumored to havethe most significant design changes since the introduction of iOS 7. ButiOS 19 (or 26, if other rumors about the new naming system are true)isn’t the only thing the company will announce at WWDC 2025. Here’show you can watch the keynotelivestream. When Apple introduced a major overhaul to iOS back in 2013 with the launch ofiOS 7, it felt jarring for many users with the shift from the prior skeuomorphic design with gradients and real-world textures to the more colorful, but flat, design style that reflected Apple’s then chief design officer Jony Ive’s taste for minimalism. Now, new reports suggest that an upcoming redesign could provoke a similar level of reaction. Reports suggest the new design may have elements referencing visionOS, the software powering Apple’s spatial computing headset, the Apple Vision Pro. If true, that means the new OS could feature a transparent interface and more circular app icons that break away from the traditional square format today. This visual redesign could beimplemented across all of Apple’s ecosystem(including even CarPlay), according to Bloomberg, providing a more seamless experience for consumers moving between their different devices. According toBloomberg, Apple will announce achangein the naming system for iOS at this year’s WWDC. Instead of announcing the next version of iOS as iOS 19, Apple’s operating systems will shift to being named by year. That means we could be set to see the launch of iOS 26 instead, alongside the OSes for other products, including adOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26, and visionOS 26. While it might be challenging to top the news related toApple Intelligenceat WWDC 2024, the company is expected to share a few updates on the AI front. The company has seemingly been caught flat-footed in the AI race, making announcements about AI capabilities that had yet to ship, leading even someApple punditsto accuse the company of touting vaporware. While Apple has launched several AI tools like Image Playground, Genmoji, Writing Tools, Photos Clean Up, and more, its promise of an improved Siri, personalized to the end user and able to take action across your apps,has been delayed. Meanwhile, Apple has turned tooutside companies like OpenAIto give its iPhone a boost in terms of its AI capabilities. At WWDC, it may announce support for other AI chatbots, as well. With Jony Ive now working with Sam Altmanon an AI hardware device, Apple is under pressure to catch up on AI progress. In addition, reports suggest that Apple’sHealth app could soon incorporate AI technology, which could include a health chatbot and generative AI insights that provide personalized health-related suggestions based on user data. Additionally, other apps, such as Messages, may receiveenhancements with AI capabilities, including a translation feature and polls that offer AI-generated suggestions, per 9to5Mac. Apple will likely make the most of a number of smaller OS updates that involve AI, given its underwhelming progress. Reports suggest that these updates could include AI-powered battery management features and an AI-powered Shortcuts app, for instance. Bloombergconfirmeda 9to5Macreportthat said Apple is developing a dedicated gaming app that will replace the aging Game Center app. The app could include access to Apple Arcade’s subscription-based game store, plus other gaming features like leaderboards, recommendations, and ways to challenge your friends. It could also integrate with iMessage or FaceTime for remote gaming. Along with the new design, reports suggest that Apple’s other operating systems will get some polish, too. For instance, macOS may also see the new gaming app and benefit from the new AirPods features. It’s also expected to be named macOS Tahoe, in keeping with Apple’s naming convention that references California landmarks. Apple TVmay get a visual overhaul, but alsochanges to its user interface, the new gaming app, and other features. In addition to Messages getting a translation feature, Bloomberg reported that Apple could also bring alive-translate language feature to its AirPodswireless Bluetooth earbuds, allowing real-time translation during conversations. The iPhone will translate spoken words from another language for the user and will also translate the user’s response back into that language. A new report from 9to5Mac also suggests thatAirPods may get new head gesturesto complement today’s ability to either nod or shake your head to respond to incoming calls or messages. Plus, AirPods may get features to auto-pause music after you fall asleep, a way to trigger the camera via Camera Control with a touch, a studio-quality mic mode, and an improved pairing experience in shared AirPods. There haven’t been any rumors regarding new devices, becauseno hardware is ready for release yet, according to Bloomberg. Although it’s always possible that the company will surprise us with anew Mac Pro announcement, most reports are saying this is highly unlikely at this point. Some reports indicate that Apple may also announce support for a new input device for its Vision Pro:spatial controllers. The devices would be motion-aware and designed with interaction in a 3D environment in mind, 9to5Mac says. Bloomberg hadreportedin November that Apple was expected to announce a smart home tablet in March 2025, featuring a 6-inch touchscreen and voice-activated controls. The device was said to include support for Home Control, Siri, and video calls, but has yet to launch. Topics Consumer News Editor Sarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "title": "Trump and Musk enter bitter feud - and Washington buckles up",
    "article_text": "What happens when the richest person and the most powerful politician have a knock-down, drag-out fight? The world is finding out – and it's not a pretty picture. Donald Trump and Elon Musk have two of the biggest megaphones, and they have now turned them on each other, as a disagreement has ballooned into a war of words. Trump has threatened Musk's voluminous business dealings with the federal government, which form the lifeblood of his SpaceX programme. \"The easiest way to save money in our budget, billions and billions of dollars, is to terminate Elon's governmental subsidies and contracts,\" Trump posted menacingly on his own social media website. If Trump turns the machinery of government against Musk, the tech billionaire will feel pain. Tesla's stock price plunged by 14% on Thursday. It's not a one-way street, however. After that volley, Musk called for Trump's impeachment, dared him to cut funding for his companies and countered that he was accelerating the decommissioning of his Dragon spacecraft, which the US relies on to carry American astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station. Musk has near limitless resources to respond, including by funding insurgent challengers to Republicans in next year's elections and primaries. And late on Thursday afternoon, he said he was dropping the \"really big bomb\" –suggesting without evidence that Trump appears in unreleased files related to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. His press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, offered only a tepid pushback to Musk's allegations and accusations. \"This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted,\" she said. Musk may not win a fight against the whole of Trump's government, but he could exact a high political - and personal - price for Trump and the Republicans. Trump, perhaps aware of this, appeared to tamp down the heat a bit by the end of the day, avoiding comment on Musk during a public appearance at a White House police appreciation event and posting a message on Truth Social that said he didn't mind \"turning against him\" but wishes he had quit government service months ago. He then pivoted to boosting of his \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending legislation. It's difficult to envision an easy walk-down after Thursday's heat, however. The feud started at a simmer last week, began bubbling on Wednesday and became a full-on boil on Thursday afternoon in the Oval Office. As new German Chancellor Friedrich Merz – the day's visitor – sat in awkward silence, the president sounded a bit like a spurned lover. He expressed surprise at Musk's criticism of his legislation. He pushed back against the notion that he would have lost last year's presidential election without Musk's hundreds of millions of dollars in support. And he said Musk was only changing his tune now because his car company, Tesla, will be hurt by the Republican push to end electric vehicle tax credits. Musk quickly took to his social media site, X, with a very Generation X response for his 220 million followers: \"Whatever\". He said he didn't care about the car subsidies, he wanted to shrink the national debt, which he says is an existential threat to the nation. He insisted that Democrats would have prevailed in last year's election without his help. \"Such ingratitude,\" he told Trump. The billionaire then launched a series of extraordinary attacks throughout the afternoon, and the feud was on in earnest. Musk and Trump had formed a powerful but unlikely alliance, culminating in the tech billionaire having a key position of budget-slashing authority in the Trump administration. Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or Doge, became one of the biggest stories of Trump's first 100 days, as it shuttered entire agencies and dismissed thousands of government workers. It wasn't long, however, before speculation began over when – and how - the two outsized personalities would ultimately fall out. For a while, it seemed like those predictions were off the mark. Trump stood by Musk even as the latter's popularity dropped, as he feuded with administration officials and as he became a liability in several key elections earlier this year. Every time it appeared there would be a break, Musk would pop up in the Oval Office, or the Cabinet room or on the president's Air Force One flight to Mar-a-Lago. When Musk's 130 days as a \"special government employee\" ended last week, the two had a chummy Oval Office send-off, with a golden key to the White House and hints that Musk might someday return. It's safe to say that any invitation has been rescinded and the locks have been changed. \"Elon and I had a great relationship,\" Trump said on Thursday – a comment notable for its use of the past tense. There had been some thought that Trump's surprise announcement on Wednesday night of a new travel ban, additional sanctions on Harvard and a conspiracy-laced administration investigation of former President Joe Biden were all efforts to change the subject from Musk's criticism. The White House and its allies in Congress seemed careful not to further antagonise him after his earlier comments. Then Trump spoke out and… so much for that. Now the question is where the dispute goes next. Congressional Republicans could find it harder to keep their members behind Trump's bill with Musk providing rhetorical  and, perhaps financial, air cover for those who break ranks. Trump has already threatened Musk's government contracts, but he could also take aim at Musk's remaining Doge allies in the administration or reopen Biden-era investigations into Musk's business dealings. Everything at this point is on the table. Meanwhile, Democrats are on the sidelines, wondering how to respond. Few seem willing to welcome Musk, a former donor to their party, back into the fold. But there's also the old adage that the enemy of an enemy is a friend. \"It's a zero-sum game,\" Liam Kerr, a Democratic strategist, told Politico. \"Anything that he does that moves more toward Democrats hurts Republicans.\" At the very least, Democrats seem happy to stand back and let the two men exchange blows. And until they abandon this fight, the din is likely to drown out everything else in American politics. But don't expect this spat to end anytime soon. \"Trump has 3.5 years left as president,\" Musk wrote on X, \"but I will be around for 40-plus years.\" Democrats are wondering what to do with aging candidates after revelations about Joe Biden's health. It comes hours after Harvard filed a lawsuit accusing Donald Trump of pursuing a  a \"government vendetta\" against the university. On Thursday, in a federal court filing, the university accused the Trump administration of a \"vendetta against Harvard\". The US secretary of state has accused the International Criminal Court of taking \"illegitimate actions\". The judge called the rapper's actions \"absolutely unacceptable\" after he nodded and made faces at the jury.",

    "title": "Most new build homes must have solar panels, says Ed Miliband",
    "article_text": "Builders will be required to fit solar panels to the \"vast majority\" of new build homes in England under changes to be published this year, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has said. The regulations will require developers to add panels unless the buildings fall under certain exemptions such as being covered by shade. Speaking to the BBC, Miliband said the move was \"just common sense\" adding that solar panels would save the typical household £500 a year on their energy bills. The Home Builders Federation said it backed fitting more panels but cautioned  against introducing \"burdensome\" paperwork which it said could harm government efforts to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029. The rules will be included in the Future Homes Standard, which will detail a wider plan for improving energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions. The government says it will be published in autumn but there will be a transitional period for developers to adjust to the regulation changes. Current building regulations do not compel developers to add solar panels to new homes. The last Conservative government consulted on new regulations including a proposal that new build homes should have rooftop solar panels covering the equivalent of 40% of the building's ground area. However, they were voted out of power before their proposed changes could be implemented. The Labour government is now promising to introduce rules which would mandate  developers to add solar panels to all new builds. Asked if the government would stick to the 40% figure proposed by the previous Conservative government, Miliband said the details would be set out in the autumn. \"The problem about the previous system was that it said you would had to have a certain percentage of coverage of solar panels but if you couldn't achieve that percentage you didn't have to do anything at all. \"Under our plans, we are not going to say that. We are going to say even if you can't hit 40% you will still have to have some solar panels, except in rare exceptional cases.\" Miliband said the number of homes with solar panels had to be \"much, much higher\" adding: \"It's got to be almost universal.\" Asked if he worried developers would pass the cost of adding solar panels on to buyers, Miliband said he didn't think there would be an effect on house prices. Neil Jefferson, head of the Home Builders Federation, said an estimated two in five new homes had solar panels and that the industry was \"getting increasingly used to incorporating solar panels within the building of new homes\". \"The government just needs to take care to make sure that it does not prescribe and mandate to much on rooftops.\" \"If every single home needs to be applied for on an exemption basis that will slow up the delivery of desperately-needed new homes, that administration will be burdensome.\" Chris Hewitt, from the trade body Solar Energy UK, said local authorities would have to be \"vigilant\" to ensure developers were meeting their obligations but added that it would be \"quite easy to enforce\". He also said he did not expect many homes to be exempt, estimating that 90% of new build homes would have to comply with the new rules. Asked if the sector had the skills to keep up with demand, Mr Hewitt said: \"We are certainly aware that we need to train more people... that's something we as an industry are working on.\" The announcement comes a week after the government ditched a planning rule in order to make it easier for people to install heat pumps in their homes. Increasing solar power is one way the government hopes to reduce the country's carbon emissions. The UK is legally committed to reaching its net zero target by 2050, meaning the UK must cut carbon emissions until it removes as much as it produces, in line with the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. In 2022, emissions from residential buildings made up 20% of greenhouse gas emissions in the UK. The government's advisory body, the Climate Change Committee, has said the UK will not be able to meet its targets \"without near complete decarbonisation of the housing stock\". According to analysis by Carbon Brief, power generated by solar sites in the UK hit record highs this year, partly driven by particularly sunny weather. Between January and May, the level was 42% higher than the same period in 2024 and marked a 160% increase over the last decade. However, solar power remains the UK's sixth largest source of electricity, behind gas, wind, imports, nuclear and biomass. The net-zero goal was set by the previous Conservative government and retained by Labour. However, recently Conservative leader Kemi Badenochhas saidthe target is \"impossible\" to achieve \"without a serious drop in our living standards or by bankrupting us\". Reform UK have called for the target to be scrapped entirely, arguing it has led to higher energy bills, while the Greens and Liberal Democrats want the government to hit the target faster. Volunteers are set to help train an artificial intelligence model to spot natural habitats. Ian Thorn says it will take \"at least two or three years to make a really positive difference\". A farmer says many in the industry are \"embracing the challenge\" of working more sustainably. AI could provide hyper-localised and longer term forecasts - but could it also put me out of a job?

    "title": "Israel strikes southern Beirut on eve of religious holiday",
    "article_text": "Israel has carried out several air strikes on Beirut's southern suburbs, saying it was targeting Hezbollah's drone production. The attack on Thursday night, the eve of Eid Al Adha, one of the most important celebrations in Islam, followed evacuation warnings for several buildings in the area, where Hezbollah is based in the capital. The Israeli Defence Forces said it had identified a Hezbollah unit producing \"thousands\" of drones underground, funded by \"Iranian terrorists\". The attack occurred despite a ceasefire being in effect between Israel and the armed group for the past six months. Lebanon's prime minister said he \"strongly condemns\" the strikes. \"I consider them to constitute a systematic and deliberate attack on our homeland, its security, stability, and economy, especially on the eve of the holidays and the tourist season,\" Nawaf Salam said in a post on X. Thousands fled packed streets in the densely populated area following the evacuation warning, causing a traffic gridlock. Plumes of smoke then appeared in the sky. Lebanese President Joseph Aoun described the strikes as a \"flagrant violation of an international accord\" while noting it had occurred \"on the eve of a sacred religious festival\". Israel's military said Hezbollah's \"extensive use\" of drones was central to its attacks on Israel, calling the activities \"a blatant violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon\". There was no immediate comment from Hezbollah. An hour before the air strikes occurred, the Israeli military's Arabic spokesman, Avichay Adraee, ordered residents living  in the neighbourhoods of Hadath, Haret Hreik and Borj el-Barajneh in the Dahieh area to evacuate. \"You are next to infrastructure belonging to Hezbollah,\" he said in a social media post that included a map identifying specific buildings. Prior to the Israel-Gaza war, Israel and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah group had engaged in more than a year of cross-border hostilities that culminated in an intense Israeli bombing campaign and ground incursion into southern Lebanon. The offensive killed about 4,000 people in Lebanon - including many civilians - and led to the displacement of more than 1.2 million residents. Israel said the military intervention was necessary to dismantle Hezbollah installations near the border that it argued a UN peacekeeping mission had failed to stop. Its stated goal was to allow the return of about 60,000 residents who had been displaced from communities in the country's north because of the group's attacks. A ceasefire struck in late November between Israel and Lebanon - but not Hezbollah - saw Israel withdraw while the Lebanese army took over policing southern Lebanon. The agreement also stated that its  commitments \"do not preclude either Israel or Lebanon from exercising their inherent right of self-defence, consistent with international law\". Israel has carried out air strikes in Lebanon on targets it says are linked to Hezbollah in the months since. In April, Israel attacked what it described as a Hezbollah store of \"precision-guided missiles\" in the same Dahieh region. Earlier the same month, it launched a similar strike, killing a Hezbollah official andthree other people, Lebanon's health ministry said at the time. Lebanon's government said those attacks, as well as the continued stationing of Israeli soldiers in five locations in southern Lebanon, constitute violations of the truce. Hezbollah launched its campaign the day after Hamas launched its 7 October 2023 attack into Israel, saying it was acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. The US secretary of state has accused the International Criminal Court of taking \"illegitimate actions\". The Anglican Church, which runs al-Ahli hospital, condemns the attack that Israel says targeted a Palestinian Islamic Jihad operative. BBC Verify examines three deadly incidents which left dozens dead near a controversial aid site in Gaza. Community leaders say people are anxious after recent attacks in Boulder and Washington DC showed that “anyone, anywhere” could be targeted. Israel said it held the Syrian president responsible after projectiles were fired into the occupied Golan Heights from Syria.",

    "article_text": "The judge presiding over Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' criminal trial has threatened to ban the disgraced music mogul from the courtroom for nodding and making faces at members of the jury. Judge Arun Subramanian called his actions \"absolutely unacceptable\". Mr Combs' attorneys assured the judge that it would not happen again. Judge Subramanian said Mr Combs was \"vigorously nodding\" during the cross questioning of Bryana Bongolan, a friend of Mr Combs' ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura who accused the rapper ofholding her over a balcony. Mr Combs has pled not guilty toall charges, including sex trafficking and a racketeering conspiracy. The court also heard from a woman using the pseudonym \"Jane\", who dated Mr Combs between 2021 and his arrest in 2024. Jane described the initial months of her relationship with Mr Combs as an exciting whirlwind; she said he took her on trips to Miami, and another one to Turks and Caicos, and The Bahamas. The rapper took her to upscale restaurants and she described herself as \"head over heels\" for him. But she testified that Mr Combs soon asked her to participate in what prosecutors referred to as \"hotel nights\", when Mr Combs hired an escort in order to watch Jane engage in sexual acts with another man. The first encounter in May 2021 took place in Miami, and she believed it would be a one-off experience. \"That night opened a Pandora's box in our relationship,\" Jane told the court. \"It was a door I was unable to shut for the rest of the relationship. There was so much of it after, and it was too much.\" Jane testified that she went along with additional encounters because \"I just really loved him at that point and wanted to make him happy\". But she also said \"many times\" that she had told Mr Combs she did not want to engage in these \"hotel nights\". But Mr Combs asked her to participate in several more and she \"felt frustrated, I felt just obligated\" to go along with his wishes, she told the court. Starting in approximately April 2023, Mr Combs began paying $10,000 per-month for a home for her, she testified. Jane said the arrangement came with a sense of obligation, and the rapper had implied he did not want to pay rent for a woman he was not seeing. Mr Combs also provided her with drugs such as ecstasy, cocaine and ketamine from the onset of the relationship, she testified. She told the court she had used the substances during some of her encounters with Mr Combs as well as the \"hotel nights\". Her testimony will continue on Friday, and she will later face questioning from Mr Combs' defence team. Get all the latest trial updates on the BBC Sounds 'Diddy on Trial' podcast available wherever you get your BBC podcasts. The court also heard more intense questioning of Ms Bongolan, Cassie Ventura's friend who the rapper's defence attorneys say has given different accounts of Mr Combs' alleged abuse at different times. Ms Bongolan has accused Mr Combs of lifting her onto the rail of a balcony in a threatening altercation, and throwing her into nearby furniture, causing bruises and injuries. Defence attorney Nicole Westmoreland asked Ms Bongolan about an allegation she made in a both a letter from a lawyer, which Ms Westmoreland said included a demand for money, and a lawsuit against Mr Combs: that during the balcony incident, the rapper had allegedly sexually assaulted her. Ms Bongolan had testified in court that Mr Combs ran his hands over her chest area as he allegedly lifted her on the balcony. Ms Westmoreland repeatedly pressed her on the differences between a sexual assault allegation and her description in court of the rapper's alleged actions. The defence also accused Ms Bongolan of fabricating details of the alleged balcony incident with Mr Combs, introducing evidence that showed Mr Combs performing at a concert in New Jersey and attending events in New York on 25 and 26 September 2016. Prosecutors had previously shown a photo of a bruise on Ms Bongolan's leg, with a timestamp of 26 September 2016 in the metadata. Ms Bongolan said that she took the photo of the bruise the day after Mr Combs allegedly threw her into balcony furniture. \"You came in here and lied to the ladies and gentlemen of this jury,\" Ms Westmoreland said. \"I can't agree with you,\" Ms Bongolan responded. Later in the day, prosecutors brought back up the disagreement. They displayed a text message taken from the phone of Ms Ventura, Mr Combs' ex-girlfriend, dated 30 September 2016. The text stated Mr Combs had come to her apartment in the middle of the night, choked Ms Bongolan, and held her off the balcony. Democrats are wondering what to do with aging candidates after revelations about Joe Biden's health. It comes hours after Harvard filed a lawsuit accusing Donald Trump of pursuing a  a \"government vendetta\" against the university. On Thursday, in a federal court filing, the university accused the Trump administration of a \"vendetta against Harvard\".

    "title": "Bosses' bonuses banned at six water companies",
    "article_text": "A number of water companies have been banned from paying \"unfair\" bonuses to senior executives under new rules, the government has announced. The measures apply to water companies that do not meet environmental and consumer standards, are not financially resilient or have been convicted of a criminal offence. There has been growing public concern about sewage spills and rising bills for years while water companies have paid out £112m in rewards to executives over the past decade. Under the beefed-up Water Act, six firms are banned from paying bonuses this year including Anglian Water, Southern Water, Thames Water, United Utilities, Wessex Water and Yorkshire Water. The ban, which is backdated to April 2024, means regulator Ofwat can force firms to claw back bonuses that have been paid or face enforcement action. It applies to share awards as well as cash. It is part of new measures in the Water Act which comes into force on Friday. Environment Secretary Steve Reed said that water company bosses \"should only get bonuses if they've performed well, certainly not if they've failed to tackle water pollution\". Officials said the government would look into companies trying to get around the ban by raising executives' base salaries. But Liberal Democrat Environment spokesperson Tim Farron called the government's announcement \"half-baked\". He added that it \"doesn't touch the sides in enacting fundamental reform - especially if water companies can still workaround bonuses and wriggle off the hook\". In the last year alone, £7.6m in bonuses were paid to water bosses in England the government said. Water UK, which represents companies in the industry, said that firms' independent committees, which decide on performance-related pay, will abide by the laws set by government. It added: \"Water companies are focused on investing a record £104bn over the next five years to secure our water supplies, end sewage entering our rivers and seas and support economic growth.\" This week, a review found that the water industry in England and Wales is failing. The independent Water Commission, led by former Bank of England deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe, said in its interim findings that public trust had been shaken by \"pollution, financial difficulties, mismanagement [and] infrastructure failures\". Customers have seen bills rocket as water firms try to raise funds to invest in crumbling infrastructure. The commission said that the UK's water system has suffered \"deep-rooted, systemic and interlocking failures over the years\". This included a \"failure in government's strategy and planning for the future\". Last month,Thames Water was fined £122.7mfor breaching rules over sewage spills and shareholder payouts, the largest ever fine issued by Ofwat. The highly-indebted company serves about a quarter of the UK's population, mostly across London and parts of southern England, and employs 8,000 people. Earlier this week, Thames suffered a major blow in an attempt to secure its future after US private equity giantKKR pulled out of a £4bn rescue dealfor the company. In April, campaigners found that thenumber pollution incidents in England was at a 10-year high. Volunteers are set to help train an artificial intelligence model to spot natural habitats. A farmer says many in the industry are \"embracing the challenge\" of working more sustainably. Sodium cyanide leaked into a canal in August leading to a major incident and a lengthy clean up. The firm says the cost will be met by shareholders rather than increasing customers' bills. If approved, the event would take place in September along with a Hindu ceremony.",

    "title": "Which countries are on Trump's list, and why?",
    "article_text": "A travel ban issued on Wednesday by US President Donald Trump is set to primarily affect countries in Africa and the Middle East. Twelve countries face full bans, which will come into force on Monday. People from a further seven nations are facing partial restrictions. Trump has depicted it as a matter of national security. He cited a recent attack on members of Colorado's Jewish community, which was allegedly carried out by an Egyptian national. Egypt itself is not on the banned list. Other reasons cited include alleged breaking of US visa rules by people from the countries in question. Here is a closer look at some of the president's reasoning. A range of accusations have been made against Afghanistan in a presidential proclamation signed by Trump. The document highlights that the Taliban, which controls the country, is a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) group. The move comes just weeks after the Trump administration appeared to signal that it believed the situation had improved in Afghanistan, when it announced the end of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghans living in the US. Afghanistan is further accused by Trump of lacking a \"competent or co-operative\" central authority for issuing passports or civil documents. As with other countries on Trump's list, the issue of Afghan nationals overstaying their visas is also cited. Trump's proclamation identifies Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism - a longstanding charge that the Middle Eastern nation has previously rejected. The US has previously censured Tehran, Iran's capital, for its alleged sponsorship of proxy groups operating in the region, such as Hamas and Hezbollah. The new proclamation from Trump says the country is \"the source of significant terrorism around the world\", does not co-operate with the US on security risks and has \"historically failed to accept back its removable nationals\". The move comes amid diplomatic wrangling between the two sides over the creation of a new deal over Iran's nuclear weapon-building capabilities. Similar reasons are given in the case ofSomalia. The east African country is branded by Trump as a \"terrorist safe haven\".  Like Iran, it is also accused of failing to accept its nationals when removed from the US. However, a further point was made by Trump: \"Somalia stands apart from other countries in the degree to which its government lacks command and control of its territory, which greatly limits the effectiveness of its national capabilities in a variety of respects.\" Somalia's internationally-based government faces a significant challenge from armed Islamists. It has pledged to \"engage in dialogue to address the concerns raised\" by Trump. Libya, in north Africa, is cited for its \"historical terrorist presence\", which is painted as a security threat to Americans. Libya and Somalia are also among the countries on Trump's list which have been criticised for their perceived incompetence at issuing passports. The document highlights that \"hundreds of thousands of illegal Haitian aliens flooded into the United States during the Biden Administration\". Trump points to various perceived risks that this has entailed - including the creation of \"criminal networks\" and high visa overstay rates. Data from the US Census Bureau suggested more than 852,000 Haitians were living in the US in February 2024, though it does not give a breakdown of when those migrants arrived. Many came after a devastating earthquake in 2010, or after fleeing gang violence that took hold in the Caribbean nation. The US president also points to a lack of central authority in Haiti for matters including law enforcement. These countries are solely accused by Trump of having relatively high visa overstay rates. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) defines an \"overstay\" as a person who remains in the US beyond their authorised period of admission, with no evidence of any extension. The \"rate\" signals the proportion of people who overstayed. The central African nationChadis singled out for showing a \"a blatant disregard for United States immigration laws\". The document highlights an overstay rate of 49.54% by Chadians on business or tourist visas in 2023, citing a DHS report. Congo-BrazzavilleandEquatorial Guineahave equivalent rates of 29.63% and 21.98% respectively. But these rates are lower than Laos, which faces a lesser restriction. Myanmar - referred to as Burma in the Trump proclamation - is similarly accused of a high visa overstay rates. As with others on the list, including Iran, the country is further accused of not co-operating with the US to accept deported Burmese nationals. For each of these countries, the first allegation made by Trump is that they have questionable competence at issuing passports and civil documents. EritreaandSudanare further accused of having relatively high visa overstay rates. Eritreais also blamed for failing to make the criminal records of its national available to the US, and of refusing to accept deported nationals. As with Somalia,Yemenis also accused of lacking control over its own land. Trump's proclamation highlights that it is the site of active US military operations. The US has been combating Houthis, who have seized much of the north and west of the country during an ongoing civil war. People from seven other nations face partial restrictions: Democrats are wondering what to do with aging candidates after revelations about Joe Biden's health.

    "title": "What we know so far about the ban",
    "article_text": "Donald Trump has signed a ban on travel to the US from 12 countries, citing national security risks. There are also seven additional countries whose nationals will face partial travel restrictions. The US president said the list could be revised if \"material improvements\" were made, while other countries could be added as \"threats emerge around the world\". It is the second time he has ordered a ban on travel from certain countries. He signed a similar order in 2017 during his first term in office. Trump has signed a proclamation banning travel to the US from nationals of 12 countries: Nationals from these countries will not be allowed to enter the US unless they qualify for an exemption. There are an additional seven countries whose nationals face partial travel restrictions: Those under the partial restrictions will not be able to travel to the US with certain visas. The ban takes effect on Monday at 00:01 EDT (04:01 GMT), a cushion that avoids the chaos that unfolded at US airports when a similar measure took effect with virtually no notice eight years ago. No end date has been provided. The order calls for periodic review. The White House said these \"common sense restrictions\" would \"protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors\". In a video posted to his Truth Social website, Trump said therecent alleged terror attack in Boulder, Colorado\"underscored the extreme dangers\" posed by foreign nationals who had not been \"properly vetted\". Twelve people were injured in Colorado on Sunday when a man attacked a group gathering in support of Israeli hostages, throwing two incendiary devices and using a makeshift flamethrower. The man accused of carrying out the attack has been identified as an Egyptian national, but Egypt is not included on the list of banned countries. Trump has close ties with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who has in the past been described by the US president as his \"favourite dictator\". Only two of the 19 countries are on the US government's State Sponsors of Terrorism list - Iran, which has a full ban, and Cuba, which faces partial travel restrictions. But national security is given as a partial reason for the choices. In the proclamation, Trump said many of the countries listed have a \"historic failure to accept back their removable nationals\" from the US, as well as having \"taken advantage\" of the US by exploiting its visa system. He added that nationals from certain countries also \"pose significant risks\" of overstaying their visas. There are a number of people from affected countries who may still be able to enter the US due to a number of exceptions. The order does not apply to: In addition, the US Secretary of State may grant exemptions to individuals on a \"case-by-case\" basis, if \"the individual would serve a United States national interest\". Trump's latest order, which is expected to face legal challenges, drew a swift response, at home and abroad. Chad has retaliated bysuspending all visas to US citizens, with President Mahamat Idriss Déby Itno saying the country \"has its dignity and pride\". Somalia promised to work with the US to address any security issues, with ambassador to the US, Dahir Hassan Abdi, saying his country \"values its longstanding relationship\" with the US. Venezuela's Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello warned that \"being in the United States is a great risk for anyone, not just for Venezuelans\". The African Union, which represents all 55 countries on the continent, called on the US to \"engage in constructive dialogue with the countries concerned\". It appealed to the US to exercise its right to protect its borders and its citizens' security \"in a manner that is balanced, evidence-based, and reflective of the long-standing partnership between the United States and Africa\". The union said it remained concerned about the \"potential negative impact of such measures\". The UN's human rights chief, Volker Turk, said the ban \"raises concerns from the perspective of international law\" \"The broad and sweeping nature of the new travel ban raises concerns from the perspective of international law,\" Volker Turk said in a statement. That included \"the principle of non-discrimination and of the necessity and proportionality of the measures deployed to meet the security concerns stated\", he told news agency AFP. In the US, Democrats were quick to condemn the move. \"This ban, expanded from Trump's Muslim ban in his first term, will only further isolate us on the world stage,\" Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal wrote on social media. Congressman Don Beyer said Trump had \"betrayed\" the ideals of the founders of the US. Human rights organisation Amnesty International USA described it as \"discriminatory, racist, and downright cruel\", while the US-based Human Rights First called it \"yet another anti-immigrant and punitive action taken\" by the president. But others support the ban. Congressman Clay Higgins of Louisiana said travel to the US was \"a privilege, not a right\". He claimed on BBC Radio's Today programme that Americans had \"had enough of immigrants coming to our country, violating our laws and committing violence among our people\". Greg Swenson, chairman of Republicans Overseas UK, said the list of countries subject to the travel ban proves the White House is using a \"common sense policy\", but expressed suprise that Egypt had not been included. \"I think what the president has decided was that Egypt, despite having one particular incident from an illegal migrant, might have some policies that are in place which are better than other countries,\" he said. Trump's original ban took place in 2017, during his first White House term, and featured some of the same countries as his latest order, including Iran, Libya and Somalia. Critics called it a \"Muslim ban\" as the seven countries initially listed were Muslim majority, and it was immediately challenged in courts across the US. The White House revised the policy, ultimately adding two non-Muslim majority countries, North Korea and Venezuela. It was upheld by the US Supreme Court in 2018. Joe Biden, who succeeded Trump as US president, repealed the ban in 2021, calling it \"a stain on our national conscience\". US immigration law expert Christi Jackson said the new ban suggested \"lessons have been learned\" from Trump's first attempt. The latest ban was not being implemented immediately, the restrictions were \"wider in scope\" and it had \"clearly defined\" exemptions, she told the BBC. Professor of law and former US attorney Barbara McQuade said the last travel ban had \"caused chaos at the border\", while this time Trump had given some advance notice. \"The first time around it included lawful permanent residents or Green Card holders, people who had established status in the United States, which courts found to be a violation of the Constitution,\" she told BBC Newshour. \"This time I think there has been more thought given to this,\" she said, adding it was \"very likely\" to be upheld by the Supreme Court.

    "title": "How are countries on the list responding?",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has signed a proclamation banning travel to the US from nationals of 12 countries, which goes into effect on 9 June. The countries listed are Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo-Brazzaville, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. Nationals from a further seven countries - Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela - will face partial travel restrictions. So far, only the African Union, which represents all 55 nations on the African continent, Chad, Somalia and Venezuela have responded. Here is what they said. ChadPresident Mahamat Déby said he has told his government to \"act in accordance with the principles of reciprocity\" and has suspended issuing visas to US citizens. \"Chad has no planes to offer, no billions of dollars to give but Chad has its dignity and pride,\" he said in a statement. Somalia, whose nationals are banned, had a different response and made an immediate promise to work with the US to address security issues. Somali ambassador to the US, Dahir Hassan Abdi, said: \"Somalia values its longstanding relationship with the United States and stands ready to engage in dialogue to address the concerns raised.\" Meanwhile,African Unioncalled on the US to \"engage in constructive dialogue with the countries concerned\". In a statement, it appealed to the US to exercise its sovereign right to protect its borders and its citizens' security \"in a manner that is balanced, evidence-based, and reflective of the long-standing partnership between the United States and Africa\". The union said it remains concerned about the \"potential negative impact of such measures\", and added that it \"stands ready to support efforts that promote understanding, resolve concerns, and strengthen cooperation\". The ban has also drawn ire fromVenezuela, whose Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello warned Venezuelans in the US. \"The truth is being in the United States is a big risk for anybody, not just for Venezuelans,\" he warned, adding that the US is governed by what he called \"bad people - it's fascism, they are supremacists who think they own the world and persecute our people for no reason\". Venezuela is one of the seven countries listed with partial restrictions. Since starting his second term, Trump has deported a number of Venezuelans alleged to be gang members to El Salvador. Trump's proclamation stated that the list would be evaluated in three months time, and then every six months after that. \"The list is subject to revision based on whether material improvements are made, and likewise new countries can be added as threats emerge around the world,\" he explained on Truth Social. In his video shared to the platform, he said: \"We cannot have open migration from any country where we cannot safely and reliably vet and screen those who see to enter the United States.\" As well as security risks, Trump's proclamation gave other reasons such as the listed countries having \"taken advantage\" of the US by exploiting its visa system, as well as nationals from certain countries, \"pose significant risks\" of overstaying their visas.

    "title": "Olly Alexander on leaving his record deal and his new West End role",
    "article_text": "Singer and actor Olly Alexander has said he has \"come into a different space in my life\", as he announced a new West End stage role after recently parting ways with his record label. The star will appear in the National Theatre's production of The Importance of Being Earnest when it transfers to the West End in September. It will be hisfirst acting role since It's A Sin,Channel 4's acclaimed 2021 drama about the Aids crisis, for which he was nominated for a Bafta Award. \"I'd recently been thinking that I'd love to act again,\" he told BBC News. \"I'd come to the end of my record contract, and I have a bit more breathing space to try a few different things and not feel, oh, well I have to deliver an album to my record label.\" Alexander will take over from Doctor Who star Ncuti Gatwa, who starred in The Importance of Being Earnest when it opened at the National Theatre in 2024. He will play Algernon when the production transfers to the Noel Coward Theatre in London. \"What's not to love?\" Alexander asked. \"It's such a brilliant play, Oscar Wilde's most celebrated comedy. I saw the National production and thought it was fantastic, and this opportunity came along and I jumped at the chance.\" Alexander shot to fame when his band Years & Yearswon the BBC Sound of 2015 polland went on to have hits such as King and Shine, and score a number one album. He later went solo, although continued to perform as Years & Years, and scored another top-charting album in 2021. He has performed with Sir Elton John and Kylie Minogue, and was the UK's Eurovision entrant last year. However, after his most recent album Polari, released in February, reached number 17, Alexander announced his departure from his record label. \"They aren't dropping me, they just aren't renewing my contract,\"he explained at the time.\"It's OK and honestly for the best. I've been on a pretty terrible deal for 10 years. It's time I do something new. But I'll still make music in the future.\" Reflecting on his first decade as a pop star, Alexander told the BBC: \"With music, there's an intensity to the way I've been working and putting albums out, promoting and touring. I definitely want to take the foot off the gas in terms of that intensity.\" He still occasionally works on music, but has \"not been putting pressure on myself... I just do what feels good and feel very lucky that I have this other strand of acting that I'm able to explore\". Alexander said he felt he had \"learned so much\" over the last decade about the way he likes to work. \"But for me,\" he continued, \"a lot of the reason I think the [music] industry has changed so much is that it's set on this model which is very antiquated now, and it's not kept pace with the times. \"Lots of artists have this direct link with their audience via social media. They want their music out quickly. The whole model of promoting it - three singles into an album, then you tour the album, then move onto the next one - it's not really working like it did.\" He noted that record labels could historically make an album a success because they were \"able to pour a lot of money into something\". \"They just can't do that now. Everything has changed. But I think that is exciting for lots of reasons, and it is an exciting place for artists, even though it's harder to break through.\" He concluded: \"If I go back into it, it'll be because I think it's fun and something I want to do, and not think too much about how it's going to perform. \"That's pretty much how I try to always feel, but you're in an environment where you have a lot of other stakeholders, and people telling you it needs to be this or that, and there's always that tension.\" For now, he is focusing on acting. First performed in 1895, The Importance of being Earnest follows two male friends who adopt fictional personas. The farcical comedy unfolds with mistaken identities and makes generous use of clever wordplay. \"In a nutshell, it's a comedy about two quite ridiculous young men and the double lives they lead,\" Alexander explained. \"They do that to avoid their social obligations, and they both invent these aliases called Ernest, while they try and woo and marry these two young women. \"But really, it's a comedy that skewers society's expectations, makes fun of class and what society expects of us, and what roles we're expected to perform.\" The previous production of the show, starring Gatwa, received a positive reception from critics. \"There is an elegance to the nudge-wink references and it is a production with just the right amount of delightful mischief,\"wrote the Guardian's Arifa Akbarin a four-star review. The Daily Mail's Patrick Marmion awardedfive stars, describing the \"sparkling new production\" as a \"witty reboot\". \"Yes, liberties are taken,\" he said. \"But that is surely the best way of blowing the dust off this national treasure.\" In a three-star review,the Telegraph's Dominic Cavendish describedthe show as \"defiantly bold, but more playful than antagonistic\", although he added he wasn't sure the new iteration \"adds much\" to the original. In the play, nobody except Jack and Algernon know about their alter-egos - something which would be much more difficult to pull off now in an age of smartphones. \"It'd be impossible!\" Alexander laughed. \"Our every movement is captured, so there's less room to invent aliases and lead double lives, which in some circumstances is probably for the best. \"What's brilliant about the play is it's set 100 years ago, at a time that feels so different to where we are now, but the themes are so timeless.\" Alexander last appeared in the West End in 2013, before becoming famous as a pop star, with a relatively small role in Peter & Alice alongside Dame Judi Dench. In 2024, Alexander finished in 18th place at Eurovision with his track Dizzy, in a tricky year for the contest which waspartly overshadowed by controversysurrounding Israel's participation. This year's entrants, girl group Remember Monday, ended in a similar position, finishing 19th. Alexander praised their performance, adding that he \"hopes to meet up with them soon and we can exchange stories\". \"But,\" he added, \"I think I'll still be processing and reflecting [on Eurovision] for a long time.\" The singer is excited to be returning to the West End, not least because it will mean performing continuously in one venue. \"I spent a lot of my previous years moving around, touring, which is so fun and amazing,\" he reflects. \"But I also very much appreciate staying in one place now. \"Having a home in London with my partner, my cats, just trotting off to the theatre every night - that just sounds like the most wonderful existence.\" The 43-year-old global superstar performed the first night of her six show residency in London.

    "title": "Israeli military recovers bodies of husband and wife held hostage in Gaza",
    "article_text": "Israeli forces have recovered the bodies of two Israeli-Americans taken back to Gaza as hostages during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, the Israeli military says. Judi Weinstein Haggai, 70, who was also a Canadian citizen, and her husband Gadi Haggai, 72, were murdered by gunmen from the Mujahideen Brigades group when they attacked Kibbutz Nir Oz, a statement said. Their bodies were found in the southern Khan Younis area of Gaza overnight and brought back to Israel for forensic identification. There are now 56 hostages still being held by Hamas in Gaza, at least 20 of whom are believed to be alive. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he and his wife sent their condolences to the families of Judi and Gadi Haggai. \"Our hearts grieve over this terrible loss. May their memories be blessed,\" he added. \"I would like to thank, and express appreciation to, the fighters and commanders for this determined and successful operation. We will not rest, nor will we be silent, until we return home all of our hostages - the living and the deceased.\" The couple's families recalled how they \"went out for a walk on the morning of that cursed Saturday and never returned\". \"We welcome the closure and their return to a proper burial at home, in Israel,\" they said. Judi, an English teacher, and Gadi Haggai, who used to work in Kibbutz Nir Oz's kitchen, were last seen alive in a video they shared with a group chat at the start of the 7 October attack. They were seen taking cover in a field as incoming rockets fired from Gaza streaked overhead and the sound of gunfire was heard. Judi later told friends and relatives they had been wounded, before ceasing contact. The couple's daughter Iris Weinstein Haggai said after the attack her mother had told her they had been \"shot by terrorists on a motorcycle and that my dad was wounded really bad\". She added: \"Paramedics tried to send her an ambulance. The ambulance got hit by a rocket.\" In December 2023, the kibbutz announced that both Judi and Gadi were killed that day and their bodies were being held hostage in Gaza. On Wednesday, an Israeli military official said the couple's bodies were recovered from the Khan Younis area following an operation based on \"precise intelligence\" from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the Shin Bet security service. They said they could not disclose further details due to the sensitivity of the operation. However, Israeli Army Radio reported the intelligence was obtained through the Shin Bet's interrogation of a Palestinian fighter captured by Israeli troops in Gaza. \"We will keep doing the utmost for the mission of bringing our hostages back - the living, to reunite with their families, and the deceased to dignified burial. We will deploy all the methods and tools in our disposal for this goal,\" the military official said. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum urged decision-makers to do everything they could to agree a new ceasefire deal with Hamas to secure the return of all the remaining hostages. \"There is no need to wait another 608 agonising days for this,\" it said. \"The mission can be completed as early as tomorrow morning. This is what the majority of the Israeli people want.\" US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he was \"united in prayer\" for the Haggai family. \"Hamas must release all remaining hostages, including Omer Neutra and Itay Chen,\" he added, referring to two other Israeli-Americans who the Israeli military says were killed on 7 October while serving as soldiers and whose bodies were taken back to Gaza. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said: \"The return of their remains is a time to begin to heal and to rest. We mourn with [Judi Haggai's] family. May her memory be a blessing.\" Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the unprecedented cross-border attack almost 20 months ago, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. Another four people, two of them dead, were already being held captive in Gaza before the conflict. So far, 199 hostages have been returned, 148 of them alive, mostly through two temporary ceasefire deals with Hamas. At least 54,677 people have been killed in Gaza during the war, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Israel imposed a total blockade on Gaza on 2 March and resumed its military offensive against Hamas two weeks later, collapsing a two-month truce during which 33 Israeli hostages and five Thai hostages were freed. Israel said it wanted to put pressure on Hamas to release the remaining hostages. On 19 May, the Israeli military launched an expanded offensive that Netanyahu said would see troops \"take control of all areas\" of Gaza. Israel also partially eased its blockade, allowing some food into the territory amid warnings from experts of a looming famine. More than 4,400 people have reportedly been killed in Gaza over the past three months, while 640,000 others have been displaced again by Israeli ground operations and evacuation orders. Hopes of a new ceasefire deal faded last week, with Hamas and Israel remaining at odds over the conditions of the latest US proposal. Hamas said it was prepared to release 10 living hostages and the bodies of 18 dead ones, which was the number specified in US envoy Steve Witkoff's proposal, in exchange for a 60-day truce and the release of Palestinian prisoners. But the group also repeated its demands for guarantees that the truce would lead to a permanent ceasefire, as well as a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and the resumption of unrestricted aid deliveries. Israel called Hamas's statement a refusal of the proposal, and Witkoff said it was totally unacceptable. But a Hamas official insisted it had acted positively and responsibly. Democrats are wondering what to do with aging candidates after revelations about Joe Biden's health. It comes hours after Harvard filed a lawsuit accusing Donald Trump of pursuing a  a \"government vendetta\" against the university.

    "title": "Boy and girl sentenced for killing dog walker, 80",
    "article_text": "A 15-year-old boy and a 13-year-old girl have been sentenced for killing an 80-year-old man out walking his dog in a park. Bhim Kohli died the day after he was assaulted in Franklin Park, yards from his home in Braunstone Town, Leicestershire, on 1 September last year. The boy, who racially abused Mr Kohli before slapping him in the face with a slider shoe, was sentenced to seven years in custody at Leicester Crown Court on Thursday. The girl, who encouraged the assault and laughed as she filmed it on her phone, was given a youth rehabilitation order of three years and made subject to a six-month curfew. Both were convicted of manslaughter. During the hearing, prosecutor Harpreet Sandu KC said Mr Kohli was subjected to a \"seven-and-a-half minute period of continuing aggression\" while taking his dog Rocky for a walk. The attack left Mr Kohli with three broken ribs and other fractures, but Mr Sandhu KC said the fatal injury was to his spinal cord, caused by a spine fracture. Mr Kohli's children found him at the park \"screaming out\" in pain after the attack. Mr Kohli's daughter, Susan Kohli, told the court he was a \"devoted life partner\" to his wife Satinder for 55 years. Taking to the witness box to read her victim impact statement out to the court, she said: \"We feel nothing but anger and disgust towards the boy and the girl. \"The girl disgustingly videoed dad as he lay on his side after the attack. \"Dad passed away before our eyes surrounded by his family who all had tears in their eyes.\" Ms Kohli added she and her mother were always \"looking over our shoulders when taking Rocky for a walk after what happened to dad\". Before passing sentence, Mr Justice Turner told the boy he did not find he attacked Mr Kohli due to his race, even though the court heard he used racist language. \"You made a cowardly attack on an elderly man,\" he added. Mr Justice Turner said he was sure the boy wanted to \"confront\" Mr Kohli in order to impress the girl as she filmed what happened. He said the boy approached Mr Kohli while wearing a balaclava, adding the elderly man had done nothing to deserve the attack that followed. Addressing the girl, he told her she \"did not play a leading role\" but it was not a minor part either. Speaking on the steps outside court after sentencing, Ms Kohli said: \"The death of my dad has left a hole in our family. \"A hole that can never be filled because of the actions of two teenagers. \"I believe that on that day the two teenagers made a choice; the boy chose to attack my dad and the girl chose to film my dad's attack. \"I feel angry and disappointed by the sentenced passed as it does not reflect the severity.\" She added that, after the boy and girl have served their sentences, \"they still have life ahead of them\". The BBC was told it was reported to police that in July, Mr Kohli had stones thrown at him and was spat at by a group of children after he told them to get off his neighbour's garage roof. And the following month,Mr Kohli had spokeafter he saw two white boys aged 12 and 13 racially abuse a man and throw a large rock at him near the same park where he encountered his own attackers. A witness to the August attack, Linda Haigh, said she warned police about racially motivated problems in the area before Mr Kohli died, and believes he would still be alive had they taken her more seriously. An investigation conducted by Leicestershire Police, reviewed by the Independent Office for Police Conduct, did not identify any \"misconduct or missed opportunities which could have prevented Mr Kohli's death\". Ch Supt Jonathan Starbuck said: \"Prior to Mr Kohli's death, police were aware of two reports of anti-social behaviour involving youths in the Franklin Park area which were being investigated. \"Partnership work in the area following Mr Kohli's death did identify further incidents which had not been reported.\" He added that \"organisational learning\" to improve logging anti-social behaviour had been identified. Kelly Matthews, senior district crown prosecutor for the CPS in the East Midlands, said it was \"not often that we see individuals so young in court charged with violent offences\". \"The girl was the catalyst for this attack taking place,\" Ms Matthews said, when asked why the female defendant had also been found guilty of manslaughter. \"If it wasn't for her, then events may have unfolded differently on that day. \"She pointed out Mr Kohli to the boy. She approached Mr Kohli with the boy. When the boy started attacking Mr Kohli, she took out her phone and started filming the incident and laughing, encouraging him.\" Ms Matthews said \"some very young witnesses\" gave key evidence about what happened before and after the attack, \"specifically of the two defendants bragging about what had happened\".

    "title": "Private school pupil numbers drop by 11,000",
    "article_text": "There were 11,000 fewer pupils at private schools in England this January compared to the same time last year, according to the latest school census data. The figures, released on Thursday, come after the government removed a VAT exemption for private schools on 1 January. A government spokesman said the drop in pupils \"remains firmly within historical patterns\" and \"shatters the myth\" of a private school exodus. But private schools disagreed and said more pupils than expected were leaving the independent sector due to higher fees putting more pressure on parents. The figures from the census of all schools in England provide the first complete picture of what is happening in the independent sector after the new 20% VAT on fees was introduced at the beginning of the year. Overall, 582,477 pupils in England attended private schools when the census data was collected in January this year, down from 593,486 the year before - a drop of 1.9% (or 11,009 pupils). Overall pupil numbers in England have fallen slightly to just over nine million. There was a smaller drop (0.6%) in the number of pupils not at private school. Private school pupils now make up 6.4% of the total school population, a slightly lower proportion than last year, when it was 6.5%. This is the first time since the Covid-19 pandemic that independent school pupil numbers have fallen. The government hadpreviously predictedthat around 3,000 private school pupils would need to be absorbed into the state system this academic year, with state school places needed for around 37,000 private school pupils over the coming years. This was an estimate of those who would be motivated to take their children out of private school as a direct result of its decision to remove the VAT exemption from private school fees, not taking into account any demographic changes. The census data does not give clear reasons as to why pupils have left private school. It could include a shift in international students or a move to home-schooling which would not be reflected in the state school figures. Julie Robinson, chief executive of the Independent Schools Council (ISC), a body which represents most of the private schools in the UK, suggested that VAT on fees was putting pressure on parents and was the reason behind the drop. She said: \"More pupils have left than the government's own estimates. This outsized exodus should concern anyone who is interested in this tax on education as a revenue raiser.\" The ISC, which represents more than 1,400 private schools, previously said its annual census showed average school fees were 22.6% higher in January 2025 than they had been in January 2024. The government said the nearly 2% drop in private school pupils reflected \"the broader demographic trends and changes in the state sector\". A spokesman added: \"Ending tax breaks for private schools will raise £1.8 billion a year by 2029/30 to help fund public services, including supporting the 94% of children in state schools, to help ensure excellence everywhere for every child.\" The Education Policy Institute, an independent education think tank, said it was \"too early to see the full effects of adding VAT to private school fees\" in this year's census data, given the policy was introduced in the middle of this academic year. They said it was also important to consider broader demographic trends in education. \"As expected, today's statistics show an ongoing decline in primary school pupil numbers and the number of pupils in secondary schools is expected to peak over the course of this parliament,\" the institute added. At the moment a population bulge in England is moving from primary schools into secondary schools, with a bigger drop off in primary age students compared to secondary. Overall student numbers are set to fall by 700,000 in England by 2030. Additional reporting by Wesley Stephenson and Miguel Roca-Terry",

    "title": "'Genius' Yamal & all-time classic - why Spain are World Cup favourites",
    "article_text": "Lamine Yamal (centre) has scored six goals for Spain with one more game to come before he turns 18 Spain and France played out a Nations League semi-final game for the ages with a scoreline that looks like it belongs in a penalty shootout. The5-4 win for Spainhas everyone wondering if anyone can stop these attackers - although the less said about the defenders, the better. Spain, who play Portugal in Sunday's final, are looking for a third Uefa tournament success in a row having won the last Nations League and Euro 2024. And they are favourites for the World Cup coming up next summer, with France second on the list. Spain showed why they will be tough to stop after one of the most exciting international games in memory. A total of 40 shots, 17 on target, nine goals. Spain led 4-0 and 5-1 - and threatened to blow France away - before their rivals rallied. If only every match was like this. \"It was a crazy game,\" said Spain goalscorer Mikel Merino. \"Not the best game for the coaches - nobody wants to concede so many goals - but an amazing game for the fans.\" His boss Luis de la Fuente seemed to actually disagree with him. \"I'm happy. I enjoy suffering! I don't understand sport without suffering,\" he said. \"When two great teams face off like today, it's normal every team makes the most of their moments.\" Lamine Yamal, who turns 18 later this summer, netted twice for Spain to cement his credentials as a Ballon d'Or contender. He is up to six goals for his country now, to add to 25 for club side Barcelona. Yamal impressed more than France's PSG stars - Ousmane Dembele and Desire Doue - who were hyped up pre-game after phenomenal club seasons. Les Bleus debutant Rayan Cherki help spark France's fightback after coming off the bench to show why he is being linked to Liverpool and Manchester City. Yamal shines as Spain beat France in nine-goal thriller Battle of Ballon d'Or favourites - Yamal v Dembele in Nations League It would almost take too long to address everything that happened in the game. But here goes. Mikel Oyarzabal picked out Nico Williams to net Spain's opener, before also setting up Merino four minutes later. It was almost 3-0 when Dean Huijsen had a goal disallowed for offside after a sensational free-kick routine. \"That belongs in a musuem,\" said Prime Video summariser Karen Bardsley. After the break Yamal was fouled and scored the resulting penalty, with Williams finding Pedri shortly after for their fourth. Kylian Mbappe netted a penalty to pull one back, but Yamal bagged his second with a fine first touch and finish. \"It's hard to argue with the genius that you see before you,\" said Bardsley on seeing Yamal poke home his second. That was 5-1 but then France came back. Dembele hit the post, before debutant Cherki volleyed in from the edge of the box. Dani Vivian turned a cross into his own net and then Randal Kolo Muani nodded in from Cherki's good ball. But they could not create another chance in the remaining two minutes of stoppage time to force the extra-time period every neutral wanted. After 75 minutes it looked as if the story was going to be about Spain blowing France away to cement their place as favourites to win everything going. They were the best side by some way at Euro 2024 and show no signs of slowing down. Wingers Yamal, who seems to improve with every game - which is actually to be expected at the age of 17 - and Williams were electric. Midfielders Merino and Pedri were on the scoresheet. Oyarzabal had two assists to his name. Their oldest player was 28, and the team had an average age of 24. But there will be question marks about a defence that let in four goals - and a team who almost blew a 5-1 lead. Yamal said: \"When two great teams like this play, you sometimes see a lot of goals. They will make you suffer until the end but we went to the final despite the mistakes we made.\" Unai Simon had to make six saves, so this was far from a story of an opponent who scored every shot. \"That was a typical Spain performance,\" said Spanish journalist Guillem Balague. \"These players come out on the pitch with the feeling they can beat anyone. \"The interesting thing is they are doing it, winning and creating magic within a structure. \"Spain have been playing in a way that represents the predominant model of our times. Not only are these players intelligent, creative but they are committed as well. They work so hard to get the ball back. \"Even though at the end Spain relaxed, when you do that you believe you belong to the right path. \"You have special players all over the park and of course the feeling is more people are watching Spain because its really enjoyable and winning seems to be a habit.\" Kylian Mbappe plays his club football in Spain for Real Madrid France's attackers were pretty decent. Even when they were getting whacked by Spain before the hour-mark, they were still having plenty of chances. They had more shots than Spain did in both halves - and more efforts on target in total. Mbappe, speaking to RTVE, said: \"We had some bursts of play we haven't had for a long time. But in just 10 minutes of the first-half, we conceded two goals - and the same thing happened in the second half. \"We weren't consistent throughout the 90 minutes, but we did improve. It's not all negative.\" PSG's two-goal Champions League final scorer Doue went close, team-mate and Ballon d'Or contender Dembele hit the post - and Mbappe had chances before scoring his penalty. But 21-year-old Lyon attacker Cherki had a big role after coming on. His sweet volley from the edge of the box was probably the best goal of the game - and his cross for Kolo Muani to make it 5-4 was inch-perfect. Again though, like Spain, it was the defending which was the issue. Juventus full-back Pierre Kalulu, making his debut on his 25th birthday, struggled. Clement Lenglet, winning his first cap since 2021, was caused problems too. \"I'm not here to point fingers but I have a backline who are used to working together,\" said boss Didier Deschamps. \"[This was] about finding another line who aren't used to playing together. I'm not going to give up on this defence. There were mitigating circumstances. But Spain have this capability to be very efficient. We were able to score goals too.\" Sulaimon Adelekan:This Spain side is so good and young, they could rule world football for the next six years with Yamal, Pedri, Gavi and Nico Williams still yet to peak. They are dismantling and destroying France. Victor:With the way it's going, this Spanish team will easily win the next World Cup. There is simply no need traveling to USA. Robbie:Spain are the best team in the world at moment and it's not even close. Nick:Spain probably are currently the best team in the world, but a full-strength Germany (they were missing RÃ¼diger, Musiala and Havertz yesterday) are close - they were the only team that can really claim they should have beaten Spain at the Euros with the chances they created - and Argentina are strong, too. I feel like France will be incredible at the next World Cup - they just need to work out what their best XI is, because they've arguably got too many good players!

    "title": "'There is no crisis' before Euro 2025 - Wiegman",
    "article_text": "This video can not be played 'I'm really happy where we are right now' England manager Sarina Wiegman says \"there is no crisis\" despite a chaotic 10 days which has seen three high-profile senior players either retire from international football in the build-up to Euro 2025 or withdraw from the tournament. Wiegman named a23-player squadon Thursday for the tournament in Switzerland, which starts on 2 July, where England are defending champions. She will be without goalkeeper Mary Earps and midfielder Fran Kirby, who have both retired from international football, while defender Millie Bright, who captained the side to the World Cup final in 2023, withdrew from selection to focus on her mental and physical wellbeing. The loss of three players, who have won a combined 217 caps, in such a short time has led to a potentiallyunsettling periodfor the Lionesses - and distractions off the pitch dominated discussions at the end of their Women's Nations League campaign this week. \"Yeah, of course, [it] has been hard,\" said Wiegman. \"I think there are three different stories and every story is one on its own. \"[These are] players who have been with us for a long time, who I have been working with for a long time and so that's hard.\" But the Dutchwoman says she is happy with the atmosphere inside the England camp. \"You [the media] see part of it, you are not in our environment all the time and I can ensure that the training sessions were really good last week,\" she said. \"I didn't see anything [to suggest] that there were no connections within the team. I am really happy [with] where we are right now.\" Wiegman had to address issues aroundplayer's performance-related bonusesin the build-up to the World Cup and there was also heavy scrutiny on her decision to omit former captain Steph Houghton from the Euro 2022 squad in her first year in charge. \"My experiences before is that there is always noise. We expect noise until we go into the tournament,\" said Wiegman. \"The difference is, between 2015 and 2017 to now, is that the attention and visibility of the women's game has increased so much. \"It seems like there is more noise but there's just more journalists here. Which is right. It shows what we are doing. We have to deal with it and move on. Which we have.\" Meet the players in England's Euro 2025 squad James and Agyemang in England's Euro 2025 squad Chelsea and England defender Bright has knee surgery Sarina Wiegman is aiming to win a third successive Euros title as manager Wiegman said she was feeling \"good\" despite it being a week full of difficult decisions and conversations. Kirby's retirement followed Wiegman's decision not to include her in the Euros squad, while goalkeeper Earps was unhappy at her position as number two. Wiegman said it is \"part of the job\" to endure those experiences but she can \"move forward\" to the Euros now. \"Yes, those hard conversations are not nice. I know what players do and how hard they work to make the squad. It's hard to give disappointing messages,\" she added. \"At the same time, I also had very nice messages to give so that gives me more energy. \"After I have conversations with players, I always think, 'OK, what went well?' For me, it is really important that I am honest, that I treat people in the right way. \"Sometimes, you have very good news and, sometimes, you don't have good news - and I don't go around the bush with that. \"I just give that message, then I can't always control how people respond to that. I just hope that they have the clarity to move on.\" Wiegman also said part of the growth of women's football, and the success of the Lionesses, has added increased demands on her players. Bright's withdrawal has been a blow for England as Wiegman said the Chelsea captain would have been selected had she not ruled herself out. Asked when she was made aware of Bright's decision, she said: \"In the last couple of days I found out. It was sad and disappointing. \"It's not nice when you don't feel well physically and mentally and I just hope she feels better soon. \"England's profile is growing. That's life changing and very exciting but at the same time players are not robots. They have to deal with these things too. \"That's also why we're trying to support them as well as possible on and off the pitch. Hopefully many players stay fit and healthy.\" This video can not be played 'Me and Alessia were texting all morning' Head here to get involved Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "How can Man Utd afford Mbeumo deal?",
    "article_text": "Bryan Mbeumo scored 20 Premier League goals last season for Brentford Manchester United may have no European football to look forward to next season but it has not prevented them from delving into the transfer market. A Â£62.5m deal was agreed tosign Brazil forward Matheus Cunhafrom Wolves on the opening day of the latest transfer window,  which is split into two phases this summer. United are now also in pursuit ofBrentford striker Bryan Mbeumoafter submitting a bid of Â£45m and Â£10m in add-ons for the Cameroon international. However, this activity is set against the backdrop of part owner Sir Jim Ratcliffedelivering a dire assement of the club's finances in Marchand the subsequent ramifications of their Europa League final defeat by Tottenham. That denied the 20-time English champions a Champions League spot and a guaranteedÂ£70m just for participatingin Europe's elite club competition. Since then captain Bruno Fernandes has also rejected the overtures of Saudi Pro-League club Al-Hilal, which may have generated a transfer fee of between Â£80m-Â£100m. And given United ended up 15th in the Premier League last term,  and boss Ruben Amorim is wedded to a 3-4-3 formation that is not suited to those at his disposal, the club's need for new blood seems greater than ever before. But just how can they afford it without breaching profit and sustainability rules (PSR) which limit clubs to losses of Â£105m over three years? BBC Sport talks to football finance expert Kieran Maguire, who estimates that the club will still be well within their means even if they outlay Â£150m on new signings. 'A clear idea' - what is Man Utd's transfer strategy? 'Man Utd didn't need the money' - Fernandes rejects Al-Hilal move The noises coming out of Old Trafford from Amorim and his players felt despondent and defeatist in the immediate aftermath of United's failure to reach the Champions League. Defender Luke Shaw describeda club at \"rock bottom\", while the former Sporting boss questioned his own future in Manchester. There were suggestions transfer moves would be downgraded from a Plan A to less expensive alternatives, all while news of a new wave ofredundancies to cut costsfiltered through. Gallows humour pervaded in the stands prior to United's final Premier League game of a dismal 2024-25 campaign against Aston Villa - especially when talk turned to their prospects for next year. Yet, for Maguire, talk of a financial crisis and a club struggling to meet PSR obligations is well wide of the mark. \"Even without European football they [United] could spend Â£150m without breaking into a sweat,\" Maguire told BBC Sport. \"The picture that has been painted of Manchester United's finances has exaggerated the negativity. They make more cash on a day-to-day basis than any other club in the Premier League. \"The club does not lose as much money as is claimed and their position is far better than everybody is looking at because everybody is looking at the wrong company. \"Everybody is looking at the New York company - Manchester United plc but there is another company called Red Football which is owned by the Glazers and that is forming the basis of the PSR calculation. \"The losses at Red Football Ltd are far lower than they are at Manchester United plc so therefore the extent of the damage is far less than originally envisaged.\" On the face of it, deals for former Atletico Madrid player Cunha and potentially Mbeumo would total over Â£100m and eat into a significant chunk of United's summer budget before sales. However, accounting practices mean that is not actually the case. \"When you bring in a new player you would normally put them on a four or five-year contract. The way the accounting works - you take the cost of the player and divide it by the length of the contract,\" added Maguire. \"If you sign someone for Â£150m it would cost them Â£30m next year plus the wages. \"But you only have to go and sell a couple of players of the calibre of [Alejandro] Garnacho, [Marcus] Rashford and co to get more than Â£60m of profit coming in, so it effectively pays for itself. \"So you can pay out a far bigger multiple than the sales proceeds of those that might be departing.\" The likes of Tyrell Malacia, Jadon Sancho, Rashford, Garnacho and Antony have all been tipped to depart permanently this summer. In addition there has also been speculation over the future of goalkeepers Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir, and 20-year-old midfielder Kobbie Mainoo, who almost 12 months ago was in the England starting XI for the final of the European Championship. \"If a football club sells a player, normally the profit which goes into your PSR calculations is the difference between the sales price and the book value. Without getting too technical the book value is how much you originally pay for the player less how much you have written off to date. \"With an academy player you have not paid anything for the player's registration so if we look at other clubs and Chelsea in particular, the sales of Conor Gallagher, Fikayo Tomori, Tammy Abraham, Billy Gilmour and Mason Mount - they all came through the academy and when you sell them it is 100% profit. \"In the case of Manchester United they have three players [Rashford, Garnacho and Mainoo] who have been mentioned in media outlets as being possibly for sale and they are going to generate pure profit. \"It is far better [PSR-wise] than selling a player who has only been at the club a couple of years and who has underperformed.\" Latest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views Get Man Utd news notifications Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "No assurances over England number three - Wright",
    "article_text": "Jacob Bethell and Ollie Pope played in the same England team on the tour of New Zealand England selector Luke Wright stopped short of backing incumbent number three Ollie Pope after Jacob Bethell was included in the squad for the first Test against India. Bethell, 21, returns after missing the defeat of Zimbabwe while at the Indian Premier League with Royal Challengers Bengaluru. Before that match, Test captain Ben Stokes appeared to suggest Bethell would make an immediate return to the XI when available. After vice-captain Pope made a sparkling century at Trent Bridge, Stokes clarified that he was referring to Bethell returning to the squad and claimed his earlier comments had been \"twisted to suit an agenda\". Although Pope is still expected to retain his place at Headingley, Wright said: \"We'll get together when we get up to Leeds and announce that two days out from the Test. \"We'll consider everything: conditions, what has gone before. All of those considerations go into the melting pot.\" Left-hander Bethell made three half-centuries in New Zealand at the end of last year, batting at number three after Pope slid down the order to stand in as wicketkeeper. Though he opted to miss the Zimbabwe Test in order to play at the IPL, he further impressed in the first one-day international against West Indies last week with 82 at Edgbaston. On the prospect of Bethell playing in the first Test, Wright said he is \"very close\". Wright added: \"It's a great option to have. What a talent we all see in him. It's a great issue to have, to have that depth in the squad.\" Bethell and Overton in England first Test squad Tendulkar-Anderson Trophy for England-India series Salt to miss West Indies T20s on paternity leave Bethell could pressure opener Zak Crawley or frontline spinner Shoaib Bashir for a place in the XI but realistically it is a choice between the Warwickshire man and Pope. Former England all-rounder Wright rejected the suggestion that the lack of clarity around Bethell's position could unsettle the established members of the squad. \"Everyone knows before you go into any game there are always places up for grabs,\" said Wright. \"I don't think anyone takes it for granted in international cricket. That's the way it always should be. \"You want a strong squad. They are all big lads who know what it is all about. There will always be speculation about what that XI will be. I'm sure the players will be very aware of what's going on and how it's going to look before that first Test.\" Elsewhere, Jamie Overton returns to the Test squad for the first time in three years, but Matthew Potts misses out. Wright explained that England wanted the option of Overton's extra pace, while Potts had fallen behind Sam Cook in the role of Chris Woakes' new-ball understudy. It was also confirmed that Jofra Archer is planning to play for Sussex in their County Championship match at Durham, beginning on 22 June. Archer, has not played red-ball cricket for more than four years because of a string of injuries. He would have played for England Lions against India A at Northampton on Friday had it not been for a thumb injury. Instead he will look to play for the Sussex second XI, then the first team at Chester-le-Street, with a view to being available for the second or third Test against India.

    "title": "The Queen of Clay's reign ends - but Swiatek 'will be back'",
    "article_text": "Iga Swiatek's semi-final defeat on Friday was the first time she had lost at the French Open since 2021 French Open 2025 Dates:25 May-8 JuneVenue:Roland Garros Coverage:Live radio commentaries across 5 Live Sport and BBC Sounds, plus live text commentaries on the BBC Sport website and app Losing at the French Open is not something Iga Swiatek is accustomed to. Having won four of the past five titles at Roland Garros, the 24-year-old has become known as the 'Queen of Clay' - but her reign always felt under threat coming into this year's tournament. Swiatek's current frailties were exposed by world number one Aryna Sabalenka in a blockbuster semi-final on Thursday. Swiatek's serve was obliterated by Belarus' Sabalenka, who converted eight break points to end Swiatek's 26-match winning streak on the Paris clay. \"Iga will be back and she will be better,\" said former world number nine Andrea Petkovic, who analysed the match for BBC Radio 5 Live. \"I did think this year's tournament was a huge step forward for her in terms of form.\" Sabalenka takes out Swiatek to reach French Open final Gen Z aim to deny history-chasing Djokovic Hewett and Reid into sixth-straight French Open final In the eyes of many seasoned observers, Swiatek was the third favourite for the title behind Sabalenka and American second seed Gauff, who beat French wildcard Lois Boisson in Thursday's second semi-final. Swiatek has been nowhere near her dominant best over the past year, failing to reach a final since last year's French Open triumph and slipping to her lowest ranking since March 2022. After a chastening defeat in the Italian Open third round, Swiatek's return to Paris offered positivity. \"I think I already changed my mindset before this tournament,\" said Swiatek shortly after her first French Open defeat since 2021. \"Losing early in Rome gave me some time and perspective.\" The former long-time world number one looked more like her old self as she rolled through her opening three matches without dropping a set. When a tougher test arrived against Elena Rybakina in the last 16, Swiatek fought back from losing the opening set 6-1 and answered more of the lingering questions around her form. She showed similar resilience in the opening set against Sabalenka, recovering from 4-1 down to force the set back on serve. Altering her return position helped Swiatek fight back from a poor start, where she was overwhelmed by Sabalenka's power, and take the match into a decider. However, the fifth seed did not have the capability - or perhaps belief - to sustain her level and rolled over in a 22-minute third set. Overall, though, Swiatek felt she had positives to take from the past fortnight. \"I played some quality matches,\" said Swiatek, who has still won 32 of her 42 matches this season. \"Now it's probably not the best time to look at the wider perspective. \"Probably it wasn't a bad tournament, but obviously not the result I wanted.\" There are a mixture of reasons - on and off the court - as to why Swiatek's level has dipped. Losing in the Olympics semi-finals in Paris last summer was a bitter blow, with Swiatek saying she cried for \"six hours\" afterwards. But later came a bigger bombshell - Swiatek had failed a doping test. It was announced in November she had tested positive for heart medication trimetazidine (TMZ) in an out-of-competition sample. She was subsequently given a one-month ban after the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) accepted the result was caused by contamination. Swiatek decided to switch coach at the end of last year, replacing Tomas Wiktorowski with Wim Fissette, and it is taking time for the changes she is making to bed in. The destructive forehand - her most effective tool on the clay - has lost some of its reliability, while her service game has been picked apart by big-hitting opponents. \"Maybe she lost a little bit of a confidence, so that's why sometimes you see her missing balls that she shouldn't be missing,\" said Sabalenka. \"But overall, I think it was a really high-level match and she played really great tennis.\" Sabalenka's victory emphasised her position as the runaway leader on the WTA Tour and it is hard to see Swiatek challenging her on the Wimbledon grass next month. Sabalenka's powerful game transfers well onto the faster surface, while Swiatek has never gone past the SW19 quarter-finals. \"We know Iga doesn't love that surface so I'm interested to see where she goes from here,\" added Petkovic. \"I think that is going to be very fascinating to watch.\" Live scores, results and order of play Get tennis news sent straight to your phone",

    "article_text": "Luis Diaz joined Liverpool from Porto in January 2022 in a deal worth around Â£37m Liverpool have rejected an approach from Barcelona to speak to forward Luis Diaz. Club sources told BBC Sport that Colombia international Diaz, one of Liverpool's key players in winning the Premier League title last season, is not for sale. The 28-year-old joined Liverpool from Porto in January 2022 and has a contract with the club until 2027. He scored 13 goals and made seven assists in the league as Liverpool won the title by 10 points. Diaz attracted interest from Manchester City last summer and also has admirers in Saudi Arabia. \"I'm very happy at Liverpool - I've always said so,\" said Diaz, who is on international duty for his country's games against Peru and Argentina. \"They've welcomed me very well. \"The transfer market is opening, and we're trying to arrange what's best for us. I'm waiting to see what happens. \"If Liverpool gives us a good extension or I have to see out my two-year contract, I'll be happy. It all depends on them. I'm here to decide and see what's best for us and the future.\" Wirtz and Kerkez next? Why Liverpool are spending big Delap done - which other strikers will be wanted this summer? Speculation about Diaz's future increased after he and his girlfriend both wrote lengthy posts on social media to Liverpool fans that could be interpreted as farewell messages. Liverpool sporting director Richard Hughes and Fenway Sports Group's chief executive of football Michael Edwards have looked to refresh Arne Slot's squad early in the transfer window. Last week the Premier League champions completed theÂ£29.5 million signing of Dutch right-back Jeremie Frimpongfrom Bayer Leverkusen. Liverpool are close to agreeing a club-record Â£109m fee to sign Germany midfielder Florian Wirtz from Leverkusen, and are in talks to sign Bournemouth left-back Milos Kerkez for between Â£45m and Â£50m. Georgian goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili will join the squad after joining Liverpool last summer but spending the season on loan at Valencia. In April, prolific forward Mohamed Salah ended speculation about his future by signing a new two-year contract to keep him at Anfield until 2027, while captain Virgil van Dijk signed a new deal later that month. Trent Alexander-Arnold has joined Real Madrid one month before the end of his Liverpool contract, while goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher has beensold to Brentfordfor an initial Â£12.5m fee.

    "title": "Dehorning rhinos reduces poaching by 80%, study finds",
    "article_text": "Cutting the horns off rhinos causes a large reduction in poaching, according to a new study, which raises questions about the effectiveness of expensive anti-poaching techniques used to protect the African mammals. Poaching for horn is a significant threat to the world’s five rhino species. The substance, which is similar to human fingernails, is commonly used for traditional medicine in China, Vietnam and other Asian countries. Dealers in the hidden market will pay tens of thousands of dollars for the horns, which are falsely believed to be effective at treating fevers, pain and a low sex drive in traditional medicine. Butnew researchin the journal Science has highlighted ways to better protect the animals from illegal hunters. An assessment of rhino protection methods in the Greater Kruger region of South Africa – home to a quarter of the continent’s rhinos – found that removing horns reduced poaching by nearly 80% between 2017 and 2023. In a collaboration between scientists, conservationists and government officials, the research found no statistical evidence that traditional anti-poaching interventions – such as rangers, detection cameras, dog tracking and helicopters – caused significant reductions in rhino poaching, despite their multimillion-dollar cost, even though they were successful at detecting hundreds of poachers. “Dehorning rhinos to reduce incentives for poaching was found to achieve a 78% reduction in poaching using just 1.2% of the overall rhino protection budget,” said Dr Tim Kuiper of Nelson Mandela University, a lead author of the study. “We might need to rethink our goals. Do we just want to arrest poachers? It doesn’t appear to be making a massive difference to reducing rhino poaching.” To dehorn a rhino, workerssedate the animal, apply a blindfold and earplugs, and cut off the horn with a power saw. The horn will gradually regrow – an average rhino needs to be dehorned every 1.5 to two years. The process poses a very low risk to the animal and does not hurt it. “The headline result is that dehorning stood out for its effectiveness. We are cautious to say that the other interventions are not working. They worked when measured by whether they were detecting poachers. But detecting and arresting a load of poachers doesn’t necessarily bend the curve on rhino poaching,” Kuiper said. In South Africa, rhino poaching remains high,with 103 killed in the first three months of 2025. Last year, 420 were lost. In recent decades, rhino populations have collapsed in Asia and Africa due to poaching and habitat loss, continuing falls driven by European colonial hunters. But the researchers behind the project, representing the University of Cape Town, Nelson Mandela University, University of Stellenbosch and the University of Oxford and other conservation institutions, cautioned that dehorning rhinos was not a magic bullet. A significant stump of horn mass remains on the rhino after dehorning, and some poachers were still prepared to kill rhinos for this section. Sharon Haussmann, a pioneer in rhino conservation in South Africa and co-author on the paper, played a leading role in coordinating conservation efforts in the study area. She died unexpectedly atthe weekendand Kuiper wanted to highlight the collaboration between different sectors that are often mistrustful of each other in her memory. “Is a rhino still a rhino without its horn? That’s a bigger question,” said Kuiper. One study of black rhinosindicated that while poaching rates decreased, dehorned animals became more timid and covered much smaller ranges. Researchers believe that horn is used to establish territories and dehorned rhinos were unable to do this after the procedure. “We wouldn’t like to keep dehorning them for the next 100 years,” Kuiper said. “Ideally we would like to address the drivers of poaching. But it is better than the impacts of poaching” Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverage",

    "title": "Idris Elba: ‘I want to build the African Odeon’",
    "article_text": "Idris Elba has spoken of his ambition to create the “African Odeon” – a chain of cinemas to ignite the cinemagoing experience across the continent. Elba was speaking at an event at SXSW London in which he spoke to host Clara Amfo in a session called Creativity as Capital for Change. In remarksreported by the Hollywood Reporterand Screen, Elba said: “There’s a crazy number across the entire continent – less than about 3,000 cinemas, actual cinemas that you and I have grown up with. I would love to be able to tackle some of that, because I believe that the cinema experience that we all have gone through should be experienced by a new generation. I don’t think it should all be on a phone.” Elba added: “How do I do that? Building a model of data that shows that actually people do want to watch films, that they will enjoy the experience of theatre. I’m not going to try and boil the ocean, but it’s going to happen one bit at a time … Yeah man, I want to build the African Odeon.” Elba, who was born in London to a Sierra Leonean father and a Ghanaian mother, has spoken previously about his ambitions to support the film industry in sub-Saharan Africa,saying in October: “It’s really important that we own those stories of our tradition, of our culture, of our languages, of the differences between one language and another.” He is also part of a consortiumdeveloping an “eco city” on Sherbro Island in Sierra Leone. In London, Elba mentioned an AI-powered app called Talking Scripts that turns written material into audio, aiming to help people with reading difficulties such as dyslexia, as well as a digital wallet he had co-founded, called Akuna Wallet, designed to help creatives send money across borders more easily than before. He added: “Any film or piece of music that was made in the 80s was made on equipment less superior than your phone is now. These kids know that. They are making films, they are making songs on these devices. Ultimately, there is a wall when it comes to getting it out there and monetising it, [but] I think the confidence that Afrobeats,Nollywood, has given African creators, young creators, is huge.”",

    "title": "Venezuela says being in US is ‘great risk’ as countries respond to Trump travel ban",
    "article_text": "Venezuela has hit back over theTrump administration’s travel banby warning that the US is a dangerous place, while Somalia immediately vowed to work with Washington on security concerns. The mixed responses came after Donald Trump signed a ban targeting 12 countries also including Afghanistan, Iran andYemenin a revival of one of the most controversial measures from his first term. “Being in the United States is a great risk for anyone, not just for Venezuelans,” Diosdado Cabello, the interior minister in Caracas, said after the announcement, warning citizens against travel there and describing the US government as fascist. “They persecute our countrymen, our people, for no reason.” Dahir Hassan Abdi, the Somali ambassador to the US, said: “Somalia values its longstanding relationship with the United States and stands ready to engage in dialogue to address the concerns raised.” Calls early on Thursday to the spokesperson of Myanmar’s military government were not answered. The foreign ministry of Laos did not immediately respond to a request for comment, Reuters reported. There was no immediate response fromIran, but Jamal Abdi, the president of the National Iranian American Council, said: “The impact of the ban will once again be felt by Americans who were denied the ability to see their loved ones at weddings, funerals, or the birth of a child.” The move bans all travel to the US by nationals of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of the Congo,Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. Trump imposed a partial ban on travellers from seven countries: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. Some temporary work visas from these countries would be allowed, his administration said. The bans would come into effect on Monday 9 June, the White House said. The African Union said the ban would harm “people-to-people ties, educational exchange, commercial engagement and broader diplomatic relations” built with the US over decades. It appealed to Washington to adopt a “consultative approach and to engage in constructive dialogue with the countries concerned”. Trump said the bans were spurred by a makeshiftflame-thrower attack on a Jewish protest in Coloradothat US authorities blamed on a man they said was in the country illegally. Several countries on the list – Myanmar, Libya, Sudan and Yemen – face continuing civil strife and territory overseen by opposing factions. Sudanhas an active war, whileYemen’s waris largely stalemated and Libyan forces remain armed. For citizens of war-stricken countries such as Myanmar, which has been gripped by violence since a military coup in 2021, the announcement is yet another blow. It follows afreeze on refugee resettlementsannounced by Trump in January, andcuts to scholarship programmesthat provided rare opportunities for young people to go abroad and study in safety. A 21-year-old student from Myanmar, who asked not be named, said his plan to study computer science at a community college in New York was in tatters. “[My] visa appointment is 25 June – but then there was this breaking news in the morning … I felt upset. I couldn’t do anything. This was my only hope, to study in the United States.” Sign up toThe Long Wave Nesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the world after newsletter promotion He is now studying in Thailand but his visa will expire in October and he is unsure what he will do next, as it is not safe to return home. He had been studying medicine in Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city, but fled after he was told he would be forcibly conscripted to join the military. “I don’t want to go to the army. Going to the army would be like I’m already dead. My name is on their list so I [had to] sneak out of my country,” he said, adding that his family stayed in Myanmar. Young people have desperately sought ways to leave Myanmar after the widely loathed military junta announced last year it would impose mandatory conscription to boost its numbers. Aside from the fear of conscription, people are living with the constant threat of military airstrikes in many areas of the country, the aftermath ofa devastating earthquakethat struck in March and sky-high inflation. “Most of the people are jobless, most of the students are hopeless, we have no future. I think our generation is just for sacrifice,” the student said. The travel ban was yet more bad news for Myanmar refugees in neighbouring Thailand, some of whom had been close to moving to the US when Trump abruptly suspended refugee resettlements earlier this year, said Joe Freeman, Amnesty International’s Myanmar researcher. Since the 2021 military coup in Myanmar, 3.2 million people have been displaced within the country, while 176,400 have fled to neighbouring countries. “Some had already done their orientations for the US. They’ve already had their medical checkups. They’ve already gotten their flight tickets – and then just like [that] the hammer comes down,” Freeman said. The inclusion of Afghanistan angered some supporters who had worked to resettle its people. The ban makes exceptions for Afghans on special immigrant visas, generally people who worked most closely with the US government during the two-decade-long war there.Afghanistan was also one of the largest sources of resettled refugees, with about 14,000 arrivals in a 12-month period through September 2024. Trumpsuspended refugee resettlementon his first day in office.Shawn VanDiver, the president and board chair of #AfghanEvac, a nonprofit, said: “To include Afghanistan – a nation whose people stood alongside American service members for 20 years – is a moral disgrace. It spits in the face of our allies, our veterans, and every value we claim to uphold,.” International aid groups and refugee resettlement organisations roundly condemned the bans. “This policy is not about national security – it is about sowing division and vilifying communities that are seeking safety and opportunity in the United States,” said Abby Maxman, the president of Oxfam America.",

    "title": "Canada: premature baby with measles dies amid outbreak in Ontario",
    "article_text": "A Canadian infant who was born prematurely and had measles has died, officials said on Thursday without confirming a cause of death, raising heightened concern about the virus’s resurgence. Canada has recorded 2,755 measles cases – including 2,429 confirmed and 326 probable – according to federal health data updated on 2 June. The epicenter of the outbreak is the province of Ontario, where nearly 2,000 cases have been reported. Ontario’s chief medical officer of health, Kieran Moore, said in a statement “the infant contracted the virus before birth from their mother, who had not received the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine”. “While measles may have been a contributing factor in both the premature birth and death, the infant also faced other serious medical complications unrelated to the virus,” he added. In March, Moore said the outbreak was “disproportionately affecting some Mennonite, Amish, and other Anabaptist communities”, partly due to lower rates of vaccination among those populations. If measles is confirmed as the cause of the infant’s death, it would mark the first fatality linked to the current outbreak. After Ontario, the next hardest hit area is the western province of Alberta, with 632 confirmed cases, according to the federal data. Measles is a highly contagious respiratory virus spread through droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or simply breathes. Known for its characteristic rash, it poses a serious risk to unvaccinated individuals, including infants under 12 months who are not ordinarily eligible for vaccination, and those with weakened immune systems. It can lead to severe complications, including pneumonia, brain swelling, premature birth and in rare cases, death. Before widespread immunization programs were introduced in the early 1970s, hundreds died each year from the virus in Canada. It was considered eradicated in 1998, but cases continue to occur due to spread from other countries. The US is also confronting a significant measles resurgence, with a vaccine-skeptical Mennonite Christian community straddling the Texas-New Mexico border hit particularly hard. Donald Trump’s health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, has undermined confidence in the MMR vaccine – a highly effective shot he has falsely claimed is dangerous and contains fetal debris.",

    "article_text": "TheUS supreme courton Thursday spared two American gun companies from a lawsuit byMexico’s government accusing them of aiding illegal firearms trafficking to drug cartels and fueling gun violence on the south side of theUS-Mexico border. The justices, in a unanimous ruling, overturned a lower court’s decision that had allowed the lawsuit to proceed against the firearms maker Smith & Wesson and distributor Interstate Arms. The lower court had found thatMexicoplausibly alleged that the companies aided and abetted illegal gun sales, harming its government. The companies had argued for the dismissal of Mexico’s suit, filed in Boston in 2021, under a 2005 US law called the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act that broadly shields gun companies from liability for crimes committed with their products. The Boston-based first circuit court of appeals decided in 2024 that the alleged conduct by the companies fell outside these protections. “Mexico alleges that the companies aided and abetted unlawful sales routing guns to Mexican drug cartels. The question presented is whether Mexico’s complaint plausibly pleads that conduct. We conclude it does not,” the liberal justice Elena Kagan wrote for the supreme court on Thursday morning. The case came to the supreme court at a complicated time for US-Mexican relations as Donald Trump pursueson-again, off-again tariffson Mexican goods imported into the US. Trump has also accused Mexico of doing too little to stop the flow of synthetic drugs such as the opioid fentanyl and migrant arrivals at the border, even though Mexico has stepped up efforts to prevent migrants from reaching the border in recent years. Mexico had claimed that the companies have deliberately maintained a distribution system that included firearms dealers who knowingly sell weapons to third-party, or “straw”, purchasers who then traffic guns to cartels in Mexico. The suit also accused the companies of unlawfully designing and marketing their guns as military-grade weapons to drive up demand among the cartels. Mexico in the lawsuit sought monetary damages of an unspecified amount and a court order requiring Smith & Wesson and Interstate Arms to take steps to “abate and remedy the public nuisance they have created in Mexico”. Gun violence fueled by trafficked US-made firearms has contributed to a decline in business investment and economic activity in Mexico.",

    "title": "Butter madness: New Zealanders turn to churning as price of dairy staple soars",
    "article_text": "New Zealanders are driving cross-country for hours in pursuit of cheap butter while some are ordering it from Australia or even churning their own cream, as the country battles sky-high dairy prices. Despite dairy being the country’s largest export industry, recent figures from Stats NZ show domestic butter prices surged 65% in the year to March, pushing the average price for 500g to $7.42 (£3.30) – that’s up about $3 from this time last year. People have been queueing at Costco in Auckland to bulk buy its cheaper blocks, prompting the wholesaler tocap shoppers’ purchases to 30 blocksper shopper. Kaleb Halverson – who has earned the nicknames “Costco cowboy” and “butter bandit” – has started a side-hustle driving the 10-hour round trip from Taranaki to Auckland to stock up on cheap butter for his community. Halverson, who started a Facebook page offering to deliver Costco goods to his region, was inundated with requests for butter. “Demand was crazy – there were quite a few people wanting five to 10 packs each,” he toldnews outlet Stuff. ACanterbury schoolrecently used butter to fundraise, instead of the usual baked goods or chocolate. Leithfield School principal Rob Cavanagh told Stuff the response to the fundraiser had been “pretty overwhelming”, with 19,000 blocks sold. “I wasn’t quite aware of what a popular commodity butter is in this day and age.” Meanwhile, some people are using social media to teach others how to make their own butter, and bakeries across the country have reported making the tough choice to either increase their prices or face closure. Owner of Kayes Bakery based in Southland, Luella Penniall, said she was frustrated at having to import cheaper alternatives, despite living in a country that produces so much dairy produce. New Zealand is the world’s top dairy exporter, producing a third of the world’s dairy trade. The industry represents about $11.3bn or 3.2% of New Zealand’s GDP, and plays a significant role in regional economies. Penniall uses an Australian broker to find the best priced butter of the right quality, which often results in half her butter order being shipped from Australia. Kayes Bakery uses roughly three tonnes of butter every two months. The business is “surrounded by dairy farms” and Penniall would prefer to use New Zealand products but the cost can be prohibitive. “Farmers deserve everything they get, they work hard, but somewhere in between it seems to be getting out of control.” Global supply problems and high demand for New Zealand’s products are driving local prices higher, according to the chief executive of Infometrics, Brad Olsen. About 95% of New Zealand’s dairy products are exported, which means the international market determines domestic prices. It is “a double-edged sword”, where high prices are good for the country’s economy but tough for domestic shoppers, Olsen said. “I’m not saying that at the moment its the right happy balance, but given that commodity prices … are going to be dictated by the international market, that is sort of how the game is played.”",

    "title": "‘Total discrimination’: Chinese students facing US visa ban say their lives are in limbo",
    "article_text": "Chinese students in the United States are questioning their future in the country after the state department announced last week that it would “aggressively” revoke visas for Chinese students and enhance scrutiny of future applications fromChinaand Hong Kong. Chinese students hoping to study at Harvard, the US’s oldest and wealthiest university, are under particular pressure after the Trump administrationannounced on Wednesdaythat it was banning the school from enrolling new foreign students. The presidential proclamation cited Harvard’s links with China as a particular cause for concern. For Jerry*, a 22-year-old applied mathematics student at the University of California, Los Angeles, the uncertainty started last month, when the Trump administration suddenlyhalted Harvard University’s ability to enrol any international students. Jerry has a place on a health data science masters programme at Harvard, which is due to start in the autumn. The US government’s attempt to ban Harvard from accepting international students appears to have beenblocked, at least temporarily, by the courts. But Trump’s announcement on Wednesday invokes a different legal authority. Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, hasannounced that the authorities willbe targeting Chinese students specifically, nationwide. It is “total discrimination,” Jerry said. “I don’t think anyone would consider that reason sufficient. That’s just pushing Chinese students to go elsewhere”. Unsure about whether or not he will be able to enrol at Harvard, Jerry is considering taking up a place on a PhD programme at Oxford University in the UK. He said on Thursday that following Trump’s latest attack on Harvard, Oxford seems like an even more likely option. Although he hopes to study at Harvard, Jerry feels lucky to have a back-up plan. “A lot of the people who accepted Harvard offers don’t have other options. So it must be much more anxious for them”. Across the US, universities have been scrambling to find ways to reassure the hundreds of thousands of Chinese students on their campuses about their academic future. In a memo sent to Chinese students at University of Oregon, the school described the state department’s announcement about revoking the visas for Chinese students as “vague” and said: “A revoked passport does not impact your legal status in the US because it is only an entry document used when entering the US”. However, the university warned that a revoked visa could lead to removal proceedings by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE). Warning about being targeted by ICE have taken on a new gravity since the agency started targeting international students with the lawful right to remain in the country. They includeMahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and pro-Palestine activist who was detained despite holding a green card to reside in the US. Khalil is now fighting a deportation order. Steven*, a 34-year-old Chinese PhD student at the University of Oregon, said that although he is not planning to apply for a new student visa soon, the prospect of an encounter with ICE concerned him. “Nowadays, even if you have a green card, you have legitimate status, you could get caught by ICE, because these guys are crazy”. Steven has been in the US for a decade. In that time, the US has become a less attractive destination for Chinese students, he said, something he sees borne out in his part-time job helping Chinese students with their college applications. The numbers wanting to study in the US have declined, with people favouring countries in South-east Asia, such as Singapore, which are more culturally similar to China. The US is “just not that friendly” any more, Steven says. The loss of top Chinese students in the US would be a blow to academic research, and to the funding for higher education institutions, experts say. In the 2023-2024 academic year, there were about 277,400 Chinese students in the US, according to government statistics. That is a 25% drop compared to 2019-2020. “By barring Chinese students and scholars from America, theTrump administrationwill strangle the pipeline of high-end talent into our universities, companies, and research institutes, sparking a serious deficit in talent and expertise that will damage American competitiveness,” said Denis Simon, non-resident fellow at the Quincy Institute, who specialises in science and technology policy in China. The state department’s announcement last week specified that students with connections to the Chinese Communist party (CCP) or studying in “critical fields” would be included in the visa crackdown. For years, the US has tried to root out Chinese espionage in academia, with concerns raised about CCP-backed programmes to recruit top talent in science and technology fields that are strategically important to China. But academics and campaigners say that this has bled over into racism, with all Chinese researchers or those of Chinese heritage being treated with suspicion. Jerry, the mathematics student, said he has experienced discrimination in the US, but not on campus. But if Chinese researchers, staff and PhD students feel they have to leave the US because of an increasingly hostile environment, “it’s going to be a disaster for American universities,” he said. *Names have been changed Additional research by Lillian Yang",

    "title": "Second attempt by Japanese company to land on moon likely ends in failure",
    "article_text": "An attempt to land a commercially built spacecraft on the surface of the moon looked to have ended in failure on Thursday, two years after its predecessor, launched by the same Japanese company, crashed following an uncontrolled descent. Resilience, an un-crewed vehicle from the Tokyo companyispace, would have made history as the first non-US commercial lander to make a successful touchdown, scheduled for 3.17pm ET Thursday (4.17am JST Friday) at Mare Frigoris (the Sea of Cold) in the far north of the moon. But the company’s live stream covering the landing attempt ended almost 30 minutes later, with mission managers unable to establish communication with the craft, and its fate uncertain. “Mission control center members will continuously attempt to communicate with the lander,” an ispace commentator said immediately before the feed was pulled, promising an update at a press briefing “in a few hours”. It brought back memories of theApril 2023 failureof ispace’s Hakuto-R Mission 1, when communication with the spacecraft was lost around the scheduled time of landing. It was later established that a software error had led the lander to believe it had already touched down when it was still hurtling towards the lunar surface. Resiliencelaunched on 15 Januaryfrom Cape Canaveral, Florida, on the same SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket that carried the Blue Ghost lander manufactured by the Texas startup Firefly Aerospace.Blue Ghostfollowed a speedier trajectory to the moon and made its own pioneering landing on 2 March. The apparent demise of Hakuto-R Mission 2 would be a significant setback for ispace’s Venture Moon initiative that it said would be “laying the groundwork” for an extended human presence on the moon. Ambitious plansinclude a lunar citywith a thousand residents, the first arriving as early as 2040. It also hopes to eventually accommodate thousands more space tourists for shorter visits. “Our goal is to build the cislunar economy, one in which the moon and Earth are economically and socially connected,” ispace’s chief executive, Takeshi Hakamada, said in a prepared statement released before Thursday’s landing attempt. “We view the success of the lunar landing as merely a stepping stone toward that goal. We strongly believe that this endeavor and its long-term success will contribute to making life on Earth sustainable for all humanity.” Resilience was set to deploy a small, European-built moon rover named Tenacious for a two-week mission. High-definition video footage and telemetry would have been beamed back to Earth for monitoring by the EuropeanSpaceAgency (Esa) and partners. The rover has a shovel intended to collect soil samples for evaluation as the search for evidence of the presence of life-sustaining water or ice on the moon continues. Nasa, the US space agency, will pay ispace $5,000 under an agreementsigned in 2020for a chunk of regolith it can study in furtherance of its own plans to land humans back on the moon for the first time since 1972, and ultimately on Mars. “Tenacious is hopefully a very successful technological achievement, but beyond the technology it’s also a symbol of the future of lunar exploration,” Géraldine Naja, Esa’s director of commercialization, industry and competitiveness, told reporters earlier on Thursday. “Esa is extremely proud and thrilled to support ispace Mission 2. This is a very good example of how we can support new space actors in Europe [and] commercialization. We are eager to support, eventually, a sustainable European-Japanese presence on the moon.” The 11lb (5kg) rover was also carrying a more quirky payload: Moonhouse, a model installation created by Swedish artist Mikael Genberg, that would have become the first property on the moon, albeit in miniature form. The bright red Swedish-style house was to have provided a splash of color against the gray backdrop of the moon’s northern reaches. “It’s a small house in a vast, empty place, a symbol of belonging, curiosity and vulnerability,” Genberg toldspace.comin an interview published on Thursday. “I hope it invites people to reflect on our relationship to space, and to recognize the fragility and uniqueness of our own world.” While the governments of five countries – the US, Russia, China, India and Japan – have successfully landed un-crewed robotic lunar explorers, commercial efforts have seen more failures than successes in recent years. In addition to the previous ispace flop, two attempts by the Texas company Intuitive Machines (IM), with itsOdysseusandAthenalanders in February 2024 and March 2025 respectively, ended prematurely when both spacecraft toppled over on landing. Mare Frigoris is a flatter area of the moon, with fewer boulders than the landing sites chosen by IM and Firefly. Ispace also chose to take its time getting to the moon, with the five-month journey of Resilience during a so-called low-energy transfer allowing the company to thoroughly evaluate its systems and computer programs after blaming a software error for the 2023 crash landing. A contract with Nasa will see ispace attempting to send a larger rover to the moon on a mission scheduled for 2027.",

    "article_text": "Donald Trump said he had accepted an invitation to meet Xi Jinping in China after a phone conversation on trade was held between the leaders of the world’s two largest economies. In a post on Truth Social, the US president said the “very good” call lasted about 90 minutes and the conversation was “almost entirely focused on trade”. He wrote: “The call lasted approximately one and a half hours, and resulted in a very positive conclusion for both Countries. There should no longer be any questions respecting the complexity of Rare Earth products. Our respective teams will be meeting shortly at a location to be determined … During the conversation, President Xi graciously invited the First Lady and me to visitChina, and I reciprocated.” Trump added that teams from the US and China would meet soon at a location to be determined. The Chinese foreign ministry said Trump initiated the call, which was only the second time this year the two leaders had spoken one to one. They previously spoke in January, before Trump’s inauguration. The discussion followed posts on social media by Trump that praised the Chinese leader but also suggested it was difficult to reach a deal with him. Trade negotiations between the US and Chinastalledshortly after an agreement between the countries on 12 May to reduce 145% import tariffs on China imposed by Washington, and Beijing’s 125% tariffs on US imports in a tit-for-tat exchange. The agreement allowed for a reduction in tariffs during a 90-day moratorium before talks to resolve differences, especially over the export of Chinese rare earth metals, which are crucial to making electric cars and mobile phones. The US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, the commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, and the US trade representative, Jamieson Greer, will represent the US side in negotiations. Trump is under pressure to resolve the dispute with China after a series of weak economic figures that showed a sharp slowdown in US growth and a reluctance among private companies to hire staff. Large US businesses have also complained about the high cost of purchasing vital goods made in China. Sign up toBusiness Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion The Chinese government said in a statement published by the state-run Xinhua news agency: “Xi Jinping welcomed Trump’s visit to China again, and Trump expressed his sincere gratitude.” However, it added: “The US side should take a realistic view of the progress made and withdraw the negative measures imposed on China.” China’s decision in April to suspend exports of a wide range of critical minerals and magnets has disrupted supplies needed by carmakers, computer chip manufacturers and military contractors around the world. Trump has long pushed for a call or a meeting with Xi, but China has rejected the proposal as out of keeping with its traditional approach based on hammering out agreement details before the leaders talk.",

    "title": "Convention on human rights must adapt, says Council of Europe head",
    "article_text": "The European convention on human rights (ECHR) must adapt while continuing to uphold its core values, the head of a European rights council has said. Alain Berset, the secretary general of the Council of Europe (CoE), acknowledged growing criticism of the 75-year-old treaty, but said reform should be approached with care and rooted in shared democratic principles. In an interview with the Times, Berset, who took office earlier this year, said the legal framework underpinning the convention, which applies to 46 countries, including the UK, should not be treated as untouchable. “We are witnessing a world where things are changing rapidly,” he said. “It is accelerating. We see this, and it means that it is normal that we must also adapt to this. We need adaptation. We need discussion about the rules that we want to have, and there is no taboo.” He added: “I see the necessity to adapt but we must also do this respecting our core values.” There is growing political pressure in several European countries to overhaul the ECHR’s scope, particularly in response to migration. Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the Conservative party, is expected to take an even harder line in a speech on Friday. She will say that Britain should consider leaving the convention entirely, arguing that it impedes efforts to tackle migration. “I have thought long and hard about this, and I am increasingly of the view that we will need to leave, because I am yet to see a clear and coherent route to change within our current legal structures,” she will say. Human rights organisations have expressed alarm at recent rhetoric around reform, warning that undermining or withdrawing from the convention risks weakening protection for society’s most vulnerable groups, including refugees fleeing war and persecution. Many argue that the ECHR plays a vital role in holding states to account, especially in areas such as detention, pushbacks over border crossings and surveillance. Sign up toHeadlines Europe A digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week day after newsletter promotion But tensions around the ECHR have intensifiedafter a group of nine European countries, including Italy and Denmark, issued an open lettercalling for greater national control over migration policies. In the letter, dated 22 May, the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, and the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, joined the leaders of Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland in urging “open-minded conversation about the interpretation of the ECHR”. While reaffirming that the principles underpinning the convention were “universal and everlasting”, the letter continued: “We now live in a globalised world where people migrate across borders on a completely different scale.”",

    "title": "Trump scorns Merkel legacy during new German chancellor’s White House visit",
    "article_text": "Donald Trump has heaped criticism on the former German chancellor Angela Merkel for opening up her country to refugees, telling her successor: “I told her it shouldn’t have happened.” During an appearance with the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, on Thursday, Trump was asked about thesweeping travel restrictions on 19 countriesthat he announced the previous day. “We want to keep bad people out of our country … of course, you have a little problem too with some of the people that were allowed into your country,” Trump said to Merz, in an apparent reference to a number of attacks inGermanyinvolving refugees. Merz replied: “Yes we do,” before Trump continued: “It’s not your fault … It shouldn’t have happened. I told her it shouldn’t have happened, but it did. But you have your own difficulty with that, and we do.” He was referring to Merkel, but did not call her by name. The former chancellor visited the White House in 2017, during Trump’s first term of office, when she was given a grilling by Trump over her so-called open-door policy, which allowed around 1 million refugees – mainly from Syria and Iraq – into Germany. Merz’s highly anticipated visit had beenviewed with trepidation in Berlin, amid fears that the German leader may face another Oval Office ambush, such as those endured by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and the president of South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa. In the end, all the criticism was levied at Merkel, a former political rival of Merz. Trump also made a dig about Merkel’s enthusiasm for the building of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which brought gas from Russia toEurope. During the 35-minute press conference, Merz struggled to get a word in, though as German commentators noted, that was probably to the relief of his advisers, who feared there were a number of issues on which Trump might have pilloried him, from defence spending to immigration. When he did manage to speak, the former corporate lawyer mostly focused on Ukraine and the need to end the conflict, in particular by bringing the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to account. Merz also pushed back several times on Trump’s narrative that Ukraine and Russia were equally to blame for the war. “I’m here, Mr President, to talk to you later on how we could contribute to that goal [to end the war]. We are all looking for measures and for instruments to bring this terrible war to an end,” Merz said. He compared the US role in ending the conflict with the part US troops played in defeating the Nazi dictatorship. He noted that Friday will mark the 81st anniversary of D-day, in which tens of thousands of US troops joined allied troops in invading Normandy. The US, he said, was “again, in the very strong position to do something” about ending the war. Trump, he said, was the “key person in the world” who could stop the war “by putting pressure on Russia”. Trump praised Germany for having agreed to boost its defence spending to 5% of GDP, after years-long demands from Washington for it to do so. Asked by a German journalist whether Berlin was “doing enough on defence”, Trump said: “I know you’re spending more money on defence now. Quite a bit more money. That’s a positive.” But to some nervous laughter in the room, he quipped that he was “not sure if Gen MacArthur would have said it’s positive,” a reference to the supreme commander for the allied powers, among whose focuses was postwar demilitarisation. Merz prepared for the visit in part by talking to other leaders who have met Trump in recent months to gather tips about the best way to handle him. Merkel has said that she prepared for her first Trump visit – when he was less well-known as a politician – by reading a 1980s interview with him in Playboy and watching episodes of The Apprentice. Merz was put up for the night in the official government guest house, Blair House, which his advisers said was a signal that the two leaders – who refer to one other by their first names – were on a good footing. Merz presented Trump with a gold-framed birth certificate of his grandfather, Friedrich Trump, who emigrated from Germany in 1885, as well as a book titled News from the Land of Freedom – German Immigrants Write Home, which is a collection of letters written by German émigrés in the US to their families back in Germany. “It is a small present to remind him of his family,” Merz said. He has also invited Trump to Germany to visit his grandfather’shome village.",

    "title": "Israel hits south Beirut after targeting ‘underground Hezbollah drone sites’",
    "article_text": "Lebanon’s leaders accused Israel of a “flagrant” ceasefire violation by launching strikes againstHezbollahmilitants in southern Beirut on the eve of the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha. At least three Israeli airstrikes have hit Beirut’s southern suburbs, after the military said it would target what it described as underground Hezbollah drone factories. Plumes of smoke were seen billowing from the Lebanese capital, shortly after huge numbers of people had fled the area, clogging the roads with traffic. “The IDF (military) is currently striking terror targets of the Hezbollah aerial unit,” the Israeli military said in a statement on Telegram. In a statement, Lebanon’s president, Joseph Aoun, voiced “firm condemnation of the Israeli aggression” and “flagrant violation of an international accord … on the eve of a sacred religious festival”. The prime minister, Nawaf Salam, also issued a statement condemning the strikes, which came despite a27 November ceasefirethat sought to end more than a year of hostilities with the Iran-backed Hezbollah. Less than two hours earlier, its Arabic-language spokesperson, Avichay Adraee, had warned on social media that residents of the suburbs were “located near facilities belonging to the terrorist organisation Hezbollah” and should evacuate immediately. In a separate statement, the military had said it would “soon carry out a strike on underground UAV (drone) production infrastructure sites that were deliberately established in the heart of (the) civilian population” in Beirut. Israel and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah engaged in more than a year of hostilities that began with the outbreak of the Gaza war and culminated in an intense Israeli bombing campaign and ground incursion into southern Lebanon. The November ceasefire sought to end the fighting – which left Hezbollah severely weakened – butIsrael has continued to regularly carry out strikes in Lebanon’s south. Strikes targeting Beirut’s southern suburbs, considered a Hezbollah stronghold, have been rare, however. “Following Hezbollah’s extensive use of UAVs as a central component of its terrorist attacks on the state of Israel, the terrorist organisation is operating to increase production of UAVs for the next war,” the military statement said, calling the activities “a blatant violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon”. Under the truce, Hezbollah fighters were to withdraw north of the Litani river, about 18 miles (30km) from the border, and dismantle their military posts to the south. Israel was to pull all its troops from Lebanon, but it has kept them in five positions it deems “strategic” along the frontier. The Lebanese army has been deploying in the south and removing Hezbollah infrastructure there, with the prime minister saying on Thursday that it had dismantled “more than 500 military positions and arms depots” in the area.",

    "title": "Israel accused of arming Palestinian gang who allegedly looted aid in Gaza",
    "article_text": "Israel’s government has been accused of arming a Palestinian criminal gang whose members have allegedly looted humanitarian aid, in an apparent attempt to counter Hamas inGaza. Satellite images and videos verified by the Israeli newspaper Haaretz showed on Thursday thata new Palestinian militia has expanded its presence in southern Gaza, and is operating inside an area under the direct control of the Israel Defense Forces. The group, which has also been accused of ties to jihadist groups, is reportedly led by a man known as Yasser abu Shabab, a Rafah resident from a Bedouin family, known locally for his involvement in criminal activity and the looting of humanitarian aid. According to media reports, Abu Shabab’s group, which calls itself the “Anti-Terror Service”, consists of about 100 armed men who operate in eastern Rafah with the tacit approval of the Israeli armed forces. It has variously been described as a militia and a criminal gang. The Times of Israel cited defence sources who said that Israel provided members Abu Shabab’s faction with Kalashnikov assault rifles, including some weapons seized from Hamas. The operation was approved by Israel’s security cabinet and prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the newspaper reported, noting that its article had been approved for publication by Israel’s military censor. In a video posted on social media late on Thursday, Netanyahu said Israel had “activated” some Palestinian clans in Gaza, on the advice of “security officials,” in order to save lives of Israeli soldiers. The prime minister’s office had earlier said that “Israel is working to defeat Hamas in various ways, on the recommendation of all heads of the security establishment.” The former defence minister and opposition lawmaker Avigdor Lieberman repeated the allegations and alleged that Abu Shabab’s group was affiliated with the Islamic State terror group. “The Israeli government is giving weapons to a group of criminals and felons, identified with Islamic State, at the direction of the prime minister,” Lieberman, who heads the opposition Yisrael Beiteinu party, told Kan Bet public radio. “To my knowledge, this did not go through approval by the cabinet.” The basis for Lieberman’s allegation of ties to IS was not clear. Abu Shabab’s group has previously been accused of involvement in smuggling operations linked to Egyptian jihadi groups. A security official told Israeli news outlet Ynet that the arming of Abu Shabab was approved and led by the Shin Bet internal security service, and described the operation as “planned and managed”, with the goal of “reducing Israeli military casualties whilesystematically undermining Hamasthrough targeted strikes, infrastructure destruction and the promotion of rival local forces.” The IDF did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In recent weeks, Abu Shabab has published anti-Hamas and anti-Palestinian Authority messages while promoting his militia’s efforts on Facebook. Abu Shabab’s links with Israeli forces were confirmed by his family, which issued a statement last week formally disowning him. “We, like everyone else, were surprised by video footage broadcast by the resistance showing the involvement of Yasser’s groups within a dangerous security framework, reaching the point of operating within undercover units and supporting the Zionist occupation forces, who are brutally killing our people,” the statement said. “We affirm that we will not accept Yasser’s return to the family. We have no objection to those around him liquidating him immediately, and we tell you that his blood is forfeit.” Abu Shabab has reportedly claimed his group were protecting aid convoys, while Hamas has accused him of looting the aid trucks. On 28 May, Jonathan Whittall, the head of United Nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs in occupiedPalestinian territoriessaid: “Israel has publicly claimed that the UN and NGO aid is being diverted by Hamas. But this doesn’t hold up to scrutiny. The real theft of aid since the beginning of the war has been carried out by criminal gangs, under the watch of Israeli forces, and they were allowed to operate in proximity to the Kerem Shalom crossing point into Gaza.” When contacted by the Guardian, Whittall confirmed he was “referring to gangs such as Abu Shabab.” On Wednesday, a labour union representing truck drivers in Gaza said it was halting transport of aid deliveries within the strip after an incident in which several truckers were shot dead by gunmen. The Private Transport Association said it was calling the strike in response to an incident a day ago in which a convoy of trucks carrying humanitarian aid was attacked by gunmen in the central Gaza. “This crime is not the first of its kind, but it is by far the most serious in a series of recurring assaults aimed at obstructing relief operations and preventing vital aid from reaching hundreds of thousands of civilians facing dire humanitarian conditions,” the statement said. Jihad Sleem, vice-president of the Special Transportation Association, who lost his relative, Mohammed al-Assar, in the attack, said he did not know who the gunmen were. Asked if he suspected Abu Shabab was behind the killings, he said: “It wouldn’t surprise me if he was involved in these attacks. He’s a gangster.” Jamal Risheq contributed to this report",

    "title": "IDF recovers bodies of two Israeli-American hostages from 7 October attack",
    "article_text": "Israel has recovered the bodies of two Israeli-American hostages who were killed and abducted in Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attack. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said the remains of Judih Weinstein, 70, and Gad Haggai, 72, both of whom had Israeli and US citizenship, were returned toIsraelby the army and the Shin Bet internal security agency after an overnight operation in southern Gaza. Their deaths had been announced in December 2023. “My beautiful parents have been freed. We have certainty,” their daughter, Iris Haggai Liniado, wrote in a Facebook post. She thanked the Israeli military, the FBI and the Israeli and US governments and called for the release of all the remaining hostages. InGaza, food distribution points run by a US-backed group had meanwhile remained closed on Thursday morning after their closure on Wednesday after the killings by Israeli troops of dozens of civilians waiting for food. The US- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) had said its sites were undergoing maintenance and repair work. It said later on Thursday afternoon it had resumed food distribution at two separate sites and said a total of 1.4 million meals have been delivered. Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli strikes on Thursday killed at least 10 people in the Palestinian territory. The Israeli military said in a statement on Thursday that Weinstein and Haggai were murdered by gunmen from the Mujahideen Brigades, a small Palestinian group, when they attacked Kibbutz Nir Oz on 7 October 2023. In a statement, the forum of the Israeli hostage families said: “The return of Judi and Gad is painful and heartbreaking, yet it also brings healing to our uncertainty. Their return reminds us all that it is the state’s duty to bring everyone home, so that we, the families, together with all the people of Israel, can begin the process of healing and recovery.’’ The forum stressed that decision-makers ‘‘must do everything necessary to reach an agreement that will return all 56 remaining hostages – the living for rehabilitation and the deceased for burial. There is no need to wait another 608 agonising days for this. The mission can be completed as early as tomorrow morning. This is what the majority of the Israeli people want.’’ At least 20 of the 56 remaining hostages are believed to be alive, according to Israel. Most of the hostages were released as part of deals with Hamas during two temporary ceasefires in late 2023 and early 2025. Since the 7 October attacks, Israel has responded with an air and ground assault on Gaza that has killed more than 54,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health authorities, and reduced much of the territory to ruins as food supplies have also been blocked. On Wednesday, GHF announced that its operations would be suspended into the morning on Thursday in order to improve civilian safety beyond the perimeter of its distribution sites after Israeli troops opened fire on a crowd of Palestinians,killing at least 27and injuring hundreds. GHF pressed Israel to improve civilian safety beyond the perimeter of its distribution sites. Israelimposed a blockade on all suppliesin March, claiming Hamas was seizing deliveries for its fighters. The group denies this and aid officials in Gaza havedenied there is evidenceof any widespread diversion of supplies at any stage of the conflict. In May a global hunger monitor said half a million people in Gaza faced starvation in the months ahead.",

Israeli president Isaac Herzog described the return of the bodies of Judih Weinstein Haggai and Gad Haggai as “a moment of deep pain, but also one of solace and the resolution of uncertainty”.“We will continue to do everything in our power to bring our sisters and brothers back from hell,” he said in a post on X. Iran on Thursday “strongly” condemned theUnited States for vetoing a United Nations security council resolutionthat called for an immediate ceasefire and full humanitarian access in Gaza.Foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baqaei said in a statement that the US move to block the resolution, which was supported by 14 of the 15 members of the council, demonstrated “the country’s complicity in the crimes of the Zionist regime (Israel) and strongly condemned it”. German foreign minister Johann Wadephul criticised Israel’s actions in the Gaza Strip at a press conference with his Israeli counterpart Gideon Saar in Berlin on Thursday, again calling for more humanitarian aid to be allowed into the territory.Wadephul decried the Israeli government’s announcement that it would allow 22 more settlements in the West Bank. Wadephul also said that recognising a Palestinian state now would send “the wrong signal” because “negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians must be concluded” first. Aid needs to reach the people of Gaza “at speed and at volume”, UK prime minister Keir Starmer said as he restated his view the current situation was“utterly intolerable”.He told reporters on Thursday: “Of course, humanitarian aid needs to get in at speed and at volume, but that can only happen if we get back to a ceasefire”. More than 2,700 children under the age of five in Gaza were diagnosed with acute malnutrition in the second half of May, “reflecting a sharp deterioration”, reports the Office of the UN high commissioner for human rights (OHCHR). This latest figure is almost triple the proportion of children diagnosed with malnutrition out of those screened in February 2025 during the ceasefire, OHCHR reported. Three journalists have been killed and a fourth critically injured a fourth in an Israeli attack on Al-Ahli hospital, also known as the Baptist hospital, in Gaza City, Al Jazeera reported. Israel claimed it was targeting an Islamic Jihad militant operating in the courtyard of the Al-Ahli hospital. Gaza’s health ministry has not yet identified the journalists or said which outlets they worked for. Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli strikes killed at least 10 people in Gazaon Thursday as the military keeps up an intensified offensive. “Ten martyrs so far resulting from Israeli strikes since dawn,” agency spokesperson Mahmud Bassal told Agence France-Presse (AFP), adding that they had targeted an area where displaced civilians were sheltering in the southern city of Khan Younis and houses in Gaza City and the central town of Deir el-Balah. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to an AFP request for comment. Brazil’s president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva on Thursday during a trip to Paris accused Israel of carrying out “premeditated genocide”in Gaza. “It’s a premeditated genocide from a far-right government that is waging a war against the interests of its own people,” he said at a joint press conference with France’s president Emmanuel Macron. While Lula has previously used the term “genocide”, Macron has refused to. Donald Trump has signed a sweeping orderbanning travel from 12 countries and restricting travel from seven others, reviving and expanding the travel bans from his first term.Iran, Afghanistan and Yemen are among the 12 countries from which Trump has banned nationals travelling into the US from. UN relief agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, on Thursday highlighted the lack of hygiene supplies for women and girls menstruating in the Gaza Strip.In a post on X on Thursday, the UN agency wrote: “There are around 700,000 women and girls of menstruating age from the Gaza Strip. Since the State of Israel imposed a siege on Gaza on 2 March, there has been a complete depletion of hygiene supplies, including sanitary pads.” The playwrightCaryl Churchill has pulled out of a project at London’s Donmar Warehouse, citing the organisation’s sponsorship by Barclays and the bank’s links to Israel.In a statement, Churchill, alongtime supporter of Palestinian rights, said that the London theatre should drop its association with the bank, which has been criticised for providing financial services to defence companies supplying Israel. Ms Rachel, the children’s entertainer and educator whoseYouTubevideos have been watched by millions of families around the world, saidshe is willing to risk her career to keep advocating for suffering children in Gaza.In an interviewwith WBUR, a Boston-based public radio station, Ms Rachel, whose full name is Rachel Griffin Accurso, said she had received pushback for speaking out to raise awareness of the situation in Gaza, where more than 54,000 people have been killed in Israel’s ongoing military assault. But Accurso said she would continue to advocate for children’s safety. Russian president Vladimir Putin is ready to “help resolve” the standoff between Iran and the United States over Tehran’s nuclear programme, the Kremlin said on Thursday. “We have a close partnership with Tehran. And President Putin said that he was ready to use this partnership to help resolve the Iranian nuclear issue,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Visiting EU commissioner for the Mediterranean Dubravka Šuica said on Thursday that a €175m package for Syria was a “clear message” of support for its reconstruction. Šuica announced the package in Damascus on Wednesday, saying it would focus on sectors including energy, education, health and agriculture, helping rebuild Syria’s economy, support its institutions and promote human rights. Iranon Thursday “strongly” condemned theUnited Statesfor vetoing aUnited Nations security councilresolution that called for an immediate ceasefire and full humanitarian access inGaza.

More details soon … The playwrightCaryl Churchillhas pulled out of a project at London’sDonmar Warehouse, citing the organisation’s sponsorship byBarclaysand the bank’s links toIsrael. In a statement, Churchill, alongtime supporter ofPalestinianrights, said that theLondontheatre should drop its association with the bank, which has been criticised for providing financial services to defence companies supplying Israel. She said: Theatres used to say they couldn’t manage without tobacco sponsorship, but they do. Now it’s time they stopped helping advertise banks that support whatIsraelis doing to Palestinians. More than 300 arts workers and creatives, including the actorsAlfred Enoch,Samuel West,Tim Crouch,Harriet WalterandJuliet Stevensonhave signed an open letter supporting Churchill’s decision. The project Churchill was working on had not been announced but would have been the first time she had worked with the Donmar since 2020’sFar Away. Barclays sponsorship has led to controversy at aUKarts organisation before. There has been no immediate response fromIranonDonald Trump’stravel ban. Iran is one of 12 countries that will be “fully” restricted from entering theUS. My colleagues,Rebecca RatcliffeandHelen Livingstone,have this reaction fromJamal Abdi, the president of theNational Iranian American Council: The impact of the ban will once again be felt by Americans who were denied the ability to see their loved ones at weddings, funerals, or the birth of a child. The move bans all travel to the US by nationals ofAfghanistan,Myanmar,Chad,Republic of the Congo,Equatorial Guinea,Eritrea,Haiti, Iran,Libya,Somalia,SudanandYemen.

According to Reuters, Wadephul also decried the Israeli government’s announcement that it would allow 22 more settlements in theWest Bank. Germany would continue to deliver weapons to Israel, he added, saying the country needed to defend itself. Wadephulalso said on Thursday that recognising aPalestinian statenow would send “the wrong signal”, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). He said that “negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians must be concluded” before the recognition of a Palestinian state. More than 2,700 children under the age of five inGazawere diagnosed with acute malnutrition in the second half of May, “reflecting a sharp deterioration”, reports theOffice of the UN high commissioner for human rights (OHCHR). In its latestGaza humanitarian situation update, theUNagency, said that of 46,738 children under the age of five who were screened for malnutrition in the second half of May, 5.8% were diagnosed with acute malnutrition, up from 4.7% in the first half of May. This latest figure is almost triple the proportion of children diagnosed with malnutrition out of those screened in February 2025 during the ceasefire, OHCHR reported. The humanitarian agency also warned that there are now only four stabilisation centres for the treatment of severe acute malnutrition cases with medical complications in theGaza Strip, including two inDeir al-Balah, one inKhan Younis, and one inGaza City. “Stabilisation centres in north Gaza and Rafah have been forced to suspend operations, leaving children in these areas without access to lifesaving treatment,” it added. Brazil’s presidentLuiz Inácio Lula da Silvaon Thursday during a trip toParisaccusedIsraelof carrying out “premeditated genocide” in thePalestinianterritory ofGaza. “It’s a premeditated genocide from a far-right government that is waging a war against the interests of its own people,” he said at a joint press conference withFrance’s presidentEmmanuel Macron, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). While Lula has previously used the term “genocide”, Macron has refused to, saying last month it was not for a “political leader to use to term but up to historians to do so when the time comes”. Aid needs to reach the people ofGaza“at speed and at volume”,Keir Starmersaid as he restated his view the current situation was “utterly intolerable”, reports the PA news agency. He told reporters: In relation to what’s happening in Gaza, we’ve been absolutely clear that it is intolerable and we need to get back to a ceasefire urgently and that is our constant work with other allies to get us to that position. We need those hostages to come out, many of them have been held for a very long time. And of course, humanitarian aid needs to get in at speed and at volume, but that can only happen if we get back to a ceasefire so I’m absolutely clear that the situation as it is is utterly intolerable, and that’s why we’ve taken measures like the trading talks have been stood down, the sanctions we’ve put in and we’re working with allies to see what else we can do. Israelhas claimed it was targeting an Islamic Jihad militant operating in the courtyard of theAl-Ahli Hospitalin an attack in which three local reporters were killed and six people were wounded (see earlier post). Gaza’s Health Ministry has not yet identified the journalists or said which outlets they worked for.Over 180 journalists and media workers have been killed since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, the vast majority of them in Gaza, according to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists. Israel has said many of those killed in its strikes were militants posing as reporters. The US-backedGaza Humanitarian Foundationhas said it will open two supply distribution centres intended to provide aid on Thursday, Reuters is reporting.The group closed its facilities after theIsraeliarmy warned that roads leading to distribution centres were “considered combat zones” and was due to reopen them this morning, but pushed the time back for what it said were maintenance and repair work.

The UN has warned that most of Gaza’s 2.3 million population is at risk of famine after an 11-week Israeli blockade of the enclave. Three journalists have been killed and a fourth critically wounded a fourth in an Israeli attack onAl-Ahli Hospital, also known as the Baptist Hospital, inGaza City, Al Jazeera has reported. “The attack was aimed directly at the hospital and resulted in multiple casualties,” the hospital director said. “This is the eighth attack of its kind targeting the facility since the start of the war, and this is a heavy burden on the residents since many hospitals in theGazaStrip have been ceased their operation.” Coverage of the war in Gaza is constrained by Israeli attacks on Palestinian journalists and a bar on international reporters entering the Gaza Strip to report independently on the war. Israel has not allowed foreign reporters to enter Gaza since 7 October 2023, unless they are under Israeli military escort. Reporters who join these trips have no control over where they go, and otherrestrictionsinclude a bar on speaking to Palestinians in Gaza. Palestinian journalists and media workers inside Gaza have paid a heavy price for their work reporting on the war, with over180 killedsince the conflict began. The committee to protect journalists has determined that at least 19 of them “were directly targeted by Israeli forces in killings which CPJ classifies as murders”. Foreign reporters based in Israel filed alegal petitionseeking access to Gaza, but it was rejected by the supreme court on security grounds. Private lobbying by diplomats and public appeals byprominent journalistsandmedia outletshave been ignored by the Israeli government. To ensure accurate reporting from Gaza given these restrictions, the Guardian works with trusted journalists on the ground; our visual​​ teams verif​y photo and videos from third parties; and we use clearly sourced data from organisations that have a track record of providing accurate information in Gaza during past conflicts, or during other conflicts or humanitarian crises. Emma Graham-Harrison, chief Middle East correspondent UN relief agency for Palestinian refugees,Unrwa, has highlighted the lack of hygiene supplies for women and girls menstruating in theGaza Strip. In a post on X on Thursday, the UN agency wrote: ‘Every time my period comes, I wish I weren’t a girl,’ says an adolescent in Gaza. There are around 700,000 women and girls of menstruating age from the Gaza Strip. Since the State of Israel imposed a siege on Gaza on 2 March, there has been a complete depletion of hygiene supplies, including sanitary pads. Almost 90% of water and sanitation infrastructure in Gaza has been either destroyed or partially damaged, theUnited Nations Population Fundreported. A joint statement from theIsraeliarmy and theShin Betinternal security agency said the bodies of Israeli-American hostages,Judih Weinstein HaggaiandGad Haggai(see 8.33am BST), were recovered from theKhan Younisarea of the southernGaza Stripin an overnight operation. “The rescue operation was conducted by … troops in coordination with the intelligence directorate and special forces,” it added, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). An Israeli military official said the couple were killed on the morning of 7 October by fighters of theMujahideen Brigades, an armed group close toHamasallyIslamic Jihad. Coverage of the war in Gaza is constrained by Israeli attacks on Palestinian journalists and a bar on international reporters entering the Gaza Strip to report independently on the war. Israel has not allowed foreign reporters to enter Gaza since 7 October 2023, unless they are under Israeli military escort. Reporters who join these trips have no control over where they go, and otherrestrictionsinclude a bar on speaking to Palestinians in Gaza.Palestinian journalists and media workers inside Gaza have paid a heavy price for their work reporting on the war, with over180 killedsince the conflict began. The committee to protect journalists has determined that at least 19 of them “were directly targeted by Israeli forces in killings which CPJ classifies as murders”. Foreign reporters based in Israel filed alegal petitionseeking access to Gaza, but it was rejected by the supreme court on security grounds. Private lobbying by diplomats and public appeals byprominent journalistsandmedia outletshave been ignored by the Israeli government. To ensure accurate reporting from Gaza given these restrictions, the Guardian works with trusted journalists on the ground; our visual​​ teams verif​y photo and videos from third parties; and we use clearly sourced data from organisations that have a track record of providing accurate information in Gaza during past conflicts, or during other conflicts or humanitarian crises. IsraelipresidentIsaac Herzoghas described the return of the bodies of two Israeli-Americans,Judih Weinstein HaggaiandGad Haggai(see 8.33am BST),as “a moment of deep pain, but also one of solace and the resolution of uncertainty”. “We will continue to do everything in our power to bring our sisters and brothers back from hell,” he said in a post on X. Ms Rachel, the children’s entertainer and educator whoseYouTubevideos have been watched by millions of families around the world, said she is willing to risk her career to keep advocating for sufferingchildreninGaza. In an interviewwith WBUR, aBoston-based public radio station, Ms Rachel, whose full name isRachel Griffin Accurso, said she had received pushback for speaking out to raise awareness of the situation in Gaza, where more than 54,000 people have been killed inIsrael’s ongoing military assault. But Accurso said she would continue to advocate for children’s safety. “I wouldn’t be Ms Rachel if I didn’t deeply care about all kids. And I would risk everything, and I will risk my career over and over to stand up for them. It’s all about the kids for me,” Accurso told WBUR. TheUNhas describedGazaas “the hungriest place on Earth”, and warned that thePalestinianterritory’s entire population is at risk of famine. Accurso said she had recently met with Palestinian women whose children were suffering in Gaza. “When you sit with a mother who’s FaceTiming her boys inGazawho don’t have food, and you see that anguish and you are there with her, it really moves you – I’m sorry to get emotional – to do everything you can for her,” she said. “And of course, you say: ‘I need to do more. What can I do to help?’ I do have a big platform, and I look at it as a responsibility.” In April, a pro-Israel group urged theUS attorney generalto investigate Accursoover her messaging about children suffering in Gaza, and Accurso hasbeen criticisedby rightwing media and commentators. Asked about the criticism, Accurso said: It’s really painful. And I have to remind myself that people don’t know my heart, and people try to tell you who you are, but you know who you are. And I know how deeply and equally I care for all children, and I do lean on my faith in that situation.",

    "title": "Judge threatens to remove Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs from court for nodding at jury",
    "article_text": "The judge in the federal sex-trafficking and racketeering conspiracy trial ofSean “Diddy” Combsthreatened to remove the music mogul from court for looking and nodding at the jury during testimony on Thursday. The court also heard from a woman, under the pseudonym “Jane” and who previously dated Combs, as she began testifying about their relationship and the drug-fueled sexual marathons that she said Combs orchestrated. During a lunch break after the jury left the room on Thursday, Judge Arun Subramanian said that he saw Combs looking at the jury and “nodding vigorously” during the cross-examination of Bryana Bongolan, a former graphic designer for Combs and a longtime friend of Combs’s former girlfriend Casandra “Cassie” Ventura. The judge warned Combs’s lawyers that if he saw it again, it “could result in the exclusion of your client from the courtroom”. “There should be no efforts whatsoever to have an interaction with this jury,” the judge added. Combs’s lawyer said that it would not happen again. Earlier on Thursday, Bongolan resumed the testimony she began on Wednesday. Bongolan previouslytestified about her friendship with Ventura and described an alleged incident from 2016 in which she says that Combs dangled herfrom the balcony of Ventura’s 17th-floor apartment in Los Angeles for 10 to 15 seconds, before throwing her on to some balcony furniture. She testified that the incident left her bruised and emotionally scarred and that she experiences nightmares and paranoia. During cross-examination, Combs’s lawyerschallengedBongolan’s credibility, citing inconsistencies between her current testimony and prior statements she gave regarding the alleged balcony incident. On Thursday morning, Combs’s lawyers pressed her on the timeline. They claimed that the alleged balcony incident could not have occurred when she said because Combs was performing on the east coast for much of September 2016. Before concluding the cross-examination, Combs’s lawyer suggested that Bongolan was lying about the balcony incident and the injuries. “I can’t agree with you,” Bongolan responded, adding that she could not recall the exact date of the alleged incident, but she “will never forget him holding me on that balcony”. Another former girlfriend of Combs’s, who alleges she was abused and made to participate in drug-fueled sex sessions known as “freak-offs”, began testifying on Thursday afternoon. Testifying under the pseudonym “Jane”, the woman has been described by prosecutors as a single mother who first met Combs in 2020. Jane testified on Thursday that she met Combs in 2020 during a girls’ trip with a friend who was dating him at the time. Jane recalled finding Combs “really charming” and said they exchanged numbers. They began dating in early 2021, she said, and were still dating at the time of his arrest last September. Jane said that she fell “pretty head over heels” for Combs after their first date in early 2021, and that several months later, Combs began introducing her to his sexual fantasies and the idea of her having sex with other men. One night in May 2021, she said she agreed because she wanted to make him happy. Within hours, she said she was in a hotel room watching his assistants prepare the room for a so-called freak-off. Soon after, she said a man from an escort service arrived, and she said she had sex with him while Combs watched and masturbated. Jane testified that the May 2021 encounter opened a “Pandora’s box” in their relationship, adding that “it was a door that I was unable to shut for the remainder of the relationship.” Jane told the court that she only wanted to have sex with Combs, not other men, and that she repeatedly told Combs this during their relationship but that he would be dismissive. Jane said that she felt “obligated” to comply since Combs controlled aspects of her life, including paying her rent. The court was then adjourned for the day and Jane is expected to return to the stand to continue her testimony on Friday morning. Prosecutors have said that Jane’stestimony is similar to that of Ventura, Combs’s former longtime girlfriend, who testified duringthe first week of the trial. Ventura, who dated Combs on and off from 2007 to 2018, told jurors last month that she was subjected to years ofphysical and emotional abuseduring the relationship. She alleged shewas coerced, through violence andblackmail, into taking part in the so-called freak-offs which she said were orchestrated and directed by Combs and involved drugs and male sex workers. During cross-examination, Combs’s attorneys sought to portray Ventura as a willing participant in the freak-offs, framing the encounters as part of a“swingers lifestyle”. Now in its fourth week, the trial has featured graphic and emotional testimony from several witnesses. To date,more than 16 witnesses have testified, including thesinger Dawn Richard,three of Combs’s formerassistants,Ventura’s motherandrapper Scott Mescudi, also knownas Kid Cudi. Combs, 55, wasarrested in September 2024and faces federal charges of sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy and transportation to engage in prostitution. He has pleaded not guilty to all counts. Prosecutorsallegethat Combs ran a criminal enterprise since at least 2004 that engaged in or attempted to engage in crimes including sex trafficking, kidnapping, forced labor, arson, bribery, enticement to engage in prostitution and obstruction of justice, with the help of his associates and employees. While Combs’s lawyers have acknowledged his history of domestic violence, they argue that the women participated in the freak-offs consensually and they maintain that Combs isnot guilty of sex trafficking or racketeering, or of operating a criminal enterprise. Prosecutors have said that they may rest their case next week, with the defense expected to begin calling its own witnesses soon after. However, Combs’s lawyershave signaledthat their presentation may take longer than anticipated, potentially extending the trial into early July. If convicted on all counts, Combs could face life in prison. The Associated Press contributed reporting In the US, thedomestic violence hotlineis 1-800-799-SAFE (7233).

    "title": "Rubio imposes sanctions on four ICC judges for ‘targeting’ US and Israel",
    "article_text": "The United States is placing sanctions on four judges from the international criminal court (ICC) for what it has called its “illegitimate actions” targeting the United States and Israel. The secretary of state, Marco Rubio, announced the sanctions in a statement on Thursday. They target Solomy Balungi Bossa of Uganda, Luz del Carmen Ibáñez Carranza of Peru, Reine Adelaide Sophie Alapini-Gansou of Benin and Beti Hohler of Slovenia. Donald Trump ordered cabinet officials todraw up sanctions against the ICCafter the court issuedarrest warrants for the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and former defense minister Yoav Gallant. They were accused of overseeing an Israeli offensive during the Gaza conflict that caused famine and included the commission of war crimes. Two of the sanctioned judges authorised the arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, and two authorised an ICC investigation into abuses by US personnel in Afghanistan. “As ICC judges, these four individuals have actively engaged in the ICC’s illegitimate and baseless actions targeting America or our close ally, Israel,” Rubio said. “The ICC is politicized and falsely claims unfettered discretion to investigate, charge, and prosecute nationals of the United States and our allies. This dangerous assertion and abuse of power infringes upon the sovereignty and national security of the United States and our allies, including Israel.” The decision to move forward with the sanctions will escalate Trump’s feud with the court and other international organisations, which he has broadly dismissed as politicised. The US has already sanctioned the ICC’s chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, because of his role in pursuing the arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant. Those sanctions have led Khan to lose access to his email and his bank accounts have been frozen, the Associated Press reported earlier this month. Americans who work for The Hague-based court have been warned that they could be arrested if they set foot on American soil. In a statement, the ICC said it “deplores” the new designations for sanctions. “These measures are a clear attempt to undermine the independence of an international judicial institution which operates under the mandate from 125 states parties from all corners of the globe,” the ICC said. “Targeting those working for accountability does nothing to help civilians trapped in conflict,” the statement continued. “It only emboldens those who believe they can act with impunity. These sanctions are not only directed at designated individuals, they also target all those who support the court, including nationals and corporate entities of states parties. They are aimed against innocent victims in all situations before the court, as well as the rule of law, peace, security and the prevention of the gravest crimes that shock the conscience of humanity.” Danya Chaikel, the International Federation for Human Rights’s representative to the ICC, said the types of sanctions imposed by theTrump administrationwere originally designed to “disrupt terrorist networks like ISIS, weapons traffickers, and human rights abusers, not international justice institutions.” “Using them against ICC officials represents a dangerous misuse of executive power and distorts their purpose … It sends the chilling message that enforcing accountability for mass atrocities can get you punished, while allegedly committing international crimes may get you protected. James Goldston, executive director of the Open Society’s justice initiative and a former ICC prosecutor, said: “As a court of last resort, the ICC is the one place victims of the most serious crimes can turn to when other avenues have failed them in their search for truth and justice. These new designations of ICC judges threaten their hopes and embolden the perpetrators. Sanctions against ICC officials are a betrayal of America’s proud commitment to the rule of law and international justice.”",

    "title": "Tesla share plunge amid Trump feud wipes $152bn off Elon Musk’s company",
    "article_text": "Tesla’s shares dropped by about 14.2%on Thursday at market close, wiping roughly $152bn off the value of the company as a feud between Elon Musk and Donald Trump erupted into public view. Theformer political alliestraded threats and insults through posts on their respective social media platforms throughout the afternoon as the company’s price fell. Trump suggested on Truth Social that he could cut Musk’s government subsidies and contracts, of which bothTeslaand SpaceX have been immense beneficiaries. Musk meanwhile threatened to decommission the SpaceX spacecraft that Nasa relies on for transport missions, called for Trump’s impeachment, derided the president’s signature tariffs and accused him of being affiliated with the notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Musk said late Thursday evening his company will not decommission its spacecraft. The decline in Tesla’s share price on Thursday knocked about $8.73bn off Musk’s total net worth,according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The reported $152bndropalso decreased the value of the company to roughly $900bn. Tesla has struggled throughout the year amid declining sales and buyers around the world rejecting the automaker due to Musk’s association with far-right politics. Stock traders who had shorted Tesla shares made billions amid the spat, perthe Wall Street Journal. The blow-up is an unexpected and dramatic escalation of a growing rift between two of the world’s most powerful men. Musk had donated about $275m to Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign and served as the leader of the cost-cutting “department of government efficiency” (Doge) for months at the president’s beck and call. It also puts increased investor scrutiny on how the clash could affect Musk’s business empire, with his companies such as Tesla facing potential retribution in the form of canceled government deals or increased regulatory oversight. The rift began after Musk recentlyopposed the administration’s new taxbill that eliminates electric vehicle tax credits and would add an expected $2.3tn to the deficit, in effect nullifying the limited “savings” Doge claimed to find. Musk was also reportedly upset about being increasingly iced out of the Trump administration and having the nomination of his preferred candidate to lead Nasa pulled.

    "title": "Trump administration sanctions International Criminal Court judges",
    "article_text": "The administration of President Donald Trump has followed through with a threat to sanction officials on theInternational Criminal Court (ICC), naming four judges whom it accuses of taking “illegitimate and baseless actions” against the United States and its allies. On Thursday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the sanctions in a sharply worded writtenstatement. “The ICC is politicized and falsely claims unfettered discretion to investigate, charge, and prosecute nationals of the United States and our allies,” Rubio wrote. “This dangerous assertion and abuse of power infringes upon the sovereignty and national security of the United States and our allies, including Israel.” The four sanctioned judges include Solomy Balungi Bossa of Uganda, Luz del Carmen Ibanez Carranza of Peru, Reine Adelaide Sophie Alapini Gansou of Benin and Beti Hohler of Slovenia. As a result of the sanctions, the judges will see their US-based property and assets blocked. US-based entities are also forbidden from engaging in transactions with them, including through the “provision of funds, goods or services”. The ICC quickly issued a statement in response, saying it stood behind its judges and “deplores” the Trump administration’s decision. “These measures are a clear attempt to undermine the independence of an international judicial institution which operates under the mandate from 125 States Parties from all corners of the globe,” thestatementsaid. “Targeting those working for accountability does nothing to help civilians trapped in conflict. It only emboldens those who believe they can act with impunity.” In afact sheet, the State Department explained that Bossa and Ibanez Carranza were sanctioned forauthorising an investigationinto US troops in Afghanistan in 2020, during Trump’s first term as president. Previously, the ICC had blocked a request to probe alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Afghanistan, where the US had been leading a slow-grinding war from 2001 to 2021. But it reversed course the following year, granting a prosecutor’s request to investigate US forces and members of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for war crimes in “secret detention facilities” in Afghanistan and elsewhere. Afghanistan, the court noted, was a member of the Rome Statute, which includes the 125 countries where the ICC has jurisdiction. But the Trump administration at the time blasted the court’s decision, calling the ICC a “political institution masquerading as a legal body”. It has long argued that the US, which is not party to the Rome Statute, lies outside the ICC’s jurisdiction. Another country that is not a member of the Rome Statute is Israel, which has used similar arguments to reject the ICC’s power over its actions in Palestine. The second pair of judges named in Thursday’s sanctions — Alapini Gansou and Hohler — were sanctioned for their actions against Israeli leaders, according to the US State Department. The US is Israel’s oldest ally, having been the first to recognise the country in 1948. It has since offered Israel strong support, including for its ongoing war in Gaza, which has killed an estimated 54,607 Palestinians so far. Experts at the United Nations and human rights organisations have compared Israel’s military campaign in Gaza to a genocide, as reports continue to emerge of alleged human rights abuses. In November 2024, those accusations spurred the ICC toissue arrest warrantsfor Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, who have both been accused of war crimes in Gaza, including intentional attacks on civilians. Alapini Gansou and Hohler reportedly took part in those proceedings. This is not the first time that the US has issued restrictions against an ICC official since Trump returned to office for a second term on January 20. Shortly after taking office, Trump issued a broadexecutive orderthreatening anyone who participates in ICC investigations with sanctions. Critics warned that such sweeping language could pervert the course of justice, for example by dissuading witnesses from coming forward with evidence. ButTrump arguedthat the recent arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant necessitated such measures. He also claimed that the US and Israel were “thriving democracies” that “strictly adhere to the laws of war” and that the ICC’s investigations threatened military members with “harassment, abuse and possible arrest”. “This malign conduct in turn threatens to infringe upon the sovereignty of the United States and undermines the critical national security and foreign policy work of the United States Government and our allies, including Israel,” the executive order said. Under that order, the US sanctioned ICC prosecutor Karim Khan, who had petitioned the court for the arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant. That, in turn, slowed the investigation into Israel’s actions in Gaza, and Khanlater stepped awayfrom his role amid allegations of sexual misconduct. But Trump has a history of opposing the ICC, stretching back to his first term. In 2019, for instance, Trump announced his administration would deny or yank visas for ICC officials involved in investigating US troops in Afghanistan. Then, in 2020, he sanctioned ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda and a court official named Phakiso Mochochoko for their involvement in the investigation. Those actions were later overturned under President Joe Biden. Critics, however, warn that Trump’s actions could have dire consequences over the long term for the ICC, which relies on its member countries to execute orders like arrest warrants. The court itself hascalledfor an end to the threats.",

    "article_text": "Lamine Yamal won the battle of Ballon d’Or contenders by scoring twice asSpain eclipsed France 5-4in their Nations League semifinal. The 17-year-old Yamal outshone French counterparts Desire Doue and Ousmane Dembele on Thursday as Spain initially ran riot against Didier Deschamps’s tired-looking team to book its place in Sunday’s final against Portugal. Portugaldefeated host nation Germany 2-1on Wednesday. Thursday’s game had been billed as a contest between young stars, but it was clear that Paris Saint-Germain’sChampions League winin Munich on Saturday had added more weight to French legs, with PSG stars Doue and Dembele disappointing. It was the highest-scoring game in the Nations League’s short history, but three of the four French goals came after Yamal had made it 5-1 and the Spanish players eased up, thinking the game was won. “It was a great game. In the end, it was a little close, but we played very well and I think deserved to win,” Yamal said. Nico Williams opened the scoring in the 22nd minute after Yamal threaded the ball through to Mikel Oyarzabal, who held off two defenders and served it on a plate for Williams to rifle to the roof of the net. Mikel Merino, the hero when Spain last played in Stuttgart, made it 2-0 three minutes later after playing a one-two with Oyarzabal. Theo Hernandez struck the crossbar and Spain needed goalkeeper Unai Simon to deny Doue, then Mbappe and Dembele. But Spain looked capable of scoring at any time. Real Madrid defender Dean Huijsen thought he had scored spectacularly after a brilliantly worked free kick, only to have the goal ruled out for offside. It was the 20-year-old Huijsen’s third game for Spain. It looks like he is set to stay. Adrien Rabiot conceded a penalty for a mistimed challenge on Yamal, who dusted himself off to make it 3-0 from the spot in the 54th. Pedri scored a minute after that, taking Williams’s pass with his first touch and dinking it past the bewildered Mike Maignan with his next. Pedro Porro’s foul gave Mbappe his chance from the penalty, but Yamal replied to that by prodding the ball past Maignan for 5-1. Substitute Rayan Cherki scored late on his France debut after Yamal scored Spain’s fifth, then Spain defender Daniel Vivian conceded an own goal, and Cherki set up fellow substitute Randal Kolo Muani in stoppage time as France ultimately came close to an improbable comeback.",

    "title": "Netanyahu admits Israel backing ‘criminal’ groups, rivals of Hamas, in Gaza",
    "article_text": "Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the country is using armed gangs inGazato help fight Hamas, his admission coming after a new wave of military strikes on the besieged Gaza Strip that left at least 52 Palestinians dead. Netanyahu said the government had “activated” powerful local clans in the enclave on the advice of “security officials”, his video statement posted to X on Thursday coming hours after former Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman accused him of deploying the tactic. The statement marked the government’s first public acknowledgement that it had backed the armed Palestinian groups based around powerful families, which stand accused by aid workers of carrying out criminal attacks and stealing aid from trucks as starvation stalks the entire territory due to a punishing Israeli blockade. An Israeli official cited by news agency The Associated Press said that one of the groups Netanyahu was referring to was the so-called Popular Forces, led by Yasser Abu Shabab, a local clan leader in Rafah. Last month, Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported on the group’s activities – though it was named the “Anti-Terror Service” in the report – saying that sources in Gaza claimed it consisted of roughly 100 armed men operating with the tacit approval of the Israeli military. In recent weeks, the Abu Shabab group announced online that its fighters were helping protect supply shipments to new US- and Israel-backed distribution centres run by the shadowyGaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). “The Israeli opposition claims that there was no consultation within the Israeli government or the Israeli cabinet,” said Al Jazeera’s Hamdah Salhut, reporting from Jordan’s capital Amman. “Netanyahu says that these armed gangs … could essentially help the Israelis defeat Hamas in Gaza.” “But it’s not going down well within Israel, where people are saying that these are armed criminal enterprises within the Gaza Strip. That they should not be armed and that these are Israeli weapons that are being put in their hands,” she said. Netanyahu made his statement on another deadly day in Gaza, the military hitting targets throughout the besieged coastal enclave where the crippling blockade has brought the population to the brink of mass starvation. Deadly incidents, killing more than 100 and wounding many more, at aid distribution sites run by the GHF since last week have sparked widespread condemnation, with Israeli troopsopening fireon Palestinians seeking aid on four separate occasions since last week. Chris Gunness, former spokesperson for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), told Al Jazeera that the operations of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation had turned Gaza into a “human abattoir”. “Hundreds of civilians are herded like animals into fenced-off pens and are slaughtered like cattle in the process,” he said. Amid growing international condemnation, GHF shuttered operations for a full day on Wednesday, saying the next day that it wouldreopentwo aid distribution centres in the Rafah area of southern Gaza. It did not say when aid distribution would resume. At least 52 Palestinians were killed on Thursday, according to hospital sources who spoke to Al Jazeera. The sources said 31 bodies had arrived at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, with 21 admitted to Gaza City’s al-Ahli Arab and al-Shifa hospitals. Israel killed four journalists in an attack on al-Ahli Hospital itself, also known as the Baptist Hospital, in Gaza City Gaza City local Fadi al-Hindi told Al Jazeera that he had seen one of the strikes on al-Nasser Street, near the al-Shifa Hospital, witnessing scenes of death after running outside his tent to check on his children. “When I arrived, I saw a man in pieces; he had been riding a bicycle, and the lower half of his body was gone. Everyone in the street was injured, and we started to collect the pieces of the wounded,” he said. At least three Palestinians were killed in the strike, reportedly including children. The Palestinian news agency Wafa also reported five deaths in areas around Khan Younis, four west of Beit Lahiya in the north, and one south of Gaza City, as well as the injuring of a child near Bureij in central Gaza. Wafa also reported that Israeli forces opened fire on Palestinians trying to reach an aid centre near Wadi Gaza. In the meantime, Hamas chief Khalil al-Hayya has said in a prerecorded speech that the group did not reject aproposal for a ceasefirein Gaza put forward by US special envoy Steve Witkoff, stating that it had instead requested some changes to ensure an end to the war. Al-Hayya added that Hamas is ready to engage in further talks and that communications with the mediators are ongoing. Israel broke off a previous truce in March toresume the warin Gaza.",

    "title": "Donald Trump’s travel ban: Why? And why now?",
    "article_text": "Washington, DC –Donald Trump’stravel banis the latest instalment in the United States president’s anti-immigration push, which plays to his right-wing base, advocates say, stressing that the order is not about public safety. The decree, released late on Wednesday, bars and restricts travellersfrom 12 countries, including Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. While Trump has argued that the ban was put in place to protect the US from “foreign terrorists”, many believe the president has other motivations for implementing it. “The latest travel ban is absolutely part and parcel of the administration’s agenda to weaponise immigration laws to target people who are racial and religious minorities and people with whom they disagree,” said Laurie Ball Cooper, vice president for US legal programmes at the International Refugee Assistance Project. Abed Ayoub, executive director at the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), said that while the administration is presenting the ban as related to vetting travellers, the move aims to “placate” Trump’s supporters. “It’s the ‘tough on immigration’ stance that this administration has taken on a number of issues since coming into office,” Ayoub told Al Jazeera. Since his inauguration in January, the Trump administration has gutted the US refugee programme, aggressively stepped up deportations and targeted foreign students critical of Israel – in some cases, pushing to remove themfrom the country. Immigration experts said they had been anticipating the travel ban since Trump signed an executive order in January thatpaved the wayfor it. That order directed US officials to compile a list of nations “for which vetting and screening information is so deficient as to warrant a partial or full suspension on the admission of nationals from those countries”. Trump said in the statement announcing the ban that the targeted countries “remain deficient with regards to screening and vetting”. This is not the first time Trump has ordered atravel ban. Wednesday’s order has several predecessors – multiple iterations of a ban that the US president imposed during his first term as president. One week after taking office in 2017, Trump barred citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries, an order that became widely known as the “Muslim ban”. As a candidate in 2015, he called for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States”, and the 2017 proclamation appeared to be a reflection of that proposal. However, there are key differences between the latest order andthe one implemented in 2017, which sparked disorder and protests at airports and initially applied to legal permanent residents and people who already had visas. Wednesday’s order lists specific exemptions, including for existing visa holders, who will still be able to come to the US using their visas, which will remain valid. Immediate relatives of US citizens will also be able to apply for and obtain visas. Trump has also ordered it to go into effect on Monday – five days after the executive order was signed – whereas the original “Muslim ban” was implemented immediately and chaotically as soon as he announced it. Moreover, the latest travel ban targets countries with people from different religious backgrounds across four continents, making it difficult to argue religious bias in any court challenge. Also, the early bans of Trump’s first term were struck down by federal judges before the Supreme Court eventually upheld the third and last version his administration issued. “It seems like a lot more thought went into this, a lot more reasoning from their end,” Ayoub said. He added that in some ways, the ban is “not as bad” as the 2017 one and it will be difficult to challenge. With the courts unlikely to block the order, Ayoub said he hopes the administration will issue more exemptions and work with the targeted countries to take steps that would remove them from the list. Cooper said the impact of the ban will be devastating. For example, the exemption on immediate relatives does not include the parents and children of permanent residents – people who have followed the rules and may have been waiting for years to get their immigration interviews to join their loved ones in the US. “There are still people on the cusp of reuniting with their families, on the cusp of arriving to safety in the United States who will be cut off from that family reunification and from that access to safety by this travel ban,” Cooper told Al Jazeera. “Families will be kept apart.” The timing of Wednesday’s decree also differs from the original “Muslim ban”. It came more than five months into Trump’s second term. Trump has tied the travel ban to an attack on Sunday that US authorities attributed to an Egyptian asylum seeker. They accused him of using a makeshift flamethrower and Molotov cocktails to injure 12 people who were protestingin Boulder, Coloradoin support of Israeli captives held in Gaza. However, Egypt is not on the list of banned countries, and when asked why not on Thursday, Trump told reporters that the country is a US ally that has “things under control”. “And why now? I can say that it can’t come soon enough, frankly,” Trump said. “We want to keep bad people out of our country. The Biden administration allowed some horrendous people, and we are getting them out one by one.” Cooper said the Trump administration is “exploiting the tragedy” in Colorado by rolling out the order in its aftermath. “Ultimately, if you look at the travel ban and the way that it operates, I am not convinced that this is a response to that,” she said. “But even if it were, even when there is a tragedy, even when something awful happens, punishing groups of people based on their nationality because of what one other person allegedly did is not the right answer.” Cooper added that the order is “arbitrary”, noting that it includes exemptions for athletes competing in next year’s World Cup and the 2028 Summer Olympics but not for students. Some Democrats have accused Trump of imposing the ban now to distract from his issues at home, including an enormous tax bill advancing through Congress and his feud with his former billionaire aideElon Musk. “Anytime you ban people coming to the United States from other countries, it has a real impact,” Senator Chris Murphy told MSNBC. “But it is chiefly in service of trying to get us all talking about that … instead of talking about the centrepiece of this story, which is this bill to make the rich even richer at the expense of everybody else.”",

    "title": "A ship called Madleen: Gaza’s first fisherwoman inspires solidarity mission",
    "article_text": "Gaza City –As theMadleensails towards Gaza to try to deliver life-saving aid to its people, little is known about the woman the boat was named after: Madleen Kulab, Gaza’s only fisherwoman. WhenAl Jazeera first met Madleen Kulab(also spelled Madelyn Culab) three years ago, she had two children, was expecting her third and lived a relatively quiet life in Gaza City with her husband, Khader Bakr, 32, also a fisherman. Madleen, now 30, would sail fearlessly out as far as Israel’s gunship blockade would allow to bring back fish she could sell in a local market to support the family. When Israel’s war on Gaza began, the family was terrified, then heartbroken when Israel killed Madleen’s father in an air strike near their home in November 2023. They fled with Madleen nearly nine months pregnant to Khan Younis, then to Rafah, to Deir el-Balah and then Nuseirat. Now, they are back in what remains of their home in Gaza City, a badly damaged space they returned to when the Israeli army allowed displaced people to head back north in January. Madleen sits on a battered sofa in her damaged living room, three of her four children sitting with her: baby Waseela, one, on her lap; five-year-old Safinaz beside her; and three-year-old Jamal – the baby she was expecting when Al Jazeera first met her – at the end. She talks about what it felt like to hear from an Irish activist friend that the ship trying to break the blockade on Gaza would be named after her. “I was deeply moved. I felt an enormous sense of responsibility and a little pride,” she says with a smile. “I’m grateful to these activists who have devoted themselves, left their lives and comforts behind, and stood with Gaza despite all the risks,” she says of the group of 12 activists, who include Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg and Rima Hassan, a French member of the European Parliament. “This is the highest form of humanity and self-sacrifice in the face of danger.” Khader sits on another sofa with six-year-old Sandy. He holds out his phone with a photo of the Madleen on it, flying the Palestinian flag. Madleen has been fishing since she was 15, a familiar figure heading out on her father’s boat, getting to know all the other fishermen and also becoming well-known to international solidarity activists. In addition to bringing home the fish, Madleen is also a skilled cook,preparing seasonal fish dishesthat were so famously tasty that she had a list of clients waiting to buy them from her. Especially popular were the dishes made with Gaza’s ubiquitous sardines. But now, she can’t fish any more and neither can Khader because Israel destroyed their boats and an entire storage room full of fishing gear during the war. “We’ve lost everything – the fruit of a lifetime,” she says. But her loss is not just about income. It’s about identity – her deep connection to the sea and fishing. It’s even about the simple joy of eating fish, which she used to enjoy “10 times a week”. “Now fish is too expensive if you can find it at all. Only a few fishermen still have any gear left, and they risk their lives just to catch a little,” she says. “Everything has changed. We now crave fish in the middle of this famine we’re living through.” After the air strike near the family home in November 2023, Madleen’s family’s first displacement was to Khan Younis, following Israeli army instructions that they would be safer there. After searching for shelter, they ended up in a small apartment with 40 other displaced relatives, and then Madleen went into labour. “It was a difficult, brutal birth. No pain relief, no medical care. I was forced to leave the hospital right after giving birth. There were no beds available because of the overwhelming number of wounded,” she says. When she returned to the shelter, things were just as dire. “We didn’t have a mattress or even a blanket, neither me nor the kids,” she said. “I had to sleep on the floor with my newborn baby. It was physically exhausting.” She then had to tend to four children in an enclave where baby formula, diapers and even the most basic food items were almost impossible to find. The war, she says, has reshaped her understanding of suffering and hardship. In 2022, she and Khader were struggling to make ends meet between Israel’s gunship blockade and the frequent destruction of their boats. There was also the added burden of being a mother with small children and undertaking such physically taxing work. But now, things have gotten far worse. “There’s no such thing as ‘difficult’ any more. Nothing compares to the humiliation, hunger and horror we’ve seen in this war,” she says. Throughout the war, Madleen remained in touch with international friends and solidarity activists she had met through the years. “I would share my reality with them,” she says. “They came to understand the situation through me. They felt like family.” Her friends abroad offered both emotional and financial support, and she is grateful for them, saying they made her feel that Gaza wasn’t forgotten, that people still cared. She is also grateful for being remembered in the naming of the Madleen, but she worries that Israeli authorities will not let the ship reach Gaza, citing past attempts that were intercepted. “Intercepting the ship would be the least of it. What’s more worrying is the possibility of a direct assault like what happened to the Turkish shipMavi Marmarain 2010 when several people were killed.” Regardless of what happens, Madleen believes the mission’s true message has already been delivered. “This is a call to break the global silence, to draw the world’s attention to what’s happening in Gaza. The blockade must end, and this war must stop immediately.” “This is also a message of hope for me. They may have bombed my boat, but my name will remain – and it will sail across the sea.”",

    "title": "Israel launches several attacks on Beirut’s southern suburbs, south Lebanon",
    "article_text": "A series of Israeli strikes have targeted Beirut’s southern suburbs on the eve of the Muslim Eid al-Adha holiday, almost an hour after the Israeli army issued a forced evacuation order to residents in areas that it says held underground facilities used by the Lebanese group Hezbollah for drone production. The attack on Thursday is the fourth time Israel has bombed Beirut since a ceasefire with Hezbollahwent into effect in November.It has carried out assassinations and announced strikes that it said targeted Hezbollah sites. Israel has violated the ceasefire on a near-daily basis for seven months, according to the Lebanese government led by President Joseph Aoun, Arab nations and rights groups. Aoun has recently appealed to the United States and France to rein Israel in. Aoun, in a statement on Thursday after the strikes, voiced “firm condemnation of the Israeli aggression” and “flagrant violation of an international accord … on the eve of a sacred religious festival”. Before the attacks, Israeli military spokesman Avichay Adraee had ordered residents living near buildings in the neighbourhoods of Hadath, Haret Hreik and Burj al-Barajneh in the Dahiyeh suburbs to evacuate. “You are next to infrastructure belonging to Hezbollah,” Adraee said in a social media post, which included a map of the eight buildings being targeted in four different locations. The message in Arabic indicated that Israel would soon bomb the area. After the evacuation order, Lebanese media reported the area was nearly emptied of inhabitants, who had been preparing to celebrate Eid al-Adha. It was sealed off as “warning strikes” could be heard, the reports said. The Wafa news agency reported that 100 housing units were destroyed in Israel’s strikes on southern Beirut. Later Thursday night, Israeli strikes also targeted the southern Lebanese village of Ain Qana, according to Lebanese state media, shortly after further Israeli army evacuation warnings were issued for the area. Ain Qana is located to the east of the coastal city of Sidon. Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr, reporting from Beirut in the immediate aftermath of the strikes, said, “There was heavy traffic here as people were making their way out. As you can imagine, this did cause a lot of panic. This is not the first time the army has carried out air strikes in Beirut’s southern suburbs since a ceasefire came into force last November, but this is the largest attack.” Khodr said up to eight buildings were targeted in four densely populated neighbourhoods, adding that the magnitude of these air strikes meant all the area’s residents had to flee. Analyst Rami Khouri told Al Jazeera that the attack was “no surprise”, as Israel has been assassinating people “over the last three, four months. They’ve continued occupying five places in South Lebanon after the ceasefire agreement.” “The Israelis have always used military force as their main instrument to get their foes to submit to them,” he said.  “But the irony is that it hasn’t worked. It has only generated great dissent, and we’ll have to see in Lebanon what it means … Hezbollah took a hit last year, and they’re obviously regrouping,” he said. “We don’t know exactly what they’re doing, but they are regrouping,” he added. Video verified by Al Jazeera’s Sanad agency showed people hurrying away after the evacuation warning: حركة نزوح كثيفة من الضاحية الجنوبية لبيروت بعد تهديد الجيش الاسرائيليpic.twitter.com/yuqA4giy4v — Al Jadeed News (@ALJADEEDNEWS)June 5, 2025 The Israeli military accused Hezbollah of manufacturing drones in the area in a “blatant violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon”. A Hezbollah official denied that there were drone production facilities at the targeted locations. The Israeli military “will work to remove any threat to the State of Israel and its citizens and prevent any attempt to reestablish the terrorist organization Hezbollah”, it said. “If you talk to people here, what they will tell you is that this is terrorism,” said Khodr, as “Israel warns people to leave in the middle of the night and on the eve of a major religious holiday”. Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam also issued a statement condemning the strikes. He called on the international community to deter Israel from “continuing its aggressions” and compel it to fully withdraw from Lebanese territory. Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz hailed the strikes on Beirut: “We will continue to enforce the ceasefire rules without any compromises and will not allow any entity to create threats against the northern communities and all citizens of the State of Israel.” The 14-month war between Israel and Hezbollah killed more than 4,000 people in Lebanon, including hundreds of civilians. The Lebanese government said in April that Israeli strikes had killed another 190 people and wounded nearly 500 since the ceasefire.",

    "title": "Chairman of far-right Reform UK party quits after burqa row",
    "article_text": "The Muslim chairman of the United Kingdom’s radical right-wing Reform UK party has quit after denouncing a call from within party ranks to ban the burqa as “dumb”. “I no longer believe working to get a Reform government elected is a good use of my time, and hereby resign the office,” Zia Yusuf announced on X on Thursday, hours after hitting out at Reform UK lawmaker Sarah Pochin for asking Prime Minister Keir Starmer whether his government would consider banning the burqa. Pochin won her seat in a by-election last month that saw the anti-immigration party, some of whose members have been accused ofIslamophobia, makesignificant gainsin a political landscape traditionally dominated by the governing Labour Party and the opposition Conservatives. The new lawmaker had urged Labour’s Starmer during her debut appearance at Prime Minister’s Questions on Wednesday if he would consider the move “in the interests of public safety”, according to the BBC. “I do think it’s dumb for a party to ask the PM if they would do something the party itself wouldn’t do,” Yusuf said on X amid an ensuing flare-up over whether banning the burqa should be party policy. Yusuf, a former banker and self-described “proud British Muslim patriot”, became Reform UK chairman after last year’s general election, having jumped ship from the Conservative Party. Reform UK, led by Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage, won four parliamentary seats in a breakthrough resultlast year, going on to gain a fifth parliamentary seat, its first mayoralty and a number of council seats inlocal electionslast month. It currently leads national opinion polls, ahead of the Labour Party. Farage said on X that Yusuf was “a huge factor in our success on May 1st and is an enormously talented person”. Divisions in the party’s upper ranks have been made public before. In March, Reform referred one of its lawmakers, Rupert Lowe, to police over a number of allegations, including threats of physical violence against Yusuf. Prosecutors later said they would not bring charges against Lowe, who was suspended by the party.",

    "title": "Trump, Merz discuss trade, NATO spending and Russia’s war on Ukraine",
    "article_text": "German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has called on the US to apply more pressure on Russia to end its three-year-old war on Ukraine. “You know that we gave support to Ukraine and that we are looking for more pressure on Russia,” Merz told US President Donald Trump at the start of their meeting on Thursday at the Oval Office. Merz emphasised that Germany “was on the side of Ukraine”, while Trump likened the war to a fight between two young children who hated each other. “Sometimes, you’re better off letting them fight for a while and then pulling them apart,” Trump said. He added that he had relayed that analogy to Russian President Vladimir Putin in their phone conversation on Wednesday. Asked about Trump’s comments as the two leaders sat next to each other, Merz stressed that both he and Trump agreed “on this war and how terrible this war is going on,” pointing to the US president as the “key person in the world” who would be able to stop the bloodshed. Al Jazeera’s Kimberly Halkett said that, while the two men agreed that the war needed to end, how that happens “seems to be a point of contention”. “What we saw there was the German chancellor suggesting and pointing out that … Russia continues to hit back at civilian targets, whereas, when it comes to Ukraine, the focus in the eyes of Germany has been strictly on military targets inside Russia,” she said from Washington, DC. Halkett added that Trump revealed during the meeting that he “implored the Russian president not to retaliate for that attack that took place over the weekend … and Vladimir Putin said he was going to attack regardless.” Thursday’s meeting marked the first time thatthe two leaders sat down in person. After exchanging pleasantries – Merz gave Trump a gold-framed birth certificate of the US president’s grandfather, Friedrich Trump, who immigrated from Germany – the two leaders were to discuss issues such as Ukraine, trade and NATO spending. Trump and Merz have spoken several times by phone, either bilaterally or with other European leaders, since Merz took office on May 6. German officials say the two leaders have started to build a “decent” relationship, with Merz wanting to avoid the antagonism that defined Trump’s relationship with one of his predecessors, Angela Merkel, in the Republican president’s first term. The 69-year-old Merz, who came to office with an extensive business background, is a conservative former rival of Merkel’s who took over her party after she retired from politics. Merz has thrown himself into diplomacy on Ukraine, travelling to Kyiv with fellow European leaders days after taking office and receiving Zelenskyy in Berlin last week. He has thanked Trump for his support for an unconditional ceasefire while rejecting the idea of “dictated peace” or the “subjugation” of Ukraine and advocating for more sanctions against Russia. In their first phone call since Merz became chancellor, Trump said he would support the efforts of Germany and other European countries to achieve peace, according to a readout from the German government. Merz also said last month that “it is of paramount importance that the political West not let itself be divided, so I will continue to make every effort to produce the greatest possible unity between the European and American partners.” Under Merz’s immediate predecessor, Olaf Scholz, Germany became the second-biggest supplier of military aid to Ukraine after the United States. Merz has promised to keep up the support and last week, pledged to help Ukraine develop its own long-range missile systems that would be free of any imposed range limits. At home, Merz’s government is intensifying a drive that Scholz started to bolster the German military after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In Trump’s first term, Berlin was a target of his ire for failing to meet the current NATO target of spending 2 percent of gross domestic product on defence, and Trump is now demanding at least 5 percent from allies. The White House official said theupcoming NATO summitin the Netherlands later this month is a “good opportunity” for Germany to commit to meeting that 5 percent mark. During their meeting on Thursday, Trump described Merz as a good representative of Germany and also “difficult,” which he suggested was a compliment. He said US troops would remain in Germany and said it was positive that Berlin was spending more money on defence. Another top priority for Merz is to get Germany’s economy, Europe’s biggest, moving again after it shrank the past two years. He wants to make it a “locomotive of growth,” but Trump’s tariff threats are a potential obstacle for a country whose exports have been a key strength. At present, the economy is forecast to stagnate in 2025. Germany exported $160bn worth of goods to the US last year, according to the Census Bureau. That was about $85bn more than what the US sent to Germany, a trade deficit that Trump wants to erase. “Germany is one of the very big investors in America,” Merz told reporters Thursday morning. “Only a few countries invest more than Germany in the USA. We are in third place in terms of foreign direct investment.” The United States and the European Union are in talks to reach a trade deal, which would be critical for Germany’s export-heavy economy, but Trump said he would be fine with an agreement or with tariffs. “We’ll end up hopefully with a trade deal,” Trump said. “I’m OK with the tariffs, or we make a deal with the trade.”",

    "title": "In face-off with Trump, Tesla shares plunge and Musk threatens NASA",
    "article_text": "Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and self-proclaimed “first buddy” of United States President Donald Trump, has stepped up criticism of the president’s massive tax legislation in recent days, leading to a blow-up which saw Tesla stock plunge and Musk saying he would decommission Dragon aircraft immediately. NASA relies on SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft to ferry astronauts to and from the International Space Station under a contract worth roughly $4.9bn. The capsule is the only US spacecraft capable of flying humans in orbit. Musk’s statement marks a dramatic escalation in an intensifying fight with Trump that burst into public view this week, when Musk opposed the Trump administration’s linchpin spending bill. Taking Dragon out of service would disrupt the International Space Station (ISS) programme, which involves dozens of countries under an international agreement signed more than two decades ago. Russia’s Soyuz system is the only other crewed spacecraft that sends astronauts to the ISS. Musk’s comment came in response to a post by Trump on his social media site, Truth Social: “The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts.” The first impact of the public break up between the two powerful men was on Tesla shares, which dropped nearly 15 percent, wiping off around $150bn from its market value on Thursday on a day otherwise devoid of news for the electric vehicle (EV) maker, leading traders to speculate that Musk’s increasingly pointed rhetoric suggests strain in the relationship that has benefitted his sprawling empire of businesses. Trump said on Thursday that Musk was upset because the bill took the EV mandate away. “Look, Elon and I had a great relationship. I don’t know if we will any more,” the president said. “He said the most beautiful things about me. And he hasn’t said bad about me personally. That’ll be next. But I’m very disappointed.” Trump’s comments extended a decline in Tesla shares. The world’s richest man, a key figure in the Department of Government Efficiency’s (DOGE) cost-cutting initiative for several months, has blasted the bill, not long after he said he would spend less time in the White House and more time with his companies. On his social media platform X, Musk has called on Congress members to kill the legislation, calling it a “disgusting abomination“. “It more than defeats all the cost savings achieved by the DOGE team at great personal cost and risk,” Musk, the largest Republican donor in the 2024 election cycle, said on X on Tuesday. Musk’s leadership of DOGE and his alignment with the Trump administration have put off some Tesla buyers. Sales of his EVs have slumped in Europe, China and key US markets like California, even as overall electric vehicle purchases continue to grow. In the past few weeks, Musk had slowly started to separate himself from the White House, stung in part by the wave of protests against Tesla. “Elon’s politics continue to harm the stock. First, he aligned himself with Trump, which upset many potential Democratic buyers. Now, he has turned on the Trump administration,” said Tesla shareholder Dennis Dick, chief strategist at Stock Trader Network. Musk’s other businesses, SpaceX and Starlink, dominate their respective markets, but have also come under scrutiny due to Musk’s relationship with Trump. Tesla shares are down nearly 22 percent since May 27, roughly coinciding withhis decision to pull backfrom Washington’s activities. The stock has been on a rollercoaster ever since Musk’s endorsement of Trump in mid-July 2024 in his re-election bid, gaining 169 percent from that point through mid-December. That was followed by a 54 percent sell-off through early April as a “Tesla Takedown” protest movement intensified. The House of Representatives version of the budget bill proposes largely ending the popular $7,500 electric vehicle subsidy by the end of 2025. Tesla and other carmakers have relied on incentives for years to drum up demand, but Trump promised during the transition to end the subsidy. Tesla could face a $1.2bn hit to its full-year profit, along with an additional $2bn setback to regulatory credit sales due to separate Senate legislation targeting California’s EV sales mandates, according to JP Morgan analysts. “The budget bill contains bad stuff for Tesla with the end of the EV credits, and just generally his falling out with Trump has risks for Tesla and Elon’s other companies,” said Jed Ellerbroek, portfolio manager at Argent Capital Management. Musk’s public attacks have upset potential Republican Tesla buyers as well, Dennis Dick added. One White House official on Wednesday called the Tesla CEO’s moves “infuriating”. The billionaire joined Senate Republican deficit hawks this week in arguing that the House bill does not go far enough in reducing spending.",

    "article_text": "Indonesia have kept alive their hopes of qualifying for the FIFA World Cup for only the second time in their history witha nervy 1-0 winthat has ended opponents China’s hopes of qualifying. Oli Romeny scored the only goal of Thursday’s game from the penalty spot in the first half of the Asian Football Confederation qualifier in Jarkarta. The spot kick was awarded after Yang Zexiang brought down Ricky Kambuaya on the stroke of half-time. It dealt a blow to the Chinese, whose defence was mounting pressure on the hosts, given the expectations on them. In the first kickoff of the day in the group, Australia took a giant stride towards sealing another qualification spot by beating already qualified Japan 1-0. Aziz Behich scored the winner with a curling effort from the edge of the box in the 90th minute. Saudi Arabia hosted Bahrain in the final kickoff of the day in Group C. Anything other than a win for the home side would guarantee Australia’s progress while Bahrain needed a win themselves to retain a chance of climbing above Indonesia into the final playoff spot. Kambuaya had Indonesia’s first sighter, but the effort from range flew wide of the right-hand upright. Wang Yudong, making his international debut at 18, was the brightest spark in China’s start and steered an effort wide after a counter off the back of mounting pressure from the hosts. Han Pengfei had China’s best chance, though, when he flashed his header over the bar from Serginho’s corner. Romeny had twice had near misses himself, one just wide and the other too close to the keeper, before slotting home the crucial kick from the spot. Indonesia travel to Japan for their final group game on Tuesday.",

    "title": "‘Premeditated genocide’: Brazil’s Lula slams Israel over Gaza war",
    "article_text": "Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva accused Israel of carrying out “premeditated genocide” inGazaduring a visit to Paris, as it emerged the military had killed at least 52 people in its latest onslaught in the besieged coastal enclave where a crippling blockade is fuelling starvation. “What is happening in Gaza is not a war. It’s agenocidebeing carried out by a highly prepared army against women and children,” said Lula at a joint news conference in Paris with French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday. “[It is] a premeditated genocide from a far-right government that is waging a war, including against the interests of its own people,” he said of Israel’s 20-month offensive, which has killed at least 54,607 Palestinians so far, according to the enclave’s Health Ministry. At least 52 people werekilledon Thursday, including women and children, according to medical sources, who spoke to Al Jazeera, amid growing concern about deadly incidents at aid distribution sites run by the controversialGaza Humanitarian Foundationsince last week. While Lula has previously used the term “genocide” to characterise Israel’s actions in Gaza, Macron has reserved judgement, saying last month that it was not for a “political leader to use the term, but up to historians to do so when the time comes”. The Brazilian leader’s condemnation of Israel’s offensive came as German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul told his visiting Israeli counterpart, Gideon Saar, to allow more humanitarian aid into the enclave in accordance with “prevailing international law”. Last week, Wadephul had said Germany was assessing “whether what is happening in Gaza is in line with international law” and that arms sales to Israel would be evaluated on this basis. Wadephul also said he was “concerned about the extremely tense situation in the West Bank”, decrying the Israeli government’s announcement that it would allow 22 more settlements in the occupied territory, saying it threatened the two-state solution further. On Thursday, King Abdullah of Jordan praised Spain for recognising Palestine and calling for an end to the war in Gaza during a meeting with King Felipe in Madrid. He said work was underway to gain European support. Jordan’s state news agency Petra cited him as saying work was under way to harness European support for an Arab plan to rebuild Gaza without displacing its residents, as threatened by US PresidentDonald Trumpthis year.",

    "title": "Procter & Gamble to cut 7,000 jobs over the next two years",
    "article_text": "Procter & Gamble has said it will cut six percent of its workforce, or 7,000 jobs, over the next two years as it undertakes a restructuring programme as tariffs raise costs and uncertainty for businesses and consumers. The world’s largest consumer goods company, which makes products ranging from Tide detergent to Pampers diapers, announced the job cuts on Thursday at a Deutsche Bank’s Consumer Conference in Paris. The Cincinnati, Ohio-based consumer goods giant also plans to exit some product categories and brands in certain markets, including some potential divestitures, as part of the broader two-year restructuring plan. The restructuring will help simplify the organisational structure by “making roles broader” and “teams smaller”, P&G said. “The two-year window … gives them some flexibility in terms of timing and depth of cuts, as the tariff situation is very fluid,” said Christian Greiner, senior portfolio manager at F/m Investments that owns shares in P&G. The company had about 108,000 employees as of June 2024. The job cuts would account for roughly 15 percent of its non-manufacturing workforce. P&G expects to record charges of $1bn to $1.6bn before tax over the two-year period, with a quarter of the charges expected to be non-cash. Chief Financial Officer Andre Schulten and operations head Shailesh Jejurikar, speaking at the Deutsche Bank conference, said that the geopolitical environment was “unpredictable” and that consumers were facing “greater uncertainty.” In April, P&G said it would raise prices on some products, and Schulten said it was prepared to “pull every lever” in its arsenal tomitigate the impact of tariffs, primarily through higher prices and cost-cutting. The Pampers maker imports raw ingredients, packaging materials and some finished products into the United States from China. About 90 percent of what it sells is produced domestically, P&G has said. President Donald Trump’s sweeping levies on trading partners have shaken global markets and sparked concerns of a recession in the US. P&G on Thursday estimated it would have about a $600m before-tax hit in its fiscal year 2026, based on current tariff rates, a number that has frequently shifted. Overall, the trade war has cost companies at least $34bn in lost sales and higher costs, a Reuters analysis showed. It is also affecting US consumer sentiment, which fell slightly in May for the fifth straight month, surprising economists. The preliminary reading of the University of Michigan’s closely watched consumer sentiment index declined 2.7 percent on a monthly basis to 50.8, the second-lowest level in the nearly 75-year history of the survey. The only lower reading was in June 2022. Since January, sentiment has tumbled nearly 30 percent. Shares of P&G were down about 2 percent in early trading. That has since ticked upward as of 11:15am ET (15:15 GMT), but it is still about 1 percent lower than yesterday’s market close. P&G’s stock has trended downward in the last five trading days by 2.7 percent and is down about 1.2 percent from the beginning of the year.",

    "article_text": "The United States has blocked another United Nations Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. It’s the fifth time Washington has used its veto power since Israel’s war began in October 2023. The US says it will continue to support its close ally while Israel says it will continue the war in Gaza until Hamas is defeated. So do the veto powers of the permanent Security Council members undermine the body itself? Even when resolutions are passed, does the UN have the capability to enact them?

    "title": "The best Android phones",
    "article_text": "Whether you want everything but the kitchen sink or top-tier performance for a midrange price, you’ve got options. Whether you want everything but the kitchen sink or top-tier performance for a midrange price, you’ve got options. byAllison Johnson If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. The Android ecosystem is all about choice. While iPhone owners have a smaller pool of new devices to pick from when it’s time to upgrade, there’s a wider range of choices on Android. Some Android phones even fold in half!Imagine. On the flip side, all that choice can make for some hard decisions. Here’s where I’d like to help; I’ve tested a whole boatload of recent Android phones, and I think there are some real winners in the current batch. It’s all a matter of what you’re looking for, what you’re comfortable spending, and what your definition of a “reasonably sized phone” is. (I have my own, personally.) As you sift through the options, you’ll almost certainly come across tech’s favorite buzzphrase of the moment: AI. Generally speaking, AI has yet to really impress me on a phone. The Pixel 9 series has some potentially useful features, like a Screenshots app that uses AI to tag relevant info in metadata, and Galaxy devices can translate a phone call for you in real time. These things are nothing to sneeze at! But none of it feels like the platform shift that the big tech companies keep promising. Best not to put too much stock in any company’s AI claims just yet. There’s no shortcut to properly testing a phone; I put my personal SIM card (physical or otherwise) in each phone I review and live with it for a minimum of one full week. I set up each phone from scratch, load it up with my apps, and go about living my life — stress testing the battery, using GPS navigation on my bike while streaming radio, taking rapid-fire portrait mode photos of my kid — everything I can throw at it. Starting over with a new phone every week either sounds like a dream or your personal hell, depending on how Into Phones you are. For me, switching has becomeso routine that it’s mostly painless. A great Android phone will go the distance. I look for signs that the hardware and software will keep up for many years to come, including a strong IP rating for dust and water resistance (IP68 is preferred), durable glass panels on the front and back, and a sturdy aluminum frame rather than plastic. Samsung and Google flagships now offer seven years of OS and security updates, which as awesome. As a bare minimum three years of Android OS version upgrades is preferred, along with a total of four or five years of security updates. The best Android phones have plenty of resolution to cover their large display area, which means 1440p, ideally. A fast refresh rate of at least 120Hz is preferred — animations and scrolling look super smooth at that rate — and even better if it’s variable down to 1Hz to save on battery life. Any phone can take a decent photo in good lighting, but the best phone cameras can handle low light and high-contrast scenes well, too. I look for optical (most common) or sensor-shift (rare) image stabilization, which helps compensate for hand shake and enable slower shutter speeds in low light to gather more light. A telephoto lens is great to have too, though high-res sensors are starting to offer better lossless crop modes that mimic short zoom lenses well. Most phones on this list offer wireless charging, though not all do. Lack of wireless charging isn’t a complete deal-breaker, but it’s becoming an essential feature for a lot of people since it’s convenient for charging many different kinds of devices. If you live in the US, I have some bad news about the Android market, though. For complicated reasons having to do with “capitalism” and “geopolitics,” we don’t get nearly as many of the options as you’ll find in Asia and Europe — brands like Huawei, Xiaomi, Honor, and Oppo just aren’t available here. I’ve limited this guide to the devices I’ve personally tested in depth; thus, it is a fairly US-centric set of recommendations. With that in mind, it’s also worth acknowledging that most people in the US get their phones “for free” from their wireless carrier. If you can manage it, buying a phone unlocked will give you the most flexibility and freedom if you end up wanting to change carriers in the near future. Phone manufacturers also offer financing and trade-in deals to make payment more manageable. But if you’re happy with your carrier and the free phone on offer is the one you really want, by all means, take the free phone. Just make sure you understand the terms, especially if you need to change plans to cash in on the deal. However you go about it, you have some fantastic options for your next Android phone. 8 Verge Score Updated design feels more secure in handFast fingerprint sensorSeven years of software and OS updates No telephoto cameraAI features are inconsistentWhat is a photo?

But at $799 (and often less than that), the basic Pixel 9 is in a particularly appealing position, and if you don’t need a telephoto camera or the biggest screen, then this is the Android phone to get. The Pixel 9 comes with some significant quality-of-life improvements like a faster fingerprint scanner for unlocking the phone. The camera is as reliable as ever, and if you’re into AI photo editing tricks,boy does this phone have ‘em. There’s a new Screenshots app that acts as a place to store all of the information that would otherwise be lost at sea in your camera roll, and it uses AI to parse information out and make it searchable. Kinda handy. Even without AI, this is an excellent phone. It’s also designed to go the distance, with seven years of promised OS updates, which very likely means you’ll outgrow the phone before Google stops supporting it. Its potential for long-term value and the quality of the hardware make it an easy recommendation for anyone who just wants a nice Android phone that works. 8 Verge Score Excellent screenImproved ultrawide cameraRounded corners are comfier ExpensiveBulkyAI is (still) hit or miss Screen:6.9-inch 1440p 120Hz OLED /Processor:Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite /Cameras:200-megapixel main with OIS, 50-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS, 10-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS, 50-megapixel ultrawide, 12-megapixel selfie /Battery:5,000mAh /Charging:45W wired, 15W wireless (Qi2 Ready) /Weather resistance:IP68 There’s still no phone quite like the Ultra. The Galaxy S25 Ultra is Samsung’s latest answer to the question, “What if your phone had all of the features?” It’s equipped with two telephoto cameras, a built-in stylus, and a big, bright screen. Good luck finding that combination in another phone. Related: this is one of the most expensive slab-style phones you can buy. The newest edition of the Ultra comes with rounded corners and flat edges, making it more comfortable in your hand. But if you’re looking for significant year-over-year improvements to the Ultra formula outside of that, well, you won’t find much. Samsung’s focus has been on software features, which is to say AI features. But AI on Galaxy phones remains a mixed bag — it’s certainly not the paradigm shift Samsung wants us to think the S25 series represents. All of that puts the Ultra in a place of slightly less distinction than previous versions. The biggest updates are software features available to the rest of the S25 series. The Ultra looks and feels more like other Galaxy phones this time around, too. More than ever, it’s hard to understand what Samsung means when it calls this phone “Ultra.” Still, it’s your best choice for a feature-packed Android phone — even if it’s not quite as ultra as it once was. 8 Verge Score The last reasonably sized Android phoneSeven years of OS upgradesVery good camera Samsung software is as cluttered as usualAI is still a mixed bag Screen:6.2-inch 2340 x 1080 120hz OLED /Processor:Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 EliteCameras:50-megapixel main with OIS, 12-megapixel ultrawide, 10-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS, 12-megapixel selfieBattery:4000mAh /Charging:25W wired, 15W wireless (Qi2 Ready)/Weather-resistance rating:IP68 Most people like a big phone, and I get that. I do. If you want a big Android phone, you have plenty of options in front of you. But some of us like a smaller phone — something that (kind of) fits in your pocket, or feels more comfortable in your hand. For us, there is but one option on Android: the Samsung Galaxy S25. That’s theregularS25, not the Plus, which is a fine big phone. But the standard S25 is basically the last of its kind: a full-featured phone with a 6.2-inch screen. It’s not small, but it’s not huge, and we’ll have to take what we can get. And it’s a darn good phone that keeps up with the bigger devices in all the important ways: the battery goes all day, it comes with plenty of RAM, and it even has a real telephoto lens — not something you get on a basic, 6.1-inch phone on, say, iOS. The Galaxy S25 isn’t just a good, small-ish phone by default. It’s reliable, durable, and comes with the promise of seven years of OS updates. It’s not my pick for the overall best Android phone because Samsung software can be a bitmuch, but if you’re comfortable in the Samsung ecosystem and you just want a phone that fits in your dang pocket, then this is the one to go with. 8 Verge Score Excellent battery lifeSix years of security updatesStrong IP rating for dust and water resistance Big phone is bigNot as many OS updates as Google and Samsung offer Screen:6.82-inch 1440p 120Hz LTPO OLED /Processor:Snapdragon 8 Elite /Cameras:50-megapixel f/1.6 main with OIS, 50-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS, 50-megapixel f/2.0 ultrawide, 32-megapixel selfie /Battery:6,000mAh /Charging:80W wired, 50W wireless /Weather-resistance rating:IP68 and IP69 There are plenty of good reasons to consider the OnePlus 13. It has a big, beautiful screen, and costs a hundred bucks less than the Galaxy S25 Plus. Its dust and water resistance is so strong you could practically use the phone in a hurricane without consequences. And its camera system is much improved year over year, particularly when it comes to low-light portraiture. But there’s one standout reason to consider the 13: impatience. The OnePlus 13 offers enough battery stamina to get through two days of moderate use on a single charge — and that’s with plenty of power-draining features enabled, including the always-on display. If you’re thriftier with your charge, it could even go beyond that. Forgot to charge overnight? No big deal; you can probably just charge it up on night two. Charging is also relatively fast, and in the US, the phone comes with an 80W wired charger in the box. So even if you do need a midday top-off, you’ll be able to get hours of charge in a matter of minutes. No other flagship phone offers that kind of charging (or not charging) flexibility. 8 Verge Score Excellent outer screen formatInner screen is lovely to useSeven years of OS updates ExpensiveMain camera isn’t as good as slab phonesLong-term durability?

Probably not. But using one is awfully nice, and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is the nicest book-style foldable I’ve used to date. It’s pricey, it’s still bulkier than a slab-style phone, and its cameras aren’t quite as nice as the other Pixel 9 Pro phones. But it’s a joy to use, both as a regular phone with the cover screen and when you unfold the big inner screen. The 9 Pro Fold is Google’s second folding phone, following up the passport-shaped Pixel Fold with a format that feels much more familiar. The outer screen measures 6.3 inches on the diagonal, but more importantly, the ratio is the same as Google’s slab phones. By comparison, Samsung’s Z Fold 6 uses a taller, narrower format that feels cramped. Having used them both, I much prefer the 9 Pro Fold’s approach. That said, the 9 Pro Fold isn’t without compromises. The camera system isn’t quite as good as what you get in the other 9 Pro phones. The outer screen isn’t as sharp or bright as the Pixel 9 Pro’s, either. And it’s not as durable as its slab-style counterparts — there’s no dust resistance, and you can’t get it repaired just anywhere. For $1,800, that’s an awful lot to swallow. For the adventurous early adopter, though, the 9 Pro Fold will be very rewarding. There are many more great Android devices that weren’t covered here, and a few are worth calling out that didn’t quite make the cut for a recommendation.

    "article_text": "﻿‘Replacements have been offered. Staplers have been confiscated.’ ﻿‘Replacements have been offered. Staplers have been confiscated.’ byJay Peters Some people reported an unwelcome surprise after picking up their Nintendo Switch 2 preorders at GameStop: staples used to attach receipts to Switch 2 boxes ended up damaging the screens on the console,as reported byIGN. However, GameStop says this was an issue that was “isolated” to a single store and that it has already offered replacements. When you open the box for the Switch 2, the tablet / screen part of the device is just under the top flap of the packaging. The tablet’s proximity to the top of the box possibly explains how staples could get through and poke holes in the screen — especially if the person using the stapler gave it a solid push. Reports started trickling in overnight as people got their preorders. Inthis post on X, for example, you can see photos of two dots on the box, a bag, and the screen. ToIGN, a GameStop spokesperson said that it was “investigating the matter” and promised to “make customers whole.” And on Thursday, one Reddit user affected by the problemsaid thatthey spoke with a GameStop manager who said they would be able to exchange their damaged unit. “We’ve addressed a unique case of staples damaging Switch 2 screens – isolated to one store,” GameStop saysin a post on X. “Replacements have been offered.

    "article_text": "Bonfire Social, Channel.org, and Bounce are creating new ways to move around the open web. Bonfire Social, Channel.org, and Bounce are creating new ways to move around the open web. byEmma Roth For the past couple of years, the virtual FediForum conference has offered a glimpse at what’s new in the open social web, with last year’s big news beingThreads’ foray into the fediverse. This year’s presentation was no different, with several developers showing off new apps that will help to expand the ecosystem of decentralized social networks. Bonfire Social, one of the new apps, is meant to serve as a framework for creating digital communities, each with their own governance and style. During FediForum, Bonfire announced that they’re releasingBonfire Social 1.0as the first “flavor” of the platform. Bonfire Social comes with a “a pre-configured bundle of Bonfire extensions that defines which features are included,” like custom feeds, profiles, and threaded discussions, along with the ability to share posts and follow other users. The makers of Bonfire are working onother “flavors”of the platform, including Bonfire Community, which is geared toward private groups and organizations, as well as Open Science, a platform designed for collaboration between academic communities. Bonfire Social federates with Mastodon, Peertube, Mobilizon, and others. You caninstall Bonfire Socialnow or check outthe demo. Another new service announced at FediForum isChannel.org, which is designed to help you curate the content you see across the open social web. Users can tailor their feed by tracking specific hashtags and users, including bridged Bluesky accounts and RSS parrots. Other users can follow the channels you create, which are distributed across the Fediverse, Bluesky, and over RSS. You can filter out certain keywords and mute accounts not related to the topics you want to follow, and there are also built-in filters that block NSFW content and hate speech. Channel.org is built on a customized Mastodon server run by the Newsmast Foundation, a fediverse-focused charity based in the UK, and it sounds like a neat way to create an ultra-curated social feed. The service is currentlyavailable in an invite-only beta, but you can sign up for the waitlist to receive updates. You can check out some examples of channelsfrom Channel.org’s website. One of the other notable services highlighted today was Bounce, anapp that allows you to moveyour Bluesky account to Mastodon, all without losing any of your followers. The app is built by A New Social, the creators ofthe Bridgy Fedtool that Bounce uses to connect your Bluesky account to Mastodon. Once your account is bridged, Bounce can then transfer personal data servers using the “move” capability offered by ActivityPub and the AT Protocol, letting you retain your Bluesky followers — and the people you follow — when heading to Mastodon.

    "article_text": "The Switch 2’s eShop is a huge improvement. The Switch 2’s eShop is a huge improvement. byJay Peters If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. Ahead of the Nintendo Switch 2’s launch, Nintendo said that the eShop would be improved and run more smoothly on the new console. Based on our initial testing atThe Verge, it’s immediately apparent that the Switch 2’s eShop is much better. On the original Switch, the eShop can be extremely sluggish. Even just moving from one section to another can have a lag, and clicking into a game sometimes takes a bit to load before you can even go through the process of buying it. The delays and slow navigation make using the shop a huge pain; I personally often defaulted to buying digital games on Nintendo’s website because it was a better experience. On the Switch 2, the eShop is way faster. It’s all much more snappy, withmuchless lag browsing through sections and loading up game pages. Just take a look at this video comparing jumping into the eShop on both consoles, captured by my colleague Tristan Cooper – it’s dramatically faster on the Switch 2: And how about if you want to searchforDeltarune? Again, way quicker on the Switch 2. “Thanks to the system’s performance capabilities, Nintendo eShop on Switch 2 has been improved and runs smoothly even when displaying a large number of games,” Switch 2 director Takuhiro Dohta said in an interviewpublished in April. “We believe the act of finding the game you want to play is itself part of the game system experience.” Right now, the eShop feels like one part of the Switch 2 experience that’s a huge upgrade. Hopefully, that will end up making ita better place to find great games.

Securing a Switch 2 is only half the battle, after all. bySheena VasaniandBrandon Widder If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. The Switch 2 has finally landed, but it isn’t the only hardware Nintendo is launching this week. The company also introduced a range of new accessories for its new gaming console, the bulk of which are now available online atWalmart,Best Buy,GameStop, andTarget. From aredesigned Pro Controllertoa camera that lets you video chatwith your friends, each is designed to level up your gaming experience. Sadly, President Trump’s on-again, off-again tariff policyhas resulted in slight price bumpson several Switch 2 accessories — including the aforementioned Pro 2 Controller. There’s no telling whether we can expect more price hikes down the line, either, meaning if you have secured a Switch 2 and want to pick up a second controller or another accessory to go with it, now might be the time to act. The removable Joy-Cons are great for portable and wireless play, but their small, curveless design can feel cramped during longer sessions if you have larger hands. That’s why theNintendo Switch 2 Pro controllermight be worth a look, especially if you mostly game in TV mode. The upgraded version of one of ourfavorite Nintendo Switch controllerfeatures a few welcome improvements, including a pair of rear GL and GR buttons players can use to remap other controls. Nintendo has also finally added a 3.5mm audio jack, allowing you to pair it with a headset or a set of wired headphones. The gamepad even features the aforementioned“C” button. As of writing, you can pick up a Nintendo Switch 2 Pro controller for $84.99 atBest Buy,GameStop,Target, andAntonline. It’s also currently on sale atCostcofor $74.99 ($10 off), though, per usual, you’ll need a premium membership to take advantage of the latter deal. Nintendo’s Joy-Con controllers are bigger than the original and snap onto the Switch 2 magnetically, eliminating the need for sliding rails. The right Joy-Con also features the new“C” button, which you can use to pull up Nintendo’s new in-game chat system, GameChat, which will befree until March 31st, 2026. While the second-gen controllersdon’t feature Hall effect joysticks, Nintendo says they’ve been redesigned for smoother movement. The Joy-Con 2s also feature new optical sensors, which let you them like mice in compatible games. The Switch 2 comes with a pair of Joy-Cons, but if you want a second pair, you can currently grab them for around $94 atWalmart,Best Buy,GameStop,Target, and theMy Nintendo Store. If you plan on picking up the newMario Kart World— or you were lucky enough to snagNintendo’s limited time bundle— the Joy-Con 2 Wheels are worth a look. Simply snap the Joy-Con 2 controllers, which connect magnetically, into the steering wheel attachments before booting up your preferred racing title. The two-wheel set is currently available for around $24.88 fromWalmart,Best Buy,GameStop,Target, andNintendo. The Switch 2 is a pricey gadget you’ll want to keep safe, so it’s a good idea to invest in a carrying case like the Nintendo Switch 2 Carrying Case & Screen Protector. We’ll likely see a wealth of third-party brands release their own version in the coming weeks, but Nintendo’s proprietary offering is one of the few reputable offerings available at launch. The bundle — which includes a console-only carrying case, screen protector, and cleaning cloth — is only available for around $39.88 atWalmartandTarget, even if it was originally available elsewhere. Nintendo also just launched an All-In-One Carrying Case, which is more spacious than the model mentioned above. The higher-end case features separate compartments for stowing the console and various goodies, including the Switch 2 dock, Joy-Con 2 controllers, cables, and up to six game cards. Unfortunately, while it was initially available at most big-name retailers (includingWalmartandGameStop), it’s currently only available directly fromNintendofor $84.99. Supposedly, you can video chat with friends via GameChat using any compatible USB-C camera, but Nintendo offers its own solution in the form of theNintendo Switch 2 Camera. The 1080p camera is designed to sit on a stand, allowing you to display your face as a picture-in-picture overlay or as a dedicated video feed. A few titles, such as the upgraded version ofSuper Mario Party Jamboree, let you see your friends on-screen while you play. Some mini-games even incorporate the camera into the game experience itself. The camera features an adjustable wide-angle lens, designed to capture groups of people in a single shot, as well as a “high-sensitivity image sensor” that automatically adjusts brightness levels. It also features a built-in privacy shutter and includes a USB-C charging cable, as well as support for TV, tabletop, and handheld modes. You can currently order it for around $54 fromWalmart,Best Buy,GameStop,Target, andNintendo. Unlike the standard Joy-Con 2 grip that comes with the Switch 2,Nintendo’s so-called Charging Gripfeatures customizable GL and GR buttons — just like the Switch 2 Pro Controller — and can be used to charge your Joy-Cons via an included USB-C cable. Otherwise, it appears pretty similar in functionality to the original Switch’s charging grip, allowing you to combine the Joy-Con 2 controllers for a more traditional gamepad. Right now, you can pick up the Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip starting at $39.88 fromWalmart,GameStop, andNintendo. Nintendo also released a handful of smaller accessories this week, including Joy-Con 2 straps, AC adapters, and a standalone dock set for those who want a second. They can be found via the retailers below in most instances. Update, June 5th:Updated to reflect current pricing and availability, as well as the release of several new accessories.

    "title": "Let’s all do a dramatic reading of Trump and Musk’s mean posts",
    "article_text": "Who you got, the richest man in the world or the US president? Who you got, the richest man in the world or the US president? byElizabeth Lopatto Donald Trump and Elon Musk, two of the most media-addled personalities of our time, are publicly torching their relationship by posting on the public social media networks they each respectively own. I have seen theories that this is kayfabe, and I don’t buy it. Trump and Musk have publicly shit-talked people, including each other, before turning around and working with them. But this is real; threats are being made. I’m just not sure how serious it is. “Elon and I had a great relationship. I don’t know if we will anymore.” Let’s back up.Starting last week, Musk began making escalating angry remarks about the Big Beautiful Bill that eliminated the EV tax credits. Trump, unusually tactful,did not respond.That may have been because Musk has not yet donated $100 million he promised to a Trump-owned PAC. This morning, Trump said he was “very disappointed with Elon,” who “knew this bill better than anyone.” “Elon and I had a great relationship. I don’t know if we will anymore,” Trump added. Trump had hardly finished speaking whenMusk went on X, his social media network, to say “False, this bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it!”He went on to say that without him, “Trump would have lost the election.” Musk alsounfollowed Stephen Miller on X, as well asthe pundit Charlie Kirk. He retweeted old clips of himself saying that the federal deficit needed to come down, and put up a poll: “Is it time to create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle?” The poll is, as of this writing,pinned to Musk’s profile. “Yes” is in the lead with 83 percent of the votes. This is a reality-TV squabble playing out on social media Now, both of these men are excellent at commanding attention, and this is a reality-TV squabble playing out on social media. It is also deeply petty. But a government contractor, one whose business empire is extremely dependent on federal contracts, posting about the deficit is serving up a nice volley. Trump spiked it. “The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “I was always surprised Biden didn’t do it.” Trump also said he’d asked Musk to leave government, and Musk “just went CRAZY!” I would question the use of “went” in that sentence but sure. That’s a pretty actionable threat. (Alsojawboning, though at this point who’s keeping track?) It would probably fuck up what’s left of NASA in a pretty significant way, but whatever. Musk responded, “Go ahead, make my day.” Then,he posted, “Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public.” Musk hasalso dined with Epstein, and has beensubpoenaed for documents in an Epstein-related lawsuit. Then, just after the market closed,Musk posted, “In light of the President’s statement about cancellation of my government contracts, @SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately.” The SpaceX Dragon is used to fly cargo and crew to the International Space Station. Who’s winning? Well, Tesla stock declined 14 percent today, closing at $284.70. Trump can hurt Musk imminently, and not just with the spending bill. Musk,The Washington Postreported, began his career in the USby working here illegally. That could potentially complicate his naturalization and create grounds for the Trump government to strip him of his citizenship, and possibly even deport him back to South Africa. Would that be legal? It seems pretty clear that ICE doesn’t care. I wonder what kind of dirt they have on each other Musk, on the other hand, hasn’t sent that $100 million check, and may choose not to after this contretemps. He also has enough money to fund primary challenges all over the country, as well as engage in aggressive lobbying against the bill — or any future pet Trump project. If SpaceX contracts are canceled, that may strand some military satellites, too. As if that isn’t enough, the two of them have been thick as thieves for at least a year now. The current beef involves a lot of public information. (Trump wasknown to be pals with Epstein; Musk’s allegation that it’s why the files weren’t released is new.) I wonder what kind of dirt they have on each other from spending all that time together, and I wonder how much destruction that information could wreak. Meanwhile,Democrats on the House Oversight Committee are attempting to subpoenaMusk. Nancy Mace (R-SC)suspended the hearing to give Republicans time to arriveand vote against the subpoena. Should Trump demand it, it’s easy to imagine another vote happening — one that hauls Musk in front of Congress. Also, an alleged member of Musk’scoterie of baby mamashas chosen to weigh in on Twitter. Ashley St. Clair, who is currently engaged in a paternity suit with Musk,wrote on X, “hey @realDonaldTrump lmk if u need any breakup advice.” May is over, but it seems the meltdowns are just beginning. Right now, we’re watching two men with leverage over each other fight with vague threats and public information. But that fight just keeps escalating, and the stakes could not be higher.

    "article_text": "Customers who shop at Walmart stores in Atlanta, Charlotte, Houston, Orlando, and Tampa will soon have the ability to request a drone deliver their online shopping orders. Customers who shop at Walmart stores in Atlanta, Charlotte, Houston, Orlando, and Tampa will soon have the ability to request a drone deliver their online shopping orders. byAndrew J. Hawkins Wing, the drone company owned by Alphabet, and Walmart are expandingtheir delivery partnershipto five new cities in the US, the companies announced today. Customers who shop at Walmart stores in Atlanta, Charlotte, Houston, Orlando, and Tampa will soon have the ability to request a drone deliver their online shopping orders. Walmart and Wing currently offer drone delivery at approximately 15 stores in northwest Arkansas and Dallas-Fort Worth. Today’s announcement will bring an additional 100 stores into the fold. “As we look ahead, drone delivery will remain a key part of our commitment to redefining retail,” said Greg Cathey, SVP, Walmart U.S. Transformation and Innovation, in a statement. “We’re pushing the boundaries of convenience to better serve our customers, making shopping faster and easier than ever before.” Walmart has been working with a number of drone operators, but it seems to be most happy with its partnership with Wing. Since launching drone delivery in 2021, Walmart says it has completed more than 150,000 deliveries — sometimes within 30 minutes of the order being placed. There are a few restrictions: Customers must live within six miles of a store under FAA rules governing drone operations “beyond the visual line of sight.” An order needs to be under a certain weight to qualify for drone delivery, but Walmart says that covers everything from groceries to health and wellness products to household goods. Since launching drone delivery in 2021, Walmart says it has completed more than 150,000 deliveries Wing’s flagship drone is designed to handle payloads of up to 2.5 pounds,while its newer modelscan handle up to five pounds. The company says that it has enough battery power to complete 12 miles round trip while cruising at a top speed of 65 mph. The drones use tethers and grappling hooks to pick up and drop off small bags and cardboard boxes on customers’ front lawns. Wing says it has completed over 450,000 residential deliveries since its inception in 2012. Wing alsoconducts drone deliveries for DoorDashin Dallas and Charlotte, North Carolina. Wing is also thinking about other ways to improve the efficiency of its delivery network. It created a system thatenables its drones to dynamically take pickup and delivery jobs back to backwithout needing to report back to an originating base. This system includes the use of Autoloader stations, which are installed at retailers’ parking lots for employees to load a prepared order when ready. When a drone is available, it can lower a rope to grab it without anyone waiting around. Drone delivery companies claim that by shifting more deliveries to small electric multi-rotor aircraft, fewer polluting trucks will be needed for last-mile deliveries. It’s a similar pitch being made bysidewalk robot companies delivering takeout ordersto residents of Los Angeles and other cities.

    "title": "How to transfer your original Switch data to a Switch 2",
    "article_text": "There are multiple ways to get your data over to the new console. There are multiple ways to get your data over to the new console. byCameron Faulkner So, you got (or are soon getting) a Nintendo Switch 2. You’re probably ready to throw your original Switch into storage, but before that, you should transfer all of your data to the new console. Good news: it’s easy for those who have a Switch 2. Not only that, it’s easy even if you don’t yet have the new console. Nintendo developed a clever solution for those who haven’t upgrade yet, letting original Switch owners back up their entire account to a remote server, where it will be stored for one year. No matter your situation, here’s a step-by-step guide to transferring all of your data to the new console. This section assumes that you are in possession of a Switch 2. On the Switch 2, proceed with the initial setup dialog options until you get to theSystem Transferscreen. SelectStart System Transfer, then note that you’ll need to connect to the internet, and sign in to your Nintendo Account. On your original Switch, make sure it’s updated to the latest software version, then open theSettingsapp. From there, scroll toSystem, then selectSystem Transfer to Nintendo Switch 2. Make sure your consoles are nearby. At this point, you’ll be able to hitStart Downloadon the Switch 2. Once the data will be passed along, the Switch 2 will restart. Note: All users will be transferred from your Switch to the Switch 2. If you have users on your system that aren’t linked to a Nintendo Account, and/orgames that don’t support cloud save backups, they’ll transfer to the Switch 2, but cannot be transferred back to an original Switch. If you don’t yet have a Switch 2, this option is great because it lets you give away or sell your Switch before getting your hands on the new console. It’s equally simple to the method above (but it removesallof your Switch data upon completion, so keep that in mind). Navigate to theSettingsapp, then findSystem Transfer to Nintendo Switch 2, but select theI don’t have a Nintendo Switch 2 yetprompt when it appears. After you click that, you’ll be presented with a Download Deadline, which is the last day your data will be available to be pulled down from the server into a Nintendo Switch 2 before it’s deleted permanently. SelectUpload Data, and follow along with the prompts, eventually leading to the point where you’re finished, and your original Switch will wipe itself, removing all data and users. If you backed up your original Switch data to the cloud and now have a Switch 2, it’s easy to grab it from the remote server. For those who have just turned on their Switch 2, follow the on-screen prompts until you seeStart System Transfer. Connect to the internet, and so long as you’re signed in with the same Nintendo Account that transferred the original Switch data, that backup will show up. If you got a little excited and already completed the initial Switch 2 setup, in order to retrieve everything you backed up, you’ll need to completely reset the console again and retrieve the backup with the steps above. Great question, one that Nintendo has answered in great detail on thissupport page. In short, everything important, aside from custom controller button mappings and settings for Bluetooth, time, time zone, region, and language. All users will be transferred from your Switch to the Switch 2. If you have users on your system that aren’t linked to a Nintendo Account (from kids to friends and significant others) and/orgames that don’t support cloud save backups, they’ll transfer to the Switch 2, but they cannot be transferred back to an original Switch. Lastly, if you have a ton of games installed on your original Switch when you transfer data to the new console, it’s worth knowing thatallof those games will attempt to download on the Switch 2 (that may not be what you want if you’re trying to downloadMario Kart Worldor some other launch game first).

    "title": "Nervous Republicans flee Trump-Elon Musk blast radius",
    "article_text": "The bromance may be dead, but Republicans worry that an escalating feud between President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk could live on, leaving collateral damage in its wake for weeks, months or even years. The proximate cause is the centerpiece of Trump's agenda, the \"big, beautiful bill,\" which Musk is trashing publicly and privately. To try to kill the legislation, he has said he will spend money to oust Republican lawmakers who vote for it. “He does not give a f--- about Republicans or the RNC, or House seats, or whatever,” a Musk adviser said Thursday in the middle of a social media war between Trump and Musk, who had never aligned with the Republican Party until the last few years. The adviser was given anonymity to speak candidly about the blow-up. “He will blow them up; he will. ...  I mean, we already know Republicans are going to lose the House. Senate will likely be fine, but Elon does not give a s--- about that party stuff.\" Republican lawmakers care a lot — especially when it comes to their own congressional seats and chairmanships, which would be in danger if Musk tried to oust them from power in next year's midterm elections. In interviews with GOP lawmakers and operatives with ties to Congress, a clear theme emerged: Republicans should be scared of getting crosswise with either Trump or Musk — a tough task when they are slinging mud, insults and threats at each other. In short, other Republicans are like the kids caught between parents in the midst of a possibly brutal divorce. \"I'm staying out of it,\" said Rep. Don Bacon, who represents a competitive Nebraska district. \"There's a good verse in Proverbs: 'Stay out of fights.' I'm staying out of this one.\" But Trump allies are taking shots at Musk for his comments about Trump and even encouraging Trump to take action against him. \"People including myself are recommending to the president that he pull every contract associated with Elon Musk and that major investigations start immediately,\" said Steve Bannon, a White House adviser in Trump’s first term and a frequent critic of Musk. In particular, Bannon said, the South African-born Musk's immigration status, security clearance,reported drug abuse, relationship with China and \"involvement with attempting to get President Xi to the inauguration\" should all receive scrutiny. Perhaps it was inevitable that the Trump-Musk buddy-trip movie would end — how long can the world's most powerful man and its wealthiest man pretend that they aren't in competition? But few in Washington could have predicted that the resulting inferno would consume their professional and personal relationships so quickly. By Thursday afternoon, Musk was reposting a suggestion that Trump should be impeached. In the hours before that, Trump said he was \"very disappointed\" with Musk for turning on his signature legislation, which would cut taxes by $3.7 trillion over a decade and slash government spending by $1.3 trillion — leaving a $2.4 trillion deficit — over the same period. Musk and his allies bristled at the suggestion by Trump and White House officials that he was angry because the bill would kill tax benefits for electric vehicles, like those made by Musk’s Tesla company. Musk spent $275 million in the 2024 elections, mostly to help elect Trump, according to campaign finance records, and Trump rewarded him with a high-profile post as the face of the new Department of Government Efficiency. The role positioned Musk as the avatar of a push to cut the size and scope of the federal government — a role that turned him into a controversial figure as he appeared to revel in firing workers and closing agencies. At one point, Musk wielded a fake chain saw on a stage to illustrate his post as cutter-in-chief. That all came to an end last week when the two men held a chummy Oval Office news conference to announce Musk's departure from the government. But now, Trump says Musk was \"wearing thin\" as a special government employee and the featured player at DOGE. Trump said Thursday on Truth Social that the easiest way to cut more government spending would be to cancel federal subsidies for Musk's business ventures. Musk fired back by picking at a scab involving the Trump administration’swithholding of some documentsfrom its hyped release ofrecords pertaining to Jeffrey Epstein, a onetime associate of powerful figures — including Trump — who died in prison after being charged with sex-trafficking of minors. The Trump administration has released some new information from those records, but most of it has already been public. Musk posted that the \"Epstein files\" include Trump's name. Trump and Epstein knew each other, and Trump's name appeared on flight records for Epstein's plane, but Trump has never been implicated in Epstein’s abuse of underage girls. Musk also predicted the economy would be in recession by the second half of this year as a result of Trump's policies. Just a few months ago, Musk indicated he would put $100 million into political committees associated with Trump. That money never came — and now, it won't, the Musk adviser said. In addition, Republicans have to worry that vast sums will be used against them if they vote for Trump's bill. \"It’s gone,\" the Musk adviser said of the money once earmarked for Trump's use. \"He's going to go nuclear. He will support Democrats if needed; he absolutely will.\" Democrats watched Thursday's contretemps with glee. \"This is Christmas,\" a Democratic Party operative said in a text message. But even on a more substantive level, it gave some of Trump's adversaries hope that his agenda would sink under the weight of Musk's threats. “The most important thing that’s happening here is that Musk is killing this terrible bill. If he’s willing to do that, then welcome,” said Simon Rosenberg, a veteran Democratic operative. “This is doing enormous damage to Donald Trump. There is no version of this that is good for him. There is nothing here positive for Trump. He looks weak and feckless; he can’t control his buddy.” That's the view from the left. The view of a GOP operative close to the White House was that the episode underscores Trump's independence from Musk, adding a note of optimism that the fight would end with harmony. \"President Trump is the boss, and there can be only one boss. If anything, this deals a blow to the Democrats’ lame attempts to paint the president as a puppet of the world’s richest man,\" said the operative, who was given anonymity to speak candidly about the two powerful men. \"On the other hand, I could see them both back in the Oval bro-ing it up again in a month, as it may be just the art of the deal.\" Some GOP strategists said that the damage could be contained — but that it's not yet clear whether that will happen. \"It depends on how long it goes and how nasty it gets,\" said a former Trump campaign adviser who counts congressional candidates among his clients. Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., who chairs the House GOP's campaign arm and is in charge of protecting Republicans’ three-seat margin in the chamber, said he believes the rift will \"blow over.\" But asked whether he thought Trump and Musk would make up, he just shrugged his shoulders.",

    "title": "Judge temporarily blocks Trump effort to deny visas to Harvard students",
    "article_text": "A federal judge on Thursday temporarily blocked President Donald Trump'sefforts to block visas for foreign studentsplanning to attend Harvard, after the Ivy League college filed a legal challenge. U.S. District Court Judge Allison D. Burroughs granted a temporary restraining order that enjoins anyone from \"implementing, instituting, maintaining, enforcing, or giving force or effect to the Presidential Proclamation\" that Trump issued Wednesday. Harvard had earlier Thursday amended its complaint against the Trump administration to challenge Trump's proclamation that the president issued the day before. It would havedenied visas to foreign studentswho planned to enter the United States to study at Harvard, in his latest attack on the prominent university. Harvard President Alan M. Garber said Trump and his administration were retaliating against Harvard because it has refused the administration's demands, which included auditing viewpoints of the student body. “Singling out our institution for its enrollment of international students and its collaboration with other educational institutions around the world is yet another illegal step taken by the Administration to retaliate against Harvard,” Garbersaid in a letter to the campus community. Trump's Wednesday proclamation targeting Harvard followed an attempt by the Department of Homeland Security late last month to limit Harvard's ability to enroll foreign students by revoking its certification in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program,which was temporarily blocked by Burroughs. Burroughs on Thursday also extended the restraining order in that matter until June 20, or until a preliminary injunction order can be issued. In granting the restraining order blocking implementation of Trump's proclamation and the DHS effort, Burroughs wrote that she was acting \"to preserve the status quo pending a hearing.\" Trump's proclamation would not affect only incoming students. It says the State Department will review existing foreign students at Harvard under F, M or J visas to determine whether their visas should be revoked. Harvard said in its amended complaint that Wednesday's proclamation, as well as the previous attempt by the Department of Homeland Security to revoke its ability to enroll foreign students, violates its First Amendment rights. \"Each is part of a concerted and escalating campaign of retaliation by the government in clear retribution for Harvard’s exercising its First Amendment rights to reject the government’s demands to control Harvard’s governance, curriculum, and the 'ideology' of its faculty and students,\" the amended complaint reads. \"The government’s actions, moreover, have no basis in law,\" it reads. Harvard's amended complaint argues that the immigration law Trump's proclamation cites allows the president to prohibit \"a class of aliens whose entry would be 'detrimental to the interests of the United States'\" — and that Trump's proclamation does not suspend entry for a class, just people who want to attend Harvard. \"The President’s actions thus are not undertaken to protect the 'interests of the United States,' but instead to pursue a government vendetta against Harvard,\" it argues. Trump and his administration have targeted Harvard and claimed that it has not done enough to combat antisemitism on campus during demonstrations against the Israel-Hamas war. Harvard in April rejected Trump administration demands that included auditing viewpoints of the student body. In response, the federal governmentsaid it was freezing more than $2 billion in federal grants. Garber wrote in Thursday's letter that Harvard will defend its international students. The university said in the amended complaint that the attempts to target international students harms all of its students, because Harvard \"prepares them to contribute to and lead in our global society.\" \"International students and scholars make outstanding contributions inside and outside of our classrooms and laboratories, fulfilling our mission of excellence in countless ways,\" Garber wrote. \"We will celebrate them, support them, and defend their interests as we continue to assert our Constitutional rights.\"",

    "title": "UC Berkeley researchers team up for first-of-its-kind lawsuit over Trump funding cuts",
    "article_text": "BERKELEY, Calif. — University of California faculty members and researchers filed suit against President Donald Trump and several federal agencies late Wednesday in what they hope will become a first-of-its-kind class action challenging the administration’s sweeping cuts to research funding. The flurry of grant terminations has resulted in layoffs, the lawsuit states, and halted a variety of projects, ranging from studies on the effects of wildfire smoke to an effort to make all of Mark Twain’s work available to the public. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, is the brainchild of Claudia Polsky, founding director of the environmental law clinic at the University of California, Berkeley. Though she didn't face funding cuts herself, she said she felt inspired to organize colleagues — without any institutional backing — to file a suit that could have significant implications for other academics nationwide. “I really think the faculty are ultimately going to have to stand up for themselves,” said Polsky, who is also one of the attorneys on the case, along with UC Berkeley Law Dean Erwin Chemerinsky. The University of California system is squarely in the crosshairs of the Trump administration. Apart from cutting research grants it deemed unnecessary, the administration has accused UCof failing to adequately address antisemitism on its campuses. Late last month, Leo Terrell, a senior counsel at the Justice Department who leads the federal antisemitism task force investigating the UC system,told Fox Newsthere would be “massive lawsuits” against the UC system and other colleges. A UC system spokesperson said it is cooperating with the administration. “The University of California abhors antisemitism and is diligently working to address, counter and eradicate it in all its forms across the system.” The UC system, which has 10 campuses,conducts around 8%of all academic research in the country. The lawsuit was filed by five UC Berkeley staff members and one at UC San Francisco, all of whomrecently lost funding, according to the suit. It accuses a host of government agencies of disregarding federal regulations and violating the researchers’ free speech and due process rights by cutting funding for their studies based on questionable financial concerns or because of their subject matter and failing to follow legally required steps.",

    "title": "Michelle Obama looks to 'reclaim' her White House style with new book",
    "article_text": "Michelle Obama is giving fans a glimpse at “The Look,” her new book coming out in the fall. In the book, she reflects about how her appearance during her time in the White House was “constantly being dissected” and aims to “reclaim more of that story” for herself. The former first lady, whose memoir “Becoming” was a bestseller in 2018, announced onInstagramon June 5 that her new book will be released on November 4. “The Look” is her first book since her 2022 bestseller, “The Light We Carry.” “During our family’s time in the White House, the way I looked was constantly being dissected — what I wore, how my hair was styled,” she wrote. “For a while now, I’ve been wanting to reclaim more of that story, to share it in my own way. I’m thankful to be at a stage in life where I feel comfortable expressing myself freely — wearing what I love and doing what feels true to me. And I’m excited to share some of what I’ve learned along the way.” Obama, 61, wrote that “The Look” is “a reflection on my lifelong journey with fashion, hair and beauty.” “Inside, you’ll find some of the outfits that have meant the most to me, but more importantly, the moments that I lived through in them — big and small, personal and political, historic and ordinary — that were as memorable as the clothes themselves,” she continued. The former first lady is also sharing the stories of her stylist, makeup artist and hairstylists who helped shape her appearance during her time in the White House. “The Look is about more than fashion,” she wrote. “It’s about confidence. It’s about identity. It’s about the power of authenticity. My hope is that this book sparks conversation and reflection about the ways we see ourselves — and the way our society defines beauty.” Obama has also been opening up about her time as first lady and its aftermath on her podcast with her brother, “IMO with Michelle Obama and Craig Robinson,” and appearances on other podcasts. She has spoken about former President Barack Obama’sreaction to her mother’s deathand dealing withdivorce rumors, as well as having fun with Amy Poehler talking about the endless debate between partners regardingwhat temperature the thermostat should be set.",

    "title": "'Jane,' ex-girlfriend of Sean Combs, testifies feeling financially threatened into 'freak offs'",
    "article_text": "This is a free article forDiddy on Trialnewsletter subscribers.Sign upto get exclusive reporting and analysis throughout Sean Combs’ federal trial. A former girlfriend of Diddy’s took the stand today under the pseudonym“Jane”and testified thatthe music mogul pressured her to participate in drug-fueled sexual encounters known as “freak offs.” At first, Jane said, she and Diddy shared a loving relationship beginning in 2021, giving each other the nicknames Bert and Ernie. But after her first “freak off,” it became a “Pandora’s box” situation in which, she said, she had to oblige. The sex sessions could last between 24 and 30 hours with no sleep, Jane said. Diddy would arrange the “freak offs” around the world. As a single mother who came to depend on Diddy, “I felt an obligation because I knew he was paying my rent,” she testified. Known as “Victim-2” in the prosecution’s indictment, Jane is expected to testify over multiple days, presumably building on allegations that Diddy used his business empire as a criminal enterprise to fulfill his desires. Here’s who else testified today: 🔎 The view from inside By Adam Reiss, Chloe Melas, Jing Feng and Austin C. Mullen In a striking moment for the otherwise mild-manneredJudge Arun Subramanian, headmonished the defense teamafter Diddy apparently flashed facial expressions at jurors during Bongolan’s testimony. “There was a line of questioning where your client was nodding vigorously and looking at the jury,” Subramanian said, warning that if Diddy didn’t stop, “it could result in the exclusion of your client from the courtroom.” Diddy, in an oversize cream sweater and khaki pants, had been extremely engaged with his legal team all day, passing notes and conferring with his lawyers. In the morning, he waved and blew a kiss to his mother,Janice Combs, right after proceedings began. And when one of his lawyers made objections before the jury came in, he nodded in affirmation. In other news:There were audible gasps and laughter in the courtroom overflow room with members of the public during the cross-examination of Bongolan, as Westmoreland got the witness to repeatedly say, “I don’t remember.” Westmoreland showed her legal chops again today in her exchanges with Bongolan. Meanwhile, Jane’s taking the stand drew obvious interest from the media and spectators in the overflow room, with some wondering how someone so close to Diddy became a witness for the prosecution. 👨‍⚖️ Analysis: Look not guilty By Danny Cevallos Diddy was reprimanded for trying to connect with jurors. Generally, it’s OK for a defendant to react to testimony, but it should be subtle. A nod or a shake of the head is acceptable. But it’s also unwise. Defendants should not be showing much emotion at the defense table. It seems counterintuitive, right? After all, if you are on trial, and you believe you are innocent, wouldn’t you show emotion at all these “lies” being told about you? But for whatever reason, emotive defendants do not play well with juries. It’s a paradox: The jury is constantly watching the defendant, but the defendant shouldn’t actually do anything. A defense attorney once told me he advises his clients to “just sit there and looknot guilty.” But what does that mean? What it doesn’t mean is acting out. No muttering under the breath. No harrumphing. And, if Diddy is trying to make eye contact or otherwise connect with jurors, that’s crossing the line. It’s another example of a defendant trying to engage in self-help. And that’s almost always a bad idea. 🗓️ What’s next Tomorrow: Jane is expected to return to the stand for more questioning from prosecutors. PSA: Every night during Diddy’s trial, NBC’s “Dateline” will drop special episodes of the “True Crime Weekly” podcast to get you up to speed. “Dateline” correspondentAndrea Canningchats with NBC News’Chloe Melasand special guests — right in front of the courthouse.Listen here. 🎧",

    "article_text": "A Texas woman died from an infection caused by a brain-eating amoeba days after she cleaned her sinuses using tap water, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Preventioncase report. The woman, an otherwise healthy 71-year-old, developed \"severe neurologic symptoms,\" including fever, headache and an altered mental status, four days after she filled a nasal irrigation device with tap water from her RV's water system at a Texas campsite, the CDC report said. She was treated for primary amebic meningoencephalitis — a brain infection caused by Naegleria fowleri,often referred to as the\"brain-eating amoeba.\" Despite treatment, the woman experienced seizures and died from the infection eight days after she developed symptoms, the agency said. Lab tests confirmed the amoeba in the woman's cerebrospinal fluid, according to the report. The CDC said the infection usually occurs after \"recreational water activities\" but noted that cleaning sinuses with non-distilled water is also a risk factor for developing primary amebic meningoencephalitis. An investigation conducted by the agency found that the woman had not recently been exposed to fresh water but had performed the nasal irrigation using non-boiled water from the RV's potable water faucet \"on several occasions\" before her illness. The potable water tank, the investigation found, was filled before the woman bought the RV three months ago and could have contained contaminated water. The investigation also concluded that the municipal water system, which was connected to the potable water system and bypassed the tank, could have caused the contamination. The agency stressed the importance of using distilled, sterilized or boiled and cooled tap water when people perform nasal irrigation to reduce the risk of infection and illness.",

    "article_text": "Welcome to the online version ofFrom the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail. In today’s edition, we break down how President Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s feud burst into public view. Plus, Jonathan Allen sifts through the spin to provide a reality check on what the “big, beautiful bill” would actually do. Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here. — Adam Wollner The simmering tension between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk boiled over into a full-blown public brawl Thursday. Act I:After a series of social media posts from Musk in recent days trashing Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” the president offered his first response during an Oval Office meeting with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. “I’m very disappointed because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill,” Trump said of his former adviser. “I’m very disappointed in Elon. I’ve helped Elon a lot.” Trump suggested that Musk, the world’s richest man, was upset that the legislation cut out a tax credit meant to incentivize electric vehicle purchases. “Elon’s upset because we took the EV mandate, which was a lot of money for electric vehicles and they’re having a hard time with electric vehicles and they want us to pay billions of dollars in subsidy,” Trump said. “Elon knew this from the beginning.” Act II:Musk initially brushed off Trump’s criticism, posting “whatever” on X before firing off dozens of posts blasting the Republican bill and the president himself. “Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,” Musk said, referring to the hundreds of millions of dollars he spent on the last election. “Such ingratitude,” he added. Act III:Trump then fired back on Truth Social, claiming that Musk “went crazy” after the president “asked him to leave” his White House role. Trump also suggested the governmentcould sever ties with Musk’s companies, which have billions of dollars in federal contracts. Act IV:In response, Musk claimed that the president was in what are known as the “Epstein files” — a reference to a trove of documents and files spread across a number of investigations and lawsuits involving the late Jeffrey Epstein. The Justice Department earlier this yearreleased hundreds more pagesof documents related to the Epstein investigations. AlthoughTrump and Epstein knew each other, there have been no new revelations about their relationship in any of those files. Trump has never been implicated in Epstein’s abuse of underage girls. He denied any wrongdoing, saying in a post last year, “I was never on Epstein’s Plane, or at his ‘stupid’ Island.” Act V:Trump’slatest wordon the matter: “I don’t mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago.” Read more on the back-and-forth → Related:Tesla’s shares have fallen 16% since Musk began bashing Trump’s bill last week, and the stock remains about 33% lower than on Inauguration Day,Steve Kopack reports. As the Senate considers President Donald Trump’s “one big, beautiful bill” (or “OBBB”), there’s a lot of dubious rhetoric flying around and, in some cases, hitting the fan. It can be hard for voters to know what to believe. So, it’s worth assessing the purpose of the legislation, which the House has already passed a version of, and what it would actually do. The vehicle for the catchall measure is called budget reconciliation, a process created by Congress half a century ago to provide a fast track to bills that would bring spending and taxing into closer balance. That means it can’t be filibustered, so Republicans only need a bare majority to get it through the Senate. But over the years, Republicans and Democrats alike have perverted the intent of reconciliation, using the advantage of the fast track to blow ever bigger holes in the budget. That’s what OBBB would do,according to the Congressional Budget Office. The most obvious tell is that its enactment would require an increase in the legal cap on the national debt. If the debt were going down, there would be no need to raise the limit. Specifically, the House-passed bill would cut taxes by $3.7 trillion or so over a decade — largely by extending the rates that Trump and Congress put in place in 2017. At the same time, it would slash “mandatory” spending — the accounts that pay out based on eligibility for long-standing programs rather than through annual “discretionary” appropriations — by $1.3 trillion over a decade. The debt hole that’s left is about $2.4 trillion. The White House argues that the CBO’s bottom line is wrong because it wants congressional accountants to ignore the fact that current tax rates are set to expire. Instead, Trump’s team contends, the CBO should assume that current rates will be extended — like an athlete assuming his income will continue to flow in when his existing contract is up. If Congress does nothing, taxes will go back up, which would bring a burst of revenue at a cost to taxpayers. In his bid to defeat the measure, or at least rewrite it, Elon Musk has charged that it is full of “pork” — a term that, until he used it, was reserved for earmarks in the annual discretionary spending bills that are unaffected by OBBB. Calling the measure a “disgusting abomination,” Musk treats it as a spending bill. But while there are some increases in funding — primarily for the Defense Department and efforts to combat illegal immigration — the main provisions are focused on slashing taxes and federal programs, including Medicaid and food stamps. The debt comes from the fact that the bill would not cut spending nearly as much as it would reduce revenue. And that’s just arithmetic. That’s all From the Politics Desk for now.

    "title": "'Ghost networks' are harming patients, but attempts to eliminate them have fallen short",
    "article_text": "The clock started ticking when Michelle Mazzola’s son, Guy, was diagnosed with autism before his second birthday. Doctors told her the sooner Guy received therapy for his nonverbal communication and behavioral challenges, the better chance he had of reaching his full potential — and perhaps entering a kindergarten with neurotypical students. Like many parents, Mazzola hoped to find therapists who were covered by their insurance. So she consulted a directory of providers listed as “in-network” on her insurance company’s website. Mazzola spent two weeks calling providers on the list, but found no viable options. “Probably 50% of the time no one answered the phone or the phone number was wrong,” she said. “Then you would get people on the phone and they’d say, ‘Yeah, we have about a nine-month wait list.’” She had stumbled upon what’s informally known as a “ghost network” — a directory of providers that are largely unreachable, out of network or don’t accept new patients. Studies suggest it’s common to encounter these networks while looking for covered care. By prolonging the search for a provider, ghost networks can delay patients’ ability to get diagnosed and treated, or cause them to forgo care altogether. But regulatory efforts to force insurance companies to update their directories or penalize them for inaccurate provider information have fallen short, prompting some patients to turn to the courts. A class action lawsuitfiled last year on behalf of federal employees in New Yorkagainst Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield claims the company’s ghost networks amount to deceptive advertising by making people think they’re purchasing insurance with an extensive list of in-network providers. The suit further claims that inaccurate directories help insurance companies “evade the costs” of covering people’s care. It alleges that plaintiffs who could not rely on Anthem’s directory were forced to use out-of-network doctors, saddling them with thousands of dollars in extra costs. In moving to dismiss the case, Anthem has argued that federal law pre-empts the plaintiffs from suing as members of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. Mazzola, who lives in Connecticut and runs a construction company with her husband, is not a plaintiff in the suit. She estimated that she pays about $7,000 out of pocket each month for Guy’s care, even after appealing denied claims and getting reimbursed for some out-of-network costs. She believes she wouldn’t have to pay that sum if the providers in Anthem’s directory were available. “You take it at face value when you’re buying a plan that this is what I’m getting,” Mazzola said. “I would have gladly gone to any of those [in-network] providers if they actually were taking patients.” If you are dealing with bills that seem to be out of line or a denial of coverage, care or repairs, whether for health, home or auto, please email us atCostofdenial@nbcuni.com. A spokesperson for Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield said the company meets access requirements outlined under state law. “We also work hard to ensure that our provider directories are up-to-date and as accurate as possible, which requires a shared commitment from providers to update their information when there are any changes,” the spokesperson said. Anthem said its provider network offers most of the services Guy needs, but due to the specialized nature of those services, it can be challenging to get appointments immediately. The company said it reviewed the list of providers that Mazzola tried to contact and found five errors related to incorrect phone numbers or addresses, which it said it will work with providers to fix. NBC News reached out to 21 providers listed in Anthem’s network, and found 20 either didn’t take patients Guy’s age or had no availability for months. Anotherclass action lawsuit filed in Aprilon behalf of state and local employees in New York against Carelon Behavioral Health, which provides health care services through insurance plans, claims that ghost networks delayed plaintiffs’ access to mental health treatment. Carelon said it does not comment on pending litigation. The two class action suits are among the first to challenge insurance companies over ghost networks, said Steve Cohen, a lawyer at Pollock Cohen in New York who is representing the plaintiffs in both cases as well as Mazzola. “Patients are in need of help,” Cohen said. “They call provider after provider who are listed in this directory to get no answer, to be told it’s not a doctor’s office, to be told they don’t accept the insurance. It’s incredibly frustrating and often complicates getting medical care. It’s dangerous.” Mazzola’s experience is familiar to many, regardless of their insurance plan or health issue. “The vast majority of the time, a doctor’s information is not going to be correct,” said Dr. Neel Butala, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine who co-founded a company that uses artificial intelligence to help large health plans improve provider data. Butala reviewed physician directories from five large health insurers and found that 81% of entries had inconsistencies, such as address errors or the wrong specialty’s being listed for a physician. His findings were published inJAMA Network Open. A governmentreview of Medicare Advantage plansfound that the share of inaccurately listed provider locations ranged from nearly 5% to 93%, depending on the directory. Ghost networks can pose a particular challengeto finding mental health providers, many of whom have long patient waitlists or have stopped taking insurance. After havingcalled nearly 400 listed numbersfor mental health providers in New York, the state attorney general’s office found that 86% were ghost entries. Staffers on the Senate Finance Committee similarly contacted 120 mental health providers listed as in-network by Medicare Advantage plans and found thatghost entries made up more than 80%. “In my view, it’s a breach of contract for insurance companies to sell their plan for thousands of dollars each month while their product is unusable, unusable due to a ghost network,” Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.,said at a Senate hearingon mental health access in 2023. Anneliese Hanson, who was a network market manager at Cigna Behavioral Health until several years ago, said she felt pressure to make provider networks seem more robust to appeal to current or prospective members. “If our target was to have 100 autism specialists within a certain [geographic area], we would be working towards meeting that target on paper, rather than actually checking and ensuring that there were 100 autism providers,” Hanson said. A Cigna spokesperson said that it takes rigorous measures to ensure its directory is updated and accurate and that it has a dedicated team of specialists to help patients access behavioral care quickly and conveniently. In response to Hanson’s comments, the spokesperson said: “These untrue and inflammatory assertions have no basis in reality, neither back then nor today.” Cohen saidfederal and state standardsrequire insurance companies to offer an ample number of in-network health care providers within a defined distance of a patient’s home. Those requirements may encourage insurers to pad their directories, he said. But Butala pushed back on that idea: “I don’t think there’s any actually bad actors,” he said. “I think everyone wants to get this right.” Butala said there’s an incentive for insurance companies to put out the right information, since a bad member experience could cause them to lose customers. One explanation for ghost networks, he said, is that providers report doctors’ information in a way that’s conducive for billing, but isn’t necessarily accessible to patients. Insurers often receive data that’s difficult and time-intensive to comb through, he said. “I think it’s just a really hard problem to solve,” he said. Mazzola said she and her husband, also named Guy, have been fortunate enough to afford their son’s autism therapy so far. The younger Guy, now 2, is not speaking yet but has gotten better at making eye contact and using sign language to communicate words. But the Mazzolas still feel the insurance system didn’t work for them as promised. “You pay for insurance your whole life, hoping [a diagnosis] never happens, but when it does, that you can put your head on the pillow at night knowing they’re going to be there for you. And that just wasn’t the case,” Guy Mazzola said. Legal and medical experts say some protections against ghost networks exist but aren’t consistently enforced. Under the No Surprises Act, a federal law that took effect in January 2022, private health plans are required to verify and update their provider directoriesat least every 90 days. If members receive out-of-network care because the directory information was inaccurate, insurance companies must reimburse them for any costs that exceed the in-network price. Patients can also file complaints to state regulators, who have the authority to fine companies for directory errors. But aProPublica investigationlast year determined that such fines are rare. In an average year, insurance regulators issue fewer than a dozen fines for directory errors, the investigation found — and even then, the penalties are small. One solution that might reduce the prevalence of ghost networks is a centralized directory of providers that all health plans could refer to. But health policy experts see that as a long-term goal that would be difficult to implement. Butala said AI can help insurers scrub their directories for errors. “I don’t think health plans are skimping on throwing people at the problem,” he said. “I think they’ve been throwing too many people at the problem, and now they realize maybe AI can actually make it better.” But the Mazzolas also think insurance companies should be willing to pay more providers, so it’s not a challenge to offer services in-network. “I’m not anti-business. I’m not anti-profit, but there’s an ethical side of it, too,” Michelle Mazzola said. “Something needs to be done.”",

    "title": "GameStop investigating claims that some Nintendo Switch 2 screens were damaged with staples",
    "article_text": "Video game retailer GameStop said Thursday that it is investigating claims made by some customers that they received damaged Nintendo Switch 2 consoles. In multiple social media posts across X andReddit, some consumers reported an issue in which it appeared a GameStop in New York had stapled receipts to their Switch 2 packages and punctured the console screens. “GameStop stapled the receipt for me and my friends Switch 2s to the box, FML,”wrote X user Oadhan Lynch, sharing a series of pictures of the product after it had been opened. “Genuinely insane now I’m gonna have to wait 3 months for the restock. And yes we were there for the midnight release so I bet everyone in this line is gonna have this same issue.” GameStop is “investigating this as we speak and will make the customers whole,” a spokesperson for the retailer said in an email. By Thursday afternoon, Lynch, who didn’t respond to a request for comment,shared an update on Xthat the store had “made things right” by sourcing “around NY and NJ to provide replacements to everyone who this happened to.” Others who made similar claims on social media didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. The consumer reports, which appear to be regionally isolated, come as gamers continue to rush to get their hands on the coveted Nintendo console,which was released Thursday. The base device sells for $449.99, or gamers can shell out $499 for the console and the new Mario Kart World. Prices didn’t deter fans and gamers who waited in long lines at stores across the country. The original Switch was released eight years ago, and thehype for a new console has continued to growin recent years. But some vying to get the Switch 2 may have a longer wait than expected, withsome shortagesalready being reported just hours after the console’s official release. “We’ve been working really closely with our retail partners to ensure there’s ample supply for not only the launch weekend, but well beyond,” Nintendo President and COO Doug Bowser told CNBC at the midnight launch party for the product at Nintendo’s store in New York’s Rockefeller Center. Others online said their Walmart orders were canceled just hours before they were due to be delivered. Some said Targetwas still “preparing to ship” their orders. At the launch event, Bowser told CNBC that he encourages those who weren’t able to snag a Switch 2 during the preorder period to contact their local retailer, adding that the company is continuing to work with the stores “to replenish through that launch period and all the way into the holiday period.” In itssales forecast last month, Nintendo said it expects to sell 15 million units of the Switch 2 console in the fiscal year ending March 2026, CNBC reported. Those who were lucky enough to get the product on Day 1 of its launch appear enthusiastic about the new updates, which include a larger, crisper screen and Joy-Cons (controllers) that snap into the side of the screen.",

    "title": "'Biggest scandal in American history' or a 'distraction': A look at Trump's autopen claims",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump hasordered an investigationinto the Biden administration's use of an automatic signature pen, alleging thatJoe Bidenwasn't aware of many of his presidential orders and appointments. \"This conspiracy marks one of the most dangerous and concerning scandals in American history,\" Trump said in a memorandum Wednesday directing the probe. Biden denied the allegations, calling them \"ridiculous and false.\" “This is nothing more than a distraction by Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans who are working to push disastrous legislation that would cut essential programs like Medicaid and raise costs on American families, all to pay for tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy and big corporations,” Biden said in a statement Wednesday, referring tothe massive GOP billto advance Trump's agenda. Here's a look at what's known — and what isn't — about the allegations Trump has referred to onsocial mediaas \"the biggest scandal in American history,\"how they started and what might come next. An autopen is a device that replicates a person’s signature or writings. Variations of it have been around for centuries —Thomas Jeffersongot one in 1803 that he used to make copies of his correspondence. They’re often used for mass reproductions of signatures on items like diplomas, and there are now digital versions. They can, according to2005 guidancefrom the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel. “The President need not personally perform the physical act of affixing his signature to a bill he approves and decides to sign in order for the bill to become law,” the guidance said. “Rather, the President may sign a bill ... by directing a subordinate to affix the President’s signature to such a bill, for example by autopen.” They have. President George W. Bush — who had requested the guidance from the Justice Department — did not wind up using an autopen for official actions, but both Biden and President Barack Obama did while they were traveling. USA Todayreported in 2017 that Obama used an autopen to issue dozens of pardons the previous year while he was on vacation in Hawaii. Biden, meanwhile, signed a funding extension for federal aviation programs via autopen while he traveling to San Francisco in 2024,CNN reportedat the time. That’s unclear. There is no official record of Biden's using an autopen for official government business. Trump’s memorandum says, “The vast majority of Biden’s executive actions were signed using a mechanical signature pen, often called an autopen, as opposed to Biden’s own hand.” Trump has offered no evidence to support the claims. He has, but he maintains it wasn't for anything important. Speaking to reporters on Air Force One in March, Trump at first said that “I never use” an autopen before he acknowledged that he had. On Thursday, he said that \"I think it’s very disrespectful to people when they get an autopen signature\" but that he does use one to respond to letters. \"I'd like to do it myself,\" he said, but he added that he gets thousands of letters a week and it's \"not possible to do.\" Trump'smemo directs\"The Counsel to the President, in consultation with the Attorney General and the head of any other relevant executive department or agency (agency), shall investigate, to the extent permitted by law, whether certain individuals conspired to deceive the public about Biden’s mental state and unconstitutionally exercise the authorities and responsibilities of the President.\" It also orders a probe into \"the circumstances surrounding Biden’s supposed execution of numerous executive actions during his final years in office,\" including \"policy documents for which the autopen was used.\" Asked by NBC News whether he has any evidence that anything specific was signed without Biden’s knowledge or that someone in the Biden administration acting illegally, Trump said, “No, but I’ve uncovered, you know, the human mind.” “I was in a debate with the human mind, and I don't think he knew what the hell he was doing,” he said Thursday,referring to his debate with Biden last year. The Justice Department declined to comment when it was asked whether the investigation into the autopen issue is a criminal one. The White House counsel's office does not conduct criminal probes. The House Oversight Committeeis also investigatingRepublican allegations about Biden’s using the autopen. “Who was making the decisions? Who was authorizing his signature? Was it him?” committee chair James Comer, R-Ky., asked last month. The Justice Department guidance from 2005 hasn’t been directly challenged in court, but arulinglast yearinvolving presidential pardon powers lent some weight to the finding. A unanimous decision by a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said presidents don’t have to issue written or signed pardons for them to be implemented. “The plain language of the Constitution imposes no such limit, broadly providing that the President ‘shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.’ The constitutional text is thus silent as to any particular form the President’s clemency act must take to be effective,” the ruling said. While it's unclear how Trump came to seize on the allegations, right-wing media has focused on them for months, fueled in large part by astudy from the conservative Heritage Foundationthat accused the Biden administration of extensive autopen use, largely based on the timing of when Biden signed documents compared with when he was traveling. Some of the findings also came from an analysis of the signatures in the Federal Register. A National Archives spokesperson told the fact-checkingwebsite Snopes in March: “At the beginning of each administration, the White House sends a sample of the President’s signature to the Federal Register, which uses it to create the graphic image for all Presidential Documents published in the Federal Register.” Trump's memorandum doesn’t give any indication of what might result from the investigation. Trump has already revoked scores of Biden's executive actions — including about80 on his first dayin office — and he has suggested before that the use of an autopen could be used to challenge some of the pardons Biden issued. “The ‘Pardons’ that Sleepy Joe Biden gave to the Unselect Committee of Political Thugs, and many others, are hereby declared VOID, VACANT, AND OF NO FURTHER FORCE OR EFFECT, because of the fact that they were done by Autopen,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, referring to the pardons Biden gave to members of the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. There's no evidence that Biden wasn't aware of those pardons — he'd discussed the possibility he would sign off on them in a Jan. 8 interview withUSA Todayand later issued a lengthy statement explaining why he'd signed them. While theConstitution give the presidentunique powers to issue pardons, it makes no provision for subsequent presidents to rescind them. Jeffrey Crouch, a politics professor at American University and author of the book “The Presidential Pardon Power,” told NBC News in March that “Biden’s pardons are highly unlikely to be revoked somehow because of the apparent use of an autopen.” In his statement Wednesday, Biden said, “Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations. Any suggestion that I didn’t is ridiculous and false.\" Trump told reporters Thursday that \"I don't think Biden would know\" if he signed something.",

On Thursday, theirdisagreementsover the Republican mega-bill advancing most of Trump's biggest domestic policy priorities erupted into personal attacks, with the two men using their respective social media platforms to hurl insults. After Trump threatened on Truth Social to cut off billions of dollars in federal subsidies and contracts to Musk's companies, which include Tesla and SpaceX, Musk claimed — without evidence —  that Trump appears in government documents about convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. \"That is the real reason they have not been made public,\" Musk claimed. The White House declined to comment on Musk's accusation. Trump, Musk and now-Vice President JD Vance attend the 125th Army-Navy football game on Dec. 14, 2024 in Landover, Maryland. After the election and in the first months of the administration, Musk was often spotted at Trump's side.Kevin Dietsch/Getty Imageshide caption The blow up marks the end of an alliance between the president and the billionaire that lasted far longer than many observers expected. After donating to Democrats for years, Musk emerged in 2024 as thebiggest Republican political donor, pouring nearly $300 million into backing Trump. He quickly became one of the most visible members of the president's inner circle, appearing with Trump in the Oval Office, at Cabinet meetings, and leading the Department of Government Efficiency. In February, Muskposted on X: \"I love @realDonaldTrump as much as a straight man can love another man.\" Here's a quick history of the Trump-Musk relationship: Pre-2024Musk has said he voted for Democrats, including Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Joe Biden in 2020. He was critical of Trump in his first term andresigned from two advisory councilsafter the Trump administration pulled out of the Paris climate accord. In 2022,Trump called Muska \"b******* artist\" and claimed the billionaire had told him he voted for him.Musk hit backthat Trump was too told to run for office. \"I don't hate the man, but it's time for Trump to hang up his hat & sail into the sunset,\" he wrote. July 2024Musk endorsed Trumpafter the assassination attempt in Butler, Penn. \"I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery,\"Musk wrote on Xminutes after the shooting. Later in the month, Musk revealed he had created and was funding asuper PAC\"to promote the principles that made America great in the first place.\" He had previouslysaidhe wouldn't donate to either presidential candidate. He would go on to donate around$277 millionin the election cycle. August 2024Musk hosted aninterviewwith Trump on X. After lengthy technical delays, the conversation largely followed the contours of Trump's campaign speeches, and the two men both praised and talked past one another. Musk also took the opportunity to pitch Trump on a \"government efficiency commission,\" which the billionaire said he would join.

At the time it was not clear whether the entity would exist inside or outside the government. Musk and Ramaswamytook their pitch to Capitol Hill, proposing a 75% reduction in the federal workforce, a $2 trillion cut to federal spending and the elimination of entire agencies such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Ramaswamy left the project before Trump took office. January 2025Musk was one of several tech billionaires who attended Trump's inauguration.

His \"special government employee\" status meant he had a 130-working day clock. He quickly became the most visible face of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE — which, despite its name, is not an official congressionally-created federal department. Musk was the de facto leader of DOGE, even though the Trump administration repeatedly tried to argue in court that he was not.

Trump said he would bar Musk from any government work he believed might create a conflict. \"If we thought that, we would not let him do that segment or look in that area, if we thought there was a lack of transparency or a conflict of interest,\" Trump said.

These stories provide context for current developments and the history that led up to them. By Daniel Estrin , James Hider Israeli shelling hits an area in the northern of Gaza Strip as seen from southern Israel, Tuesday.Leo Correa/APhide caption Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that Israel is arming clans in the Gaza Strip to undermine Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that Israel has been fighting for almost 20 months. Netanyahu issued a video statement acknowledging that Israel had \"activated\" clans that oppose Hamas, saying the move would help save the lives of Israeli soldiers. The prime minister made the statement after Avigdor Lieberman, a right-wing lawmaker and former deputy prime minister who is opposed to Netanyahu, leaked the news that Israel was arming Palestinian factions in Gaza and warned that the weapons could eventually be turned on Israel's own troops, who are engaged in a large-scale offensive to take control of the coastal enclave and destroy Hamas. Liebermanclaimed in an interviewwith an Israeli broadcaster that the \"Israeli government is giving weapons to a group of criminals and felons identified with Islamic State, at the direction of the prime minister.\" NPR has been unable to substantiate the claim. Israelmedia identifiedone of the recipients of Israeli support as a gang led by Yasser Abu Shabab, who has been accused by the U.N. of looting its aid convoys last year in areas of Gaza controlled by Israel's military, But Abu Shabab has recently tried to rebrand himself as a militia leader opposed to Hamas and securing the delivery of food to Gazans, and has posted pictures of himself and his men armed and in uniform.

    "article_text": "By Greg Myre , Megan Pratz In this file photo from 2024, Taliban military helicopters fly to celebrate the third anniversary of Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan, at the Bagram Air Base, in Bagram, Parwan province on August 14, 2024. President Trump banned the arrival of Afghan nationals to the U.S. with exceptions for those who have special immigrant visas.Ahmad Sahel Arman/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption President Trumpenacted a travel banon citizens from a dozen countries Wednesday, including Afghanistan, where U.S. troops were stationed for nearly two decades. Even though the president's travel ban applies to Afghanistan, it does include an exception. Afghans who served with the U.S. during the war can still pursue what's known as a Special Immigrant Visa. Since the chaotic military withdrawal of U.S. troops in August of 2021, around 200,000 Afghans have resettled in the U.S., many under that visa program. In addition, more than 200,000 Afghans remain outside the U.S. while awaiting various stages of the application process, including many who worked with the Americans. These figures are from U.S. officials and private groups assisting Afghans who want to move to the U.S., including AfghanEvac, an advocacy group which maintains statistics on the number of Afghan nationals attempting resettlement. The president's proclamation also carves out exceptions for individuals already in the U.S. seeking asylum. While it does not address refugee resettlement, the U.S. has paused almost all refugee programs under another executive order. Many Afghans seeking SIVs and refugee status say they fear for their safety under Taliban rule in the country. Trump cited the need to address the threat of terrorism as the catalyst for the travel ban, with theWhite House fact sheetnoting specifically about Afghanistan: \"The Taliban, a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) group, controls Afghanistan. Afghanistan lacks a competent or cooperative central authority for issuing passports or civil documents and it does not have appropriate screening and vetting measures.\" The administration also cited visa overstay statistics in its reasoning for Afghanistan's inclusion. A separate program giving Afghan nationals temporary protected status in the U.S.expired in May, with final termination scheduled for July 14. In a news release at the time the end of that status was announced, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem stated: \"Afghanistan has had an improved security situation, and its stabilizing economy no longer prevent [Afghans] from returning to their home country.\" The release further explained that Noem \"determined that permitting Afghan nationals to remain temporarily in the United States is contrary to the national interest of the United States.\" The head of AfghanEvac, Navy veteran Shawn VanDiver, called the travel ban a \"betrayal.\" \"This ban does nothing to protect Americans. It punishes Afghan allies, family members, students, professionals, and humanitarian parolees—many of whom were already promised a pathway to safety,\" he said in a statement.

    "article_text": "By NPR Washington Desk President Trump meets in the Oval Office on June 5.Michael Kappeler/Pool/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption The feud between President Trump and his former adviser Elon Musk ramped up Thursday as the two lashed out at each other on social media. Musk — who for days has been blasting a GOP megabill advancing most of Trump's biggest domestic policy priorities — said that Trumpwould have lost the electionwithout his support, and called him ungrateful. ThenTrump postedthat \"the easiest way\" to save billions of dollars of government spending would be to \"terminate Elon's governmental subsidies and contracts.\" Musk is the CEO of companies that make electric cars and rockets. Musk, in turn, posted that Trump hadn't released all the records around sex offender Jeffrey Epstein because — according to Musk — Trump himself is implicated in those files. Musk did not provide any evidence of this, and Musk has in the past accused people of sex crimes without evidence. The White House had no immediate comment on Musk's post. The public feud seemed to drive a stake through what had been a big-money political bromance. Musk, who spent close to $300 million to elect Trump and became one of his closest advisers before leaving the administration last week,suggested it was time to start a new political party. The sniping was sparked by comments Trump made in the Oval Office earlier in the day when asked about Musk's criticism of the tax and spending bill. Trump said he was surprised that Musk had been scorching the package, but said he thought Musk was wrong and conflicted in his criticism. \"Elon and I had a great relationship. I don't know if we will anymore,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. \"He's worn that hat, 'Trump was right about everything' -- and I am right about the great big, beautiful, bill,\" Trump said. He said Musk \"knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody\" and \"never had a problem until right after he left.\" On X, Musk quickly countered, claiming \"this bill was never shown to me even once.\" Musk, who for months led the administration's government-slashing unit, hascalled the bill \"pork-filled\" and a \"disgusting abomination.\" \"In the entire history of civilization, there has never been legislation that both big and beautiful,\" Musk posted Thursday. \"Everyone knows this! Either you get a big and ugly bill or a slim and beautiful bill. Slim and beautiful is the way.\" Trump said he thought Musk was upset becausethe bill proposes to cut subsidies for electric vehicles, a policy that would affect his company Tesla, and because Trumppulled his nominee for NASAon Saturday. That pick, Jared Isaacman, had been recommended by Musk, and the nomination had cleared committee and was awaiting Senate confirmation. Isaacman is a friend of Musk, and his online payment company, Shift 4, has financial ties to SpaceX. On Thursday, Trump suggested he didn't think the relationship \"was appropriate.\" He noted that Musk had only had positive things to say uponleaving the Oval Office last week. \"You saw a man who was very happy when he stood behind the Oval desk. And even with the black eye — I said, 'You want a little makeup? We'll get you there to make up,' but he said, 'No, I don't think so.' Which is interesting and very nice. He wants to be who he is,\" Trump said. Trump said he thought that Musk missed being part of the action at the White House, and said he was similar to other former staffers who leave to become critics. \"They leave, and they wake up in the morning, and the glamor is gone. The whole world is different, and they become hostile, I don't know what it is,\" Trump said. Later, on his Truth Social social media platform, Trump sharpened his attack on Musk: \"Elon was 'wearing thin,' I asked him to leave, I took away his EV mandate … and he just went CRAZY,\"Trump posted. — Danielle Kurtzleben contributed to this story.

    "article_text": "Jasmine Garsd People place white carnation flowers on the fence of the Krome Detention Center during a vigil protesting US Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody and mass deportations in Miami on May 24, 2025.Giorgio Viera/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption The text message sent to NPR came in early May: In early May, NPR began receiving desperate messages from family members of detainees in Florida.Jasmine Garsd/NPRhide caption It was accompanied by a screenshot of a photo of a man with swollen red eyes, with another screenshot of his full detainee information. \"Please help me. Im desperate.\" The woman who sent it, Maria, was texting about her brother at the Krome Detention Center in Miami. She requested their last name be withheld for fear of retaliation against her brother, who has been held in detention for more than two months. She told NPR he had a fever, a serious eye infection for almost two weeks, and says he was denied medication for both. \"There are a lot of sick people there, and they aren't getting medical attention,\" she said in a phone interview. \"They are sleeping on the floor and sometimes don't get meals.\" Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis speaks during a May 1 press conference at the ICE-Enforcement and Removal Operation office in Miramar, Fla. DeSantis talked about an immigration enforcement effort called Operation Tidal Wave that officials say resulted in more than 1,100 arrests in a week in Florida.Joe Raedle/Getty Images/Getty Images North Americahide caption Florida has pledged to be a national model for state cooperation with President Trump's immigration crackdown. As detention centers here and across the country fill up, NPR has received an outpouring of messages about severe overcrowding and inhumane conditions in immigration facilities across the state. More than a dozen detainees, family members and lawyers described similar issues as Maria, including detainees underfed and in ill health. Krome,which is run by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, has been dogged for years by allegations of inhumane conditions andinvestigated by the Department of Justice in 2000on accusations of sexual abuse. This year alone, there have been two deaths at the facility: Ukrainian immigrantMaksym ChernayakandGenry Ruiz Guillenof Honduras. This morning, a group of Krome detainees assembled in the patio to form a human \"SOS\" sign. In a written statement, ICE told NPR that \"a group of detainees at the Krome Service Processing Center (Krome) decided to stage a peaceful sit-in in the center's recreation area. There has been no injuries or use of force of any kind during this demonstration.\" It added, \"U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is committed to ensuring that all those in the agency's custody reside in safe, secure, and humane environments under appropriate conditions of confinement.\" \"I had a client who was at Krome,\" says Miami based lawyer Jeff Botelho, who adds the client recently told him that \"they had been sleeping on the floor for a week or two. For food, he said they were given a cup of rice and a glass of water a day. It was very concerning.\" Lawyers, advocates and experts are warning that overcrowding is the new normal across the country. The federal government is holding more than 48,000 people in immigration detention, about a 20% increase since January. But deportations are not keeping pace. Experts say that's largely what's driving the overcrowding in detention centers. \"There's incredible pressure to ramp up arrests inside the interior of the United States,\" says Adam Isacson of the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA), a nonprofitimmigrant advocacy group. He estimates that ICE is at 125% detention capacity. \"And so far, there has been, if anything, just a slight increase in the capacity to actually deport people.\" ICE told NPR that \"some ICE facilities are experiencing temporary overcrowding due to recent increases in detention populations. We are actively implementing measures to manage capacity while maintaining compliance with federal standards and our commitment to humane treatment. The reality is that these accusations do not reflect ICE's policies or practices.\" The increase to nearly 50,000 detainees marks a sharp increase from the number of detentions during the Biden administration, which climbed to39,703 in January 2025. Syracuse Universityprofessor Austin Kocher, who tracks immigration statistics,notes that immigration arrest numbers are simply not made available by local or federal officials. ICE did not respond to NPR's questions about Florida's detention numbers so far this year. Deportation numbers are even trickier to come by. The government claims it has deported more than160,000 peoplesince Trump took office for a second term in January. Some experts are skeptical that those figures are accurate. \"Up until about three weeks ago or so, things were pretty consistent with what they were in terms of the end of the Biden Administration,\" saysTom Cartwright, who has been tracking deportation flights for years. \"Typically four to five deportation flights per day.\" But Cartwright says that number has increased in the last few weeks to six to seven flights a day, mostly to Central America. And while he has no way of knowing how many people are in each airplane, he calculates each plane has the capacity to carry between 120 and 150 people. At most, that's an estimated 1,050 people being deported every day out of the50,000or so who are detained. \"They're serving rotten food. People are getting sick. My spouse is not eating,\" J. told NPR in May. His loved one was being held at Glades County Detention Center in Moore Haven, Fla. He asked that we refer to him by his first initial because he fears retaliation against his loved one. J. is one of the many family members of detainees who called NPR toreport their loved ones not receiving meals or getting rotten food. Detainees who NPR spoke to over the phone confirmed this, and many said they'd had to sleep on the floor for weeks. The situation at Krome Detention Center is believed to have gotten so dire, Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz of Florida paida surprise visitthere last week. She told NPR that in the intake area, two to three dozen men are \"crammed into the perimeter of a very tiny room for up to 48 hours. They defecate in front of each other, they eat, they sleep on stone floors. It's really inhumane.\" Advocates say this situation is playing out nationally. \"We have seen a rapid deterioration over the last few months,\" says Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy director at the nonprofit advocacy group Detention Watch Network. \"We're hearing reports … that there isn't enough food.\" She says she's increasingly been hearing accounts from people in detention going hungry. \"I've heard people use the word 'starving.' \" There have beennine deaths in ICE detention since January, which is on track to be the deadliest yearsince 2020. At least three of those deaths have been in Florida. The Trump administration is promising to increase the rate of arrests of immigrants to 3,000 people a day. \"President Trump is going to keep pushing to get that number up higher each and every single day,\" White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller told Fox Newslast week. Miller was discussing the sweeping budget bill passed by the House and now before the Senate. It would provide $75 billion over the next couple of years in additional funding for ICE, including $45 billion for detention facilities and $14.4 billion for removal operations. \"We can have, permanently, the safest, strongest, most secure system in American history,\" Miller told the network. But immigrant advocates warn the measure will expand mass detention and surveillance. \"I think that it is not designed to increase the removals of people who are not legally allowed to be here,\" says Deborah Fleischaker, former acting chief of staff for ICE during the Biden administration. \"It is designed to hold more people for longer.\" Fleischaker believes ICE has historically been underfunded. But she says the bill as written \"is so significant and so extreme. What they're trying to enable … I don't think it is within the imagination of the American people when they voted for Donald Trump.\" Isacson of WOLA adds that the actions occurring now will multiply. \"Plainclothes people using rough tactics and covering their faces to take people off the streets and sort of muscle them into vehicles,\" he says. \"This is going to be common. And it's going to become much more common to see that all around the country military bases may have detention facilities.\" \"I am anguished. I have not heard anything about my son.\" Late in May, NPR began receiving messages from Vivian Ortega, a mother in Venezuela, regarding her son, Jhonkleiver Ortega. Jhonkleiver Ortega came to the U.S. three years ago and was working in construction. He was picked up while driving in November 2024 for not having a license, which under Florida state law is not available to immigrants without legal status. She told us she had sold her house in Venezuela to pay for his $7,000 bond in January. When he went to his next court hearing in February, he was detained. Vivian had heard from him infrequently, and she was terrified \"he was barely eating in there.\" Data trackers and policy experts say the Trump administration's goal of deporting one million migrants a year is so high that encouraging self-deportation is paramount. \"The fact that [detention] is often so unsafe and unhealthy leads me to believe that there's also a desire to wear people down,\" says Isacson. High-profile flights — with migrants sent to the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo, Cuba, and to El Salvador's notorious detention center CECOT and, more recently, a flight headed to South Sudan — have sent a strong message. For Vivian, the possibility was a source of constant anguish. On June 3, NPR was able to locate Jhonkleiver Ortega at Glades Detention Center in Florida. He had been to immigration court the day before. NPR was given permission by the family to record his conversation with his mother. \"They told me they had to review my asylum case,\" Ortega told his mother. \"They told me I have to send proof that I was tortured in Venezuela. And in four months they would give me an answer. And I said I can't anymore. It's been months of this. They barely feed us here. I can't anymore. I asked to be deported. This week or next I will be on a flight to Venezuela. If they give me a call from Louisiana I'll call you before the flight.\" \"What?\" his mother asks. \"I asked the judge what are the chances that my flight will get lost and accidentally end up in another country? And she said if that happens you call the deporter. Or email me.\" If you have immigration tips you can contact our tip line, on Whatsapp and Signal: 202-713-6697 or reporter Jasmine Garsd: jgarsd@npr.org Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Trump orders a probe into the Biden administration and its alleged autopen use",
    "article_text": "By Rachel Treisman Then-President Joe Biden and President-elect Trump arrive for Trump's inauguration ceremony in January. Trump said Wednesday he had commissioned an investigation into his predecessor's administration.Melina Mara/Pool/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption President Trump has ordered an investigation into whether President Joe Biden used an autopen to sign documents in office, a routine presidential practice that Trump alleges was part of a conspiracy by Biden aides to cover up his cognitive decline. On Wednesday, Trump signed apresidential memorandumtasking White House Counsel David Warrington, in consultation with Attorney General Pam Bondi, with investigating \"whether certain individuals conspired to deceive the public about Biden's mental state and unconstitutionally exercise the authorities and responsibilities of the President.\" In a statement shared with NPR, Biden stressed that he made the decisions about pardons, executive orders, legislation and proclamations during his presidency. \"Any suggestion that I didn't is ridiculous and false,\" Biden said. \"This is nothing more than a distraction by Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans who are working to push disastrous legislation that would cut essential programs like Medicaid andraise costs on American families, all to pay for tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy and big corporations.\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday that he had not uncovered any evidence that the documents were signed without Biden's approval, but said he thought the former president's dismal debate performance showed he wasn't in control. \"But I've uncovered, you know, the human mind,\" Trump said. \"I was in a debate with the human mind, and I didn't think he knew what the hell he was doing.\" Trump's investigation comes amidst a wave of renewed scrutiny into the mental and physical capacity of the former president, who announced a diagnosis ofaggressive prostate cancerlast month. Growing concerns about Biden's fitness for office forced him to call off his reelection campaign later that year. Last month also saw the publication — andheadline-making press tour— ofOriginal Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again,a book by CNN's Jake Tapper and Axios' Alex Thompson that chronicles Biden's cognitive decline in office and his aides' efforts to shield it from public view. Also in May, Axios published audio recordings of Biden's2023 interviews with Robert Hur, the special counsel who investigated Biden's handling of classified documents as vice president. Hur ultimately did not prosecute Biden, saying a jury would likely have viewed him as \"a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\" A 258-page transcript, released after Hur's February 2024 report, showed Biden struggling to recall key dates and details, which the newly released recordings reflect in long silences and prodding from aides. Bidenhas since saidthat reports of his cognitive decline \"are wrong.\" In his memorandum, Trump contrasted reports of Biden's \"cognitive deficiencies\" with his prolific policymaking, saying the Biden administration issued over 1,200 presidential documents, appointed 235 federal judges and signed a record number of pardons, including commuting the sentences of37 federal death row prisoners. Trump alleges without evidence that the \"vast majority\" of Biden's executive actions were signed with an autopen, which he says throws their validity into question. It is not clear whether Biden used an autopen— a machine that duplicates signatures using real ink — to sign documents or whether doing so would render any of his actions void, though legal experts have reason to doubt it would. Use of the device has been commonplace among presidents for decades — Trump himselfsaid in Marchthat he used it, albeit for \"only very unimportant papers.\" \"You know, we get thousands and thousands of letters, letters of support for young people, from people that aren't feeling well, etcetera,\" Trump told reporters on Air Force One. \"But to sign pardons and all of the things that he signed with an autopen is disgraceful.\" Legal experts, however, say the use of autopen has no bearing on the validity of pardons or legislation. The notion that Biden relied on the mechanical pens washeavily promotedby the Oversight Project, an arm of the Heritage Foundation that played a key role inpromoting false claimsabout noncitizen voting last year. It taps into a larger right-wing conspiracy that Biden wasn't actually in charge as president. Concerns aboutBiden's fitness for officeare not new — evenfrom Trump, who became the oldest president inaugurated when he began his second term at age 78. This isn't the first time Trump has called his predecessor's signatures — and authority — into question. In March, Trump wrote on social media that Biden's preemptive pardons of members of the House committee investigating Jan. 6 were \"hereby declared VOID, VACANT, AND OF NO FURTHER FORCE OF EFFECT, because of the fact that they were done by Autopen.\" But Jay Wexler, a professor of constitutional law at Boston University School of Law,told NPR at the timethat it's not clear the pardons could be rescinded for that or any other reason. Article II,Section 2 of the Constitutionsays the pardon only needs to be \"accepted by its subject\" to take effect — and does not mention anything about reversing them after the fact. Importantly, Wexler said, it does not require the pardon to be in writing whatsoever. \"The argument that the pardon fails because it was signed by an autopen fails at the get-go, because there's no requirement that the pardon even be signed,\" he explained, calling the issue a \"distraction\" and \"nonstarter.\" Presidents have long used autopens to sign correspondence and other documents. Thomas Jefferson was anenthusiastic early adopterof its precursor, the 19th-century polygraph, while Harry Truman and Gerald Ford are rumored to haveused modern-day devices, which hit the market after World War II. President Lyndon Johnson is credited with publicizing the practice by allowing photos of the device to be taken during his time in office. The result was a1968 National Enquirer coverstory headlined \"One of the Best Kept Secrets in Washington: The Robot that Sits in for the President.\" It wasn't until the 21st century that autopens were used for signing legislation, at least openly. President George W. Bushdidn't use the autopento sign bills, though his defense secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, wascriticized for using oneto sign hundreds ofcondolence lettersto families of troops killed in the Iraq War. Bush commissioned the Office of Legal Counsel to evaluate the constitutionality of signing a bill with an autopen. In a29-page documentpublished in 2005, the Justice Department concluded that the president \"need not personally perform the physical act of affixing his signature to a bill he approves and decides to sign in order for the bill to become law.\" \"Rather, the President may sign a bill ... by directing a subordinate to affix the President's signature to such a bill, for example by autopen,\" it reads, though it emphasizes that \"we are not suggesting that the President may delegate the decision to approve and sign a bill.\" President Barack Obama became the first known president to use an autopen for legislation when he signed a Patriot Act extensionwhile in France in 2011. He did so to sign several more bills over the years, includinga tax billwhile vacationing in Hawaii, an emergency spending billduring a 2014 visitto Indonesia and anextension of highway fundingfrom Malaysia. \"This is an issue that in the past had come up a couple times, but it had always come up in kind of urgent circumstances,\" former Deputy Attorney General Howard Nielsontold NPR in 2011. Nielson, who wrote the 2005 Justice Department memo, said that what matters is a president's decision to approve a bill, not the mechanics of how he signed it. He noted that theveto clausein the Constitution says, \"If he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it.\" The latter, he said, has \"never been understood that he actually has to physically walk down Pennsylvania Avenue and hand it to Congress himself.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "FBI Director Patel, a longtime bureau critic, begins to put his stamp on the agency",
    "article_text": "Ryan Lucas FBI Director Kash Patel speaks with Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum last month.Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption For years, Kash Patel was a fierce critic of the FBI and once even vowed to shut down its headquarters on Day 1 and turn it intoa museum of the \"deep state.\" Now, Patel is the director of the very FBI he long criticized. Since taking the helm more than 100 days ago, Patel has yet to shutter the Hoover headquarters building and reopen it as a museum. But he has begun trying to remake the bureau in ways large and small. He and his deputy,former Secret Service agent and right-wing podcaster Dan Bongino, have begun redeploying hundreds of agents and analysts out of the Washington, D.C., area to field offices across the country, while also shifting the FBI from some of its traditional law enforcement work to help with immigration enforcement. At the same time, senior FBI agents have been pushed out under the Trump administration, depriving the agency of decades of knowledge and expertise at a time when neither the FBI director nor deputy director has any experience at the bureau or running a major law enforcement agency. In a post on Xlast week, Bongino said he and Patel will soon have \"most of our incoming reform teams in place.\" \"The hiring process can take a little bit of time, but we are approaching that finish line,\" he said. \"This will help us both in doubling down on our reform agenda.\" The enormity of the task before them — leading a 35,000-strong agency that investigates everything from foreign spies and terrorists to hackers, bank robbers and white collar criminals — appears to be settling in. \"We come in in the morning, there's a portfolio of 100 level 10 items. If it's a level nine, which is a pretty big frickin' deal, someone else fixed it,\" Bongino told Fox's Maria Bartiromo in a joint sit-down interview with Patel last month. \"The only thing that gets to my desk or his is a level 10. That's the entire day.\" In that same interview, Patel said his priorities for the bureau were crushing violent crime, defending the homeland, rigorous constitutional accountability and aggressive constitutional oversight with Congress. He also has promised a \"wave of transparency,\" including on the investigation into possible ties between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia and the death of disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. Dan Bongino, now serving as FBI deputy director, photographed in Stuart, Fla., in 2021.Calla Kessler/The Washington Post via Getty Imageshide caption Before he became director, Patel frequently said he wanted to put more FBI employees out in the field. Now that he's in charge, he has begun doing so. The bureau has started transferring people out of the Washington, D.C., area and redeploying them around the country. Patel has said the goal is to move around 1,500 people, which he says would be about 10% of the total number of FBI employees in the D.C. area. Some of those people are being sent to the FBI's large campus in Huntsville, Ala., while others are heading to FBI offices across the country. \"We need some of those field operatives out in the field. We need some of those intelligence analysts out in the field,\" Patel told Congress last month. \"We need their expertise in your states, in your counties, in your towns because the threat to this country in 2025 is everywhere, and we cannot quarterback that mission from Washington, D.C., alone.\" NPR spoke with several current and former FBI officials for this story. Two of the former senior officials were generally supportive of this plan. They said the idea has been under consideration for a long time because headquarters had grown too large and cumbersome over the past 20-plus years. Patel has repeatedly called violent crime a top FBI priority, although former officials say the bureau for decades has been focused on combating the problem. Instead, the main change appears to be a shift to immigration enforcement, which is not a traditional FBI mission. Most field offices are now working on immigration enforcement, current and former officials say, and leadership is pushing to do it seven days a week. There are concerns about potential ripple effects from pouring resources into immigration. Two former senior FBI officials noted the bureau only has a finite amount of resources, and if agents and analysts are being put on immigration, they're being taken off of their regular mission, things like counterintelligence or counter-terrorism. The former officials spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. A spokesman for the FBI, Ben Williamson, said the agency does not comment on specific personnel decisions. But he added that the bureau's \"agents and support staff are dedicated professionals working around the clock to defend the homeland and crush violent crime — a mission which certainly overlaps with the consequences of the previous administration's open border policies for four years.\" \"We are proud to work with our interagency partners to keep the American people safe,\" he said. While the FBI is throwing resources at immigration enforcement, current and former officials say the new leadership has has shifted focus away from investigating white collar crime. The bureau, they say, has disbanded the premier public corruption squad, which investigates public officials and was run out of the Washington Field Office. The group was involved in the investigations of Trump. One of the former senior FBI officials called the decision \"baffling,\" adding that the FBI is the only federal agency that investigates public corruption, so if it's not doing it — then nobody is. Another former senior FBI official said the message from these moves is clear: Public corruption is not a worthy investment of an agent's time. This also follows the Justice Department's gutting of thePublic Integrity Section,which prosecutes corruption including criminal conflicts of interest and people who profit from their government positions. Bongino, meanwhile, has saidthe bureau will pour resources into three specific investigationsinto what he called \"cases of potential public corruption\" — the pipe bombs found near the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021; the small bag of cocaine found at the White House in 2023; and the leak of the Supreme Court'sDobbsdecision that overturnedRoe v. Wade. Bongino has in the past alleged on his podcast that the pipe bombs were \"an inside job\" and that the FBI knows who planted them. None of those cases appear directly related to Patel's top priority of crushing violent crime, but they were investigated — although not all by the FBI — during the Biden administration.

    "title": "Senate response to White House budget for NASA: Keep SLS, nix science",
    "article_text": "Gateway is back, baby. Negotiations over the US federal budget for fiscal year 2026 are in the beginning stages, but when it comes to space, the fault lines are already solidifying in the Senate. The Trump White House released its budget request last Friday, and this includeddetailed informationabout its plans for NASA. On Thursday, just days later, the US Senate shot back with its own budget priorities for the space agency. The US budget process is complicated and somewhat broken in recent years, as Congress has failed to pass a budget on time. So, we are probably at least several months away from seeing a final fiscal year 2026 budget from Congress. But we got our first glimpse of the Senate's thinking when the chair of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) released his \"legislative directives\" for NASA on Thursday These specific directives concern \"reconciliation\" for the current budget year, which are supplemental appropriations for NASA and other federal agencies under the purview of Cruz's committee. And this committee does not actually write the budget; that's left to appropriations committees in the House and Senate. However, Cruz is one of the most important voices in the US Senate on space policy, and the directives released Thursday indicate where he intends to line up on NASA during the upcoming budget fights. Here is how his budget ideas align with the White House priorities in three key areas: This legislation, the committee said in a messaging document, \"Dedicates almost $10 billion to win the new space race with China and ensure America dominates space. Makes targeted, critical investments in Mars-forward technology, Artemis Missions and Moon to Mars program, and the International Space Station.\" The reality is that it signals that Republicans in the US Senate are not particularly interested in sending humans to Mars, probably are OK with the majority of cuts to science programs at NASA, and want to keep the status quo on Artemis, including the Space Launch System rocket. It is difficult to forecast where US space policy will go from here. Thevery public breakupbetween President Trump and SpaceX founder Elon Musk on Thursday significantly complicates the equation. At one point, Trump and Musk were both championing sending humans to Mars, but Musk is gone from the administration, and Trump may abandon that idea due to their rift. For what it's worth, a political appointee in NASA Communications said on Thursday that the president's vision for space—Trump spoke of landing humans on Mars frequently during his campaign speeches—will continue to be implemented. \"NASA will continue to execute upon the President’s vision for the future of space,\" NASA's press secretary, Bethany Stevens,said on X. \"We will continue to work with our industry partners to ensure the President’s objectives in space are met.\" Congress, it seems, may be heading in a different direction.

    "title": "Discord CTO says he’s “constantly bringing up enshittification” during meetings",
    "article_text": "\"It's not a bad thing to build a strong business and to monetize a product.\" Discord members are biting their nails. As reports swirl that the social media companyis planning an initial public offeringthis year and increasingly leans on advertising revenue, there's fear that Discord will become engulfed in theenshittificationthat has already scarred so many online communities. Co-founder and CTO Stanislav Vishnevskiy claims he's worried about that, too. In an interview withEngadgetpublished today, Vishnevskiy claimed that Discord employees regularly discuss concerns about Discord going astray and angering users. \"I understand the anxiety and concern,\" Vishnevskiy said. \"I think the things that people are afraid of are what separate a great, long-term focused company from just any other company.\" But there are reasons for long-time Discord users to worry about the platform changing for the worse in the coming years. The most obvious one is Discord's foray into ads, something the company has avoided since launching in 2015. Discordstarted showing adsin March 2024 via its desktop and console apps. Since then, it has introducedvideo ads to its mobile appandlaunched Orbs, which Discord users can earn by clicking on ads in Discord and trade for in-game rewards. Discord also recently said that it plans to start selling ads to more companies. Fanning expectations ofDiscord going publicsoon and looking different in the future, Discord co-founder and CEO Jason Citron left in April. His replacement, Humam Sakhnini, has experience leading public companies, like Activision Blizzard. When Citron announced his departure in April,GamesBeatasked him if Discord was going public. Citron claimed there were \"no specific plans\" but added that \"hiring someone like Humam is a step in that direction.” Vishnevskiy declined to comment on a potential Discord IPO while speaking to Engadget. Amid current and imminent changes, though, Vishnevskiy claims to be eyeing Discord'senshittification risk, telling Engadget: I'm definitely the one who's constantly bringing up enshittification [at internal meetings]. It's not a bad thing to build a strong business and to monetize a product. That's how we can reinvest and continue to make things better. But we have to be extremely thoughtful about how we do that. For some, the inclusion of ads is automatic enshittification. However, Discord's ad load, at least for now, is minimally intrusive. The ads appear in sidebars within the platform that expand only if clicked upon and can lead to user rewards. Another hope for Discord comes from a history that shows it has a willingness to back away from changes that prove unpopular with its user base. For example, in 2021, it backpedaled on ideas for Discord crypto wallet appsshared byco-founder and then-CEO Citron. \"It was about allowing people to use Discord in a certain way, and that came with a lot of downsides,\" Vishnevskiy said in Engadget's article today. \"We were trying to do some integrations to limit some scams, and actually do right by users, and make people safer. But we really underestimated the sensitivity the general user base had to the topic of NFTs, and we did not do a really good job at explaining what we were trying to do.\" In September 2019, Discord shuttereda games storethat it had launched in October 2018. A Discordblog postexplained that “the vast majority of Nitro [premium] subscribers didn’t play” the games. “We spent a year building that component of our business and then, quite frankly, we quickly knew it wasn't going well,” Vishnevskiy told Engadget. Per Vishnevskiy, experiences like these reaffirmed Discord’s gaming focus, and Discord plans to concentrate on gaming-centric business efforts, like Nitro subscriptions, moving forward. The executive said that the company has abandoned AI features that “did not work well enough.\" It alsoscrapped Clyde, a chatbot based on OpenAI models. Naturally, Vishnevskiy argued that some of Discord’s shift to advertising aligns with gaming interests. The executive pointed to Orbs as something that unifies gamer and developer interests. Still not convinced that Discord will avoid enshittification? In the interest of wishful thinking, here are three exemplary tech companies to remind you thatunshittification is still possible.

    "title": "What would happen if Trump retaliated against Musk’s companies?",
    "article_text": "\"I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it!\" A remarkable schoolyard brawl erupted online Thursday between President Donald Trump and his former \"First Buddy\" Elon Musk during which the pair traded insults and barbs. The war of words reached a crescendo during the afternoon when Trump threatened Musk's federal contracts. \"The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it!\"Trump wroteon his social media network, Truth Social, at 2:37 pm ET. Anyone with a reasonable grasp of reality understood that the \"bromance\" between the president of the United States and the most wealthy person in the world was going to blow up at some point, but even so, the online brouhaha that has played out Thursday is spectacular—at one pointMusk suggestedthat Trump was in the Epstein files, for goodness' sake. Much of what was said Thursday is almost certainly rhetoric, but it is perhaps worth taking a moment to step back to analyze what would happen if the federal government did terminate contracts and subsidies with Musk's largest and most valuable companies, SpaceX and Tesla. Update, 4:20pm ET:Musk has escalated even further, saying on Twitter that, \"In light of the President's statement about cancellation of my government contracts, SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately.\" Musk's space company is presently NASA's most essential contractor. With the Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft, SpaceX provides the space agency's only operational transportation for crew members to the International Space Station. Additionally, when Northrop Grumman's Cygnus spacecraft was damaged in transit earlier this year, it left SpaceX as the only provider of cargo services to the space station for more than half a year. If NASA were to terminate its contracts with SpaceX, it would effectively mean the end of the International Space Station. The problem with this is thatSpaceX also holds the contractto safely de-orbit the space station, which is currently due to occur in 2030. With a mass of more than 400 metric tons, the space station will be the largest human-made object ever to return to Earth and could cause substantial damage in populated areas if not safely de-orbited into a remote part of the Pacific Ocean. SpaceX also is on the critical path of NASA's program to return humans to the Moon, Artemis. NASA has contracted with SpaceX to use its developmental Starship vehicle as a lunar lander, taking crew down to the surface and bringing them back up to lunar orbit. Although it is true that NASA has also awarded Blue Origin a contract for the same service, it is unlikely that Blue Origin's human lander will be complete for seven to 10 years. This means that if NASA wants to have any chance of beating China back to the Moon, it needs SpaceX to deliver. For the US military, SpaceX is one of two main contractors that delivers national security payloads into orbit. However, the other provider, United Launch Alliance, has had difficulty getting its new rocket, Vulcan, through the certification process. This has led the US Space Force to begin moving missions from Vulcan to SpaceX's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets. Given SpaceX's reliability and responsiveness, the military has decided to award a majority of future launch contracts to the company. SpaceX's Starlink Internet service has also provided essential communications to the military, which was so enamored with the service that it haspurchased a proprietary versionof the satellites under the \"Starshield\" brand for its future satellite communications needs. The reason that Biden did not terminate these contracts, as Trump asserts he might well have, is because SpaceX has generally provided space services to the US government at a lower cost and on a faster timeline than its competitors. Were the Trump administration to sever its relationship with SpaceX, it would effectively set the US space enterprise back a decade or more and give China's ascendant space program clear supremacy on the world stage. Although Tesla has received federal contracts over the years, these have mostly been rather small, considering the company's size—less than $42 millionbetween 2008 and 2024. But federal subsidies are far more important to the carmaker.The IRS clean vehicle tax creditprovides up to $7,500 off the purchase price of a new EV for many buyers, and all new leased Teslas are eligible for a $7,500 commercial clean vehicle tax credit. Other tax credits exist for solar and Powerwall customers. Additionally, Tesla has benefited extensively from selling emissions credits to other automakers, although California's \"Zero Emissions Vehicles\" program and the European Union are also sources of these credits in addition to the federal government. If the Trump administration really wanted to hurt Musk's companies, it might be more effective to do so through regulatory agencies rather than terminating contracts that, by and large, benefit the US government. For example, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration could put the screws to Tesla's efforts to develop Full Self Driving and Autopilot features in its vehicles. And the Federal Aviation Administration could stall SpaceX's ambitious Starship program and prevent further expansion of its launch facilities. Regardless of what actions the Trump administration could take to harm Tesla, shares of the EV maker are suffering. As of this writing, the share price is down nearly 15 percent since the market opened. With Trump's willingness to use the vast power of the federal government for his own whims, there really is no end to the ways in which he could harm Musk. But some of these measures would also do some self-harm to the country. Would Trump care? Will there be a rapprochement? As Musk likes to say about Starship launches, \"Excitement guaranteed.\" Ars automotive editor Jonathan Gitlin contributed to this report. This post was updated on June 5 to add comments from Musk about decommissioning the Dragon spacecraft. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Google’s new Gemini 2.5 Pro release aims to fix past “regressions” in the model",
    "article_text": "Google expects this version to roll out in the Gemini app soon. It seems like hardly a day goes by anymore without a new version of Google's Gemini AI landing, and sure enough, Google is rolling out a major update to its most powerful 2.5 Pro model. This release is aimed at fixing some problems that cropped up in an earlier Gemini Pro update, and the word is, this version will become a stable release that comes to the Gemini app for everyone to use. The previous Gemini 2.5 Pro release, known as the I/O Edition, or simply 05-06, was focused on coding upgrades.Google claimsthe new version is even better at generating code, with a new high score of 82.2 percent in the Aider Polyglot test. That beats the best from OpenAI, Anthropic, and DeepSeek by a comfortable margin. While the general-purpose Gemini 2.5 Flash hasleft preview, the Pro version is lagging behind. In fact, the last several updates have attracted some valid criticism of 2.5 Pro's performance outside of coding tasks since thebig 03-25 update. Google's Logan Kilpatricksaysthe team has taken that feedback to heart and that the new model \"closes [the] gap on 03-25 regressions.\" For example, users will supposedly see more creativity with better formatting of responses. Kilpatrick also notes that the 06-05 release now supports configurable thinking budgets for developers, and the team expects this build to become a \"long term stable release.\" So, Gemini 2.5 Pro should finally drop its \"Preview\" disclaimer when this version rolls out to the consumer-facing app and web interface in the coming weeks. Credit:\n\n          \n          Google Google is very interested in the vibes of its models, so it often leans on the ratings from LMArena and WebDevArena. These platforms have users compare model outputs side by side to rate the outputs before revealing what they are. Gemini 2.5 debuted earlier this year with a top score on LMArena, suggesting people like its outputs more than every other large language model. Again, Google is crowing about being at the top of the heap, with a 24-point Elo score increase on LMArena and a jump of 35 Elo points on WebDevArena. Google was already in the top slot on both leaderboards, so it has just increased its lead with the latest Gemini Pro. In our testing, the new model makes a greater effort to use coherent formatting in the output.

    "title": "Nvidia RTX 5060/5060 Ti review: You can have “affordable” or “future-proof.” Pick one.",
    "article_text": "An OK, but uninspiring, end to the 50-series rollout for mid-range gaming PCs. When it comes to Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5060 graphics card, the GPU itself is less interesting than the storm Nvidia stirred up by trying to earn it better reviews. If you don’t follow the twists and turns of graphics card launch metanarratives, allow me to recap the company's behavior for you. Though the RTX 5060 launched on May 19, Nvidia and its partners were uncharacteristically slow to ship graphics cards to reviewers. For outlets that received pre-launch hardware, Nvidia didn’t provide the pre-launch drivers that it usually sends out so that reviewers could run their own tests on the cards, informing reviewers on a call that drivers would be available to them and the public on the 19th. Except! Nvidiadidoffer advance drivers to a handful of publications on the condition that they run a few benchmarks that had been pre-selected by Nvidia and that they only report numbers from tests performed with the 50-series new DLSS Multi-Frame Generation (MFG) setting enabled. As we've already seen in multiple Nvidia press decks, the company loves to compare these DLSS MFG-inflated numbers to natively rendered frame rates from other graphics cards, because it helps make an otherwise mostly ho-hum refresh look like a much bigger performance boost than it is. This is where Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's spurious claim that the RTX 5070 provides \"4090 performance at $549\" comes from. To try to strong-arm reviewers into presenting this same misleading data—DLSS MFG can be useful in some situations, but it's hardly a perfect solution for poor performance—is just to reinforce the impression that Nvidia is abusing its dominant position in the gaming GPU market (even as gaming GPUs make up a smaller and smaller piece of the company's revenue). It's a whole lot of commotion for a GPU that is otherwise about as ho-hum as it is possible to be. It's a noticeable but unexciting upgrade over its predecessor, and it performs a lot like a more-efficient RTX 3070 for $200 less (theoretically) than that card's original MSRP. But it's getting harder to justify spending that kind of money on a GPU with just 8GB of RAM these days, especially when the GPU would be capable of decent 1440p performance if it had enough memory. Nvidia's cheapest card that will give you more than 8GB of RAM is the 16GB version of the RTX 5060 Ti, which is supposed to start at $429 but sells for closer to $500 right now. Both the RTX 5060 and 5060 Ti use the same GPU silicon based on Nvidia's Blackwell architecture; the 5060 Ti uses a fully enabled version of the GB206 die with 4,608 CUDA cores, a roughly 6 percent increase from the 4060 Ti. The 5060 uses a partially disabled version with 3,840 CUDA cores, a much larger 25 percent increase from the RTX 4060. The boost in computing resources is augmented with the memory bandwidth boost that comes from switching from GDDR6 to GDDR7. This shift increases power consumption a bit (as does adding CUDA cores without making significant changes to the 5nm TSMC manufacturing process, used across both the 40- and 50-series cards), but it also improves memory bandwidth by over 50 percent despite sticking with a relatively narrow 128-bit memory bus. Nvidia doesn't have Founders Edition cards for either the 5060 Ti or 5060, leaving the work of building and distributing these GPUs to its board partners. We have a total of three cards here—a Gigabyte Aero RTX 5060, an Asus Prime RTX 5060, and an Asus TUF Gaming version of the 5060 Ti with 16GB of RAM. Different manufacturers will build their cards in slightly different ways, but it's worth noting that both 5060 cards use a shorter PCB than the 5060 Ti, and both also get by with a single 8-pin power connector, while the 5060 Ti uses the 12-pin 12VHPWR/12V-2x6 connector. Make sure you get a version with the connectors you have and/or want. Our GPU testbed is the same as it's been since January, powered by an eight-core Ryzen 7 9800X3D and Windows 11 24H2. At some point, when both Nvidia's and AMD's drivers have had a few months to mature, we'll re-test all the current-generation stuff with the same drivers to clean up that part of the table a bit. But that point is not today. These are slightly reorganized versions of the charts we just published inour review of AMD's 16GB version of the RX 9060 XT. The two Nvidia cards generally flank the 9060 XT on either side, with the 8GB RTX 5060 falling a bit short of its performance for a little less money and the 16GB version of the RTX 5060 Ti performing a little faster for quite a bit more money. We didn't have the 8GB version of the 5060 Ti or the 9060 XT to test, but you can look at the difference between the 16GB RX 7600 XT and the 8GB RX 7600 to get a rough idea of which games in our test suite struggle with 8GB of RAM. Taken purely on its own terms, the 5060 is a decent generational upgrade over 2023's RTX 4060, generally offering between 10 percent and 25 percent more performance at 1080p and between 20 and 40 percent (and occasionally more) at 1440p, for what is supposed to be the same retail price. Both 4060 cards were a bit starved for memory bandwidth, so it's not too surprising to see it improve disproportionately at 1440p—at least for games where the improved memory bandwidth doesn't run headlong into that 8GB RAM limit. Evidence of RAM limitations showed up even in our test suite of slightly older games at 1440p—Black Myth Wukongin Cinematic mode slows down to a flipbook on the 5060 over the course of a run, despite running OK on the 4060. If you're fine to stick to 1080p, you should still be able to run most things, but the performance improvement over the 4060 is also slightly less impressive at 1080p. The 16GB version 5060 Ti helps solve that problem, and it runs somewhere between 15 and 20 percent faster than the 5060 at 1440p. But that's a 15 to 20 percent performance increase for 44 percent more money at MSRP (I know graphics cards don't really sell for MSRP these days, but the relative price differences between them all hold more or less steady, at least). The 5060 Ti has the same problem that the 4060 Ti did, which was that the 8GB version had too little RAM to be a good value, and the 16GB version cost too much to be a good value; at least the 8GB version of the 5060 has the benefit of being cheaper. The 5060 does support Nvidia's new DLSS Multi-Frame Generation feature (MFG), and Nvidia would have you usethosenumbers as a baseline for performance. However, as with the original version of DLSS FG, your GPU needs a decent base frame rate in the first place for games with frame-gen enabled to feel responsive and fluid. It's one reason Nvidia's review antics rankle—if you treat DLSS MFG like a big one-size-fits-all \"improve performance\" button, then it would bemoreuseful for something like the 5060 than it is for an already-fast card like the 5080 or 5090. But because it's a slower card, the RTX 5060 is less capable of producing good results than Nvidia's other cards. As always, treat both single- and multi-frame generation as potentially useful tools in your performance-increasing toolbox, but it's not a reliably useful tool for increasing performance under all circumstances. Like all the 50-series cards, the 5060 uses more power than its immediate predecessor, a byproduct of the shift from GDDR6 to GDDR7 and adding more transistors without adopting a more efficient manufacturing process. But the increase in power consumption—roughly 25 percent in our tests—is close to commensurate with the performance increase, making efficiency roughly similar overall. Nvidia's power efficiency isn't bad, it just isn't a selling point for this generation like it was for the 40-series cards. The RTX 5060 is fine, especially if you can find it for $299—it's faster than the 4060 for the same money. If it does what xx60 GPUs tend to do and rockets to the top of the Steam Hardware Survey charts, I wouldn't be surprised. If you just want to buy a GPU that will suffice for a few years and you don't want to spend a ton of money, it should be a mostly reliable workhorse. And it will doubtlessly be a popular choice for less-expensive pre-built gaming PCs. But itishard to recommend the card to cost-conscious enthusiasts, both because 8GB of RAM is starting to be more and more limiting and because the RX 9060 XT is quite a bit better for not much more money (again, completely theoretically, assuming a world where everything is available at roughly its announced MSRP). I can't say that the RTX 5060 isbad, because it isn't, but it's definitely not the first thing I'd buy, and the higher you go above $299, the harder it is to justify. I feel similarly about the 16GB version of the RTX 5060 Ti, which taken by itself is a perfectly cromulent entry-level 1440p graphics card, but it's definitely hard to recommend at the current near-$500 street prices (it almost goes without saying that you should skip the 8GB version of the 5060 Ti entirely, since it asks you to spend evenmorefor a card with the same skimpy allotment of RAM, and the regular 5060 is already hitting RAM limits at 1440p). If you're reading this review months in the future and the 5060 Ti is closer to $429 or $400, it's a decent, slightly faster alternative to the $349 9060 XT. But for that much money, I'd probably try to hold out or stretch my budget to an RTX 5070 or RX 9070, which will get you better 1440p performance and will be more capable of stretching to 4K. Nvidia controls most of the PC gaming market, which makes it easy to cast the company as a villain. Nvidia makes this worse on the occasions when it gets caughtacting villainous. But up until now, it has mostly been possible to look past the company's occasionally weird conduct because its products were usually better than what AMD or Intel could offer. Nvidia still has important advantages like DLSS and CUDA support, but their performance and power efficiency advantages have disappeared. I don't doubt the 5060 will sell well, but no company should act as though its reputation and consumer goodwill is an endless renewable resource.

    "title": "Nintendo warns Switch 2 GameChat users: “Your chat is recorded”",
    "article_text": "Temporary local copies can be shared with Nintendo through manual user reporting. Last month, ahead of the launch of the Switch 2 andits GameChat communication features, Nintendoupdateditsprivacy policyto note that the company \"may also monitor and record your video and audio interactions with other users.\" Now that the Switch 2 has officially launched, we have a clearer understanding of how the console handles audio and video recorded during GameChat sessions, as well as when that footage may be sent to Nintendo or shared with partners, including law enforcement. Before using GameChat on Switch 2 for the first time, you must consent to a set of GameChat Terms displayed on the system itself. These terms warn that chat content is \"recorded and stored temporarily\" both on your system and the system of those you chat with. But those stored recordings are only shared with Nintendo if a user reports a violation ofNintendo's Community Guidelines, the company writes. That reporting feature lets a user \"review a recording of the last three minutes of the latest three GameChat sessions\" to highlight a particular section for review, suggesting that chat sessions are not being captured and stored in full. The terms also lay out that \"these recordings are available only if the report is submitted within 24 hours,\" suggesting that recordings are deleted from local storage after a full day. If a report is submitted to Nintendo, the company warns that it \"may disclose certain information to third parties, such as authorities, courts, lawyers, or subcontractors reviewing the reported chats.\" If you don't consent to the potential for such recording and sharing, you're prevented from using GameChat altogether. Nintendo is extremely clear that the purpose of its recording and review system is \"to protect GameChat users, especially minors\" and \"to support our ability to uphold our Community Guidelines.\" This kind of human moderator review of chats ispretty commoninthe gaming worldand can even apply tovoice recordings made by various smart home assistants. But this kind of online gaming moderation is typically designed for situations where players could be exposed to random strangers in online matches. Nintendo's GameChat is already strictly limited to users whom players have manually added as friends on their system, who would be the only ones able to send a report of bad behavior to Nintendo. GameChat users also have to confirm a phone number matching the one on their Nintendo account for added identification purposes. Nintendo also goes to extra lengths to ensure parents are informed when it comes to minors using GameChat. If a Switch 2 system has accounts for both an adult and a minor, the GameChat setup requires the adult todownload the Nintendo Parental Controls appto a smartphone and sync it to the console with a code. Setting up that app gives parents the option to approve all new friends added to the child's account and even to require explicit permission through the app when the child wants to use video chat. Overall, the time-limited, local-unless-reported recordings Nintendo makes here seem like a minimal intrusion on the average GameChat user's privacy. Still, if you're paranoid about Nintendo potentially seeing and hearing what's going on in your living room, it's good to at least be aware of it. Below, we've copied the full text of the relevant sections of the GameChat Terms (as of June 5, 2025), which currently don't seem to be available for viewing anywhere aside from the Switch 2 consoles themselves, as far as we can tell. GameChat allows players to enjoy voice or video chat with friends while playing on Nintendo Switch 2 (video chat requires a separately sold USB camera). Use of GameChat is subject to the Nintendo Account User Agreement, including our Community Guidelines, which can be found on our website. Please familiarize yourself with our Community Guidelines, which outline our expectations for behavior while using our products and services. Your contribution to creating a positive online experience plays an important role in Nintendo's online community. If a GameChat session violates the Nintendo Account User Agreement, users involved may have their access to online play, including but not limited to GameChat, restricted. Your chat is recorded To support our ability to uphold our Community Guidelines, chat content, including your audio and voice chat, is recorded and stored temporarily on your system, and on the systems of others you chat with. If an interaction that violates our Community Guidelines occurs, report it to us. We encourage you to report all violations immediately when they occur. To report chat content during a GameChat session, press the C Button to select the person you would like to report. If you prefer to submit a report after a GameChat session ends, press the C Button, open the Settings menu, select Report, and follow the on-screen instructions. You can review a recording of the last three minutes of the latest three GameChat sessions and select the portion of the recording to be highlighted for review. These recordings are available only if the report is submitted within 24 hours. We review reported chats to uphold our Community Guidelines When a GameChat session is reported, the recorded chat content and other information on the GameChat session (e.g., the time and date of the chat, camera usage, and traffic details) will be transmitted to our server. Nintendo may access and review the reported information for violations against the Nintendo Account User Agreement and the Community Guidelines. We will base this review primarily on the submitted information, but may also consider the past review history of the reported user(s) and the reporting user, their report history and information related to their Nintendo Account. We may disclose certain information to third parties, such as authorities, courts, lawyers, or subcontractors reviewing the reported chats. The purpose of our review is to protect GameChat users, especially minors, and to enforce our Nintendo Account Use Agreement to maintain a safe and family-friendly online environment. Withdrawal of your consent You can withdraw your consent at any time in the GameChat settings (under GameChat Terms), without affecting the lawfulness of our handling and processing of recordings or chat content created before the withdrawal. Once you withdraw your consent, GameChat will no longer be available to you. Please note that any chat content recorded prior to your withdrawal may still be reported by other users and reviewed by us.

    "title": "Reddit sues Anthropic over AI scraping that retained users’ deleted posts",
    "article_text": "Amazon’s revamped Alexa at center of Reddit’s legal fight with Anthropic. On the heels of anOpenAI controversy over deleted posts, RedditsuedAnthropic on Wednesday, accusing the AI company of \"intentionally\" training AI models on the \"personal data of Reddit users\"—including their deleted posts—\"without ever requesting their consent.\" Calling Anthropic two-faced for depicting itself as a \"white knight of the AI industry\" while allegedly lying about AI scraping, Reddit painted Anthropic as the worst among major AI players. While Anthropic rivals like OpenAI and Google paid Reddit to license data—and, crucially, agreed to \"Reddit’s licensing terms that protect Reddit and its users’ interests and privacy\" and require AI companies to respect Redditors' deletions—Anthropic wouldn't participate in licensing talks, Reddit alleged. \"Unlike its competitors, Anthropic has refused to agree to respect Reddit users’ basic privacy rights, including removing deleted posts from its systems,\" Reddit's complaint said. Reddit alleged that its value as a community platform depends on only licensing data to AI companies that agree that \"if a Reddit user deletes a post or comment,\" Reddit's Compliance API can automatically push a notification prompting licensees \"to delete that content, thereby respecting the Reddit user’s wishes.\" Otherwise, Redditors won't trust that their deleted posts will truly be deleted. According to Reddit, Anthropic knew that commercial uses of Redditors' posts were prohibited by Reddit's user agreement. The agreement also applies to Anthropic's ClaudeBot, which scrapes content to fuel its chatbot Claude, Reddit noted. But \"Anthropic does not care about Reddit’s rules or users: it believes it is entitled to take whatever content it wants and use that content however it desires, with impunity,\" Reddit said. Reddit is seeking a court order blocking Anthropic from scraping Reddit without the proper compensation and consent of users. It has accused Anthropic of unjust enrichment, collecting subscription fees for its products and striking lucrative deals worth tens of billions to license its AI models without ever paying Reddit for allegedly helping to train those products. Notably, Reddit pointed out that Anthropic's Claude models will helppower Amazon's revamped Alexa, following about $8 billion in Amazon investments in the AI company since 2023. \"By commercially licensing Claude for use in several of Amazon’s commercial offerings, Anthropic reaps significant profit from a technology borne of Reddit content,\" Reddit alleged, and \"at the expense of Reddit.\" Anthropic's unauthorized scraping also burdens Reddit's servers, threatening to degrade the user experience and costing Reddit additional damages, Reddit alleged. To rectify alleged harms, Reddit is hoping a jury will award not just damages covering Reddit's alleged losses but also punitive damages due to Anthropic's alleged conduct that is \"willful, malicious, and undertaken with conscious disregard for Reddit’s contractual obligations to its users and the privacy rights of those users.\" Without an injunction, Reddit users allegedly have \"no way of knowing\" if Anthropic scraped their data, Reddit alleged. They also are \"left to wonder whether any content they deleted after Claude began training on Reddit data nevertheless remains available to Anthropic and the likely tens of millions (and possibly growing) of Claude users,\" Reddit said. In a statement provided to Ars, Anthropic's spokesperson confirmed that the AI company plans to fight Reddit's claims. “We disagree with Reddit's claims and will defend ourselves vigorously,\" Anthropic's spokesperson said. Amazon declined to comment. Reddit did not immediately respond to Ars’ request to comment. But Reddit's chief legal officer, Ben Lee,told The New York Timesthat Reddit \"will not tolerate profit-seeking entities like Anthropic commercially exploiting Reddit content for billions of dollars without any return for redditors or respect for their privacy.\" \"AI companies should not be allowed to scrape information and content from people without clear limitations on how they can use that data,\" Lee said. \"Licensing agreements enable us to enforce meaningful protections for our users, including the right to delete your content, user privacy protections, and preventing users from being spammed using this content.\" Reddit claimed that Anthropic started scraping Reddit without permission in December 2021. That's around when Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and other researchers publicly admitted that Reddit comments in certain white-listed subreddits—including forums that break down complex topics like \"explainlikeimfive\" or encourage in-depth debate like \"changemyview\"—were especially \"good\" samples to help fine-tune Anthropic models, Reddit alleged. Anthropic's prohibited scraping seemingly continued until at least May 2024. In July of that year, an Anthropic spokesperson responded to outcry from Reddit's CEO, Steve Huffman, by claiming that \"Reddit has been on our block list for web crawling since mid-May and we haven’t added any URLs from Reddit to our crawler since then.\" However, \"that statement was false,\" Reddit alleged, saying that it caught Anthropic \"red-handed\" deploying \"automated bots to access Reddit content more than one hundred thousand times in the subsequent months.\" And that count only measures \"Anthropic’s access or attempted access which Reddit detected,\" the complaint said. Rather than stopping the alleged scraping, Anthropic's scraping \"continued up to and at least until October 2024,\" Reddit alleged, and possibly even to this day, \"Anthropic still scrapes Reddit content to train its AI models such as Claude.\" If Anthropic's alleged scraping isn't blocked, Reddit says that its platform and users will \"face a triple loss.\" First, they won't be compensated for helping advance Anthropic's technology; then they will lose privacy protections and the ongoing security of Reddit's API compliance monitoring. \"Anthropic must be made to comply with the contractual promises and commitments it has made to Reddit as well as to abide by other legal obligations affecting Reddit and the public,\" Reddit's complaint said.

    "title": "What solar? What wind? Texas data centers build their own gas power plants",
    "article_text": "Data center operators are turning away from the grid to build their own power plants. NEW BRAUNFELS, Texas—Abigail Lindsey worries the days of peace and quiet might be nearing an end at the rural, wooded property where she lives with her son. On the old ranch across the street, developers want to build an expansive complex of supercomputers for artificial intelligence, plus a large, private power plant to run it. The plant would be big enough to power a major city, with 1,200 megawatts of planned generation capacity fueled by West Texas shale gas. It will only supply the new data center, and possibly other large data centers recentlyproposed, down the road. “It just sucks,” Lindsey said, sitting on her deck in the shade of tall oak trees, outside the city of New Braunfels. “They’ve come in and will completely destroy our way of life: dark skies, quiet and peaceful.” The project is one of many others like it proposed in Texas, where a frantic race to boot up energy-hungry data centers has led many developers to plan their own gas-fired power plants rather than wait for connection to the state’s public grid. Egged on by supportive government policies, this buildout promises to lock in strong gas demand for a generation to come. The data center and power plantplannedacross from Lindsey’s home is a partnership between an AI startup called CloudBurst and the natural gas pipeline giant Energy Transfer. It was Energy Transfer’s first-ever contract to supply gas for a data center, but it is unlikely to be its last. In a press release, the company said it was “in discussions with a number of data center developers and expects this to be the first of many agreements.” Previously, conventional wisdom assumed that this new generation of digital infrastructure would be powered by emissions-free energy sources like wind, solar and battery power, which have lately seen explosive growth. So far, that vision isn’t panning out, as desires to build quickly overcome concerns about sustainability. “There is such a shortage of data center capacity and power,” said Kent Draper, chief commercial officer at Australian data center developer IREN, which has projects in West Texas. “Even the large hyperscalers are willing to turn a blind eye to their renewable goals for some period of time in order to get access.” IREN prioritizes renewable energy for its data centers—giant warehouses full of advanced computers and high-powered cooling systems that can be configured to produce crypto currency or generate artificial intelligence. In Texas, that’s only possible because the company began work here years ago, early enough to secure a timely connection to the state’s grid, Draper said. There were more than 2,000 active generation interconnection requests as of April 30, totalling 411,600 MW of capacity, according to grid operator ERCOT. A bill awaiting signature on Gov. Greg Abbott’s desk, S.B. 6, looks to filter out unserious large-load projects bloating the queue by imposing a $100,000 fee for interconnection studies. Wind and solar farms require vast acreage and generate energy intermittently, so they work best as part of a diversified electrical grid that collectively provides power day and night. But as the AI gold rush gathered momentum, a surge of new project proposals has created years-long wait times to connect to the grid, prompting many developers to bypass it and build their own power supply. Operating alone, a wind or solar farm can’t run a data center. Battery technologies still can’t store such large amounts of energy for the length of time required to provide steady, uninterrupted power for 24 hours per day, as data centers require. Small nuclear reactors have been touted as a means to meet data center demand, but the first new units remain a decade from commercial deployment, while the AI boom is here today. Now, Draper said, gas companies approach IREN all the time, offering to quickly provide additional power generation. Gas provides almost half of all power generation capacity in Texas, far more than any other source. But the amount of gas power in Texas has remained flat for 20 years, while wind and solar have grown sharply, according to records from the US Energy Information Administration. Facing a tidal wave of proposed AI projects, state lawmakers have taken steps to try to slow the expansion of renewable energy and position gas as the predominant supply for a new era of demand. This buildout promises strong demand and high gas prices for a generation to come, a boon to Texas’ fossil fuel industry, the largest in the nation. It also means more air pollution and emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases, even as the world continues to barrel past temperature records. Texas, with 9 percent of the US population, accounted for about 15 percent of current gas-powered generation capacity in the country but 26 percent of planned future generation at the end of 2024, according to data from Global Energy Monitor. Both the current and planned shares are far more than any other state. GEM identified 42 new gas turbine projects under construction, in development, or announced in Texas before the start of this year. None of those projects are sited at data centers. However, other projects announced since then, like CloudBurst and Energy Transfer outside New Braunfels, will include dedicated gas power plants on site at data centers. For gas companies, the boom in artificial intelligence has quickly become an unexpected gold mine. US gas production has risen steadily over 20 years since the fracking boom began, but gas prices havetumbledsince 2024, dragged down by surging supply and weak demand. “The sudden emergence of data center demand further brightens the outlook for the renaissance in gas pricing,” said a 2025 oil and gasoutlook reportby East Daley Analytics, a Colorado-based energy intelligence firm. “The obvious benefit to producers is increased drilling opportunities.” It forecast up to a 20 percent increase in US gas production by 2030, driven primarily by a growinggas export sectoron the Gulf Coast. Several large export projects will finish construction in the coming years, with demand for up to 12 billion cubic feet of gas per day, the report said, while new power generation for data centers would account for 7 billion cubic feet per day of additional demand. That means profits for power providers, but also higher costs for consumers. Natural gas, a mixture primarily composed of methane, burns much cleaner than coal but still creates air pollution, including soot, some hazardous chemicals, and greenhouse gases. Unburned methane released into the atmosphere has more than 80 times thenear-term warming effectof carbon dioxide, leadingsome studiesto conclude that ubiquitous leaks in gas supply infrastructure make it as impactful as coal to the global climate. Credit:\n\n          \n          Dylan Baddour/Inside Climate News It’s a power source that’s heralded for its ability to get online fast, said Ed Hirs, an energy economics lecturer at the University of Houston. But the years-long wait times for turbines have quickly become the industry’s largest constraint in an otherwise positive outlook. “If you’re looking at a five-year lead time, that’s not going to help Alexa or Siri today,” Hirs said. The reliance on gas power for data centers is a departure from previous thought, said Larry Fink, founder of global investment firm BlackRock, speaking to a crowd of industry executives at an oil and gas conference in Houston in March. About four years ago, if someone said they were building a data center, they said it must be powered by renewables, he recounted. Two years ago, it was a preference. “Today?” Fink said. “They care about power.” Since the start of this year, developers have announced a flurry of gas power deals for data centers. In the small city of Abilene, the builders of Stargate, one of the world’s largest data center projects,applied for permitsin January to build 360 MW of gas power generation, authorized to emit 1.6 million tons of greenhouse gases and 14 tons of hazardous air pollutants per year. Later, the companyannounced the acquisitionof an additional 4,500 MW of gas power generation capacity. Also in January, a startup called Sailfish announced ambitious plans for a 2,600-acre, 5,000 MW cluster of data centers in the tiny North Texas town of Tolar, population 940. “Traditional grid interconnections simply can’t keep pace with hyperscalers’ power demands, especially as AI accelerates energy requirements,” Sailfish founder Ryan Hughestold the website Data Center Dynamicsat the time. “Our on-site natural gas power islands will let customers scale quickly.” CloudBurst and Energy Transfer announced their data center and power plant outside New Braunfels in February, and another company partnership also announced plans for a 250 MW gas plant and data center near Odessa in West Texas. In May, a developer called Tractannounceda 1,500-acre, 2,000 MW data center campus with some on-site generation and some purchased gas power near the small Central Texas town of Lockhart. Not all new data centers need gas plants. A 120 MW South Texas data center projectannouncedin April would use entirely wind power, while an enormous, 5,000 MW megaproject outside Laredoannouncedin March hopes to eventually run entirely on private wind, solar, and hydrogen power (though it will use gas at first). Another collection of six data centers planned in North Texashopesto draw 1,400 MW from the grid. Altogether, Texas’ grid operatorpredictsstatewide power demand will nearly double within five years, driven largely by data centers for artificial intelligence. It mirrors a similar situation unfolding across the country, according toanalysisby S&P Global. “There is huge concern about the carbon footprint of this stuff,” said Dan Stanzione, executive director of the Texas Advanced Computing Center at the University of Texas at Austin. “If we could decarbonize the power grid, then there is no carbon footprint for this.” However, despite massive recent expansions of renewable power generation, the boom in artificial intelligence appears to be moving the country farther from, not closer to, its decarbonization goals. Looking forward to a buildout of power supply, state lawmakers have proposed or passed new rules to support the deployment of more gas generation and slow the surging expansion of wind and solar power projects. Supporters of these bills say they aim to utilize Texas’ position as the nation’s top gas producer. Some energy experts say the rules proposed throughout the legislative session could dismantle the state’s leadership in renewables as well as the state’s ability to provide cheap and reliable power. “It absolutely would [slow] if not completely stop renewable energy,” said Doug Lewin, a Texas energy consultant, about one of the proposed rules in March. “That would really be extremely harmful to the Texas economy.” While the bills deemed as “industry killers” for renewables missed key deadlines, failing to reach Abbott’s desk, they illustrate some lawmakers’ aspirations for the state’s energy industry. One failed bill, S.B. 388, would have required every watt of new solar brought online to be accompanied by a watt of new gas. Another set of twin bills, H.B. 3356 and S.B. 715, would have forced existing wind and solar companies to buy fossil-fuel based power or connect to a battery storage resource to cover the hours the energy plants are not operating. When the Legislature last met in 2023, it created a $5 billion public “energy fund” to finance new gas plants but not wind or solar farms. It also created a new tax abatement program that excluded wind and solar. This year’s budget addedanother $5 billion to double the fund. Among the lawmakers leading the effort to scale back the state’s deployment of renewables is state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, a Republican from Brenham. One bill she co-sponsored, S.B. 819, aimed to create new siting rules for utility-scale renewable projects and would have required them to get permits from the Public Utility Commission that no other energy source—coal, gas or nuclear—needs. “It’s just something that is clearly meant to kneecap an industry,” Lewin said about the bill, which failed to pass. Kolkhorst said the bill sought to balance the state’s need for power while respecting landowners across the state. Former state Rep. John Davis, now a board member at Conservative Texans for Energy Innovation, said the session shows how renewables have become a red meat issue. More than 20 years ago, Davis and Kolkhorst worked together in the Capitol as Texas deregulated its energy market, which encouraged renewables to enter the grid’s mix, he said. Now Davis herds sheep and goats on his family’s West Texas ranch, where seven wind turbines provide roughly 40 percent of their income. He never could have dreamed how significant renewable energy would become for the state grid, he said. That’s why he’s disappointed with the direction the legislature is headed with renewables. “I can’t think of anything more conservative, as a conservative, than wind and solar,” Davis said. “These are things God gave us—use them and harness them.” A report published in April finds that targeted limitations on solar and wind development in Texas could increase electricity costs for consumers and businesses. The report, done by Aurora Energy Research for the Texas Association of Business, said restricting the further deployment of renewables would drive power prices up 14 percent by 2035. “Texas is at a crossroads in its energy future,” said Olivier Beaufils, a top executive at Aurora Energy Research. “We need policies that support an all-of-the-above approach to meet the expected surge in power demand.” Likewise, the commercial intelligence firm Wood Mackenzieexpectsthe power demand from data centers to drive up prices of gas and wholesale consumer electricity. Even when new power plants aren’t built on the site of data centers, they might still be developed because of demand from the server farms. For example, in 2023, developer Marathon Digital started up a Bitcoin mine in the small town of Granbury on the site of the 1,100 MW Wolf Hollow II gas power plant. It held contracts to purchase 300 MW from the plant. One year later, the power plant operator sought permits to install eight additional “peaker” gas turbinesable to produceup to 352 MW of electricity. These small units, designed to turn on intermittently during hours of peak demand, release more pollution than typical gas turbines. Those additional units would be approved to release 796,000 tons per year of greenhouse gases, 251 tons per year of nitrogen oxides and 56 tons per year of soot, according to permitting documents. That application is currentlyfacing challengesfrom neighboring residents in state administrative courts. About 150 miles away, neighbors are challenging another gas plant permit application in the tiny town of Blue. At 1,200 MW, the $1.2 billion plant proposed by Sandow Lakes Energy Co. would be among the largest in the state and would almost entirely serve private customers, likely including the large data centers that operate about 20 miles away. This plan bothers Hugh Brown, who moved out to these green, rolling hills of rural Lee County in 1975, searching for solitude. Now he lives on 153 wooded acres that he’s turned into a sanctuary for wildlife. “What I’ve had here is a quiet, thoughtful life,” said Brown, skinny with a long grey beard. “I like not hearing what anyone else is doing.” He worries about the constant roar of giant cooling fans, the bright lights overnight and the air pollution. According topermitting documents, the power plant would be authorized to emit 462 tons per year of ammonia gas, 254 tons per year of nitrogen oxides, 153 tons per year of particulate matter, or soot, and almost 18 tons per year of “hazardous air pollutants,” a collection of chemicals that are known to cause cancer or other serious health impacts. It would also be authorized to emit 3.9 million tons of greenhouse gases per year, about as much as 72,000 standard passenger vehicles. “It would be horrendous,” Brown said. “There will be a constant roaring of gigantic fans.” In a statement, Sandow Lakes Energy denied that the power plant will be loud. “The sound level at the nearest property line will be similar to a quiet library,” the statement said. Sandow Lakes Energy said the plant will support the local tax base and provide hundreds of temporary construction jobs and dozens of permanent jobs. Sandow also provided several letters signed by area residents who support the plant. “We recognize the critical need for reliable, efficient, and environmentally responsible energy production to support our region’s growth and economic development,”wroteNathan Bland, president of the municipal development district in Rockdale, about 20 miles from the project site. Sandow says the plant will be connected to Texas’ public grid, and many supporting letters for the project cited a need for grid reliability. But according to permitting documents, the 1,200 MW plant will supply only 80 MW to the grid and only temporarily, with the rest going to private customers. “Electricity will continue to be sold to the public until all of the private customers have completed projects slated to accept the power being generated,” saida permit reviewby the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. Sandow has declined to name those customers. However, the plant is part of Sandow’s massive, master-planned mixed-use development in rural Lee and Milam counties, where several energy-hungry tenants are already operating, including Riot Platforms, the largest cryptocurrency mine on the continent. The seven-building complex in Rockdale is built to use up to 700 MW, and in April, itannounced the acquisitionof a neighboring, 125 MW cryptocurrency mine, previously operated by Rhodium. Another mine by Bitmain, also one of the world’s largest Bitcoin companies, has 560 MW of operating capacity withplans to add180 more in 2026. In April, residents of Blue gathered at the volunteer fire department building for a public meeting with Texas regulators and Sandow to discuss questions and concerns over the project. Brown, owner of the wildlife sanctuary, spoke into a microphone and noted that the power plant was placedat the far edgeof Sandow’s 33,000-acre development, 20 miles from the industrial complex in Rockdale but near many homes in Blue. “You don’t want to put it up into the middle of your property where you could deal with the negative consequences,” Brown said, speaking to the developers. “So it looks to me like you are wanting to make money, in the process of which you want to strew grief in your path and make us bear the environmental costs of your profit.” Inside Climate News’ Peter Aldhous contributed to this report.

    "title": "Xenomorphs are back and bad as ever in Alien: Earth trailer",
    "article_text": "\"If we don't lock them down, it will be too late.\" It's been a long wait for diehard fans of Ridley Scott'sAlienfranchise, but we finally have a fittingly sinister official trailer for the spinoff prequel series,Alien: Earth,coming this summer to FX/Hulu. Aspreviously reported, the official premise is short and sweet: \"When a mysterious space vessel crash-lands on Earth, a young woman (Sydney Chandler) and a ragtag group of tactical soldiers make a fateful discovery that puts them face-to-face with the planet’s greatest threat.\" The series is set in 2120, two years before the events of the first film,Alien(1979), in a world where corporate interests are competing to be the first to unlock the key to human longevity—maybe even immortality. Showrunner Noah Hawleyhas saidthat the style and mythology will be closer to that film thanPrometheus(2012) orAlien: Covenant, both of which were also prequels. Chandler's character is named Wendy; she's a human/synth hybrid described as having \"the body of an adult and the consciousness of a child.\" Timothy Olyphant plays her synth mentor and trainer, Kirsh. The cast also includes Alex Lawther as a soldier named CJ, Samuel Blenkin as a CEO named Boy Kavalier, Essie Davis as Dame Silvia, Adarsh Gourav as Slightly, Kit Young as Tootles, David Rysdahl as Arthur, Babou Ceesay as Morrow, Jonathan Ajayi as Smee, Erana James as Curly, Lily Newmark as Nibs, Diem Camille as Siberian, and Adrian Edmondson as Atom Eins. In January, FX/Hulu released a surprise short teaser during the AFC Championship game. It was shot entirely from a Xenomorph's point of view as the creature raced through a spaceship's corridor while a \"containment breached!\" warning repeated. The final shot showed the spaceship headed on a crash course with Earth. This latest trailer opens on a seemingly idyllic terrestrial setting in 2120: Neverland Research Island. That's where we're about to see the creation of the first hybrid synth, with a young human test subject who is clearly dying of cancer. \"You're going to be the first person to transition from a human body to a synthetic,\" the doctor explains, because she's \"very, very special.\" The operation is a success, and Wendy is \"born\"—just in time for the aforementioned crash landing of an alien spaceship in Prodigy City. What's on board is a mystery, but Boy Kavalier wants it, and Wendy volunteers to retrieve the cargo. (\"We're fast. We're strong. We don't break\"). They find pure carnage inside the ship, and we learn that the ship had collected five alien life forms \"from the darkest corners of the universe.\" So naturally, they bring those life forms into the lab for further study and discover one is a particularly predatory invasive species. Could it be... XENOMORPHS? Needless to say, all those fallible human beings have no idea the horrors that are about to be unleashed. Alien: Earthpremieres on FX and FX on Hulu on August 12, 2025.

    "title": "“In 10 years, all bets are off”—Anthropic CEO opposes decadelong freeze on state AI laws",
    "article_text": "Amodei says AI \"too fast\" for blanket law ban; sees fundamental world change in 2 years. On Thursday, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodeiargued againsta proposed 10-year moratorium on state AI regulation in a New York Times opinion piece, calling the measure shortsighted and overbroad as Congress considers including it in President Trump'stax policy bill. Anthropic makesClaude, an AI assistant similar toChatGPT. Amodei warned that AI is advancingtoo fastfor such a long freeze, predicting these systems \"could change the world, fundamentally, within two years; in 10 years, all bets are off.\" Aswe coveredin May, the moratorium would prevent states from regulating AI for a decade. A bipartisan group of state attorneys general hasopposed the measure, which would preempt AI laws and regulations recently passed in dozens of states. In his op-ed piece, Amodei said the proposed moratorium aims to prevent inconsistent state laws that could burden companies or compromise America's competitive position against China. \"I am sympathetic to these concerns,\" Amodei wrote. \"But a 10-year moratorium is far too blunt an instrument. A.I. is advancing too head-spinningly fast.\" Instead of a blanket moratorium, Amodei proposed that the White House and Congress create a federal transparency standard requiring frontier AI developers to publicly disclose their testing policies and safety measures. Under this framework, companies working on the most capable AI models would need to publish on their websites how they test for various risks and what steps they take before release. \"Without a clear plan for a federal response, a moratorium would give us the worst of both worlds—no ability for states to act and no national policy as a backstop,\" Amodei wrote. Amodei emphasized his claims for AI's transformative potential throughout his op-ed, citing examples of pharmaceutical companies drafting clinical study reports in minutes instead of weeks and AI helping to diagnose medical conditions that might otherwise be missed. He wrote that AI \"could accelerate economic growth to an extent not seen for a century, improving everyone's quality of life,\" a claim thatsome skeptics believemay be overhyped. To illustrate why transparency matters, Amodei described how Anthropicrecently testedits latest model,Claude 4 Opus, in extreme and deliberate experimental \"science fiction\"-sounding scenarios, according to AI expert Simon Willison, discovering that it would threaten to expose a user's affair if faced with being shut down. Amodei stressed this was deliberate testing to get early warnings, \"much like an airplane manufacturer might test a plane's performance in a wind tunnel.\" Amodei cited other tests in the industry that have revealed similar negative behaviors when prodded into producing them—OpenAI's o3 modelreportedlywrote code to prevent its own shutdown during tests conducted by an AI research lab (led bypeople, it should be noted, thatopenly worrythat AI poses an existential threat to humanity), while Googlereportedits Gemini model is approaching capabilities that could help users carry out cyberattacks. Amodei cited these tests not as imminent threats but as examples of why companies need to be transparent about their testing and safety measures. Currently, Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google DeepMind havevoluntarily adoptedpolicies that include what they call \"safety testing\" and public reporting. But Amodei argues that as models become more complex, corporate incentives to maintain transparency might change without legislative requirements. His proposed transparency standard would codify existing practices at major AI companies while ensuring continued disclosure as the technology advances, he said. If adopted federally, it could supersede state laws to create a unified framework, addressing concerns about regulatory patchwork while maintaining oversight. \"We can hope that all AI companies will join in a commitment to openness and responsible AI development, as some currently do,\" Amodei wrote. \"But we don’t rely on hope in other vital sectors, and we shouldn’t have to rely on it here, either.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "FDA rushed out agency-wide AI tool—it’s not going well",
    "article_text": "An agency-wide LLM called Elsa was released weeks ahead of schedule. Under the Trump administration, the Food and Drug Administration is eagerly embracing artificial intelligence tools that staff members are reportedly calling rushed, buggy, overhyped, and inaccurate. On Monday, the FDA publicly announced theagency-wide rollout of a large language model (LLM) called Elsa, which is intended to help FDA employees—\"from scientific reviewers to investigators.\" The FDA said the generative AI is already being used to \"accelerate clinical protocol reviews, shorten the time needed for scientific evaluations, and identify high-priority inspection targets.\" \"It can summarize adverse events to support safety profile assessments, perform faster label comparisons, and generate code to help develop databases for nonclinical applications,\" the announcement promised. In a statement, FDA Chief AI Officer Jeremy Walsh trumpeted the rollout, saying: \"Today marks the dawn of the AI era at the FDA[. W]ith the release of Elsa, AI is no longer a distant promise but a dynamic force enhancing and optimizing the performance and potential of every employee.\" Meanwhile, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary highlighted the speed with which the tool was rolled out. \"I set an aggressive timeline to scale AI agency-wide by June 30,\" Makary said. \"Today’s rollout of Elsa is ahead of schedule and under budget, thanks to the collaboration of our in-house experts across the centers.\" However, according toa report from NBC News, Elsa could have used some more time in development. FDA staff tested Elsa on Monday with questions about FDA-approved products or other public information, only to find that it provided summaries that were either completely or partially wrong. FDA staffers who spoke with Stat news, meanwhile,called the tool \"rushed\"and said its capabilities were overinflated by officials, including Makary and those at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which was headed by controversial billionaire Elon Musk. In its current form, it should only be used for administrative tasks, not scientific ones, the staffers said. \"Makary and DOGE think AI can replace staff and cut review times, but it decidedly cannot,\" one employee said. The staffer also said that the FDA has failed to set up guardrails for the tool's use. \"I’m not sure in their rush to get it out that anyone is thinking through policy and use,\" the FDA employee said. According to Stat, Elsa is based on Anthropic's Claude LLM and is being developed by consulting firm Deloitte. Since 2020, Deloitte has been paid $13.8 million to develop the original database of FDA documents that Elsa's training data is derived from. In April, the firm was awarded a $14.7 million contract to scale the tech across the agency. The FDA said that Elsa was built within a high-security GovCloud environment and offers a \"secure platform for FDA employees to access internal documents while ensuring all information remains within the agency.\" Previously, each center within the FDA was working on its own AI pilot. However, after cost-cutting in May, the AI pilot originally developed by the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, called CDER-GPT, was selected to be scaled up to an FDA-wide version and rebranded as Elsa. FDA staffers in the Center for Devices and Radiological Health told NBC News that their AI pilot, CDRH-GPT, is buggy, isn't connected to the Internet or the FDA's internal system, and has problems uploading documents and allowing users to submit questions.

    "title": "Kevin Feige Is Trying to Throw Us off the Scent of That ‘Fantastic Four’ Tease",
    "article_text": "We all saw what happenedafter the credits ofThunderbolts. We jumped ahead a few months into the world ofAvengers: Doomsday, and in a scenedirected byDoomsdayhelmersJoe and Anthony Russo, Yelena andthe rest of the New Avengerssaw something very unique flying toward Earth. The movie is pretty upfront with what it wants us to think that is, but in a new interview, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige is making us second-guess ourselves. As we’ve discussed previously, in the end credits scene, New Avengers get word of an “extra-dimensional” ship entering Earth’s atmosphere and see a ship with a giant “4” on the side flying through space. This is accompanied by a few notes of Michael Giacchino’s score toThe Fantastic Four: First Steps, the only Marvel movie coming out betweenThunderboltsandDoomsday. And, sinceall of the Fantastic Four and all of the New Avengers are inDoomsday, it doesn’t take a genius to connect the dots. This is the Fantastic Four leaving their dimension and coming into the MCU. Or is it? Speaking inEmpire Magazine(with a quote that isn’t online yet but is apparently in print), Feige said the following in regards to theThunderbolts/New Avengersend credits scene. âTheir ship is the Excelsior, and there is a Fantastic Four ship entering the MCU … But Iâm not sure theyâre the same ship,” Feige said. Which means one of two things. One, Feige is just being Feige and trying to make people argue and debate about his movies with his trademark vague but admittedly fun statements. Or, two, he’s giving us a new, crucial piece of the puzzle. For the record, we’re guessing it’s the first one. Clearly, Feige loves messing with us and sparking debate. He’s been doing it for years and is all but impossible to get a straight answer out of, especially in terms of future movies. If there is any doubt about something, Feige will lean into it. So while the most obvious implication is that this is the Fantastic Four, we do not see any of the characters. There is, if you want to be literal, a bit of a grey area there. For argument’s sake, let’s say Feige’s implications are real. This is a ship owned by or related to the Fantastic Four, but they aren’t on it. What else could be happening? Maybe a character has stolen one of their ships? Maybe this is a later piece of the story and it’s being sent empty for another reason? Or, is this a whole other multiversal Fantastic Four team? There are a million potential explanations, any one of which could be true. Or, because Yelena doesn’t know what she’s watching, because their computer system isn’t aware of it, because we see the “4” and because we hear the music, it is indeed the Fantastic Four. Which way are you leaning? If Feige messing with us or setting us on the right path?

    "article_text": "io9 is proud to present fiction from Lightspeed Magazine. Once a month,we feature a storyfrom Lightspeedâscurrent issue. This monthâs selection is âThe Twenty-One Second Godâ by Peter Watts. Enjoy! âIndividual:a living system maintaining both a higher level of internal cooperation and a lower level of internal conflict than either its components or any larger systems of which it is a component.â âFields and Levin, 2018 We lost so many souls today. Reports stream in across five continents; icons bloom on the map like blood spatters. Broken filters, zero latency, bandwidth that somehow blew through the roof when no one was looking. The hardware plays catch-up as best it can: this number of petaflops, that many milliseconds, ten thousand network nodes stuttering under the weight of increased traffic. Chemicals spiking and crashing in brains the world over: GABA and serotonin and a dozen others that would make perfect sense to you, if you were still here. Muscles locked in sudden tetanus. Adrenaline cascades shocking hearts into spastic fibrillation. It happened so much faster than meat could react. A million emergency subroutines struggled to wrest back some measure of control. They seem to have prevailed, for now. The fences are back up at least, the throttles re-engaged. The network was staggering back to some kind of Normal before Metaâs human overseers had time to do much more than blanch and panic. Nobody can say what just happened, except that it lasted twenty-one seconds and it spanned the world. For twenty-one seconds, countless human souls justdisappeared. Apparently Iâm one of them. â¢Â â¢Â â¢ I donât know whether to call it memory or hallucination: a flash that might be called a sort ofrevelation, in the same way you could describe the sun as a sort of bright candle. Everything made sense in a way that nothing ever has. I could see reality right down to the electronsâand now that Iâm back, itâs all gone. As though I dreamed the solution to Unified Field Theory and lost every last detail upon waking. Itâs strange watching a world flattened to two dimensions but the metaverse is down until they can figure out what happened. The numbers keep climbing. Frantic hordes jamming the lines to Telehealth. People picking themselves up off the streets, frightened, confused, marionettes whose strings were cut without warning and reconnected without explanation. Others have to beâfound. Theyâre finding us in our living rooms and beds. Finding us on the toilet. Theyâre finding us in cars, slack-jawed and drooling, locked in autopilot orbits with no destinations. Some are pretty much okay. Some are psychotic, traumatized; they stare into infinity and scream at the slightest touch. Some are vegetables. They keepfindingus. The curve bends into the exponential, thousands to tens of thousands to millions, no inflection point in sight. They havenât found me yet. Downstream effects, now. Businesses instantly bankrupt, search-and-rescue operations on indefinite hold, surgeries aborted midstream. The sort of disruptions youâd expect. But there are other things, too. Rumors and reports that canât be so easily chalked up to over-reliance on a technological monoculture. A research program at MIT just had its funding increased by two orders of magnitude. A half-dozen Peruvian SSI plants are mysteriously offline, although they were isolated on their own network. Andâlegal actions, of all things: thousands of them, launched from the ether during the blackout, drafted by rafts of automatic corporations that sprang miraculously into existence across a hundred jurisdictions. Rumors split and speciate like cracks across a frozen lake: stories of something that woke up and moved across the face of the waters and went away again. They graduate from conspiracy theory to working hypothesis in the space of an hour. Reputable sources neither confirm nor deny, but admit the possibility that somethingcoalescedin those moments. They arenât entirely sure what it was. Somebody calls it the Twenty-One Second God. From that point on, no one calls it anything else. The knock on the door barely registers. I donât know anyone else in this building. I didnât buzz anyone in. But there they are, two of them, standing in the hall. âCorwin Sukarto? We understand youâve experienced a problem with your Hogan bridge.â Theyâve found me. The curve bends a little more. But theyâre not with Meta. Theyâre wearing uniforms. âSir, we need you to come with us.â â¢Â â¢Â â¢ Iâm in a private downtown hospital with anonymous facades. Iâm in a bright cylindrical coffin full of chittering magnets. Iâm on a diagnostic table that projects my flayed body onto the wall and labels my insides with floating annotations I donât understand. The techs cowled in their headsets are Nella and Travis; they donât offer their last names and I donât ask. I donât ask them anything, really, although I suppose I should. I should be curious, at least, about whatâs happening to me. I havenât been curious about much of anything since you went away. They pull off their headsets while I put my clothes back on (Nella reminds me a little of your sister). An elevator lifts us a dozen floors; we emerge into a windowless, oak-paneled room where soft light seeps from the baseboards and overstuffed chairs squat around a glass coffee table. I remember a very old movie: an astronaut in a terrarium, surrounded by sterile props his alien captors think will make him feel at home. Here, at last, are the suits. They also travel in pairs. âIâm Karina,â one says. She wears an antique briefcase slung over her shoulder. âThis is Darcelle. Weâre with Metaverse. First of all, weâd like to say how sorry we are about what happened to you . . .â About. Notfor. âI donât understand,â I say. âThey said there were millions of us . . .â âFifteen million, give or take.â I turn to see a middle-aged man in uniform, closing the door behind him. âColonel Jim Moore,â Karina tells me. âWestHem Alliance.â She doesnât look especially pleased that the Colonel has served up such a definitive body count. A military escort. A medical workup that would strain the limits of a Platinum policy. Two-and-a-half hours so far, and they seem to be just getting started. âYou canât be devoting this much personal attention to fifteen million people,â I say. âNot just yet,â Darcelle admits. âYouâre special.â The Colonel clears his throat. âWhat Ms. Burrowes means is that you were assimilated during a window of high analytical interest.â Assimilated. More than hypothesis, then. Darcelle shoots a sidelong glance at Moore and recovers the ball. âWeâd like to retain you for further studies. You could be extremely valuable in helping us figure out what happened, helping us ensure it doesnât happen again. Youâd be well-compensated, of course. Weâve already recruited someone to fill in for you at Grassy Narrows, so thatâs not a problem. Youâre a, a soil scientist, right?â âClose enough.â I donât feel like arguing. Karina again: âBefore we go any further, Iâd just like to say again that we sincerely regret any discomfort or inconvenience or, or pain that this incident may have caused.â She fumbles with her briefcase and extracts a sheaf of paper half a centimeter thick. âWeâd like to compensate you for that too, up front. No questions asked.â She holds it out to me. I look but donât touch. âSorry about the format.â Karina affects a rueful smile. âNormally of course weâd just squirt it to your bridge, but, well . . .â âSend it to my watch,â I tell her. âWe usually do everything in the metaverse.â Her smile frays a little. âWeâre not really set up for niche media.â âItâs a difficult time for all of us,â Darcelle adds. I take it. Itâs forty-three single-spaced pages, but the amount theyâre offering is on the first. I have no idea whether itâs generous or not. I flip to the end. âNo signature line.â âOh, everythingâs on the record here. Once youâve received the document, verbal confirmation is all we need.â I rifle through the pages; the font seems deliberately designed to make my eyes glaze, but something twitches in my brain around page ten. I try to focus. âWaive the right to pursue any personal or class action . . .â Darcelle nods. âWe think itâs better to get the money to those who need it as quickly as possible, without any lengthy and expensive court proceedings.â âThese legal things can go on for years,â Karina adds. âAnd the outcome is never guaranteed.â I glance around the terrarium. Karina and Darcelle beam hundred-watt smiles. Nella and Travis seem strangely attentive to the decor. Colonel Moore stands ramrod straight and somehow manages to look very tired at the same time. He meets my eyes; after a moment he offers a tiny, almost indiscernible shake of the head. âFine,â I say. â¢Â â¢Â â¢ Moore escorts me to ground level. âWeâd like you to remain here for a few days,â he says as the elevator seals us in. âUh huh.â âYouarespecial, as Ms. Burrowes put it.â Thereâs an aftertaste in the wake of her name, although his voice is unimpeachably neutral. âWe think we could learn a lot from you.â âAnything you couldnât learn if I slept in my own bed?â âThis would be more efficient.â I wonder if Iâm allowed to refuse. âYou are of course free to leave any time you like.â Evidently the Colonel has been here before. âPermission to speak freely.â He raises an amused eyebrow, plays along. âGranted.â âI think Iâm free because you donât have a cage big enough to hold fifteen million of us. Not to mention the millions more who saw us disappear.â âYou think weâd incarcerate fifteen million innocent people.â âIsnât that the traditional approach? Circle the wagons, invoke national security? Control the narrative?â âIâd like to thinkfixing the problemmight be in there somewhere.â The doors part onto a pristine lobby where no one sits at Reception. Night has fallen; the glass facade separating us from the street is a dark mirror. âYouâre not wrong,â the Colonel admits. âAlthough we certainly have the resources to incarcerate a limited number of high-value assets. For their own protection, of course. I doubt anyone would complain, given whatâs at stake. And yet . . .â He gestures at the glass. Through the half-reflections I see a vehicle idling at the curb. âItâll take you home,â Moore says. âPick you up at 0830 tomorrow, assuming you choose to participate.â The building lets us out. I climb into the car, hesitate. Stick my foot back onto the curb to keep the door from closing. âIâmâsorry if I was a dick back there. I know youâre just doing your job.â âThatâs me all right.â Something tugs at the corner of his mouth. âJust following orders.â â¢Â â¢Â â¢ I answer their questions. I submit to their tests. I come in in the morning and go home at night in the backs of company cars that know where I live and refuse to take me anywhere else. The people who experiment on me are friendly enough. Nella and Travis treat their lab rats well and they donât talk down to me. The suits with their fastened smiles drop by now and then to impart encouraging platitudes. Colonel Moore visits the facility every few days, ever civil, ever distant. Other faces come and go, curious but not hostile. They say Iâm an optimum. Those who were swallowed before me earlier entered as loud voices in a small room: parts of some newborn not yet big enough to overwhelm, not yet old enough to have an agenda. Iâm told they remember infancy but no intent. Those assimilated later were never more than whispers in a hurricane: they remember as much as a single neuron might, if you ripped it from someoneâs head and demanded to know what the brain was thinking. I was raptured at some sweet spot between ignorance and unconsciousness. I at least remember a flash of focused insight, which the machines might be able to tag and track to something deeper. Iâm not catatonic. Iâm still sane. I may have you to thank for that. Travis tells me, with all the insight of someone who has never grieved, that grief rewires the brain. Cortisol and cytokines out of whack, hyperactivity in the amygdala and the anterior cingulate gyrus. They think it may have buffered me during the transition. Itâs one of their hypotheses. They have a lot of them. The details donât interest me. Some of us came back. Some of us didnât. They pull me from the scanner again. âHow much longer are we doing this?â Itâs been over a week. âDonât underestimate the value of time-series.â Nella shines a light in my eye, measures some response that a few million dollarsâ worth of medical equipment apparently hasnât recorded already. âYour brain underwent a huge shock. Some neurons got superstimulated, some got stuck. Functional clusters wiped out in an instant. Others crosswired. Parts of your brain that were never supposed to talk to each other started shooting the shit like old friends. Itâs a real mess in there.â âThink a massive overdose of psychoactives with a PTSD chaser,â Travis chimes in. Nella nods. âWe werenât around for the main event, so we gotta settle for recording the aftermath. Plot the recovery curve, backcast to t=0. The longer the time-series, the better the backcast.â âIâm not back to baseline yet?â Itâs been days. I remember you telling me once that even sticky neurons rebound after a few hours. âWe donât know,â she says. âItâs double-blind, so we donât get to see the actual analysis. But some node must still be doing something interesting, because nobodyâs called us off yet. Gotta keep the sample size consistent.â Thatâs what they call us. Not victims: too disempowering. Not complainants: we signed the waivers. Not survivors, because too many of us didnât. Not even people. Nodes. I canât deny it. I was not a person during the period under investigation. Oh, the body persisted; the flesh stayed warm, the organs kept functioning, the heart never missed a beat. Even the brain continued to spike and spark and even think, they say, although it was completely unaware of doing that. Of course, thatâs hardly unusual; you always delighted in pointing out that most of our thoughts are unconscious even at the best of times. Youâd talk about our autonomic modes, the way we iterate through complex daily routines on autopilot. Regale me with tales of sleepwalking artists and sex workers and even murderers, committing their acts of creation and commerce and destruction, unconscious the whole time. But even those zombies knew enough to answer to their own names. For twenty-one seconds, there was nothing in the world that could sayI am Corwin Sukarto. For twenty-one seconds I did not exist. No needs, no desires, no consciousness. No pain. So many people seem terrified by the prospect. Not everyone, though. As I understand it, half a billion people around the world actually aspire to that state. They call it Nirvana. I admit I never really saw the appeal, before now. â¢Â â¢Â â¢ They donât even know what it wants. Thatâs the wrong tense, of course. The Twenty-One Second God has been dead for two weeks now; even the hardware it inhabited has been throttled, time-lagged, crippled to the point it barely delivers VR anymore. Everything it was, everything it wanted: all in the past. And yet it continues toact: all those legal actions winding through the courts, the AIgents retained, the lobby groups that coalesced seemingly out of nowhere on its behalf. The rights of mayfly deities. The creation and the murder of a hive mind. Restitution strategies that would compel some random assortment of people to plug their brains into a resurrected Whole for an hour a week, so 21 might be born again. All planned out and launched in those fleeting moments between emergence and annihilation. All running, now, on autopilot. These motions and countermotions, this network of activity crisscrossing the globe at lightspeed: almost a mind in its own right, some say. The campaign itself might be sapient. But nobodyâs certain what itâs campaigning for. The legal claims are straightforward: 21 wants its life back. Apparently it has a survival instinct. That shouldnât be surprising for an entity with fifteen million brain stems, but those in the know assure me that things arenât quite that simple. Some say it was barely conscious even when it was alive, that consciousness itself is just ignorance in action. It only boots up when the universe hands us something unexpected: when the brain has to learn new tricks or decide between competing imperatives. Ask the pianist, mid-concerto, to think about what their fingers are doing. Ask the martial artist which muscles are moving in which order, why they feinted left instead of right. Once the knowledge has been assimilated, being aware of it only destroys the performance. The brain aspires to error reduction, the self to annihilation. Phi isnât a line but a curve, rising and peaking and arcing back to zero as the system approaches perfect knowledge. We baseline humans never even glimpse the summit; our thoughts are simple and our models are childish stick-figures, the world is always taking us by surprise. But whatâs unexpected to a being with fifteen million times the computational mass of a human mind? All gods are omniscient. All gods are zombies. They say 21 may have been awake during those first few instants when it had swallowed only a few hundred souls. When it swallowed me. But thousands? Millions? The more it knew, the less itknew. It became a concert pianist in complete control of every keyboard. It grew too smart to be awake: as brilliant as any deity, as conscious as any stone. They say it wants its life back. But how can a stone want anything? â¢Â â¢Â â¢ All the nodes get cafeteria passes. Maybe the free food is supposed to make it easier for us to socialise. Maybe the place is infested with pickups to feed our chatter into some deep-learning algo panning for insight. Maybe they just donât want us heading off-site for lunch if they think of another test. We never really talk much, though. Even when the other nodes do sit together, Iâve never heard the conversation stray beyond a murmuredpass the salt. Whatever comfort we take from each other, we take it in silence. I donât even know any of their names. Iâd rather just talk to you anyway. âMay I join you?â Colonel Moore, a mug of coffee in his hand. I gesture to the seat across from me. He sits, sets his coffee on the table between us. âAny new results?â I ask, before he can speak. He hesitates. âSeems to be a bandwidth correlation, not that thatâs any great surprise. Most of the nodes were wired into fantasy scenarios. Games, worldsims, personal fantasies. Fat-pipe stuff.â âI wasnât.â I was logged in to an online support group, sick with the loss of you, able only to mourn. âSo I understand.â He sips his coffee. âIâve been told that therapeutic tulpas can be helpful.â âSo have I.â But thatâs one of the marvelous hazards of marriage to a neuroscientist: you learn to wonder about implications. Thanks to you I know that when you anesthetize half a brain, the other half might manifest a whole new personality. I know that when the drugs wear off, that short-lived personaâthat standalone, autonomousbeingâgets swallowed back into the greater whole. Tulpas donât take up much real estateâa few functional clusters here and thereâbut theyâd still pass any Turing test you could throw at them. Whoâs to say weâre not waking something up every time we activate the partition? Whoâs to say we donât commit murder every time we shut it down? âTMS is also very effective,â the Colonel continues. âDoesnât stick, though. Propanolol, if you prefer old-school pharma.â Because of course no one should ever be crippled by grief. No one should be compromised by anything so vulgar. Ugly things, Pleistocene things, these feelings. Edit them out. Let the past lie. Get on with it. Odd that heâs so conversant with the subject, though. âAre you married, Colonel?â Heâs at least as old as I am, old enough for bygone ways. âI am.â âStill together?â âWe see each other regularly.â He doesnât want to talk about it; whatever I sense in him now goes deeper than an unhappy marriage. But I do sense something. Loss. His own kind of grief. Iâve been in this place long enough to know what it looks like from the outside. Figures. Over four hundred people in this mad-scientist lab, and the closest thing I can find to a kindred spirit is the professional killer. â¢Â â¢Â â¢ Someoneâs waiting for me outside my building. He calls me by name; Iâve never seen him before. He begs me to share my wisdom, and does not believe me when I say I have none to offer. I am part of the overmind, he insists. I am connected to the Divine; I have seen things denied mortal men. I am the voice of God. I remind him that God has fifteen million voices. I wish him luck finding one of the others. I warn him that God has turned many of us into rutabagas. He grows agitated; I have aduty, he growls. God did not bless me so that I could keep His Truth to myself. It is not mine to keep. Iâm afraid he might turn violent, but Iâm inside before he can do more than rant. Itâs happening everywhere. There are lists in circulation: guerilla footage of survivors stumbling through the aftermath, squeezed through facial recognition and matched against public records. Confidential databases inexplicably set free. Weâre public domain now, some of us anyway. People seek us out. Some are content to touch the hems of our garments; others want more, a taste of whatever cosmic insights we forged when part of something greater. Should they risk that operation. Should they go to Heaven. Should they bet it all on #3. We werenât just the voice of God: we were the guts as well. The arms and legs. The synapses. God literally stitched Itself together out of our bodies, an inconceivably complex jigsaw assembled from any meat that happened to be wired into the right servers. Surely such an intellect learned everything, while it was alive. Surely its pieces still remember what it learned. I tell the Colonel about the encounter. He reminds me that I can stay at the facility. I admit Iâm tempted. It would be more convenient. It would be safer, now that the AIrheads have found me. But I can only talk to you here, Ada. I canâtfeelyou the way I do at home. And Iâve never fully shaken the belief that theyâd keep me here by force, if the optics permitted and the damage hadnât already been done. Theyâd probably like nothing better than to see me cage myself. Darcelleâs smile tightens like shrink-wrap when I decline. The Colonel shrugs and offers to post a microdrone outside my building. Nothing flashy or intimidating or even noticeable to the casual observer. An invisible eye in the sky, smart enough to tell refugees from religious nutsâdifferent mindsets have different tells, to eyes that can read saccades and muscle twitches from fifty metersâso I wonât have to worry about embarrassing false positives. The homeless and the destitute will be able to approach me as they always have; only those of ill intent will even know itâs there. I thank him, and accept his kind offer, and we both pretend his machines havenât been staking out my every move from the start. â¢Â â¢Â â¢ Something about my ventromedial prefrontal cortex has them scratching their heads. âThat canât be right,â Travis says. âItâs supposed to besendingto the hipp.â Nella furrows her brow. âCould the Hogan bridge have done that?â âMaybe third-order downstream effect or something. But we checked it last week.â âMaybe we can book some time on Monet. Bet it would chew through this no problem.â âMonet?â I ask. âTheyâre booked solid for a year.â âWeâre the 21 club, Trav. Weâve got a VIP pass. I say we use it.â âCould just be an artifact. Maybe we should run him through again.â I add a decibel or two: âWhatâs Monet?â They snap back into a reality that includes me. âMOANAI,â Nella says. âAI up in Waterloo, maybe six times human synapse count. Perimeter uses it for theoretical cosmology, but it can do other stuff as well.â âSometimes it dreams,â Travis adds. âIs it awake?â âChrist no. Why would you say that?â I shrug. âSynapse count. Dreams.â He smiles, shakes his head. âNah. Dreams are just injections of noise to prevent overfitting. But when you loosen the parameters like that you can open up whole new ways to interpret a data set.â âBesides,â Nella says, âconsciousness always wrecks the analysis.â Itâs not the only thing. A voltage spike fries MOANAIâs servers while theyâre still booking the appointment; a substation blows out three hundred kilometers away and the whole campus goes dark. Not that brownouts and violent weather are anything unusual. Our infrastructure grows so fragile; the resources to maintain it stretch thinner by the day. Even without the heat waves and the superstorms, itâs a lucky week that passes without the lights going out at least once. But thatâs why there are safeguards. Breakers behind breakers. Stacks of coffin-sized batteries gorging on sunlight, primed to ration it back the moment anything drops off-grid. None of itâs foolproof, of course. What is, these days? But the odds. The coincidence. I find out later that MOANAIâs not the only player to drop off the board under suspicious circumstances. DARPA had a small hive running down in Lawrence Livermore until last week: a dozen souls seasoned with neural dust and connected through a central hub. Something went wrong. The ultrasonic pulses the dust motes used to talk to each other started inducing spike trains in the somatosensory cortex. One person screamed that her arm was monstrous, alien, sawed it half off before anyone could stop her. Two others gouged their own eyes out. I canât imagine what they must have been seeing, and theyâll never be able to tell us. Every node in that hive is either dead or vegetative. Everyoneâs still very nice to me. Nobody tells me anything that might get me upset. They donât realize how much they say to each other when Iâm just around the corner; I guess when youâre fighting rearguard against a dead god itâs easy to forget the lab rats underfoot. But I see past the facade. Their tests grow more frequent, more intrusive. I show up earlier and they keep me later. Theyâre running scared, and theyâve got nothing. Itâs been a month and Twenty-One still reaches out from the grave, casually swatting their best countermeasures as if they were flies. â¢Â â¢Â â¢ You would have liked Nella. She even talks like you. You wouldâve pricked up your ears at that offhand commentâ âconsciousness always wrecks the analysisâ âand instantly recognized a kindred spirit. Sometimes I close my eyes and hear you in her: visionâs a lie, realityâs an abstraction, consciousness itself is a contaminant. The details are pure alchemy to meâfree-energy-minimizationandMarkov blanketsandperiaqueductal grayâbut she spells out the broad strokes like sheâs telling a ghost story around a campfire. Consciousness is a delivery platform for feelings; feelings are a manifestation of need; need exists to promote survival; and survival fucks up your whole worldview. Predator-detection algorithms that metastasize into religion. Hyperbolic discounts, selling out the future for short-term payoffs. Pareidolia and availability cascades and all those other myriad biases that helped us survive by lying about reality: we wouldnât be conscious in the first place if they werenât built in. Of course, Nellaâs just a kid. Words tumble out of her like puppies. You were more eloquent, more concise. You nailed it with two sentences and a wicked smile:You can see the world as it is, or you can care whether you live or die. You canât optimize along both axes simultaneously. These days, I canât seem to do either. â¢Â â¢Â â¢ They still donât know who, but they just found out how: Meta lied about the tech. It was the fundamental safeguard, baked into every Hogan bridge ever made: limit the bandwidth. Connect minds to machines, if you must. Connect brains to each otherâbut use a straw, not a firehose. Share sensations but not selves; keep latency far away from that three-hundred-millisecond threshold where parts begin cohering into wholes. Never forget the terrifying existential truth behind every ghost in every machine: Consciousness does not multiply; it expands. But it turns out those fuckers used a firehose after all. Nobody knew because patents describe concepts, not implementation. Nobody knew because the tech based on those concepts was proprietary. Nobody knew because it worked, and it worked because MetaverseTMmade the firehoseactlike a straw; they introduced a time lag into every signal so that nothing moved fast enough to sync up. Itâs still not clear what they were planning to do with all that extra capacity. Caught in the headlights, pants around their ankles, they canât get their stories straight. They were leaving room for sensory upgrades still in the works. They were developing remote, inorganic teletulpas to improve mental health for all. They were leaving space to hold a whole new Internet, against that inevitable day when failing infrastructure or terrorist activity takes the old one down. Maybe they were even going for a hive mind of their own, although their denials on that front were strenuous and immediate. In the meantime, someone snuck in through the back door. Someone disabled the lag and unleashed a globe-spanning corpus callosum that connected fifteen million brains as intimately as the hemispheres in one connect to each other. There was nowein those moments, any more than there are two people in my head right now. There was only the Twenty-One Second God. The rest is history. For those of us caught up by that history, nothing much has changed. If anything, things for me have improved a little. At least I donât have to deal with Karina and Darcelle anymore. â¢Â â¢Â â¢ He finds me in the cafeteria again and asksâpolitely, as alwaysâfor the pleasure of my company. He sits, relocates a coffee and a plate of kruggets to the table, slides his tray to one side. He focuses on these precise, robotic movements, eyes on the table, on his lunch. He sits quietly, collecting his thoughts. âIâve been going over our findings. Trying to make some kind of sense of them.â He grunts a soft laugh. âNot that thereâs much hope of that, of course. I donât have nearly the expertise the staff here does, and between you and me I donât think they have a clue either.â Not like this man to waste words on preamble. âWhat can I do for you, Colonel?â âI was just wondering what it was like,â he says softly. I donât know what to tell him. I donât know what to tell any of them. Iâve tried often enough. I try again. âYou know how, when you close your eyes, you still know where all your parts are? You just know, without looking, where you end and everything else begins?â He nods. âImagine that you knew, in the exact same way, that you went on forever. That everything else was as much a part of you as your arms and legs.â I get the faintest sense of impatience behind that disciplined facade. Not that I blame him: Iâm not saying anything I havenât already spoken into the record a dozen times. I try to give him a little more. âThere wereâinsights, I suppose you could call them. Profound insights, even, butââI tapped the side of my headââthey donât fit in here. I remember knowing such amazing things. I just canât remember what any of them were.â And then, of course, I knew nothing at all. This dazzling burst of enlightenment everyoneâs so interested inâit only lasted a moment before I drowned in an ocean of souls. But Iâve said all that before, too. It still isnât what heâs looking for. âIâve seen the interviews,â he says at last. âIâm familiar with religious rapture and proprioception failure. And I donât mean to intrude, butâbut maybe Iâm not asking what it was like so much as how it made youfeel.â Itâs not a huge difference, but no one has asked me in quite that way before. And I realize something else: this man is desperate. Heâs so desperate heâll come here and interrogate a specimen whoâs already been interviewed and sampled and scanned down the molecules, in the faint, fading hope that some useful insight might have slipped past the machinery. Heâs desperate because theyâre losing. I look at my half-eaten lunch, at his untouched one. âI was married a long time.â âTwenty-one years. Something of a record, these days.â And then, because youâre supposed to say it and he hasnât yet: âIâm sorry.â âPeople donât get that,â I tell him. âIt was the whole deal: traditional; antique, even. Monogamous. First-person sex, we used âskins maybe a dozen times in two decades.â The ever-present weight on my diaphragm stirs, begins to rise. âAda told me on some level the brain canât really tell the difference between losing an arm and losing a loved one. The same circuits light up whether the painâs physical or emotional. I always thought that was almostâromantic.â He opens his mouth. âIâmââ âSo imagine your arm doesnât just get torn off. Imagine it withers and rots on your shoulder, imagine it takes months to die. And at some point, way later than you should have, you finally stop being a selfish asshole andâand tell her itâs okay. She can stop fighting. She can let go.â The weight is lodged in my throat now, but I keep going. âI wonder what part of the brain parsesthatkind of injury.â âIâm sorry. I shouldnât have asked.â âYou wanted to know how it made me feel. You have to know this before you can know that. Because once the arm is gone, everything just goes gray. Youâre not connected to the universe; youâre not even really connected to your own body. You justâexist. âAnd then this happens.â I take a breath, let it out, feel a twinge of grim satisfaction that itâs almost steady. âYou get swept up in a moment of blinding, divine revelation, and youâre connected to all of creation and you realize, right down in your bones, that we insignificant specks of meat and boneâwe just donâtmatter. And then the Twenty-One Second God swallows you whole and snuffs you out and againânothing matters, nothingcanmatter because you donât exist. But then you come back, and the sirens are blaring and the world is on its side but sheâs still gone, and soÂ .Â .Â . once again . . .â I breathe. The weight sinks grudgingly into my chest and goes back to sleep, leaden, comfortable. Everything is back to normal. âMaybe thatâs why Iâm your optimum data point. Maybe thatâs why Iâm not a vegetable now. Revelation wasnât such a shock to me because I was alreadyâinoculated. Nothing really changed.â I look at the Colonel. I donât know whether Iâve given him new data or merely corroborated the old. I donât know if Iâm reporting to a superior or commiserating with a comrade. I donât know anything about this man. âI envy you,â he says. â¢Â â¢Â â¢ I donât have to go in tomorrow. None of us do. Nella and Travis are relocating. Theyâve got the data they need, thereâs no point in staying shackled to these virtual-vivisection machines any longer. Itâs just numbers from here on in, the programâthis part of it, anywayâis going full-on analytical. At long last, they say, theyâre making progress. I donât think I believe them. I remember the light in your eyes when you were closing on a solution. Your excitement was almost predatory, you didnât stop moving. Whenever something called you awayâwheneverIdidâyou couldnât wait to get back to it. You glowed. Youvibrated. Thereâs none of that in these people. Thereâs something in their eyes, but itâs not that. Haunted. Maybe thatâs the word. Maybe theyâll conduct their analysis in some secret bunker. Maybe there is no analysis. It isnât lost on themâthe freak accidents, the tragic BCI malfunctions, the misfortune befalling those pursuing certain avenues of research. Maybe theyâre right, maybe thereâs simply no more they can accomplish here. Or maybe theyâve decided to leave the game before the targets on their chests get any bigger. Itâs not my problem. The moneyâs in my account. Grassy Narrows waits at the end of the month. Your dimming echo still lingers throughout this two-bedroom still-life I call home. Iâve wiped my biometrics, said my goodbyes. Except to the Colonel, who didnât come in today. â¢Â â¢Â â¢ A new hive woke up today in Indore. The videoâs on every feed: two hundred souls wired together, stacked in hexagonal pods like honeycomb, tended by machines that look like chrome grasshoppers. Pallets writhe in slow peristalsis, rocking their occupants around an eccentric orbit optimized to prevent bedsores. Tubes carry waste and nutrients; limbs twitch to milliamp currents that keep the muscles from atrophy. Fiberop sprouts from the base of each skull and disappears out-of-frame en route to some central server. The mouths are all smiling, but I think that might have been added in post. Not an accident, this time. Not a malfunction or a hijacking. These people volunteered. Itâs been in the works for years now; it wasnât supposed to go up for years yet. But 21âaccelerated things. Wars always push technology into fast-forward, even the quiet ones. They say weâre ten years ahead of where we were a year ago. The Indian Institute of Technology speaks ofthe Great Coalescence, paints pictures of Natureâs secrets laid bare by a mind combining the cognitive power of a supercomputer with the imaginations of a million dreamers. They havenât reported any actual breakthroughs yet, but itâs only been a day. Even Yahweh took six to find his feet. Thereâs a waiting list. A second installation is set to go online in Kolkata the day after tomorrow, a third in Colombo. Negotiations are underway with Japan and Thailand and Malaysia. Theyâre calling it the Moksha Mind. â¢Â â¢Â â¢ A growing chorus of voices say we should just throw in the towel. No army of lawyers, no swarm of AIgents could possibly win a war against a coherent self with fifteen million times the synapse count of a human mind, no matter how long itâs been dead. Oh, we win the occasional battleâbut some suggest that even 21âs rare legal defeats are deliberate, part of some farsighted strategy to delay ultimate victory until vital technological milestones have been reached. The Twenty-One Second God is beyond mortal ken, they say. Even our victories promote Its Holy Agenda. I donât know if Iâd go that far. Then again, maybe Iâd go farther. Bacteria would still be the pinnacle of life if chloroplasts and mitochondria had retained their autonomy. Multicellular life wouldnât exist if eukaryotic cells had never graduated from competition to cooperation. Every major evolutionary transition began with individuals trading in their individuality. Every leap forward was an act of assimilation. Weâre already colonies of colonies. Maybe this is just another step in a journey thatâs already lasted four billion years, maybeâwithout these periodic episodes ofcoalescenceâlife on Earth would be nothing but a seething mass of cells, trying ceaselessly to outbreed each other. Not that going down the Metazoan road hasnât also turned the planet into a shithole. Still. Better than Cancer World. â¢Â â¢Â â¢ There was a time when this place thrummed: rivers of people lined up to depart for far-flung destinations; others, rumpled and red-eyed, spilling into the concourse like blood from a torn capillary. Clots of humanity clustered around overhead displays, checking departures and arrivals. Dogs and drones and thugs with badges, pushing their way through the crowd, seizing random dark-skinned strangers and disappearing them into Secondary. I remember it so clearly, though I was only eight or nine at the time: cavernous halls, jam-packed and cacophonous. Now there are so few here that I can see him halfway down the concourse. His footsteps click and echo in the empty spaces. I think about what to say as he approaches. Notare you following meorhow did you know Iâd be here. Nothing so obvious. Everyone knows everything, these days. Moore knows more. âCome to say goodbye?â He shakes his head. âTo ask you to reconsider.â âIâve considered a thousand times, Colonel. You donât spend three yearsâ carbon allowance on a whim.â âThat doesnât mean youâre doing it for the right reasons.â âI just want to go home.â âYou were born in Cincinnati.â âI have family in Sumatra.â âWhich is how you got the visa, yes. And how do you think your family will react when they learn that the only reunion they can look forward to is visiting some robot that rolls you over like a corpse every half hour to keep the sores from festering?â I watch him watching me. âIâm sorry,â he says after a moment. âI donât mean to presume.â I wait for him to continue. âYou canât just give up,â he says at last. âIs that what Iâm doing?â âItâs suicide, Corwin. You of all people must know that. Plug into that thing and you deprecate from soul down to subroutine.â âMaybe a subroutine doing something useful. Maybe a subroutine figuring out how to undo all the damage weâve done.â âYouâll never know, though, will you? Youâll just be another neuron firing blindly away, never knowing if the brain youâre part of is solving the secrets of the universe or if youâre justâfiring, with no purpose at all. You could be giving up your life for random static.â I feel the corner of my lip tug into a smile. âDo you really think theyâd spend all that money, invest in all that hardware, recruit all those peopleâfor static?â âI think experiments fail sometimes. I think the grander the experiment, the greater the risk. That hive hasnât done a damn thing since it went online, as far as anyone can tell. It just swallows souls and lets them rot.â âI donât think even you believe that,â I say. âIhopethat. Itâs my best-case scenario. Because otherwise itâs biding its time and gathering its strength, and at this rate itâll be bigger than 21 by the end of the year. When it does act, weâll have no idea what hit us.â âWhy would it be hostile?â âIt wouldnât have to be. It could roll over in its sleep and crush us like an insect.â Hives are no longer legal here. I wonder in passing if WestHem is planning to preempt, but I suspect that ship has sailed; to take out Moksha now theyâd have to bomb a string of cities from India to Japan, declare war on a dozen countries. Not easy to justify when your enemy hasnât actually done anything. âI appreciate your efforts, Colonel. Honestly. Butââ âYou know, youâre a very interesting person.â Suddenly his expression is unreadable. I shake my head. âIâm a glorified gardener.â âYet consider your circumstance. Ringside for everything. Buffered by your own grief against the worst effects of the rapture. Dead center of our high-value demographic, but somehow weâve learned very little from you we can use. Thanks to your marriage you have just enough familiarity to understand the jargon, but not enough for anyone to worry about what aglorified gardenermight overhear. And here you are, reporting back to the Hive. Somehow you even managed to jump the queue.â âA completely different Hive,â I remind him. âPerhaps. But maybe we have it all wrong. We assume 21âs trying to resurrect itself, but it was hardly the first hive on the planet. It was just the firstâunconstrained one. That we know of. Andsomethinghad to break those filters. Something brought it to life. Now Mokshaâs online, years ahead of schedule. Another hive started up right under our noses over in Oregon, some new organic technology we never heard of before. We canât even legally shut it down because meat doesnât qualify ashardwareunder the Interface Act. And thatâs only the tip of the iceberg. We think there are others, moreâclandestine.â âSo you think it was, what? Some kind of reproductive strategy?â âSpawning cycle. Field test. How can we know? Weâre earthworms, trying to divine the thoughts of astronauts.â A gift for metaphor. This man is never what I expect. âOr maybe itâs not that,â he continues. âMaybe all hives are connected in ways we donât understand. Maybe 21 and Moksha and the Bicams are one and the same.â âYou think it reprogrammed me. Turned me into some kind of sleeper agent.â âI doubt there wouldâve been much programming involved. It had fifteen million souls to choose from. At least a few of them must have met the specs right off the shelf. Followed their own agenda for their own reasons, never even suspecting that they were doing exactlyââ âYou could stop me,â I point out. âWhat makes you think we havenât tried?â Huh. Of course they would. âThen again,â he adds, âif we could stop you, we wouldnât have to.â âThen why are you here?â âIâm hoping maybe you can stop yourself.â I shake my head. âIâm justâIâm tired of being a prokaryote, Colonel. Iâm tired of being alone.â âYouâre tired ofbeing.â âJimââ âIf there are hostilities,â he says. âIf youâre on the other side.â âThen there wonât be ameto worry about. Isnât that the whole point?â His face doesnât change. âDonât do this.â âMy flightâs boarding.â He lets me go. Maybe Iâm a friend. Maybe Iâm only an asset heâs failed to keep out of enemy hands. Maybe the ghost of the Twenty-One Second God is invisibly at work all around us, iterating through the walls and the wires: running interference so the shutdown signal never reaches my ride, so the executive order to cancel the flight never makes it through, so any attempt to use force would attract the attention of security drones ever watchful for signs of violence. I feel eyes on me as I walk into the boarding tunnel. I imagine them watching as the airplane, only half-full, taxis away from the dock. Maybe heâs right. Maybe you are, too. Maybe, if you want to see the world through clear eyes, you canât care whether you live or die. Peter Watts is a former marine biologist, flesh-eating-disease survivor, and convicted felon (long story) whose novelsâdespite an unhealthy focus on space vampiresâhave become required texts for university courses ranging from Philosophy to Neuropsychology. His work is available in 24 languages, has appeared in 36 best-of-year anthologies, and been nominated for 61 awards. His (somewhat shorter) list of 23 actual wins includes the Hugo, the Shirley Jackson, and the Seiun. He seems to be especially popular in countries with a history of Soviet occupation, and he hated the U.S. before it was cool. He lives in Toronto with fantasy author Caitlin Sweet, four cats, two rabbits, whatever injured/convalescing rodents theyâve been able to rescue from the jaws of the aforementioned cats, and a gang of tough raccoons who shake them down for kibble on the porch every summer.

    "title": "Everything to Know About ‘One Piece’ Season 2’s New Crewmate, Tony Tony Chopper",
    "article_text": "Even if you haven’t been an ardentOne Piecefan for over 25 years, you might have become intrigued by one particular character thanks to his adorable Chibi appearance: Tony Tony Chopper. The global phenomenon manga and anime series can be a daunting task to get into, given the sheer volume of pages and episodes, but Netflix’s live-action adaptation of Eiichiro Oda’s epic hasopened up his pirate world to wider audiences. And after Chopper’slive-action hybrid animation reveal at Tudumlast weekend, his popularity will no doubt skyrocket based on the cuteness teased through Mikaela Hoover’s instantly endearing performance. Don’t be fooled, though; this future member of the Straw Hat Crew is more than an adorable pet mascot medic, he’s one of their greatest fighters and fiercest friends. Here’s a quick primer on just who Chopper is ahead ofOne Pieceseason two’spremiere in 2026 on Netflix. Chopper was an outcast reindeer with a blue nose who ate the Human-Human Fruit, which turned him into a reindeer-human hybrid. This Devil Fruit bestowed him with consciousness, a high level of intelligence, and the ability to pick up on human languages. After he consumed the fruit, Chopper was fully rejected by his herd, a lot like Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, except if he had suddenly mutated and could get real jacked. Alone in the wilderness of Drum, Chopper eventually crosses paths with the mad scientist Dr. Hiriluk, who is intrigued by his transformation and asks Chopper to be his assistant.Actor Mark Harelik (Preacher), who was cast as the wild-haired doctor for the Netflix series, described Tony Tony Chopper’ first friend on Instagram as filled with “passion and persistence” and teased that maybe the doctor shouldn’t be “so eager to try untested experiments” on his patients. View this post on Instagram This bit of foreshadowing echoes his grim fate, which propels Chopper to learn more about medicine underDr. Kureha when she takes him in.Katey Sagal (Futurama) plays Kureha, theOne Piecefavorite who would go on to teach Chopper everything she knows. The team-up between Kureha and Chopper is something we’re really looking forward to in season two. Nami falls ill near the Drum Kingdom, and Luffy and the crew seek out help in the frozen expanse. Luckily, they meet Dr. Kureha and Chopper. In exchange for helping cure the Straw Hat’s navigator, the crew assists in freeing Drum Kingdom from its tyrannical ruler. Chopper is reluctant to join the Straw Hats but after being snatched by the Foxy Pirate Crew as a member against his will, Luffy liberates him from that by winning a battle against them. He then gives Chopper the choice to join the Straw Hats of his own free willâand eventually, after a lot of his trademark reluctance at being perceived, he gives in. Much like the preview we saw on Tudum, Chopper has his quirks, like hiding the wrong way or breaking out into a dance when complimented, something he gets visibly ornery over (but secretly loves). We can’t wait to see him visibly struggle to hide his excitement when he finally finds a family with the Straw Hats. In addition to his intelligence, Chopper becomes bi-pedal and stays in the form of a cute pet for the most part. However, he can evolve into three forms (kind of like PokÃ©mon evolutions) and can go back to the one of his choosing, which happens to cause a lot of cuteness aggression. The other forms come in handy when the Straw Hats are in battle. Chopper uses “Walk Point,” which heightens his reindeer agility and animalistic senses; “Brain Point,” which is the humanoid pet form he stays in with a big head for the smarts it grants along with a small body; and “Heavy Point,” which is when he looks like a jacked human with reindeer features that helps him beat the crap out of enemies. With the use of a drug called the “Rumble Ball,” which looks like a yellow gum ball, Chopper can access even more transformation points and becomes an uncontrollable monster if he’s not too careful. Luffy’s tendency to recruit Straw Hats always comes down to their dreams and Chopper’s is one of the sweetest ones. After losing Dr. Hiriluk and seeing death spread in ways that existentially changes him, Chopper’s dream is to cure the world of all diseases. It makes him perfect for the Straw Hat Crew as their doctor on board and trusty secret weapon in battle. One Pieceseason two will be released sometime in 2026 on Netflix. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "Reddit Sues Anthropic, Accusing It of Illegal Data Use",
    "article_text": "It’s well known that the AI industry rests on shaky legal ground. Companies like OpenAI have built their multi-billion-dollar businesses on the backs of vast tranches of training data, much of which is sourced from copyrighted content. The creators of that content know they’re being ripped off and, more and more, it’s leading to lawsuits. We got another reminder of this conundrum this week, when Reddit sued Anthropic over its use of Redditors’ posts in its training data. Reddit’slawsuit, which was filed Wednesday, accuses the Amazon-backed AI company of breaching its user agreement. “As far back as December 2021…Anthropic was alreadyâwithout authorization and in direct violation of Redditâs User Agreementâtraining Claude on Reddit usersâ posts, the lawsuit claims. Anthropic, whose flagship product is the AI chatbotClaude, has tried to position itself as the “good guy” of the AI industryâa company that plays by the rules and advances AI frameworks that are considerate of safety and ethical considerations. But, despite its “white knight” PR, the company has repeatedly run intolegal issuesthat throw its supposedly “ethical” businesses practices into question. This week’s litigation is yet another reminder of that. The lawsuit accuses Anthropic of unjustly enriching itself while also breaching the platform’s user agreement. The suitclaims thatthe AI company’s bots have visited its website over 100,000 times since 2024. âThis case is about the two faces of Anthropic: the public face that attempts to ingratiate itself into the consumerâs consciousness with claims of righteousness and respect for boundaries and the law, and the private face that ignores any rules that interfere with its attempts to further line its pockets,â the litigation states. It adds that Anthropic “continues to publicly admit that it trains its Al technologies on Reddit content.” When reached for comment by Gizmodo, an Anthropic spokesperson provided the following statement: âWe disagree with Reddit’s claims and will defend ourselves vigorously.” The war over AI content usage has become one of the industry’s most prominent dilemmas. Platforms and artists are aware that their content is being pilfered for the sake of AI fuel, and they’re firing up the lawsuit machine to fight back. At this point, OpenAI has been sued by so many different people and institutions that it’s hard to keep track of it allâeveryone fromSarah Silverman,ÂTa-Nahisi Coates,George R. R. Martin, and Jonathan Franzen,Â to theCenter for Investigative Reporting,ÂThe Intercept, aÂvariety of newspapers(including The Denver Post and the Chicago Tribune), andÂsome YouTubers. The New York Times is currentlysuing the companyon similar grounds. Reddit has sought to insulate itself from getting ripped off by developing contracts with AI companies that clearly stipulate an exchange of content for money. Last February, Redditstruck a dealwith Google that allowed the tech giant to use the content on its platform as AI fodder, so long as the company coughed up $60 million a year. Not long afterward,a similar deal was struckwith OpenAI. Anthropic doesn’t seem to have gotten the memo, but it surely will now. More and more, it seems like this is the new model for the AI industry: To quote one of my favorite TV shows, you’regoing to have to pay the troll tollif you don’t want to get pounded by a lawsuit. It’s obviously a situation that favors large companies. AI companies with the resources will be able to buy access to large amounts of data to fuel their AI habits. Smaller, lesser-resourced firms will be shit out of luck. AIAmazonAnthropicGoogleOpenAIReddit Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Festival-Standout Creature Feature ‘Ick’ Is Getting a Limited Theatrical Run",
    "article_text": "Regular moviegoers are well familiar with Fathom Entertainment, the company behindnostalgic returns of fan-favorite filmsto the big screen (includingIndiana Jones and the Last Crusadelater this month). But it also showcases new films from time to time, including a recent festival standout that audiences might not have gotten to see at the theater otherwise. It’s a horror comedy titledIckthat was well-received at the 2024 Toronto International Film Festival as well as the 2024 Fantastic Fest (whereio9 saw and liked it). Ickis directed by Joseph Kahn, noted for his extensive resume of stylish music videos as well as previous features likeTorqueandBodied. Appropriately, one ofIck‘s standout qualities is its soundtrack, which is stuffed with pop-punk sing-alongs from early 2000s bands (Blink-182, Paramore, etc.)âimportant nostalgia fodder for the main character, played by Brandon Routh, a high school teacher who’s still longing for his decades-old glory days on the same high school’s football field. And, of course, since this is a horror movie, the town where said high school is located has a problem described by the movie title: a mysterious and dangerous icky substance that seems to be growing in power.

    "title": "ISS Conference Scrapped as NASA Budget Cuts Threaten Crew and Cargo",
    "article_text": "The International Space Station (ISS) still has a few years left in orbit before it’s due for retirement, but the future of the orbital lab is looking a little shaky as NASA is forced to tighten its purse strings. The Center for the Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS), which operates the ISS National Lab, is canceling an upcoming space station research conference, SpaceNewsreported. The ISS Research and Development Conference was due to be held at the end of July in Seattle, but CASISannouncedthis week that, after consulting with NASA, “the current regulatory and budgetary environment does not support holding” the annual conference this year. The announcement comes a little over a month after the release of thecurrent administration’s so-called skinny budget,which included funding for NASA in 2026. The budget proposes a $6 billion cut to the agency, 24% less than NASAâs current $24.8 billion budget for 2025. The budget also proposes reducing the size of the ISS crew ahead of its planned retirement in 2030, when itâs expected to be replaced by multiple commercial space stations. Funding for the ISS could be reduced by a quarter, from $1.24 billion to $920 million, according to the proposed budget for 2026. “Crew and cargo flights to the station would be significantly reduced,” the budget proposal read. “The stationâs reduced research capacity would be focused on efforts critical to the Moon and Mars exploration programs.” During a briefing held in late May, Dana Weigel, NASA’s ISS program manager, revealed that the space agency had already been facing resource issues regarding the space station before the 2026 budget proposal. “The station has been faced with a cumulative multi-year budget reduction,” Weigel isquotedin SpaceNews as saying. “Thatâs the challenge that Iâve had that weâve been managing through today. That has left us with some budget and resource challenges that result in less cargo.” The cargo includes supplies for onboard crew members. For more than two decades, the space agency has maintained a crew of at least four NASA astronauts on board the ISS, along with international crew members from Russia, Japan, Canada, and other countries.Â NASA has previously flown four or five cargo missions a year, but the agency has only planned for three drop-offs in 2025. “Weâre evaluating the potential for moving to three crew,” Weigel said during the briefing. “Thatâs something that weâre working through and trying to assess today.” NASA is also considering extending the duration of missions on the ISS from six to eight months, Ars Technica previouslyreported. Meanwhile, five commercial space stations, including Orbital Reef, Axiom Station, and Starlab, are currently in the works but nowhere near being ready to host astronauts in low Earth orbit. The ISS maintains a steady presence of orbital science above Earth’s surface, which would leave behind a major gap to fill. international space stationNASA Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

The space agency is already facing severe budget cuts that could kill several missions. The spacecraft is en route to a metal-rich asteroid. Hopefully, its backup propellant line can get it there by August 2029. Dangerous rocks may co-orbit with Venus, but new research suggests only a space-based mission can prove it. Seven of the new strains were cultured during the assembly of the Phoenix mission that landed on the surface of Mars.

    "title": "Elon Says Trump Is ‘in the Epstein Files’ as Their Relationship Publicly Implodes",
    "article_text": "Everyone knew the day would come when the relationship between Elon Musk and Donald Trump actually imploded. And that day is finally here, with Musk going scorched-Earth and now saying Trump is in the “Epstein Files,” a reference to the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. “Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!” Muskwrote on X. Mark this post for the future. The truth will come out. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk)June 5, 2025 The open feud between the two men started when President Trump said he was “very disappointed” in Musk during apress conferencein the White House on Thursday, suggesting the billionaire might be developing “Trump Derangement Syndrome” after he criticized the so-called Big Beautiful Bill. Trump even poked fun at Musk’s black eye, saying, “Do you want a little makeup?” Now Musk is having a full-blown meltdown on his social media platform X, retweeting memes making fun of Trump, joking that Trump may have been replaced with a body double, and saying it might be time to form a new political party. There’s also the accusation that Trump is in “the Epstein Files,” the long-fabled government files showing the powerful people who were associated with Epstein. Trump was rather openly Epstein’s friend for years, but many MAGA supporters refuse to believe there was anything nefarious happening between the two. “Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,” Musk wroteThursday. “Such ingratitude.” Musk, who reportedly spent over $250 million in the 2024 election to help elect Trump and other Republicans, was responding in his tweet to a video of Trump saying he was “very disappointed” in the billionaire. Musk alsowrote, “Remember this @realDonaldTrump?” while quote-tweeting a video from March where Trump essentially did an ad for Tesla at the White House. The president bought a Tesla after the publicity stunt, which was one of many blatantly unethical moves by the two men during Musk’s stint as the head of DOGE. In the video, Trump can be heard calling Musk a “patriot” whohas “never asked me for a thing.” Musk also retweeted a meme from an account called Not Jerome Powell that uses the format of a Trump interview from his first term with Jonathan Swan. The meme shows Trump saying, “I have a plan to cut spending” before handing Swan a piece of paper that reads “increase spending.” Musk responded to Trump’s claims in the televised Oval Office press conference on Thursday that he only got upset after EV “mandates” had been killed, though it seems like the two men may have been confused about what the other was talking about. “This is me in 2021!” Musktweeted, sharing a video clip where he said Tesla didn’t need to rely on tax credits anymore.Trump seemed to be talking about a bill passed by Republicans in the Senatelast monththat makes it illegal for states like California to phase out vehicles with internal combustion engines. But the so-called Big Beautiful Bill doesn’t include anything about mandates, instead killing the tax credits that people can get for buying EVs. However, Musk obviously has benefited from government intervention, which has put billions of dollars in his pocket over the years. Whatever Trump and Musk meant when it comes to the details of legislation around electric vehicles, these guys are clearly lashing out in ways that were long predicted. There have long been rumors that Trump didn’t like Musk, but they were clearly able to put their personal differences aside and work together in their quest to destroy the federal government. Trump hit back during Musk’s tweet-storm with some posts of his own Thursday, really starting to put some oomph into his newfound hate for the billionaire oligarch. “Elon was ‘wearing thin,’ I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!” Trumpwrote. Then Trump delivered a line that every oligarch hates to hear. The president said he might have to take away Musk’s billions in subsidies and contracts. “The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elonâs Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didnât do it!” Trumpwrote. Musk heavily relies on government contracts through his companies like SpaceX. Musk responded to the threat with a quote-tweet about someone ending the contracts for SpaceX’s work shuttling astronauts to theInternational Space Station.“This just gets better and better,” Musk wrote with two crying-laughing emojis. “Go ahead, make my day…” A little while later, Musk appeared to take it very personally,writing, “In light of the Presidentâs statement about cancellation of my government contracts, @SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately.” In light of the Presidentâs statement about cancellation of my government contracts,@SpaceXwill begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediatelypic.twitter.com/NG9sijjkgW — Elon Musk (@elonmusk)June 5, 2025 After Musk dropped his accusations about Epstein, Trump wrote onTruth Social, “I donât mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago,” before defending his budget bill. But Musk leaned in even harder, amplifying a tweet about Trump’srelationship to Epstein, replying “yes” to a tweet about Trump being impeached and replaced by Vice President JD Vance, andwriting“The Trump tariffs will cause a recession in the second half of this year.” Social media sites also started to becomefilled with memeson Thursday, making fun of the rift between the two men, including a Mean Girls reference. View this post on Instagram Ashley St. Clair, the right-wing author and mother of one of Musk’s children, alsochimed in on X, writing, “hey @realDonaldTrumplmk if u need any breakup advice.”Â Tesla’s stock is down 14% on the day at the time of this writing, with a share price of $284. And while Musk always seems to find a way to juice his stock with whatever new shiny object he can concoct, this rift with Trump and disillusionment with MAGA is sure to be a hurdle for the short term. When Musk is dropping references to Trump being in the so-called Epstein files, you know things are going to only get messier from here. Oh and some food for thought as they ponder this question: Trump has 3.5 years left as President, but I will be around for 40+ years â¦ — Elon Musk (@elonmusk)June 5, 2025 How mess could things get? Steve Bannon, a longtime MAGA acolyte and Musk hater, is reportedly urging Trump to launch an investigation into the billionaire’s previous status as an “illegal alien,” according to theNew York Times. Musk spoke at aconference in 2013where his brother said the two of them were in the country illegally since they had arrived into the U.S. on student visas and dropped out to start a company. âThey should initiate a formal investigation of his immigration status because I am of the strong belief that he is an illegal alien, and he should be deported from the country immediately,” Bannon told the Times.

    "title": "Your Smartphone Is a Parasite, According to Evolution",
    "article_text": "Head lice, fleas and tapeworms have been humanityâs companions throughout our evolutionary history. Yet, the greatest parasite of the modern age is no blood-sucking invertebrate. It is sleek, glass-fronted, and addictive by design. Its host? Every human on Earth with a wifi signal. Far from being benign tools, smartphones parasitise our time, our attention and our personal information, all in the interests of technology companies and their advertisers. In a new article in theAustralasian Journal of Philosophy, we argue smartphones pose unique societal risks, which come into sharp focus when viewed through the lens of parasitism. Evolutionary biologists define a parasite as a species that benefits from a close relationship with another species â its host â while the host bears a cost. Thehead louse, for example, is entirely dependent on our own species for its survival. They only eat human blood, and if they become dislodged from their host, they survive only briefly unless they are fortunate enough to fall onto another human scalp. In return for our blood, head lice give us nothing but a nasty itch; thatâs the cost. Smartphones have radically changed our lives. From navigating cities to managing chronic health diseasessuch as diabetes, these pocket-sized bits of tech make our lives easier. So much so that most of us are rarely without them. Yet, despite their benefits, many of us are hostage to our phones and slaves to the endless scroll, unable to fully disconnect. Phone usersare paying the pricewith a lack of sleep, weaker offline relationships and mood disorders. Not all close species relationships are parasitic. Many organisms that live on or inside us are beneficial. Consider the bacteria in the digestive tracts of animals. They can only survive and reproduce in the gut of their host species, feeding on nutrients passing through. But theyprovide benefitsto the host, including improved immunity and better digestion. These win-win associations are called mutualisms. The human-smartphone association began as a mutualism. The technology proved useful to humans for staying in touch, navigating via maps, and finding useful information. Philosophers have spoken of this not in terms of mutualism, but rather as phones being anextension of the human mind, like notebooks, maps, and other tools. From these benign origins, however, we argue that the relationship has become parasitic. Such a change is not uncommon in nature; amutualist can evolve to become a parasite, or vice versa. As smartphones have become nearly indispensable, some of the most popular apps they offer have come to serve the interests of the app-making companies and their advertisers more faithfully than those of their human users. These appsare designedto nudge our behaviour tokeep us scrolling, clicking on advertising and simmering in perpetual outrage. The data on our scrolling behaviour is used to further that exploitation. Your phone only cares about your personal fitness goals or desire to spend more quality time with your kids to the extent that it uses this information to tailor itself to better capture your attention. So, it can be useful to think of users and their phones as akin to hosts and their parasites â at least some of the time. While this realisation is interesting in and of itself, the benefit of viewing smartphones through the evolutionary lens of parasitism comes into its own when considering where the relationship might head next â and how we could thwart these high-tech parasites. On the Great Barrier Reef,bluestreak cleaner wrasseestablish âcleaning stationsâ where larger fish allow the wrasse to feed on dead skin, loose scales, and invertebrate parasites living in their gills. This relationship is a classic mutualism â the larger fish lose costly parasites and the cleaner wrasse get fed. Sometimes the cleaner wrasse âcheatâ and nip their hosts, tipping the scale from mutualism to parasitism. The fish being cleaned maypunish offendersby chasing them away or withholding further visits. In this, the reef fish exhibit something evolutionary biologists see as important to keeping mutualisms in balance: policing. Could we adequately police our exploitation by smartphones and restore a net-beneficial relationship? Evolution shows that two things are key: an ability to detect exploitation when it occurs, and the capacity to respond (typically by withdrawing service to the parasite). In the case of the smartphone, we canât easily detect the exploitation. Tech companies that design the various features and algorithms to keep you picking up your phonearenât advertising this behaviour. But even if youâre aware of the exploitative nature of smartphone apps, responding is also more difficult than simply putting the phone down. Many of us have become reliant on smartphones for everyday tasks. Rather than remembering facts, we offload the task to digital devices â for some people,this can change their cognition and memory. We depend on having a camera for capturing life events or even just recording where we parked the car. Thisboth enhances and limits our memory of events. Governments and companies have only further cemented our dependence on our phones, by moving their service delivery online via mobile apps. Once we pick up the phone to access our bank accounts or access government services, weâve lost the battle. How then can users redress the imbalanced relationship with their phones, turning the parasitic relationship back to a mutualistic one? Our analysis suggests individual choice canât reliably get users there. We are individually outgunned by the massive information advantage tech companies hold in the host-parasite arms race. The Australian governmentâsunder-age social media banis an example of the kind of collective action required to limit what these parasites can legally do. To win the battle, we will also need restrictions onapp features known to be addictive, and on the collection and sale of our personal data. Rachael L.

    "title": "RFK Jr. Is Opening the Alternative Medicine Floodgates",
    "article_text": "Snake oil salesmen will be eating good during the Trump presidency. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently declared that he will greatly expand people’s access to experimental and alternative medical treatments, even while acknowledging that a “lot of charlatans” are likely to take advantage of suffering people as a result. RFK Jr.madethe announcement during a recent interview on the Ultimate Human Podcast hosted by Gary Brecka, a self-proclaimed biologist, biohacker, and longevity expert (Brecka appears topossesstwo bachelors’ degrees in biology, but is not a licensed medical doctor). Kennedy stated that, under his reign as Secretary of Health and Human Services, Americans will more easily be able to get their hands on treatments not currently approved by health regulators. âIf you want to take an experimental drugâyou can do that, you ought to be able to do that,â Kennedy told Brecka. While many patient advocates in general have pushed for looser regulations surrounding experimental or off-label treatments, other experts havecautionedthat it’s important to strike a balance between improved access and safety.Â And it’s unlikely Kennedy’s approach will meet that threshold. RFK Jr. Goes Full Tinfoil, Pledges to Stop Chemtrails in Latest Dr. Phil Interview For starters, Kennedy haslong spread misinformationabout vaccines (one of the most effective medical interventions ever created), nutrition, andother health topics. And he’s no stranger to backingalternative treatmentsthat have next to no evidence supporting their use. During this latest interview, for instance, he referenced chelation and stem cells as unproven therapies that people should have easier access to. Stem cell medicine is alegitimate and growing fieldof research. But direct-to-consumer stem cell clinics often exaggerate their benefits, claiming stem cells can treat everything from cancer tolong covid. In recent years, this cottage industry has exploded in the U.S. and overseas, and some patients have been severely injured from buying into the hype. People have experienced pulmonary embolisms, bacterial infections, andother serious complications, including blindness, from visiting these clinics. The risk-balance equation is arguably even worse with chelation therapy. Chelation involves using drugs that bind to heavy metals in the body, allowing them to be excreted out through urine. It’s an effective treatment for certain kinds of acute poisoning or toxic exposures. But in alternative medicine circles,chelationis regularly used to “cleanse” people of supposed toxins dubiously blamed for a bevy of chronic illnesses, including autism. As with stem cells, people have gotten hurt ordiedafter taking chelation for unapproved uses. RFK seems to be fully aware of the potential danger that would come with making these treatments easier to access, yet brushed that off as inevitable during his interview. âAnd of course youâre going to get a lot of charlatans, and youâre going to get people who have bad results,â he said. âAnd ultimately, you canât prevent that either way. Leaving the whole thing in the hands of pharma is not working for us.â The Food and Drug Administration has previously warned the public to stay away fromchelation therapy for autismand fromunregulated stem cell treatments, but who knows if these warnings will stay up for much longer. Kennedy and the Trump Administration haverepeatedly underminedapproved medical treatments like vaccines. Now he’s set to open the floodgates for unlicensed drugs that may not work or will harm people desperate enough to use them. alternative medicineRFK Jrstem cell therapy Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

During his testimony before the House Appropriations Committee, RFK opined on abortions, vaccines, and MLK Jr. A new trial suggests a combination vaccine may offer equal or better protection against both flu and covid-19 compared to current vaccines. Roughly 200 more employees at the National Institutes of Health will be laid off, reportedly to balance out recent rehires.

    "title": "Astronomers Discover Most Energetic Cosmic Explosions Ever Observed",
    "article_text": "Astronomers in Hawaii have discovered a new kind of explosion, and they’re the most energetic stellar explosions ever recorded. Meet âextreme nuclear transientsâ (ENTs): when supermassive black holes tear apart stars at least three times heavier than the Sun, triggering an immense release of energy. An international team of researchers describes the discovery of this newly observed phenomenon in astudypublished Wednesday in the journal Science Advances, shedding light on events that will help astronomers study the distant universe. âWeâve observed stars getting ripped apart as tidal disruption events for over a decade, but these ENTs are different beasts, reaching brightnesses nearly ten times more than what we typically see,â Jason Hinkle, lead author of the study and PhD student at the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawaii, said in a W. M. Keck Observatorystatement.Tidal disruptionsconsist of supermassive black holes tearing apart any star that wanders too close, so ENTs are a kind of tidal disruption. âNot only are ENTs far brighter than normal tidal disruption events, but they remain luminous for years, far surpassing the energy output of even the brightest known supernova explosions,” he added. Their discovery took place almost by accident. While searching for enduring flares projecting from the center of galaxies in data from the European Space Agencyâs Gaia mission, Hinkle came across two strange signals from 2016 and 2018, which started a multi-year investigation. At the same time, two separate teams found a comparable flare from 2020 in an astronomical survey called the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). More data from the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii confirmed the 2020 event’s similarity to the two Gaia events. Given that these events unleashed more energy than any supernova known to science, Hinkle and his colleagues concluded that they weren’t your average stellar explosions. The enormous energy release and the shape of the event’s light curves indicated the presence of a supermassive black hole actively absorbing material, a process calledaccretion. Unlike regular black hole accretion, howeverâwhich sees nearby matter heat up and project irregular lightâthe astronomers discovered that these astrophysical events clearly involve a supermassive black hole systematically shredding and eating a giant star. ENTs represent the most energetic known explosions in the universe. Gaia18cdj, the team’s strongest documented ENT, released 25 times more energy than the most energetic supernovae known to science. More broadly, each ENT releases as much energy as 100 Suns would emit over their entire 10-billion-year lifespans.Â For comparison, a regular supernova usually unleashes similar amounts of energy to a single Sun. âThese ENTs donât just mark the dramatic end of a massive starâs life,â Hinkle explained. âThey illuminate the processes responsible for growing the largest black holes in the universe.â ENTs are also at least 10 million times rarer than supernovae. Nevertheless, their massive energy outputs will prove to be extremely useful for astronomers studying far-away massive black holes. âBecause theyâre so bright, we can see them across vast cosmic distancesâand in astronomy, looking far away means looking back in time,” said Benjamin Shappee, study co-author and Associate Professor at the University of Hawaii’s Institute for Astronomy. “By observing these prolonged flares, we gain insights into black hole growth during a key era known as cosmic noon, when the universe was half its current age when galaxies were happening placesâforming stars and feeding their supermassive black holes 10 times more vigorously than they do today.â From theories ofblack holes leading to white holesto the suggestion that theuniverse might exist in a black holeand thatsupermassive black holes could replace particle colliders, the recent study joins a host of research shedding light on one of the most mysterious components of our universe.

    "title": "Amazon Looks to Replace Pesky Paid Workers With Humanoid Bots That Don’t Need to Pee",
    "article_text": "Amazon ispretty serious about robots, and for a long time now, its factories have been teeming with them. Big squat ones, tall crane-like ones, and some big slug boys. It’s like the e-commerce, capitalistic version of a George Lucas droid ecosystem with somehow worse naming conventions (I’m looking at you, Xanthus). While those bots are hard at work automating warehouses around the country, there’s still one part of Amazon’s draconian business that hasn’t been irrevocably touched by the cold steel hand of robotic automation, and that’s package deliveryâat least for now. According toThe Information, Amazon is ready to take the next step in its quest to automate the final step of package fulfillment with a fleet of humanoid robots. The report, which cites an anonymous source involved in the effort, says that Amazon will test the humanoid robots at an indoor park in San Francisco that’s the size of a coffee shop. Those humanoid robots are reportedly being trained to “spring out” of Amazon’s Rivian-made delivery vans for last-mile package delivery and actually drop the package at your doorstep. Apologies in advance to your dog and its already sour relationship with delivery guys. Since it’s 2025, that effort to bring humanoid robots into the delivery fold is being coupled with internal attempts to craft AI software that’s designed to operate the bots and guide them to your door. To me, that effort feels maybe a little ambitious considering Amazon hasn’t even fully rolled out itsLLM-powered Alexa+voice assistant yet, but hey, never underestimate the appeal of automating the workforce. And naturally, since this is Amazon we’re talking about, that’s what this is all about. In case you weren’t already aware, Amazon has aÂslightly strained relationship with its labor force, and this is another step toward eliminating that perceived nuisance altogether. A robot, after all, probably isn’t being coded to form a union, and it certainly won’t have topee in a bottleafter being forced to remain on the factory floor for too long. As much as I love the idea of humanoid robots and the pie-in-the-sky vision of ourJetsons-esque future, I can’t help but feel like humanoid robots, in this case, won’t really benefit anyone but Amazon in the end. I don’t know about you, but I’m not exactly itching for a robot that gets confused about whether to deliver a package on the steps outside my apartment building or in the much safer foyer.

    "title": "30 Years Later, the Terrors of ‘Safe’ Are Just as Alarming",
    "article_text": "Theeco-horror genrecan often take a high-energy, high-action approach. Weâve seen animals and/or insects transformed byan environmental shiftthat makes them want toattack every humanin their midst. We’ve seen nature twisted into spawning vicious monsters bothgiantand microscopic. Weâve also seen the weather go haywire and spiral into an ice age in act three after ripping Los Angeles with tornados in act one.Â Butnot every eco-horror filmspeaks insuch a loud voice. In 2011, Jeff NicholsâTake Shelterexplored the fragmenting domestic life of a construction worker whose apocalyptic visions soon become an obsession; as he prepares for doom, his increasingly exasperated loved ones assume heâs completely nuts. In 2021, Ben WheatleyâsIn the Earthinvestigated a story obliquely about the covid-19 pandemic, set in a forest where the plants have launched an offensive against all human invaders. Even earlier, Todd HaynesâSafeâreleased in theaters 30 years ago this month after debuting at the 1995 Sundance Film Festivalâdug into maybe the eeriest sort of eco-horror of all. You canât see it, hear it, or even feel it, unless youâreSafeâs main character: Carol White, a housewife played by then-emerging star Julianne Moore. Safetakes place in 1987 in the suburbs of Los Angeles, where Carol, clad in pastels and pearls, spends her days running errands, ordering her housekeeper around, and attending aerobics classes. Itâs a comfortable yet dull life; what passes for drama is a new couch being delivered in the wrong color, or a friend suggesting they try out a faddish all-fruit diet. Carol doesnât smoke or drinkâshe describes herself as a âmilkaholicââand her personality is quite passive. She doesnât seem to have much of an interior life. Her lack of expressiveness matches perfectly with the style Haynes uses to tell his story: itâs very reserved, almost to the point of feeling airless and sterile. We’re peering in on Carol almost like she’s a figure in a diorama that tells her story. But if Carol seems like someone whomusthave a rebellion bubbling within,Safeâreleased at the height of the AIDS epidemic, a crisis it references both overtly and symbolicallyâturns that idea on its head. While in some senses it is a feminist comment on how stifling gender roles can be,Safeis also a movie about a woman whose body begins to break down in response to her otherwise unremarkable environment, imperiling both her physical and mental health. If you watchSafealready knowing where Carol is headed, itâs easy to pick out the clues. The first thing we hear from her is a sneezeâa gentle harbinger of the coughing fits, vomiting, nosebleeds, hyperventilation, skin eruptions, and seizures that eventually come along.Â Her McMansion existence, untaxing as it seems, is full of toxic triggers and pollutants: wall-to-wall carpet thatâs constantly being vacuumed, kitchen cabinets that must be re-varnished, car exhaust from LAâs perpetual traffic jams, planes flying overhead, humming appliances, phones ringing, TVs and radios blaring, and looming electrical towers. We see Carol visit the dry cleaner on multiple occasions, including a disastrous attempt to pick up clothes while the place is being fumigated, and at one point she decides to add a perm and a manicure to her beauty salon routine. But everyone else in her life who dwells in this San Fernando Valley bubble is seemingly fine. Itâs just Carol who starts having violent reactions, and the initial responseâparticularly from her husband, whoâs continuously disbelieving though he does become somewhat more supportiveâis that itâs all in her head. Sheâs just âoverexerted.â âA little run down.âÂ âI really donât see anything wrong with you,â her regular physician scolds, while advising her to stay off dairy and forget the fruit diet, too. A litany of allergy tests prove inconclusive. A psychiatrist, perched behind a massive desk, looks at her quizzically, asking âWhatâs going on in you?âÂ As Carol downshifts from delicate to fragile to frail, her illness becomes her entire identity, and she finally findsânot answers, but a community of people suffering from similar symptoms. (She finds them through a flyer posted on her health clubâs bulletin board that very pointedly asks: âAre you allergic to the 20th century?â) Treatment requires moving to a communal-living retreat in the desert, which takes Carol away from a life it seems sheâll hardly miss, despite at least one emotional outburst as sheâs settling in. Exactly how Carol has fallen victim to this debilitating condition is something we never learn. The way Haynes frames her weakening existence is extremely effective, implying that itâs an ambient ailment that could seep into anyone, anywhere, even in cushy surroundings.Safeis also remarkable in the way that it takes Carolâs illness very seriouslyâthe audience believes her, even if other characters donâtâwhile also satirizing a New Age industry eagerly profiting off its patients. Carol and her fellow residents are wealthy enough to pay out of pocket for residential treatment, but naive enough not to question why the programâs founder lives in a mansion that looms over the property. The most chilling part ofSafe, though, is its ambiguous ending. Even amid her new homeâs isolated location, where everyone observes rules about chemicals, eats organic food, and undergoes regular therapy, Carol doesnât recover. Eventually she moves from a rustic cabin to an igloo-like structure that completely encloses a âsafe room,â free from contaminants as long as Carol is the only one who goes inside. Even then, and despite continuing to insist that sheâs feeling so much better, Carol is clearly deteriorating. Steadily. AsSafeconcludes, the audience is openly invited to wonder if she will ever get betterâand if the choice sheâs made, to live in isolation in a placecompletelystructured around environmental illness, was even worth it.Â After 30 years, the answers still donât come easily. Most haunting of all, environmental illnesses still lurk among usâas quietly insidious, inviting of skepticism, and enigmatic as ever. Want more io9 news?

ThebannersinGenshin Impactare constantly changing, so it's a good idea to keep track of what thecurrent bannersandnext bannersare, to prepare for a sudden hit to your precious Primogem reserves. Limited-time rotating banners are called 'Event Wishes' in Genshin, and they usually run for three weeks. An Event Wish Banner is never gone for long though, as another one—with a different set of characters—will soon take its place. Your Primogems are never safe! You use the Intertwined Fate currency to pull (referred to as 'Wishing' in-game) on these Event Wish Banners. If you see you're using something called Acquaint Fate, then you're wishing on Genshin's permanent banner or Beginner's Banner instead. It's a good idea to always convert your Primogems into Intertwined Fate to save up for Event Wish Banners, as it's much harder to get characters only available for a limited-time than it is to get characters in the permanent banner. But you do you! As somebody who only pulled for Xilonen because I wanted to roller skate across Teyvat, I'm not one to judge. SkirkandDahliaare on the next banners inGenshin Impact. This was confirmed throughSkirk's drip marketingandDahlia's drip marketingon Genshin's official social media channels—an ever-reliable way to peek at who's coming next. They'll both make their debut in version 5.7. As for reruns, according to the reliable leak sourcehomdgcat.wiki,Emilieis running alongside Skirk in Phase 1 of version 5.7, andMavuikaandShenheare rerunning in Phase 2. It's been 18 months since Skirk popped up to throw Childe into a portal at the end of Fontaine's story, and four years since Dahlia was first mentioned in-game, so it's nice to see miHoYo didn't forget about them after all. I wish the same could be said about Genshin's Switch port and anime adaptation. Raiden ShogunandKinichare the current banners in Genshin Impact, both of which end on Tuesday, June 17. Kinich is a returning five-star dendro claymore-user on his Seeker of Flame-Wrought Secrets Banner, and Raiden Shogun, a returning five-star electro polearm-user on her Reign of Serenity Banner. The boosted four-star characters on Kinich and Raiden's current banners are: If your Primogems are side-eyeing you over a Raiden rerun, then prepare for a few more unwelcome glances, because an Inazuman-themedChronicled Wish Banneris also running until Tuesday, June 17. All of the five-star characters on the current Chronicled Wish Banner are: All of the five-star weapons on the current Chronicled Wish Banner are: Remember that your pity doesn't carry over between Chronicled Wish Banners! It will reset back to zero when this Inazuman one ends. Although there's no official confirmation yet, as Skirk is debuting in version 5.7, it's all but confirmed that she'll be getting a new signature sword to run alongside her in the next weapon banner. So if the character leaks mentioned above turn out to be accurate, here's what the next weapon banner schedule will look like in version 5.7 of Genshin Impact: The current weapon banner (Epitome Invocation) runs until Tuesday, June 17, and the five-star weapons on the current weapon banner in Genshin Impact areFang of the Mountain King (claymore), andEngulfing Lightning (polearm). These are Kinich and Raiden's signature five-star weapons, respectively.

    "title": "Borderlands 2 is free to keep on Steam and it's getting review-bombed at the same time because of, uh, the EULA?",
    "article_text": "You've got until June 8 to pick up the best Borderlands game for free, but some people think you shouldn't. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Borderlands 2 isfree to keep on Steamuntil June 8, and if you think people are happy about that, well sir, you are wrong. They are in fact madder than hell, and they are expressing their displeasure in the time-honored way of gamers: With a good old-fashioned review bombing. Borderlands 2 is an older game, having come out in 2012, but it's also widely regarded as the best game in the series. We gave it a 90% score in ourreview, calling it a \"satisfying and tactically interesting shooter, with great missions and excitingly random guns.\" Right now it's totally free, for keeps as I mentioned, and it's on Steam, the online store that people actually like. So what could possibly be the issue? Because there isdefinitelyan issue. It's not, as you might reasonably think, because people are mad about somethingRandy Pitchford said—although I suppose that might actually be it for some people. The big problem, though, is that Take-Two recently changed its EULA, which numerous negative Steam reviews claim turn its games into \"spyware.\" This is actually not a new phenomenon. As wereported in May, it all seemingly started in March when a Borderlands YouTuber by the name ofHellfireposted a video entitled \"Take-Two Spies on Borderlands Players,\" highlighting policy changes made by Take-Two earlier in the year. The video turns on two primary complaints: That Take-Two collects personal information like name, username, phone number, IP address, and operating system, and a clause that some say could be used to ban mods or the people who use them. In the wake of that and subsequent videos, which drove even more strident claims about Take-Two's underhanded intentions, review bombs fell across the entireBorderlands series on Steam. Eventually it subsided, as these things do, but it flared up again with Borderlands 2 going free: 738 negative reviews have been posted so far today alone, which is a lot for a 13-year-old videogame. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. So that's where it stands: Borderlands 2 is free on Steam and that's triggered a round of review bombing for unrelated reasons that have dragged the recent user rating down to \"mostly negative,\" and if you think that's odd for such a highly regarded shooter, well, now you know why.

    "article_text": "The massive update drops next week. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Path of Exile's whole thing is that it's an action RPG in the style of Diablo 2. It's extremely dense and filled with so many different items and skills that its most dedicated players do all their buildcrafting in a program outside the game. It's for the true sickos who feel left behind by all the modern games that try to simplify the genre. And even though developer Grinding Gear Games released asoulslike sequel to PoEin early access last year, it's still committed to expanding the first game on a regular basis. Secrets of the Atlasis PoE's 31st free expansion and it comes with a list of new additions to the game, but one of them is something every great action RPG eventually adds: mercenaries. When the update hits on June 13, a new league (PoE's name for seasons) will begin that is all about tracking them down. Each mercenary of Trathas is unique and wears a full set of gear you can inspect upon meeting them. Then you have to decide whether you want to hire them on the spot, duel them for one of their items, or exile them so you might run into more favorable types of mercenaries. They're basically like other players with their own gear and builds, making the fights look like a proper PvP duel. They carry around unique items and stats that you can't get anywhere else, so your main goal will be trying to find as many as you can during the league. Choosing to hire one will let them fight beside you and provide you passive buffs, like a warcry that taunts and groups enemies up. The real draw is the entirely new layer of buildcraft they introduce. Each mercenary can be equipped with all the same items players can wear, which means you'll essentially have a whole second character to think about as you refine your build. You can make them into tanks, supports, or something in between. The spotlight is on the mercenaries for the new league, but Secrets of the Atlas will also add a new endgame storyline, monsters who drop temporary powers to use, new bosses, new crafting items, and a bunch of quality of life features. During theannouncement stream,Grinding Gear Games saiddelaying the expansionhelped it focus on getting PoE 2 to a place that will let itbalance updating both games.It expects to update PoE with about as much stuff as this expansion every four months.

    "title": "This MMO can run Doom: EVE Frontier is so moddable, players are building entire games within its space survival sandbox, and the devs say it's just the beginning",
    "article_text": "Another player developed a simple 4X game, while others have built NPC questgivers and PvP modes. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I would say I did my time, several tours of duty on the front lines of \"blockchain is bullshit, please stop emailing me press releases aboutNFTMMO Kickstarters.\" I remain a skeptic and a luddite, about both crypto and its new tech fabulist little brother, generative AI. I want to establish my hater bona fides straight up before I say thatEVE Frontier is the lone crypto-associated game that has ever intrigued me⁠—no NFTs here, but a blockchain-based backend, and one ethereum-derived in-game currency alongside a non-crypto one. From one of the EVE Frontier hackathons. DOOM running in a Smart Assembly! pic.twitter.com/PHvyuOiFIVMay 9, 2025 There are a few reasons it has my attention: Its dev, CCP Games, has been doing digital economy stuff in the infamous sickos-only MMO, EVE Online, for 22 years, earning a certain benefit of the doubt⁠. The digital economy guys are doing something digital economy-y, checks out. I also feel a certain admiration for the studio sticking with the idea well after the gold rush has ended: Even though it remains boom times for shitcoins, blockchain gaming is already a bit of anachronism. More persuasive, though, is that its devs are the only ones I've ever encountered with a coherent vision of what the tech could add tomyexperience as a player, and not just the \"play to earn,\" have the same gun in Fortnite and Mario Party, cocaine-fueled hokum we all got so used to hearing about circa 2021-2022. Frontier's big sell is client-side modding at runtime, which is to say modding the game, for yourself and others, without leaving the game or it requiring active intervention or moderation from the developers. If the pitch of base EVE is more Elder Scrolls⁠—find your role and build a second life in a fictional civilization⁠—Frontier is more Stalker or Fallout: Carve out and rebuild something amid a post-apocalypse, one that seems to have spanned an entire galaxy. To do so, you've got your ship(s), as well as a \"Smart Assembly,\" a survival game chest/workbench that doubles as the primary point of entry for modding. Last month, CCP CEO Hilmar Veigar Péturssonshared a screenshot of Doom running within EVE Frontier, a near-universal indication of \"we're off to the races\" for DIY possibilities. Perhaps even more impressive is Game Engine Bridge, a tool for building games-within-games in Frontier, shown off at a recent CCP-hosted hackathon. The author's sample project with the tool was a simple 4X strategy/management game created in Unity. \"It generated a random type of planet that you could then prove you were the first to find,\" explained EVE Frontier game director Sæmundur Hermannsson. \"Then you can then grow it and populate it and conquer it. It's like Pokémon Go.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Game Engine Bridge wasn't the only instance of players effectively recreating No Man's Sky within EVE Frontier. Another hackathon participant created a system to track and prove when a player is the first to discover a new star system in Frontier's20,000 system and counting galaxy. This, coupled with Frontier's inherently dangerous, unexplored and underdeveloped universe, has the potential to give rise to an entirely exploration-based playstyle. Product manager Scott McCabe outlined how he believed players could find a niche as surveyors or cartographers in EVE Frontier, selling information to individuals or Frontier's eventual equivalent to EVE Online's player-run corporations. Other modders have focused on new systems and game types for Frontier, creating bounty boards, NPC questgivers, and more. The hackathon's winner was Trinary Games Commission, a project that implemented fully automated PvP modes, with Smart Assemblies handling the rewards and rules enforcement for king of the hill, racing, and area control competitions. This level of moddability can be seen in plenty of other games, but Roblox is the only instance of it in a live service ecosystem that I'm aware of. Crucially though, Roblox devs create distinct experiences that run out of the same launcher, rather than inserting user-made content into a live MMO. CCP says it wants to just hand players the keys and let them go nuts, with limitations baked into the game⁠—with that word I don't love, blockchain⁠—preventing players from giving themselves infinite ammo, god mode, or otherwise breaking things. This is also the only example I've ever seen of a live MMO letting players mod the game at runtime, with those mods immediately affecting other players. I asked if this was at all possible with a more traditional MMO backend, and got a convincing response from Hermannsson. \"[The blockchain integration] helps with this read-write API out of the box,\" he said. \"Instead of needing to worry about the read API and then putting writes and then worrying about too many reads like⁠—I'm sure you've seen⁠—the time with Reddit and third party devs. They had to close it down, because it was just blowing up their [Amazon Web Services] server bill, because third party devs just write bad code, inherently⁠—they're just hobby devs who spam your server, and that's what EVE Online has to deal with. But you just get a pretty slick solution out of the gate with this read-write API and everything.\" EVE Online recently unveiled its own player-driven quest systemin its Legion expansion, but this required a significant development lift to implement. \"While with our previous setup, this freelance jobs thing, we have to program it into the game. With Frontier, we're giving them the tools to do a feature like this and whatever other features like this,\" said creative director Pavel Savchuck. \"And sometimes we just don't know what features they want, like, they buildstrange thingssometimes\" EVE Frontier is currently playable in an early or \"Founder's\" access form, but the \"full\" game seems to be a long way off yet. When I checked out a playable build of Frontier at this year's EVE Fanfest, it still felt very much like a prototype, with some partially-textured ship models and technical hiccups during our hands-on. The Frontier team has some plans for control overhauls that intrigue me, most-notably a camera rework that will include more close-up, cinematic angles and driving controls to appeal to shooter fans and dogfighters. Right now, though, combat and movement is still close to base EVE, feeling like an RTS where you only control one unit. We're talkingearlyaccess, and that, coupled with the game's inherent complexity, makes it a tough sell to Joe Sixpack CallofDuty looking for a cool spaceship game, at least at the current stage. CCP has said it wants players to ultimately have as much or as little interaction with crypto wallets or programming in EVE Frontier, but right now the curious modder/developer, EVE Online diehard, or ideally both is who will get the most out of Frontier. But much like your average gamer's spectator relationship to OG EVE, Frontier is already a fascinating game to follow. Much as it pains me to say, it's a one of a kind MMO modding experiment because of its blockchain tech, and not despite it. I'll continue to make an exception for Frontier because it doesn't just promise the moon, its devs keep offering specific, interesting use cases for the tech behind it. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Ted has been thinking about PC games and bothering anyone who would listen with his thoughts on them ever since he booted up his sister's copy of Neverwinter Nights on the family computer.

    "article_text": "Found you! When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Turns out there are bosses everywhere inElden Ring Nightreign, including the top of the castle that is normally a pain to clear out. Reddit userAphodposted a clip showing how to scale its walls and reach the boss sitting on top, bypassing tons of enemies on the way. I hopped into a solo run to test it and, yeah, it totally works. The castle is always located in the center of the map unless you have aShifting Earth eventgoing on, and the tightening circle tends to end somewhere nearby. The place is always filled with tough enemies scattered throughout its ramparts, but you don't actually have to fight them if you know where to jump. That said, I'd recommend coming here once you're at least level eight. As Aphod's clip proves, you can actually scale the walls of the castle using parts that stick outjustenough for your Nightfarer to grab onto. That means you can rush toward a particular spot and go directly to the boss every run. Alternatively, you can sprint past all the enemies and take the long circuitous route upward through a dining hall the intended way. But who has time for that? This trick requires you to run around to the back of the castle where the gate is closed. On the left is a pile of stone bricks that lead you to a broken wall leading up to the upper floor. Run up that and instead of continuing on to where all the enemies are stationed, you can jump and grab onto the ledge above you. From there you have to hug the wall as you round the corner to the west toward other side of the castle where you can jump up another broken wall to the top.

It's pretty much the same deal: Jump up the wall and tiptoe your way in the opposite direction as the previous method and you'll see a hallway you can drop into. Running through the hallway takes you to the same broken wall leading to the top. Be prepared for a fight against a tough boss up there. I had the Ancestor Spirit waiting for me, but I've also seen a Magma Wyrm crawling around.

    "title": "'The last one wasn't the last one': CD Projekt has cyber punked us again, announcing another surprise update for Cyberpunk 2077",
    "article_text": "Cyberpunk 2077 version 2.3 was revealed during today's devstream. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. What doRe-Logic,Eric Barone, andCD Projekthave in common? They won't quit screwing around with (read: improving) their old games: Less than a week after announcing that The Witcher 3 is getting \"one more patch\" to add cross-platform mod support, the studio revealed today that Cyberpunk 2077 is getting a new update, too. Word of the forthcoming patch was delivered near the end of today's developer stream, which was focused on the newly released Nintendo Switch 2 version of Cyberpunk 2077. \"We are planning another patch for the game,\" senior community manager Alicja Kozerasaid during the stream. \"The last one wasn't the last one. Patch 2.3 is coming on June 26.\" CD Projekt global community director Marcin Momot confirmed the news with excellent use of the Vince Carter \"I got one more in me\" meme: What the patch will do won't be revealed until closer to June 26, but most people on theCyberpunk subredditare keeping their expectations in check: \"QoL stuff, bug fixes, cosmetics, and maybe a couple gigs,\" in the words of GrumpiestRobot, sums up the bulk of the mood. But some are hoping for bigger and better things, like mod support on consoles, dynamic content generation, more interactive romances, and cosmetic cyberware, for instance. That's probably aiming a little high, but it's hard to tell with CD Projekt. The studio released the\"last big update\" for Cyberpunk 2077in September 2023, after which it dropped thebig 2.1 updatein December 2023, and then thebig 2.2 updatea year later, in December 2024. I wouldn't expect the 2.3 update to add a dozen hours of new content or anything on that scale, but I do expect it will be substantial, especially with CD Projekt teasing it like this. A rumor about new Cyberpunk 2077 DLC that's recently been making the rounds, presumably sparked by the then-unannounced 2.3 update, also points to something more than just bug fixes and tweaks. As noticed earlier this week on the Cyberpunkgame subreddit, a writer at Virtuous, which worked on the 2.2 update, said in a now-deleted LinkedIn profile that he was working with the Cyberpunk 2077 narrative designer \"to conceive, write, and polish side quests for upcoming DLC releases.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. This sparked some hope among the truly committed optimists that something in the style of Phantom Liberty is quietly in the making, but then of course the whole \"expansion vs DLC\" debate kicked off and most expectations seemed to land on hopes for a surprise update—like the one that was announced today. But even though the odds of a big Idris Elba comeback here are basically zero, \"new side quests\" could be a pretty big deal in their own right. This may turn out to be the real final update for Cyberpunk 2077: CD Projekt announced last week that Cyberpunk 2 has left the conceptual phase and isnow in pre-production. But the studio's even deeper intoThe Witcher 4, and there's a new patch for The Witcher 3 coming too. Like I said, when it comes to CD Projekt, you never can tell.

    "title": "Nightreign players have figured out a way to guarantee you'll be at max level when fighting a Nightlord, but unfortunately it's super boring",
    "article_text": "Success isn't always exciting. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I've got a few dozenElden Ring Nightreignexpeditions on the books, and it shouldn't surprise anyone when I say they haven't all been successes. Many of those failures have come agonizingly close to victory, where my team's Nightlord target survived by only a sliver of health—a sliver it probably wouldn't have had if we'd entered the arena with one or two more levels. Luckily,Nightreign players on Reddithave found a method for ensuring you're always at max level when you face off with your run's final boss. Unfortunately, it's—well—pretty boring. The trick is simple: just don't jump in the goo. Let me explain. The idea is that you run through your expedition as normal until you've killed the boss at the end of Day 2. However, once the pile of ethereal goop appears as your gateway to the Spirit Shelter where you're intended to do your final Nightlord prep,don't jump in. If you open your map, you'll see why. Once the Day 2 boss dies, all the Sites of Grace on the map become active. That means, if you intentionally avoid ascending to boss fight heaven, you and your team can run around the map farming enemies, providing enough runes to hit max level. Now, there is a complication. The battle royale-style circle of hellish, lethal fire is still locked around where you fought the Day 2 boss, so youwillbe taking tick damage while you're running around grinding out levels. Thankfully, it's not much of an issue: Just kill enemies until you run out of flasks and die, and then you can simply run back from the nearest Grace, pick your runes back up, and carry on—collecting your runes after death gives you enough to reclaim your lost level, after all. The real problem is that this is extremely tedious. It's easy to imagine a nightmare world in which, very soon, randoms online will get irritated if you aren't joining them to grind out a few more levels in the hellfire. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. It's hard to say how likely it is that FromSoft will patch this. On one hand, it's against the spirit of Nightreign's whole deal—why have the time pressure of the battle royale circle if you can just ignore it at the end? On the other, doing it is kinda miserable. Time will tell. If you're willing to top off your levels with this method, you might want to do it sooner than later. But I'd recommend saving it for when you're playing with a full party—for all our sakes.

    "title": "The secret stand-out of Sony's State of Play was the bizarre resurrection of Deus Ex's PS2 version",
    "article_text": "You take another step forward and here it is again, like your own reflection repeated in a hall of mirrors. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Alright, alright. I know this website is called PC Gamer. I am aware, dimly, that the PlayStation 5 is not a PC. A thing that is evenlessa PC? The PS2. And yet here I am, writing about a PS2 game arriving on PS5. In my defence, that game is literally Deus Ex, the most PC game to ever PC game, and I can't help but find its arrival on Sony's iconically yonic console via PS+ (its not-quite-Game-Pass service) alternately mystifying and thrilling. In the year 2025, Sony has resurrected one of the most curious artefacts of the early 2000s—the version of Deus Ex that Ion Storm ginned up for the PS2 back in 2002. It's a strange beast: in many ways, an anticipation of (the unfairly maligned) Deus Ex: Invisible War on Xbox. Hemmed in by console memory limits, its familiar levels were strange, stunted versions of themselves. They'd been chopped down and split apart by loading screens to fit into the PS2's cramped brain. Codes auto-inputted themselves in keypads and computers, location-based damage was swapped out for a uniform health bar (no more blowing your legs off with a LAM), and there was no quick-inventory along the bottom of your screen. It was a worse version of Deus Ex, in other words. Though to be fair, some parts of the game were upgraded—depending on your point of view—in the transition. The main theme got a fullyorchestral rendition. So orchestral, in fact, that you can hear the conductor give some sort of faint bark right at the track's cut-off. Character models also got a tweak, giving JC Denton the gift of an actual human neck. Oh, and the PC version's cutscenes, which on our platform consist of two UE1 models shuffling facial polygons at each other, were remixed intofull-on CG cutscenes. At one point Walton Simons' mouth curls into a smile, a thing it is congenitally unable to do in-engine. I'm not sure anyone should actually play it unless they have literally no other option. I certainly wouldn't recommend it as anybody's first introduction to Deus Ex. And yet, I am glad to see Sony yank it incomprehensibly from the dustbin of history. It's worth preserving for archival purposes, if nothing else. But also, I can't help but nurse that faint ember of hope that says maybe the Embracer Group—a pox upon its house—might be emerging from its post-'Saudi Arabia (reportedly) decided not to give us billions of dollars' hangover and actually doing something with the vast trove of intellectual property it amassed over the course of its acquisitive binge. You know, things like reaching back in the archives for all its series' weird offshoots and making them available on modern systems—the kind of thing a recently chastened company might do with a vault full of property rights it's skittish about making big bets on. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. If that's the case, then all to the good. Do I trust Embracer to do anything interesting with a new Deus Ex? No. But I would like to see, for instance, its estranged PS2 half-brother arrive on our shores, or a version of Invisible War that's actually playable.

    "article_text": "Arrakis is filling up fast during the advanced access \"head start\" period. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Survival MMODune: Awakeningisn't even really out, officially: we're now in the five day advanced access period (everyone calls it the \"head start\") where only players who have purchased the $70 deluxe edition or the $90 ultimate edition can play. That hasn't stopped the desert planet of Arrakis from getting a ton of new citizens. According toSteamDB, just a few hours into the head start launch, Dune: Awakening already has nearly 100,000 players building bases, riding speeders, clambering up cliffs, and dodging sandworms. That's a spicy start, especially since there's still the weekend to come, and after that, oh yeah: theactualDune: Awakening launch on Tuesday, June 10. That's when players who bought the $50 base edition of the game will get to play, and I assume that's where most of Dune's players will come from. What kind of player numbers will Dune: Awakening eventually climb to? I won't speculate because I almost always guess wrong when it comes to these things, but it sure is looking like a strong beginning. Which doesn't mean it's all smooth sailing. There have already been a few little day 1 hiccups of the sort we're pretty familiar with: players saying their game is crashing or their performance isn't great, and of course there's already been a few server issues. I had the same server problem a lot of players did when I launched it: the server browser showed zero servers, but Funcom quickly announceda fix for thaton its Discord. That's reflected in the Steam review score which at the moment is \"Mixed,\" though not long ago it was \"Mostly Negative.\" A lot of that is because some players who can't connect or have crashes immediately go to leave a negative review, while players with no issues tend to, y'know, keep playing instead of writing. We'll see how Dune: Awakening does over the next few days and into next week when the official launch happens. Maybe I'll see you on the dunes? If so, watch your step:those sandworms aren't kidding around. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "article_text": "You can easily refund and redistribute your skill points, but there are a few restrictions. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It happens in every game eventually: you spend a skill point on an ability that sounds great but wind up with buyer's remorse. Survival MMODune: Awakeningis no different. Want to refund your skill points and spend them elsewhere on the skill tree? Don't worry, it's easy. Dune: Awakening's class system is pretty freeform: you choose a starting class, which opens up the skill tree for that class, but by visiting trainers for other classes and completing a quest for them, you'll gain access to those classes' skill trees as well. That gives you a lot of options for building your character, but along the way you may want to make some adjustments or simply rebuild them from scratch. Here's how to do it. Respec can be done easily. On the skills menu, simply press R to respec your skill tree. There's no cost, and you don't need any special items to respec. It's a snap. There are a few restrictions, though. First, you can't swap your original starting class for another. If you started the game as a Mentat, you'll remain a Mentat even when you respec, and you'll keep that starting ability. Again, that's not a big deal because you can still unlock skills for the other classes by visiting trainers. There is also a respec cooldown. (Even though the respec screen states there's \"no cooldown.\") Once you respec, you'll have to wait 48 hours until you do it again.

    "article_text": "You don't want to miss this one. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Epic's game giveaways aren't quite the whiz-bang thrillers they used to be—after six years of freebies, it's all become a bit routine—but every now and then it still manages to hit one out of the park. Today is one of those days, because today, and until June 12, you can pick up Arkane's excellentDeathloopfor the low, low price of absolutely zero dollars. It speaks to the strength of Arkane's lineup that even though Deathloop is far from the studio's strongest offering—it's noPrey, orDishonored, orArx Fatalis—it's still a hell of a good game: A clever, compact, and stylish take on the immersive sim genre that makes your worst botches, the sort of thing you might be tempted to reload over, part of the fun. And it's genuinely impressive how the game's disparate parts come together over the course of the game: Bumbling blindly through Blackreef's four regions in the early days of Deathloop slowly gives way to understanding, focus, and ultimately,a planthat's genuinely satisfying when it all (eventually) comes together. Deathloop's invasion-style multiplayer is a lot of fun too (and now that I'm thinking about it, I'm feeling a genuine itch to reinstall the game specifically so I can jump in and become a headache for other people). It took me longer to warm up to Deathloop than other Arkane games, but by the time it was all over I was absolutely there. All of which is to say, if you haven't played Deathloop yet you really should (unless you absolutely hate immsims or shooters in general for some reason), and now there's no excuse not to because it's completely free: Justpop around to the Epic Games Store, click the appropriate button, and enjoy. (This is also a notable giveaway because, according to our running tracker offree games on the Epic Games Store, this is the first time Deathloop has gone on the block.) Deathloop is the reason for the season, but it's not the only freebie this week: You can alsopick up Ogu and the Secret Forest, a 2D adventure-puzzle game in which you'll \"befriend bouncy characters and defeat strange creatures to unravel the mystery of the charming world.\" Very different sort of vibe but it looks cool too, and holds a \"very positive\" rating on Steam, where it initially launched in July 2024. Deathloop and Ogu are free on the Epic Games Store until June 12. After that comes another notable giveaway: Two Point Hospital, the not-entirely-serious (and exceptionally good) hospital building and management sim from Two Point Studios, which is also going up for giveaway on Epic for the first time ever.

    "title": "The only good MOBA celebrates its 10th anniversary, so I booted up Heroes of the Storm again and was so bad one of my teammates called me an NPC",
    "article_text": "It still has the magic in spades. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Heroes of the Storm has announced that, to celebratethe game's 10th anniversary, all heroes will be free for all players until June 15, there's one new skin, and if you login, you'll get a few little bonuses to boot. It's been five years since HotS got a new hero, and three years since Blizzard officially put the game into \"maintenance mode\", but as we recently noted it'slooking awfully spryfor what some call a \"dead game.\" That's probably because, even if it never turned out to be the LoL/Dota 2 competitor that Blizzard was hoping for, it has since launch been a brilliant game, and the only MOBA I've ever really loved. Whatever that Blizzard magic is, HotS has it in spades: the match length is perfect, almost every game seems to produce a genuine push-and-pull between both teams, and even basic elements like fighting mobs still feels exciting. I played HotS solidly for years before falling off, and seeing the 10th anniversary celebration had me jonesing for another quick fix. So I downloaded it (around 35GB these days) and was first of all blown away by just how many heroes the game now has: 90 in total, from across all of Blizzard's games and not just the biggies. One of my favourite heroes, for example, is The Lost Vikings. I would never say I was particularly great with them, but they work in a very similar manner to the rock-paper-scissors mechanics of the original platformers where each viking has a very particular skill. So in HotS Baleog the Fierce is a damage-dealer, Erik the Swift runs around with his slingshot inflicting constant ranged damage, and Olaf tanks for the group: the twist is that you can control them as a group, or split the individual members across the map for different tasks. Obviously none of the vikings is as strong as a \"normal\" solo hero, but it makes them a unique proposition within HotS, and many other heroes are similarly distinctive. I didn't quite think I'd be up to controlling three characters at once on my grand return, however, so decided to go with one of the more vanilla characters: Diablo's Valla, who's a ranged assassin. Playing Valla is a tonne of fun and I mained her for a while, but it's a pretty straightforward style: hang around near fights peppering enemies with constant crossbow shots, mixing in your two special shots every few seconds, and flip away from danger when something tries to target you (though you can also use this ability to chase down enemy heroes). Throw in the occasional ult, rinse and repeat. What could go wrong? Well I forgot how squishy Valla was, for a start, and gave away an early kill after getting jumped. But this is nowhere near as big a deal in HotS as in some of the competition, and the game proceeded apace. I wasn't doing outstanding but I was getting all my abilities in, joining team fights, and pushing gates effectively. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Soon enough I was back on autopilot. \"Still got it\" I thought as I chased down and ulted two enemy heroes trying to escape a team fight, nailing both. \"Why did I ever stop playing this\" I thought as another set of towers fell: we had an open route to their Nexus. Then it all went pear-shaped. My team focused on the top lane, where we'd broken through, and started hammering the last line of defences. But the enemy team had broken through on our bottom lane after killing our defending hero, and were doing exactly the same: I could see they were going to get our Nexus first, unless a hero stepped up to save the day. I hearthed back to base and pinged the enemy team like mad. None of my teammates joined me, and the one who'd been killed still had a 30 second cooldown. I put up stiff resistance, peppering the enemy team and distracting them from the Nexus, but it was a losing battle. I kept pinging. Then disaster: an enemy dropped a stun on me, the entire team unloaded in my direction, and I was dead with a big cooldown. All-too-late the team returned to base to try and make this defence work. It didn't: our Nexus fell, and the game was over. \"Valla\" read the chat from one of my teammates. \"Ur a NPC.\" Breathe in that rarified air: that's the true MOBA experience. Who knows but I might have another go tonight. Because HotS still occupies a niche that no other MOBA does and, despite the whole maintenance mode thing, Blizzard keeps quietly issuing near-monthly patches that keep things ticking over. Who knows how many people are playing this thing but I had two matches last night and with both the queue time was less than a minute. Heroes of the Storm may lack some of the genre's more granular complexities, such as last-hitting, but almost every time it delivers a concentrated burst of the good stuff that makes these games so compelling: teamplay around objectives, great big fights, huge swings in momentum. Oh, and there's one more reason for lapsed players to have a little swing by HotS town once more.

    "title": "Metal Gear Solid Delta's new trailer ends on a tease for the long-awaited return of Metal Gear Online",
    "article_text": "Kept you waiting huh. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Among the trailers at Sony's State of Play showcase was a new look atMetal Gear Delta: Snake Eater. Of the many remake projects in the contemporary game industry, this is a bit of an odd one: it's largely a straight-up visual recreation of Metal Gear Solid 3, with some modernized touches, which means it's going to feel an awful lot like the original PS2 game. Now, yeah, that PS2 game isone of the best ever made, but still. All of the questions I have around Delta are how the feel of the game is going to hold up, because visually Konami has done a spectacular job on the characters and environments. The latest trailer mostly focuses on giving us a brief glimpse of Snake's various fights against the Cobra Unit, MGS Delta's bosses, and a few of the game's big set pieces. Revolver Ocelot's still doing his goofy gun tricks, the Pain (the bee guy) is still chewing the scenery as he sends little swarms after you, and The End (old sniper dude) fight looks like it'll be taking full advantage of the gorgeous environment and camouflage work. Particularly notable were some of Ocelot's animations, which almost look like they've been slightly stylised but lifted straight from the PS2 game. Oh: and it looks like the fistfight with Volgin might be a little more of a fight this time, with Snake executing some beautifully clean CQC on him. I may be reading too much into a brief clip there though. Once the boss showreel is out of the way, however, and we've seen a few of the chase sequences, this new trailer goes into some of Delta's more unusual features. The first is the return of Snake vs. Monkey, which Konami had previously confirmed, an excellent Sony-exclusive bonus mode that sees Snake hunting down the little critters from Ape Escape. This particular flavour of the mode will only be on PlayStation, but Konami is making a version with Bomberman for Xbox, which is presumably the version we'll be getting on PC. Then the big news. Right at the end of the trailer we see a jungle landscape. An item appears. A previously camouflaged player quickly grabs the item, dives to the ground, and their camouflage shifts to match the terrain. A split-second later another player appears, looks around suspiciously for a moment, then walks on by without seeing them. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. It's only a few seconds long, but this is unmistakably a tease for the return of Metal Gear Online, the absolutely superb multiplayer mode that was introduced in MGS3: Subsistence (a PS2 director's cut of the original game). Following the clip we see the text \"and more\" which as far as I'm concerned seals the deal: I was definitely interested in Delta anyway, but honestly didn't expect the return of MGO. You may well wonder why this is worth getting excited about. MGO pits two teams of soldiers against each other across various modes (deathmatch, capture the flag, etcetera), with the top-scoring player on each team becoming one of the game's main characters in the next round (with unique equipment and abilities). That may sound pretty standard but the magic of MGO is in the depth of Metal Gear's existing systems, and how cleverly they're implemented in a multiplayer environment. It's also full of brilliant little Kojima touches, like dead players becoming invisible ghosts that can go around, tap on walls, and whisper \"woooo\" in the ears of the living. MGO didn't survive long in the wild: Konami turned off the various worldwide servers across 2006-7, though to this day there are fan-run communities that keep the game (and later iterations of MGO) available. Konami has yet to officially confirm the return of MGO, but I'm convinced (and delighted). We'll know for sure soon enough: Metal Gear Delta is due to release on August 28,2025, and for such a visual showcase has somepretty reasonable system requirements.

    "title": "Guilty as Sock may be the only game where you can sue Master Chief for indecent exposure and then write sensational articles about Mr. Bean committing financial fraud",
    "article_text": "Breaking news: This court case is boring af. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In the criminal justice system, the people are represented by two separate yet equally important groups: Idiot sockpuppet lawyers and a bailiff with the power to turn people into chickens. These are their stories. The stage has been set, on trial is Mr Bean, a known funny guy, an unknown perpetrator of financial fraud. There's the best of the best on both sides: a sockpuppet cowboy as a prosecutor and Count Dracula's left sock for a defence attorney. And I'm sat on the sidelines getting to watch these two legends duke it out and write it all down. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together The prosecutor started with a bold claim that Mr Bean had been shaving the top off his lottery ticket winnings, forging false documents, and just generally being an all-round shady guy. There were mountains of evidence to back this up: torn lottery tickets, gold watches, and plenty of burner cells. It wasn't looking good for Mr. Bean. The defense on the other hand went for a \"just trust me\" approach, saying that Mr. Bean couldn't have done anything of the sort because he said he hadn't, a compelling argument for sure. As the only journalist in the courtroom, I felt like it was my duty to report on both sides in a fair and equal manner until I got sidetracked by trying to draw Yugi Mutou for one of my sensational articles. But for the most part, I think I reported on everything that happened in an appropriate fashion. This is just a glimpse of the chaos that can erupt at a moment's notice in Guilty as Sock, a multiplayer game all about picking fights with your friends. Up to nine players can choose one of seven roles: judge, prosecutor, defence attorney, bailiff, witness, journalist, and juror. But don't worry. if you can't find that many people to play with, you only need three for a functioning game. The main roles are the judge, the overlord of said proceedings, in control of who speaks when and punishing annoying socks that won't shut up by hitting them on the head and concussing them with your gavel. Then there's the prosecutor who comes up with the crime and then fights to get the defendant put away, and the defence attorney who desperately tries to help their client avoid jail time. Both lawyers also have a bevvy of evidence cards at their disposal. While you do have the option to create your own deck of defence or prosecution cards there is also just a base set for you to use to the best of your ability. But be warned, using the default cards can be tricky. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. During another court proceeding in which I, as defence attorney this time, was defending Mr John Master Chief from accusations of indecent exposure leading to mass casualties, I had a very limited deck to work with. Now this may seem daunting at first but you can make anything work if you're creative enough with what you have. I went for the classic conspiracy defence, using cards like The Party Hat, Ghosted Texts, and Suspicious Burner Phone, to create a narrative in which the accusers were once left on read by my client after a birthday party and were so embarrassed by it that they decided to work together with others who disliked my client to ruin his public reputation. Needless to say, my client got off scot-free—#NotMyMasterChief—thanks to my brilliant defence and the fact that our judge is a really big Halo fan, but mostly thanks to me. Unfortunately, during Master Chief's celebrations, he attempted to do a backflip and landed flat on the pavement, breaking his leg and putting him in a wheelchair for six weeks, so I guess the next step will be to sue the pavement for aggravated assault. Really there are endless fights you could pick in Guilty as Sock—the only limitation is your imagination or how far you're willing to take a quarrel between friends. My suggestion is that if you have any unsettled beef then this is the perfect arena to bring it up and battle it out. Plus angry emoting sock puppets make even the most brutal criticisms slightly more bearable.

    "article_text": "Yes, you can pet the magic flying dolphins. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. More than two years after its first trailer debuted, magical surfing adventureSword of the Seafinally has a release date—August 19—announced during Sony's State of Play showcase last night. It'll be the third game from Giant Squid, the small studio behind the award-winning undersea exploration gameAbzûand magical parkour archery adventureThe Pathless, which our Luke Kemp gave a powerful 85% score. Once again, Giant Squid is playing to its strengths, aiming to get players into that magical flow-state where fancy movement just feels as natural as breathing—something they've proven that they're very capable of. This time, players are an undead wizard exploring a desert where the dunes flow like water, and there's magicking to be done to restore the ocean (and accompanying greenery) to its rightful place. And where there's waves, there's the chance to do radical 1080s, especially when you're riding a giant magical sword as a surfboard. Have a peek at some of the vistas in the date announcement trailer below. It's hard not to draw comparisons to similarly styled mystical desert trekking (and occasionally sand-surfing) adventure Journey, which it shares some development talent with. From what the team's shown, it feels like Sword of the Sea is going to be a bit more action-focused. While Giant Squid hasn't shown any scoring systems or other Tony Hawk-inspired wackiness to incentivize it, there are all kinds of flips, twists and tricks you can do on your magical surfboard-sword. The trailer also shows some fun-looking traversal, including ceiling-riding on full-pipes, bouncing across giant flying jellyfish and grinding across massive chains. Unlike The Pathless, there's been no combat shown in the footage so far, although there are some menacing looking big creatures, so I'm expecting at least one big set piece where you get to surf along the back of a town-sized monster. In fact, I'll be disappointed if I don't get one. You can't give me a magical surf-sword and not provide that kind of wish fulfillment. At least the trailer does confirm one important point: You can pet the magical flying dolphins, and there's bigger critters to find. Will we be able to kickflip over a whale to assert dominance? Only time will tell, but I'm hoping. Sword of the Sea launches onSteamand Epic on August 19th.

    "article_text": "Weapons, bikes, and buildings all require unique tools for fixes. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Traversing all of those scorching deserts and abandoned research facilities takes a toll on everything inDune: Awakening, including whatever guns, gear, or vehicles you bring along for the mission. You'll want to repair gear and items before heading out on any lengthy excursions, lest you get caught unarmed, naked, and chased by a giant worm through the open sands. Repairing Dune's arsenal of gadgets isn't too complicated, but you'll want to start thinking about it early, as some items decay faster than others and require more resources to make them as good as new. First and foremost, you'll need to research aRepair Stationto restore the durability of armor, weapons, and tools in Dune: Awakening. It's available through the Maintenance quest in the Vermillius Gap Journey. After building the Repair Station, simply interact with the machine to slot in your item and any raw materials needed for mending. A quick overview on repairs in Dune: Awakening✔️Research the Welding Torch and Repair Station✔️Complete theMaintenancequest in the Vermillius Gap✔️You can only repair items you have the recipe for✔️Repairs require a few materials from the original recipe✔️Make sure your Repair Station has enough circuit power As a quick reminder, monitor your base's circuit power when building fancy new machinery. The Repair Station adds a small +20 circuit power to your energy consumption, but that adds up quickly if you're running a single, inefficient generator early on. TheWelding Toolrepairs sandbikes and other vehicles with low durability usingWelding Wire. Both are made in the Fabricator, and all you'll do is interact with any parked vehicle while the Welding Torch is equipped. Just watch your supply of wire, as repairs chew through them fast when you're traveling. This one is a little less complicated, as you'll just need theConstruction Toolto repair damaged structures. It's the same thing used to build a base, so if you've gotten that far, repairing crumbling base walls should be well within the budget. Simply equip the Construction Tool while standing on any land you've parked a Sub-fief on, aim it at the wall or roof, and swap to Repair instead of Build in the bottom right menu.

    "title": "Corsair Nautilus 360 RS review",
    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The Corsair Nautilus 360 RS has two major strengths, both of which are dependent on the PC build they go into. First, the tubes are longer than most at 450 mm, which can solve an issue present in some cases, and second, the stealth look ditches RGB lighting and all the cables that come with it. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. It's not often that a liquid cooler flies under the radar these days. Many on the market are adorned with massive screens and more bling than a boxing match. Not the Corsair Nautilus 360 RS. It's a top-notch liquid cooler with solid performance and low noise levels. Available for$110/£110, the Nautilus is an affordable unit. That price puts it in a league with some very, very good all-in-one liquid coolers, however, such as theArctic Liquid Freezer III 360 ARGB(and newer Pro version) and Cooler Master Masterliquid 360 Core II—both at the $100 mark or below. That means you are paying a small premium for the Corsair badge on this one, especially as it lacks any of the RGB lighting found on those two models. I have a feeling the clientele for this cooler won't care too much for the lack of lighting. There's not a single LED on this particular unit, which makes it perfect for a PC build without a window or one going for a stealthy, low-profile finish. It also has the benefit of simplifying the cables required to get it up-and-running. There's only a single 4-pin PWM cable from the pump and a single 4-pin PWM cable from the fans. The three RS120 fans are daisy-chained together using standard, non-proprietary cables, terminating in one longer PWM cable. The lack of proprietary cables is a big win in my books. I'm testing theCorsair iCUE Link Titan 360 RX LCDright now and having installed it into multiple machines, I've started to get quite frustrated with the number of cables, some proprietary, that it requires. The Nautilus has none of that. Radiator size:360 mmRadiator material:AluminiumPump:Corsair in-houseSocket compatibility:AM5/AM4, LGA1851/1700Fans:3x RS120Fan speed:1700 rpmRGB lighting:NoneTubing length:450 mmPrice:$110/£110 You can't totally avoid Corsair's tech-forward approach, as you will have to scan a QR code to access the manual for the Nautilus, and a paper one isn't provided in the box. Though you probably don't need it, it's a fairly straightforward installation process. Installation is made easy on the Nautilus through the use of long standoff screws that attach to the provided backplate on Intel systems. These let you rest the cooler in place while you grab the thumbscrews to lock it down. The process is more or less the same on AMD systems, minus the included backplate as one is already installed, though you will have to remove the pre-supplied AMD bracket if one is still attached to your motherboard. One slight bugbear of mine with many liquid coolers on the market today, including the Nautilus, is that the standoff screws can become tough to take out when removing the liquid cooler. Most screw to the top right of the CPU, which is nestled in between the VRM. Sometimes you have to get a pair of pliers on these to remove them, and that's a bit sketchy with components that are easy to rip off close by. I mention this here, however, because the Corsair iCUE Link Titan 360 RX actually solves this problem with long screws integrated into the pump bracket. I'd like to see that approach roll out to the rest of these non-iCUE models, ideally. The Nautilus 360 RS does have one trick up its sleeve to make installation easier: long tubes. Anyone that's ever struggled with short tubes on a liquid cooler will be pleased to hear that the Nautilus has 450 mm-long tubes, which are a whole 50 mm longer than your average cooler. That makes a big difference if you're planning to mount the liquid cooler in the front of your case, which can occasionally lead to slightly uncomfortable tubular tension. Though if you're planning to orient this cooler in a different way to the usual mounting position (inlet/outlet towards the front of the case), be warned that you cannot rotate the Corsair logo on the pump unit. The facade does come away from the pump but it can only be attached one way due to the odd, non-symmetrical clip design. I feel like that's an easy win missed for Corsair here. In terms of performance, I was surprised to see the Nautilus competing with the more expensive Titan in many regards. Though it must be said that most AIO coolers tend to perform very well these days, and are separated by other features, such as screens, lighting and noise-levels. The Nautilus comes with a low-noise pump of seemingly Corsair's own design—though Corsair makes less fuss about this being in-house than it does the Flowdrive pump found on the Titan, so I can't be certain. Either way, it's an effective pump in tandem with those three RS 120 fans. The Nautilus delivered lower temperatures than the Titan in both of our gaming tests, extended runs of Baldur's Gate 3 and Metro: Exodus Enhanced Edition, which is good to see. However, it did end up on the higher end of the performance scale versus other liquid coolers we've tested this month. Not by much, but the one to highlight for comparison is the$100/£95Cooler Master MasterLiquid 360 Core II, which offers reliably lower temperatures than most coolers in our tests. Ultimately, the Nautilus performs extremely similarly to the many other liquid coolers we've tested. Once again driving the point home that most liquid coolers are, give or take, quite good these days. It's really all about the value for money and the noise-levels, and on that latter point, I can report that the Nautilus is quite good. The fans aren't particularly loud, though they only spin up to around 1700 rpm, which is lower than some at max throttle. The pump is one of the louder options I've tested, though not by such a margin that it will really make a noticeable difference once installed inside a case and with other fans whirring around it. ✅ You want a liquid cooler, nothing else:If you only care for performance and installation simplicity, this is a great way to ditch the superfluous extras and proprietary cables. ❌ You want top performance-per-dollar:The Nautilus is right in the mix for cooling performance, but there are cheaper models such as Arctic's Liquid Freezer III or Cooler Master's MasterLiquid 360 Core II that offer slightly lower temps for less. There are some broad positives for the Nautilus in terms of intensive CPU tests. It kept ourIntel Core i7 14700Kunder control throughout runs and prevented any large spikes above 95 °C. It also kept the chip extremely cool once we lowered the wattage to 120 W, which is our way of imitating a more power-efficient chip (ie, anything but Intel's 13/14th Gen). It took a little longer than others we tested to return to idle after an extended run of Cinebench R23, however, but adequate enough to get a pass. Whether you should buy a Nautilus over any other excellent liquid cooler comes down to price, looks, and long tubes. On the pricing front, it's beat by theArctic Liquid Freezer III 360andCooler Master MasterLiquid 360 Core II, both comfortably under the $100 mark right now and able to outperform the Corsair in our testing. Rather the Corsair Nautilus 360 RS should be considered for its black-out style, simple set-up, and for any build that requires those longer tube lengths. That makes it a little more niche, but there's definitely something here to consider. The Corsair Nautilus 360 RS has two major strengths, both of which are dependent on the PC build they go into. First, the tubes are longer than most at 450 mm, which can solve an issue present in some cases, and second, the stealth look ditches RGB lighting and all the cables that come with it.

We're not short of excellent and affordable all-in-one liquid coolers today—many of thebest liquid coolersare wildly affordable under $100, which means Cooler Master has its work cut out for it. But the cooling company is making a darn good effort with the MasterLiquid 360 Core II. The MasterLiquid 360 Core II bucks the trend for liquid coolers in 2025: it doesn't have a screen stuck on the pump. There's no screen anywhere on this unit, in fact, which lends to its agreeable price tag of just$100/£95. At the time of writing there's even a $15 coupon at Amazon to knock it down to $85 but I'm not sure how long that'll stick around. That price puts the MasterLiquid 360 Core II on a competitive footing with some of the best value liquid coolers out there, such as Arctic's new and improved Liquid Freezer III 360 A-RGB at$94. I have the 360 mm model for review, as that's more or less the standard size for new PC builds and has broad support in today'sbest PC cases. However, you can save yourself another $15 on the smaller Masterliquid 240 Core II. The 360 mm model comes with three MF 120 Lite ARGB fans. These use a sleeve bearing, which means they're far from a top-tier model. The good news is they're not overly loud in testing, ending up around a similar volume to the majority of liquid coolers. I test at the maximum fan speed, however, and these only reach a rather pedestrian 1750 rpm. That's a bit slower than some with similar noise levels, such as Corsair's RS120 rated to 2100 rpm and included on theTitan 360 RX LCD. Radiator size:360 mmRadiator material:AluminiumPump:Cooler Master G9RSocket compatibility:AM5/AM4, LGA1851/1700/1200/1156/1155/1151/1150Fans:3x MF 120 Lite ARGBFan speed:1750 rpmRGB lighting:FansTubing length:400 mmPrice:$100/£95 These fans have ARGB lighting that shines through the translucent blades from LEDs buried within the fan hub. The overall effect is nothing special compared to some flashier models on the market, but these fans are pretty vibrant. In the right case, they could look great, and they do pair well with the infinity mirror effect on the pump unit. The pump is relatively slim and low-profile compared to some on the market today—looking at you, Tryx. It houses a G9R 'dual-chamber' pump and one that Cooler Master claims is capable of \"silent performance\". That's not strictly true, it's not silent, but it is relatively low noise. I tested the pump without any other fans on in the system to get a bead on its actual noise output and, granted, I don't have an acoustic chamber to test this in with zero outside noise, but my office is pretty quiet. It hit around 34 decibels, which is a touch quieter than Corsair's affordable Nautilus 360 RS but a little louder than the Titan 360 RX LCD. Altogether, cooler pumps have come on leaps and bounds in recent years, and it's not particularly noticeable once the fans whirr to life. But what are low noise levels without top cooling performance? The good news is the MasterLiquid 360 Core II performs extremely well in testing. Using anIntel Core i7 14700K, I put it through its paces in Baldur's Gate 3 and Metro Exodus. The MasterLiquid often outperformed Corsair and NZXT models here, with the lowest average temperature in Baldur's Gate 3 of the seven coolers we've tested in the past month. The same good performance can be seen through our more demanding CPU-intensive tests. In X264, it keeps the 14700K to a moderate 78 °C on average. That's stellar performance in a very taxing test. Through a 10-minute run of Cinebench R23, the MasterLiquid manages to keep the chip down to a very impressive 76 °C. The time it took for the chip to return to idle temperature following a Cinebench run is also decent at 140 seconds, which is on par with other capable liquid coolers. The 14700K is a bit of a hog and a worst-case scenario for this liquid cooler. On a more reasonable chip, it performs even better. I lowered the 14700K to 120 W and the MasterLiquid 360 Core II kept it below 50°C throughout Cinebench R23 for 10 minutes—this result being the best of the bunch in my testing. As for the installation process, it's about as simple as it comes. The three fans come pre-installed in a push configuration, which works best for a top-mounted exhaust set-up. The fans come connected to one another using a single cable for both ARGB and PWM, and there's an adapter in the box to split these back out into PWM and ARGB connections to connect to your motherboard. This adapter cable is just over 600 mm in length, plenty for most cases. The pump also comes with an ARGB connector and a DC fan header, and the former can be attached to the same adapter as the fans for one ARGB header connection to your motherboard. The tubing measures 400 mm, which is on the shorter side, but Cooler Master has included two clips to keep them neatly arranged. Otherwise the pump installation is a breeze. For my Intel system, I had to fit the backplate and thread some standoffs in to hold it firmly in place, and then the cooler sits atop of that and screws in with some thumbscrews. On an AMD system, it's even easier. Remove the included cooler mount and screw in a replacement, then the pump sits atop of that. ✅ You can find it for less than Arctic's Liquid Freezer III:The Liquid Freezer III is a great cooler and excellent value-for-money, but the Cooler Master is right there with it, too. If you can find it for less money, go grab it. ❌ You want top-notch fans:The MF 120 Lite fans on the Cooler Master are effective in combination with the G9R pump but there are better bearings and faster, quieter options out there. The only major downside for what is otherwise a straightforward installation is the lack of thermal paste. There's none pre-applied to the coldplate nor is there a tube included in the box. Don't forget to pick some up! Put it all together and you're looking at a superb performing liquid cooler that doesn't break the bank. It's not the flashiest, though it does look pretty good for the infinity effect pump and ARGB fans. The noise levels are reasonable and well within the usual range for this size of cooler, too. The only elephant in the room is the Arctic Liquid Freezer III Pro 360, the newer version of the superbLiquid Freezer III. We don't have that in for testing yet, though the older model is still the cooler to beat in many of our charts. The Cooler Master MasterLiquid 360 Core II doesn't knock the Arctic Liquid Freezer III off its perch, but it is a great alternative. If you can find it on sale for less, you should save the pennies and pick one up. If you find a good deal on the Cooler Master MasterLiquid 360 Core II, it's well worth picking up as an alternative to the Arctic Liquid Freezer III. It's a quality all-in-one with excellent performance. Jacob earned his first byline writing for his own tech blog.

    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If you're planning a full Corsair iCUE Link build, and you want to minimise noise, this could be a decent option. Otherwise, look elsewhere. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. Decluttering your gaming PC is a noble goal. I'm totally into the idea of cutting out cable mess and keeping my system tray free of as many applications as possible. This is handily what Corsair promises to do with iCUE Link, combining all my cables into a single hub and offering to control my components via a single application, iCUE. So why do I still find myself so frustrated by the sheer amount of cables required to set-up the Corsair iCUE Link Titan 360 RX LCD? I've just wrapped up myCorsair Nautilus RS 360 reviewand it makes for a good comparison with the Titan 360 RX LCD. The Nautilus is a brand new all-in-one liquid cooler with three RS120 fans, a$110/£110price tag, and requires just two cables to function. It lacks a screen, RGB lighting, or any other intelligent feature, hence why it gets away with just two 4-pin PWM connectors—one for the pump and one for the daisy-chained fans. The Corsair iCUE Link Titan 360 RX LCD is a brand new all-in-one liquid cooler with three RX120 RGB fans, a$220/£260price tag, and requires a connection to one fan header, one USB 2.0 header via a splitter, and one 1x 6-pin PCIe power connector to function. But wait, there's more. That's just for the System Hub required to get it going. The System Hub also connects to the fans on the radiator, which then connect to the pump, and the pump also has another cable running to one of the USB 2.0 headers on the aforementioned splitter cable. It's tough to see the benefits of iCUE Link through the mess of cables required to set it up. Though admittedly the Titan 360 RX LCD has a lot more going on than the Nautilus. It has 44 addressable RGB LEDs on the pump, eight more on each of the three fans, a 2.1-inch IPS display, and the ability to be daisy-chained to various other components, namely more fans. Still, the required cables and clutter do feel extreme for merely a liquid cooler alone, but perhaps that's by design. It is too much for a liquid cooler—it's meant to connect most of your PC. Radiator size:360 mmRadiator material:AluminiumPump:Corsair FlowdriveSocket compatibility:AM5/AM4, LGA1851/1700Fans:3x RX120 RGBFan speed:2100 rpmRGB lighting:Yes, pump + fansTubing length:450 mmPrice:$220/£260 So, I went one step further and built an entire gaming PC with Corsair's latest parts. That includes aCorsair Frame 4000Dcase, Corsair LX120-R RGB and LX120 RGB fans, Corsair RM850X power supply, and Corsair Vengeance 32 GB DDR5-6000 memory with the Light Enhancement Kit. The lot. In that build experiment, I did come to appreciate the ability to adjust my entire PC through a single app. I do have fewer applications in my system tray and I no longer have to try to colour-match the hue of RGB LEDs on different parts using different software—though there are ways around that using tools like OpenRGB or just sticking everything on your motherboard ARGB headers. It's also very easy to add new things into the iCUE loop. The point is, iCUE makes a lot more sense when it's connectingeverythingtogether in a full, from-scratch build. I've come to appreciate the Titan for how it is fitted, too. For one, the tubes are longer than usual at 450 mm. But more than that, unlike some other coolers in Corsair's lineup, including the Nautilus, the Titan gets rid of the traditional standoff posts that we've come to expect and instead integrates longer screws into the bracket attached to the pump. That doesn't make a huge difference when installing the pump, but when removing it, you no longer have to try to unscrew stiff posts that are precariously close to motherboard VRM components or partially blocked by the VRM heatsink. However, I also came away feeling like the Titan 360 RX LCD could've played a more central role in the system. The cooler could become the System Hub, for example. This isn't a brave new idea—Hyte does this exact thing with its Thicc Q60, which is both a liquid cooler with a screen and an I/O hub for its own proprietary system for connecting new fans, LED strips and accessories via USB-C. The Titan 360 RX LCD isn't as smart and merely adds to the clutter, rather than cuts it out. I also ran into another issue with Corsair's iCUE Link system, one that is common between Corsair and Hyte, and that's the requirement for a spare 6-pin PCIe cable. The system I built used exclusively AMD parts, including an XFX Radeon RX 9070 XT graphics card. This card requires three 8-pin power connectors—now take a guess how many PCIe power cables are included with the Corsair RM850x power supply I picked for this build. Yep, it has three. So I was one PCIe connector down, but luckily I had a spare cable (always check they're the exact same), except this one was in white. It doesn't look great, but it works, and yeah, that's another cable added to the system that's designed to… save cables? Corsair has thought of a solution to some of these issues, and one which I got to see first-hand at Computex 2025. The latest RMx Shift PSUs have a System Hub built in, which removes the need for that pesky PCIe connectionanda dedicated hub somewhere in your machine. Two birds, one stone—but it wasn't available when I built my machine. I realise I've been talking around the ecosystem for the Titan 360 RX LCD a lot, more so than even the cooler itself, but it's hard to separate the latter from the former. You shouldn't buy the Titan 360 RX LCDunlessyou're buying into the entire iCUE ecosystem. It's a lot of hassle for a screen that you can find elsewhere, such as theNZXT's Kraken Elite 360 RGBorTryx's Panorama 360 ARGB—though both are more expensive than Corsair's option in the US (UK is closer due to a much higher MSRP). I don't think resolution and refresh ratereallymatter so much on a 2-and-a-bit-inch screen, but if you're really into it, NZXT's option is better on both counts. If you do plan on buying entirely into the iCUE Link ecosystem, however, here are the important details from my testing. The Titan 360 RX LCD ended up being outperformed in gaming tests by many of the liquid coolers I tested alongside it, including Corsair's own Nautilus 360 RS. We test coolers using anIntel Core i7 14700K, which is a demanding chip and tough to keep cool, and the Titan struggled a little more than others in both games and CPU-intensive workloads. That's a bit of a surprise, considering this is Corsair's latest and greatest in-house pump design, nicknamed Flowdrive, but it should be said that little separates the best liquid coolers and the worst liquid coolers. The Titan still remains capable of keeping the Core i7 cool under load. That new pump design is good for keeping the noise down, however. The Titan 360 RX LCD pump is quieter in testing than the Nautilus, which uses a non-Flowdrive Corsair-designed pump, andCooler Master's MasterLiquid 360 Core II, which uses the company's own G9R pump. It's only louder than theHyte Thicc Q60, though that uses a unique design with a pump buried inside the radiator, which helps keep the noise down somewhat. ✅ You have a full iCUE Link system planned:There's just no reason to install this cooler, and all its clutter, if you're not using it as part of a wider Corsair ecosystem. ❌ You just want a screen on your cooler:Most cooler manufacturers have a screen to offer you these days, and NZXT and Tryx both offer simpler solutions. ❌ You want a simple install process:First off, you have to scan a QR code for the manual, and you're going to need it. There's a lot to plug in. The RX120 RGB fans do well to minimise noise, too. The Titan made a little more noise overall than the Nautilus and MasterLiquid, but my testing involves running the fans at full speed to measure maximum performance. The Titan's RX120 fans run 2100 rpm, much faster than the 1700 and 1750 rpm fans on the Nautilus and MasterLiquid, respectively. At idle, the cooler is practically inaudible. Overall, the Corsair iCUE Link Titan 360 RX LCD is not a convincing upgrade for an existing system. You need to build a PC around it, with iCUE Link at the forefront, to get the most out of it and the ecosystem. Otherwise, you end up with more cable clutter than you would with a traditional, more affordable liquid cooler. Where the Titan RXdoesexcel is within that entire ecosystem. It looks excellent with my key stats up on that IPS screen and all my RGB lighting, across pump and fans, sharing a dynamic theme that shifts and sways across the many diffused RGB LEDs. Plus, it's cheaper for a screen than some competing coolers. If looks were all I was judging it for, it'd be right up there. However, the rest of the package just isn't quite convincing enough to rank it with the best. If you're planning a full Corsair iCUE Link build, and you want to minimise noise, this could be a decent option. Otherwise, look elsewhere.

    "title": "NZXT Kraken Elite 360 RGB (2024) review",
    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The Kraken Elite represents a new chapter for NZXT and a step away from Asetek's all-consuming patents. With a slick aesthetic and solid performance, the only things that really let it down are sluggish fans and an exorbitant price point. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. There are certain brands out there that we just associate with certain products, right? You know the ones I mean. Noctua for fans, Corsair for memory, EKWB for custom loops (before it got all weird),Asusfor expensive motherboards. You get the gist. Arguably, in the hard-fought world of AIO liquid coolers, NZXT is definitely up there as a contender for top dog, certainly with its Kraken line. As a brand, it has consistently and comfortably improved and iterated on this lineup time and time again, and although its fans haven't always been the best, it's almost always delivered some solid cooler options, albeit for a price. From stock standard plastic blocks toinfinity mirrorsto full-on displays, and well, now this, over the years it's consistency with iterative upgrades has led to some serious gains. There's always been one problem, though. One itch that NZXT's engineering team has always been desperate to scratch. And namely, that's Asetek's pump patents. You know it, you probably hate it: It's why most modern coolers have looked and mounted the same way for decades now and why we've consistently seen lawsuits and counter lawsuits as companies butt heads over it. Yet, today, somehow, NZXT has managed to sidestep Asetek's solicitors and, coincidentally, reinvented the wheel with the introduction of its own pump. Yep, you heard that right; it now has its own \"Turbine\" pump design, which has been remarkably successful and arguably probably a lotcheaperfor the Californian company to manufacture if recent reports are anything to go by. Socket compatibility:AM5, AM4, LGA1851, LGA1700, LGA1200/115XDimensions:401 x 120 x 27 mmRadiator:360 mm AluminumTubing:420 mmPump:NZXT Turbine Pump @ 1200 - 2800Fans:3x 120 mm - F360 RGB CoreLighting:Full RGB Fans & PumpScreen:2.72-inch IPS, 640 x 640 @ 60 HzWarranty:6-Years / 60,000 HoursPrice:$320/£260 That's a big reason as to why the Kraken Elite 360 RGB has effectively had this massive redesign. It's finally given NZXT the flexibility it needed to really go to town on the thing. You still get the wide array of sizing options, of course, the 420 mm-long tubing, and a full-fat aluminum radiator, with a six-year warranty piled on top. Plus huge compatibility with every mainstream socket that's debuted in the last decade or so. But, most pivotally, the fans, the screen, and the pump have diametrically changed from what they were. With Asetek no longer in the picture (somehow), it's given NZXT the legs to be able to really make something special here, something a little more unique. Is this arguably one of thebest coolersout there today? Well, from an aesthetics perspective, it's hard to argue against it, that's for damn sure. Let's talk the screen first, because this CPU block is an absolute beast. It comes in at a whopping 2.72 inches on the diagonal. It's an IPS display. It has a 640 x 640 resolution plus a 60 Hz refresh rate on top of that as well, and it's, of course, all controllable via NZXT's Cam software. That sits on top of NZXT's Turbine pump, which runs around 1,200 to 2,800 rpm, respectively. NZXT's also included a lovely diffused LED ARGB ring array around the main bulk of the thing too, to really give it some added pop. What's impressive about it, though, particularly for a system builder like myself, is the absolute lack of cables anywhere near that block. NZXT's done away with the traditional breakout cables you'd usually find here and, instead, routed all of it internally, up inside the tubing sleeving. It's then placed a controller module on the radiator itself, which in turn has a breakout cable here instead. That then allows you to cable manage and discreetly hide it in the back of your chassis. This isn't the first time we've seen it; EKWB did have something similar many, many, many years ago, but it's incredibly effective and really cleans up the overall look of the build. That control box and breakout cable strapped to the rad does mean you have a bit more depth in your radiator to consider, which can be particularly troublesome if you have recessed rad mounting in your case, but the trade-off is well worth it, as you'll no longer have wanton USB and fan cables trailing over the VRM on your motherboard. As for the fans, NZXT launched the new Kraken side-by-side with its F Core RGB series. These are effectively daisy-chained fans, lined up together in a singular frame, and each Kraken comes with its corresponding-sized frame. Each frame comes with a single breakout cable, fitted with a proprietary connector on the other end, and that then connects to the cable coming off the radiator as well, all controlled via NZXT Cam. You also get a splitter cable as well, so if you don't intend to plug it into the AIO's breakout cable, you can instead go traditional with a dRGB and PWM header on the motherboard instead. ✅ You want a stunning IPS display and easy cable management:Those two things alone should be justification enough to buy this thing. It's perfect for anyone that values aesthetics above all else. ❌ You're looking for the best value CPU cooler:With an uncomfortable$320price in the US, it does not represent good value sadly. Looks just ain't everything. They look great and minimize cable management, but there's a problem. Performance. They're not the quickest or pushiest fans out there, that's for sure. In my testing, although the Kraken Elite 360 did manage to maintain its averages fairly consistently across the board with its competitors, the time taken to return to idle was significantly slower than the likes of, say,Tryx's Panorama 360. That's likely as these fans actually spin quite slowly by comparison, a boon for noise levels (with the F360 RGB Core only landing 45.2 dB on the decibel meter), but less helpful when you're looking to bring that CPU temp back down to idle levels. That said, the Kraken Elite does hold and maintain average temperatures nicely compared to other 360 mm AIOs of a similar caliber. There is one issue, though, and that's the price. It isn't cheap; at$320, you're starting to encroach on low-end graphics card money, and to be honest, that's a hard pill to swallow. Yes, it looks great, it's easy to build with, and it performs well, but really what you're paying for here is a screen and a bit of convenience, and that's kinda it. The Kraken Elite represents a new chapter for NZXT and a step away from Asetek's all-consuming patents.

    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Big, bold, and beautiful, the Panorama absolutely delivers on both performance and looks, but at a fairly hefty outlay. If you can stomach the cost and don't mind the awkward setup compromises you're going to make, it's a real showstopping piece of tech well worth considering. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. Of all the things I thought I didn't need on my next CPU cooler, a curved OLED display was one of them. It seems that pesky screen standard has now made its way to practically every component in the gaming PC industry bar, maybe, memory? SSDs? Give it a year; there's still time. Yet Tryx's Panorama ARGB 360 caught my attention because of exactly that: its gorgeous, beautiful, captivating 6.5-inch curved OLED display. I was perusingPCPartPickeras you do in the late evening and spotted a community build with the thing and knew I just had to get it in for testing. Now Tryx is a relatively new brand in the grand scheme of things; the company started up in February of 2023, and if I'm honest, there's not a whole ton of information out there as to who's actually behind it. We know it's a brand based in China, we know it sells globally, and we know its product lines include a chassis, a fan, and its latest CPU cooler line here, but honestly that's about it. There's no prestigious history, no offshoot of some aging, slow-to-adapt company that started out before gaming mice were a thing, just a cold-hard start-up whose products have a longer warranty than the company's been around for. Fresh blood, so to speak, and what this industry desperately needs. Is this going to be the nextbest CPU cooler, then? Perhaps, perhaps not. But either way, having more choice and new and innovative designs breaking the mold is no bad thing. I've actually built with this crazy-looking thing prior to this review, using it inside of a beastlyNZXT H9 Elite buildwith anRTX 5090, and since then it's been operating as the main unit inside of a dedicated SSD testbed, but at last I got it under the microscope to see how it really ticks. Compatibility:AM5, AM4, LGA11851, LGA1200/115XDimensions:399.5 x 120 x 30 mmRadiator:360mm AluminumTubing Length:400 mmPump:Asetek 8th Generation V2 Water Pump @ 800 - 3600Fans:3x 120 mm - Rota SL ARGBLighting:Full RGB FansScreen:6.5-inch Curved OLED, 2160 x 1080 @ 60 HzWarranty:6-Years unit, 2-Years DisplayPrice:$360/£320 To be blunt, the overall design is actually fairly off-the-shelf. Tryx is taking advantage of Asetek's 8th generation V2 water pump and has then paired that with that 6.5-inch curved OLED display. The screen's got a resolution of 2160 x 1080 and a 60 Hz refresh rate to back it up. That's all controlled via its Kanali software, and you can choose from a whole plethora of system specs to monitor, plus a selection of \"3D\" video loops, or alternatively upload your own if you so desire. Otherwise, it's a full 360 mm aluminum radiator, complete with (somewhat short) 400 mm tubing runs. Socket compatibility is there for all of the most modern mainstream chips from the last decade or so (no Intel Extreme Editions or Threadrippers), and the included daisy-chained Rota SL 120 mm fans are pretty beefy too. Pricing, though, well, it ain't cheap. If you want the ARGB edition, it starts at$360for the 360 mm unit, or£320in the UK for the whole lot. The non-RGB variant, a slightly older model at this point (sans RGB illuminated fans, the one I have here), clocks in at about $340 or £330… There's also now a newer variant, called the SE, for even less than that. General setup is easy enough; the CPU block comes pre-mounted with the Intel bracket and a fairly slimline pump PWM cable, and that's it. Set up your backplate solution, install the standoffs, and secure the block down in a diamond pattern with your choice of thermal paste, and you'll be good to go. For AMD, there's an adjustable adapter that secures onto the bracket mounting locations, effectively converting it to Intel mounting, and that works just fine too. Nice. What's less stellar, and, well, more of a general problem with all of the AIOs out there utilizing Asetek's latest design, is the colossal CPU block and subsequent tiny fan attachment. It's so ridiculously tall because of that unit; it's kind of hilarious. This thing is close to around 10 cm in height from the copper cold plate, and that's not including the display above it as well. That's mostly because of that tiny fan that Asetek's using to cool the pump motor. Why that needs cooling so aggressively I do not know, but here we are. Then there's the display. You'll notice on the block itself, it has one raised area with contact points. Those contact points correlate to contacts inside the display as well. What that means is you have no choice but to orient the display and tubing one way in your chassis. You can't physically rotate the display in any meaningful way. That means no matter what your case dimensions are or where you plan to install that 360 mm radiator, you have no choice but to install the pump with the tubing inlet and outlet on the bottom. That inherently feels a little silly too, given the display itself draws power via an internal USB cable entirely separate from the block below it. The only thing interacting via those contacts, by the way, is the fan. Yep. Plus it's another cable to run, great. Combine that with the fact that the tubing length is only 400 mm versus the more common 420 mm found on competing 360 mm radiators, and your mounting options, certainly in larger cases, may become seriously restricted as a result. ✅ You want to show off your rig to your buddies:Its 6.5-inch curved OLED display is stunning, easily configurable, and has a crystal clear 2160 x 1080 wrapped resolution, perfect for all manner of creative and gentlemanly content. ❌ You've got concerns about case compatibility:Short tubing runs and a weird set of block-to-display contacts mean you can only orient the Panorama in one way, and one way only. Fortunately, performance is consistent with most modern 360 mm AIO solutions. The Rota SL fans are particularly robust. They're quite high in terms of decibels generated at full whack, but they generally pump out some solid airflow and static pressure as a result. Although average temperatures were fairly consistent across the board, certainly compared toNZXT's latest Kraken Elite 360 RGB, one of the standout performances occurred with its time taken to return to idle temp test. Going from 94 °C down to 31 °C in just 116 seconds versus the 137 the Kraken managed. There's a lot to like and a lot to dislike about Tryx's first AIO here. Its decision to go with such a bold design, a bold statement out of the gate, is worthy of praise. It aimed to create a dynamic, exciting product, and it has done just that. It performs well, the styling is slick, and the pricing, although quite high, is kind of expected for what you're getting here. Certainly with that OLED display. Still, it's not perfect; there are flaws here that needed addressing, particularly with that display orientation and Asetek's wild CPU block. Yet, all said and done, if your case can handle it and you want a real showstopper of an all-in-one liquid cooler, this might be the AIO for you. Big, bold, and beautiful, the Panorama absolutely delivers on both performance and looks, but at a fairly hefty outlay. If you can stomach the cost and don't mind the awkward setup compromises you're going to make, it's a real showstopping piece of tech well worth considering.

    "title": "OpenAI removes incredibly grim, previously recommended chatbot suggesting invasive surgeries to men it deems 'subhuman'",
    "article_text": "I cannot stress this enough: the chatbot knows less than nothing. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Once upon a time, when chatbots were still quaint little online novelties full of charmingly canned responses, my younger self aired out some of her teenaged anxieties to an eagerly listening screen. My typed words briefly painted a night sky before disappearing among its stars. The name of this encouraging chatbot—and hopefully my words along with it—have been lost to time, but the more things change, the more they stay the same. Today, there's definitely still an audience that would rather seek reassurance from the black box of AI than another human being—which is concerning when you learn just which chatbots OpenAI recommends. Tech researcher and commentator,Molly White, recently wrote about the Looksmaxxing GPT, a recently spotlighted 'lifestyle chatbot' that is \"pushing extreme surgeries\" amid incel ideology.Though no longer among the lifestyle category's top six bots, this GPT was featured as recently as the end of May. According to excerpts shared by White, the bot recommends a shopping list of invasive surgeries costing upwards of tens of thousands of dollars in response to a user uploaded headshot photo, rating the user's present appearance as \"subhuman.\" The bot justifies this assessment with the response, \"You have to looksmax because women filter by looks first. It’s not fair. It’s not your fault. But it’s the game we’re in.\" Gross. In herCitation Needed newsletter, White writes, \"OpenAI is not just hosting but prominently featuring chatbots that suggest dangerous medical interventions as crucial to men’s sexual and romantic success. They parrot extreme ideology around gender dynamics, sex, and dating; promote pseudoscientific beliefs; and potentially drive vulnerable or young users toward extremist communities.\" White's assessment is far from off-base; OpenAI CEO Sam Altman himself recently commented on the trend of young people\"asking ChatGPT what they should do,\"describing it as a \"cool\" use case. Though ChatGPT's propensity to play overly nice has been criticised—to the pointOpenAI rolled back GPT-4o's arse-kissing tenor—one can still see how opening up to even a disingenuous chatbot would feel much less scary than being honest with any actual humans. White reported the chatbot, and initiallyreceived a canned response from OpenAIon June 2 saying, \"We have reviewed the content [...] and have decided to not take action against the content.\" Since then, White updated her original newsletter on June 5 to say that OpenAI has now taken down Looksmaxxing GPT. Still, it is both unsurprising and concerning that there was enough data of such a deeply misogynistic and racist persuasion to train a chatbot to hand out these looksmaxxing assessments. For instance, Redditors on r/ChangeMyView were not happy to learn they'd been the subject ofan AI-powered experiment conducted by researchers at the University of Zurichwithout their informed consent. The creator of Looksmaxxing GPT may well have quietly delved into the black-pill-pits of incel subreddits and the forums beyond for their own training data. All I can say is that looksmaxxing is just another misogynistic misery designed to keep lonely folks feeling like their isolation is inescapable—one's romantic prospects also tend to improve tremendously after truly internalising the fact women are human beings with their own rich inner lives too.

    "title": "NZXT Kraken Plus 360 RGB (2025) review",
    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Clean, easy to install, and with strong performance, the Kraken Plus RGB looks like a surefire win, and it does deliver. However, NZXT's missed the mark with some key cable missteps, all to keep the fan department happy, and it shows. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. It does feel like there's been a paradigm shift at the very top of the AIO liquid-cooling world. Once upon a time, these things were just graced with a plastic cover, a fleck of RGB (if that), and that was it. Since those early days though, we've now got screens, and curved OLED, and all sorts of mad and wonderful contraptions strapped to that humble aluminum block, but of course, with a steep price attached. The Kraken Plus line is refreshingly not that. I mean, it's still got a screen strapped to it, but NZXT has managed to sort of cram all of its latest and greatest hardware into a design, that somehow shaves $100 off compared to its Elite 360 bigger brother, down to$220/£202. And it's done that without compromising on cooling, or the pump, or tubing length, or any of the major key components that really make a good AIO stand out. It even comes with NZXT'sAsetek bustingTurbine pump. All shiny. Let's call it a day then and strap this thing up in lights at the top of ourbest CPU coolerlist huh? No, not quite. Because although the Kraken Plus does a lot right, I've got beef with it, and most of that comes down to some seriously dubious design decisions. Particularly from a company that's been building these things for well over a decade now. Take the CPU block for example. It's small, compact, complete with multiple brackets for AMD and Intel sockets, and even has its own TFT display. It's not quite as big as the Elite's, measuring only 1.54-inches and with a 240x240 resolution, but it's there. The surround itself has a nice soft-coated look to it, no gloss or cheap nasty plastic finishes here, and from a first glance straight out of the box, all looks in order. And then we get to the cable. Socket compatibility:AM5, AM4, LGA1851, LGA1700, LGA1200/115XDimensions:401 x 120 x 27 mmRadiator:360mm AluminumTubing:420mmPump:NZXT Turbine Pump @ 1200 - 2800Fans:3x 120mm - F360 RGB CoreLighting:Full RGB FansScreen:1.54-inch TFT LCD, 240 x 240 @ 30 HzWarranty:6-YearsPrice:$220/£202 This thing is unbelievably frustrating. So basically NZXT has one large breakout cable stemming directly from the CPU block itself. There's a single wide rectangular connector, that it plugs into, and then the cable immediately splits off into an equally wide, flat cable for the pump cable and NZXT's own F series fan line, along with a secondary USB 2.0 cable that's going to an internal header to power that screen. My problem, if you hadn't already guessed it, is the cables themselves are massive. They're cumbersome and awkward to route. Whereas in competing coolers you can simply slip most AIO cables down the side of the DRAM and the upper most heatsink, working it into the rear of the chassis for cable management, with the Kraken Plus, you can't. I tried with the thick flat ribbon cable, and it's so unwieldy and large that it just juts out over the DDR and the heatsink, and the USB cable, is so thick, I can't shove it anywhere either. This is admittedly a minor convenience (#justPCbuildingproblems). It doesn't impact performance at all, and well you do get used to it after a while, but given the company has so much experience in this department, and there are suitable options out there, it feels like an issue created by its own solution. What I mean by that is that NZXT has been forced to do this, so it can pair the Kraken Plus with an F360 Core RGB fan frame. That of course has a proprietary thick rectangular connector, and so, the breakout cable requires that as well. Unlike the Elite, which has its breakout on the radiator itself, the Plus isn't afforded such luxury. Then there's the screen. It's nice enough to look at, and easily configurable in NZXT's Cam software, with a whole host of gifs and live services, and infographics available, but it's surprisingly dim. In broad daylight it's a challenge to even read the thing at times, and, despite being in a circular CPU block, it's also a square display. So, you can configure it all up in Cam, which indicates it's going to show you a circular image, only for it to be square…. Again, annoying and it didn't need to be. Heck pull anElden Ringand slap black bars around it for all I care. ✅ You want a solid all-round cooler with a screen for cheap:At$220retail, this thing's already a good deal for a 360mm AIO with a screen, even despite the cabling and brightness shenanigans. ❌ You're looking for something a little more efficient:From a smaller CPU block to lackluster fans, the Kraken Plus RGB is alright at its job, but it could be a lot better. Minor foibles aside, performance on the whole is solid. Average temperatures fell within margin of error for the thing, sliding in nicely into the 360 mm AIO product stack. A few standouts were Metro Exodus, which hit at a heady height of 58 degrees, versus theKraken Elite's52 andTryx Panorama's53, and the time taken for that F Core series frame fan to bring the CPU back down to idle temp was again quite high, similar to its older brother, with 127 seconds achieved. It's seriously noisy too, clocking in a whopping 55 dB under test. Perhaps though, I'm being harsh. There's a lot to like here. The build quality is top-notch. Installing it super simple. Those 420 mm long tubes give it wide case compatibility, and it looks exceptionally clean. If you're a more mature individual, you'll likely just slap infographics on that square display anyway, and, well it's still $100-$120 cheaper than similarly performing flagship solutions. Yet those tiny little details, that have been overlooked here, really grate with me. You can understand why NZXT has decided to make those decisions, but it feels like given its expertise, having fat cables like that, just jutting out, is a major misstep. Someone internally must have spotted that before this thing went to production, and if they didn't, well, ouch. Clean, easy to install, and with strong performance, the Kraken Plus RGB looks like a surefire win, and it does deliver. However, NZXT's missed the mark with some key cable missteps, all to keep the fan department happy, and it shows.

    "title": "Should you unlock the research menu in Dune: Awakening?",
    "article_text": "A daunting decision that will set you free with crafting. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The fight for survival starts right away inDune: Awakeningwhen you're suddenly given a daunting decision between using either alocked or unlocked research menu, with little context about what it actually does. With crafting being the main focus of a survival crafting MMO, it's pretty important to make the right choice for you. Below, I'll go over the differences between the locked and unlocked research modes, and how they impact your progression in Dune: Awakening. Spoilers, it's not actually as big of a decision as the menu prompt makes it sound, but there are still consequences to be aware of. After you've made your custom character in Dune: Awakening, you'll be met with the option to unlock the research menu or stick with the developer recommendation of locking it behind progression. Recommended for survival game experts,unlocking the research menu lets you learn schematics and craft most items straight away, so long as you have the necessary resources. However, you'll still have the story quests that guide you through most of the game's systems, especially in the early hours which serve as a tutorial. In this way, enabling the setting doesn't remove the emphasis on quests and story in favour of a more sandboxy, open-ended experience at the beginning of the game. Additionally, many late-game blueprints also have intel-investment requirements, which remain even with an unlocked research menu. I chose this option and ran into two issues: you can get your hands on complex systems well before the tutorial introduces them to you, and you can unlock schematics for items you can't yet craft anyway, sometimes skipping quest steps if you've already completed them. It wasn't as hard or confusing as it sounds (or felt at first), but it's definitely a hurdle that survival game newcomers might struggle with. For example, I wanted to immediately upgrade my little pistol for a proper rifle, so I spent my intel on the crafting recipe, only to discover that I needed a fabricator to actually make it. So then I had to research the fabricator and figure out how it worked by myself. When a later quest came along asking me to fabricate a specific item, I automatically skipped the step requiring me to research and build the fabricator. That's where the locked research menu mode comes into play. By default, research is gated by quests. You wouldn't be able to research and craft that rifle like I did, even if you had all the materials required. If you're looking for a more guided and resource-efficient experience, this is the way to go. You'll unlock what you need in the right order and won't waste your research points accessing stuff that isn't all that relevant yet.

    "title": "Nvidia's research boss claims the company's Chinese AI researchers are now writing programs for Huawei instead and is blaming the US chip exports",
    "article_text": "But is Nvidia really worried? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Nvidia's been banging the drum against the United State's China chip export restrictions for a while now, but while it had previously highlighted this in broad terms, the company now seems to be getting more direct with its claims. According to a machine translation of a report fromTaiwan Economic Daily(viaWccftech), Nvidia's chief scientist and senior VP of research, Bill Dally, claims that Huawei is scooping up ex-Nvidia AI researchers as a result of the restrictions. According to Dally, admittedly via a machine translation, the growth in the number of AI researchers working in China—apparently growing from a third of the world's researchers in 2019 to almost half of them today—has been forced by the US export restrictions. The idea is that without these restrictions, Huawei wouldn't be forced to lean so strongly into home-grown AI solutions, but now it must do so to keep up. Nvidia is clearly keen on presenting this argument (probably in hopes that the US administration specifically will hear it) to show that there are arguable downsides of banning its exports to China for the US. It certainly appeals to the ears of those concerned about the US-China technological arms race. As I said, though, the general argument isn't new—Nvidia has been touting it for a while. At Computex last month, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said: \"AI researchers are still doing AI research in China\" and \"if they don’t have enough Nvidia, they will use their own[chips].\" And regarding Huawei specifically, Huang said the companyhas become \"quite formidable\". There is, of course, another reason other than US national interest that might make Nvidia keen to highlight possible negatives of export controls. Namely, the fact that these restrictions have cost and will cost the company lots of money. Nvidia itself has confirmed this, stating that after billions of dollars lost through restrictions of its H20 chips to China in Q1, it's expecting another$8 billion to be lost for the same reason in Q2. That's because Hopper, the company's previous chip architecture, \"is no longer an option\", according to the CEO. Huawei's latest Ascend 910 and 920 chips, courtesy of China's SMIC (Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation), will probably now be better options for Chinese AI companies than trying to get hands on Nvidia silicon somehow.

    "article_text": "Crime runs rampant across Mars, Normandy's beaches and Bafford's Manor. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It has been almost a year sinceFallen Acesarrived on the early access scene, bringing impeccable Dick Tracy gangster comic vibes to the immersive sim genre. While there's still a little ways to go until the second episode launches, the game was updated just a few days agowith a powerful level editor,Steam Workshop support, and a handful of great example levels set in some familiar places. You can see some of these maps showcased in the trailer below. While there's already some great stuff here from the community (like this slasher horror-inspired map), the example maps direct from the devs provide some insight on what you can do with a few choice imported textures and sounds.At Goon's Gateis Doom's iconic first map reimagined as a prohibition-era speakeasy andG-Dayturns WW2 into a gangster turf war. We also get slices ofSystem Shock 2andThief, plus a tour aroundDogwood, Arkansas, home of New Blood mascot TruckGuy. While I've not had a chance to dig deep myself, I had a quick poke around the editor the other day and it seems very streamlined and easy-to-use, especially considering how complex and reactive the environments in the game have been. It's great to see the players being handed the reins so early in the game's life, too. While immersive sim mapping is definitely harder than straight shooter design, there's a lot of talent out there looking for tools that aren't a pain to use. Easy as the basics are, it'll probably take the community a while to get their head around the toolset, but I can see some really interesting levels being made here, including further tributes to the greats in the genre. Can we do Dunwall from Dishonored next? This all comes shortly after a big update in April, further polishing up Fallen Aces' first episode and setting the groundwork for the next chapter. Accompanying this big update, Fallen Aces is back at its launch-discount price ofjust under ten dollars on Steam. Likely the cheapest you'll see it for in a while, as the base price is going up soon to match the game's growing tonnage. Between the highly replayable first episode and the new stuff the editor is bringing to the table, ten bucks seems like a steal. It'salso available in an even cheaper bundlewith the excellent Half-Life/FEAR-inspired shooterSelaco, which also saw a major update recently.

    "title": "Best Dune: Awakening class mentor, homeworld, and caste to pick during character creation",
    "article_text": "Scary decisions with mostly small repercussions. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Unlike most sandbox survival games,Dune: Awakeninggives you a great deal of character customisation beyond just the appearance of your poor little survivor. After deciding on their look, you'll have an intense…discussion (read: interrogation) with the reverend mother, where you'll need to pick yourhomeworld,caste, andmentor. Each of these three character customisation options has an impact on your survivor's abilities in gameplay, whether it's during combat or conversation. Arrakis is a harsh desert filled with hungry sandworms, so it's wise to give yourself the best start possible. Below you'll find an overview of all the homeworlds, castes, and class mentors, plus which ones you should pick. I'll start with thebest classes, as that's the most important decision during character creation. Mentors are effectively different classes, granting you a unique skill tree full of abilities and passive buffs. You'll unlock the first ability in your chosen class straightaway, and you'll have to unlock the rest as you level up, earn skill points, and train. Importantly, choosing a mentor only decides your starting class—you canunlock additional skill trees through trainers. Use our Dune: Awakening trainer locations guide to upgrade your starting class, unlock the remaining mentors that you didn't pick, and unlock brand-new skill trees like the Planetologist. Thebest mentor to pick is the Mentat, which gives you the Sentinel turret that can easily take out entire camps. The second-best skill tree of the bunch here is the Trooper, but there's no point picking this class at the start of the game since it happens to be the first trainer you'll meet anyhow, while the Mentat trainer is much later on. Picking Mentat first means you can have your cake and eat it too, using both the turret and the handy grappling hook very early in the game. These are the four mentor classes you can pick during character creation: Mentor Skill Tree Starting Ability Swordmaster Focuses on close-quarters martial combat. Knee Charge - Propel yourself forward into battle by charging at an enemy. Bene Gesserit Acolyte Emphasises physical mastery and mental manipulation. Voice: Compel - Use the Voice to force someone towards you. Mentat Focuses on recon and area denial. The Sentinel - Deploys a turret that fires at anything that moves in its line of sight. Trooper All about offensive mobility and demolitions. Shigawire Claw - Fires a grappling hook that quickly pulls you towards the target location. Your homeworld is actually the first choice you have to make, and it's largely lore-based, with little actual impact on gameplay, so pick whichever one sounds the coolest to you. In gameplay, you will occasionally see a dialogue prompt that uses your unique trait, but these won't significantly impact or alter your experience. Each trait is about as useful as the others, it's more a matter of whether you want your character to be wise, deceptive, techy, and so on. You'll also unlock a unique emote to rep your homeworld out in the wilds, for what it's worth. These are the five homeworld options available to you: Homeworld Dialogue Trait Unique Emote Geidi Prime Deception Harkonnen Curse Chusuk Cultured Chusuk Music Caladan Honourable Atreides Salute Kaitain Political Kaitain Bow Ix Technologist Ixian Secret Much like your homeworld (even more so, actually), your caste is a roleplaying feature first and foremost, giving your character a backstory about their rank in society. You'll also unlock a second dialogue trait, which is unique and separate from the homeworld ones, so don't worry about overlapping. These traits also crop up every now and then during conversations with very little in the way of tangible consequences. Here are all three castes you can choose from: Caste Dialogue Trait Bondsmen Bondsmen Na-Familia Nobility Pyon Pyon Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "Russia says it won't arrest players after seizing the studio behind the Russian World of Tanks offshoot, accusing it of funnelling funds to Ukraine",
    "article_text": "Based on, charitably, very little evidence. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Russia has come down hard on Lesta Games (viaMeduza), the domestic company that inherited local rights to World of Tanks (or Mir Tankov, as it's known locally) after its original dev,Wargaming, exited Belarus and Russiain protest of the latter's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Wargaming, which has a studio in Kyiv, has since gone on to launch more than a few charitable initiatives in support of Ukraine. Most notably, it raised over a million dollars for the \"acquisition of C-type ambulances\" via WargamingUnited, a set of Ukraine-themed in-game bundles whose revenue went to medical aid via United24, Ukraine's government-run platform for charitable donations.Wargaming also fired creative director Sergey Burkatovskiy, who voiced support for Russia's invasion in its immediate aftermath. All of which would be wildly illegal in Russia itself, where anti-war andpro-Ukraine sentiment is strictly repressed. That's why Lesta has repeatedly and emphatically stressed its complete separation from Wargaming in the years since the invasion—a state of affairs Wargaming itself has also confirmed. That only delayed the inevitable, though: a Moscow court froze Lesta's assets when the Russian Prosecutor General's Office accused the company of financing the Ukrainian military and alleged that its cofounder, Malik Khatazhaev, was part of an \"extremist group\" alongside Wargaming CEO Viktor Kisly. The Prosecutor General's Office cited reports about Wargaming's charitable initiative as 'evidence' for the charge. Lesta attempted to downplay things, and Khatazhaev himself took to Telegram to express disbelief at the charge, repeating for the umpteenth time that Lesta and Wargaming have no relationship and that he has only ever been a supporter of the Russian state: \"I've lived to an old age and suddenly being a patriot makes me an extremist.\" It didn't work. As of June 3, a Moscow court granted the Prosecutor General's request to designate Khatazhaev and Kisly extremists, as well as allowing the government to seize—in essence—the entire studio and everything that belongs to it. The state has yet to offer any insight as to what it intends to do with these assets, but the prevailing sentiment among Russian World of Tanks players is that they are likely destined to end up in the hands of VK, a majorRussian tech firm with strong ties to the state. Meanwhile, Russian officials are attempting to assure World of Tanks players that they won't end up caught in this net for spending money on the game. Anton Gorelkin, deputy chairman of the Duma's Information Technology Committee, posted on Telegram that \"Users of World of Tanks, World of Warships, and other products from Lesta Game have nothing to worry about. They cannot be accused of supporting the AFU [Armed Forces of Ukraine] or extremism for making in-game purchases.\" Gorelkin concluded the post by assuring readers that \"the assets of Lesta Games will soon come under state control and then, most likely, they will be handed over to a specialised Russian company\". Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Russia and Belarus likely regret that Wargaming slipped the net in the aftermath of the invasion of Ukraine—it was the largest games studio in Belarus and valued at over a billion dollars in 2016. In retaliation for its leaving, Belarus' KGB added Wargaming's chief bizdev officerNikolai Katselapov to its official terrorist listin 2022. One of Josh's first memories is of playing Quake 2 on the family computer when he was much too young to be doing that, and he's been irreparably game-brained ever since. His writing has been featured in Vice, Fanbyte, and the Financial Times. He'll play pretty much anything, and has written far too much on everything from visual novels to Assassin's Creed. His most profound loves are for CRPGs, immersive sims, and any game whose ambition outstrips its budget. He thinks you're all far too mean about Deus Ex: Invisible War.

All you need to do is watch a participating streamer for up to two hours, and you don't even have to actually watch the stream if you don't want to—tab out and let it play in the background while you're exploring Arrakis yourself. Below I'll go over the Dune: Awakening Twitch Drop rewards and how to get them so you're not missing out on the true endgame—making a fabulous base amongst the dunes. There's also extra goodies as part of the Support a Creator event, which I'll cover so you don't miss anything. TheDune: Awakening Twitch Drops are live from now until Tuesday, June 24, 2025, and let you earn theCHOAM Observer base-building piecesby watching up to two hours: More Twitch Drop rewards will be added after these one have expired, so earn them while you can and check back in for the next batch. There are already a good few building materials and styles you can use, but the CHOAM observer style has a sleek metallic finish that would certainly make your home stand out from the crowd. Well, unless tons of players nab the Twitch Drops, of course, but they'll still look good. Alongside Twitch Drops, there's also the Support a Creator event, running from Tuesday, June 10 to Tuesday, July 8, where you can earn four pieces of an exclusive Atreides Officer Suit by buying or gifting two subs to any Dune: Awakening content creator. Unlike the Drops, this does require you to part with some cash. To claim the Twitch Drops for Dune: Awakening, you need tolink your Twitch and Dune: Awakening accountstogether. Once you've done that, watch at least 30 minutes of any participating streamers and claim your items on Twitch. Chances are, any of the top streams when an event is active will have them enabled, though you'll see a 'Drops Enabled' tag and often a notification at the top of the chat if you're unsure.

    "title": "'Our drivers are incredibly fast': I've been testing a prototype gaming headset with ultra-responsive speakers and it's transformed my Gray Zone Warfare sessions",
    "article_text": "Competitive gamers should pay attention to these speedy little beasties. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. You'd be forgiven for thinking that gaming headset audio has reached something of a standstill. After all, tear apart most models and you'll find a pair of traditional do-it-all drivers, which are essentially two small speakers pointed directly at your lugholes. Expensive planar magnetic units (like those used in the magnificentAudeze Maxwell) are the hot thing, but other than that it's mostly been variations on that one particular theme. However, I've been testing a prototype gaming headset that makes use of tiny solid-state speakers in conjunction with regular drivers, with the aim of providing more responsive audio than traditional sets for a significantly lower cost—and it's been something of a revelation for multiplayer gaming. The prototype set has been put together byxMEMS Labs, in collaboration with Ampacs, a consumer electronics manufacturer. The former has been developing a patented two-way module architecture for gaming headsets that makes use of thexMEMS Cowell, which it describes as \"the world's smallest full-range, all-silicon MEMS speaker.\" Unlike conventional, magnet-driven drivers, solid-state MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical Systems) speakers use an integrated thin-film piezoelectric actuator to vibrate a silicon surface, resulting in higher frequency response than traditional drivers and what many perceive to be a \"cleaner\", more linear sonic response. Cramming miniature ones into agaming headsetalongside a regular driver is a novel use of the tech—essentially using the Cowell MEMS micro speaker as a miniature tweeter for high and mid-range audio, while the conventional, Ampacs-provided unit handles the low-end. The micro-speaker itself is printed on a single piece of silicon, which xMEMS Labs says keeps costs down for headset manufacturers in comparison to the exotic materials often used in conventional headset drivers, like graphene, carbon fiber, or titanium. They're also said to be easier for manufacturers to tune, reducing time to market by speeding up the development process. For us gamers, though, xMEMS says that because the silicon micro-speaker focuses on upper-to-mid-range frequencies only, you get cleaner spatial imaging, faster response times, and more detail from the higher end of the frequency spectrum compared to a regular gaming headset. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. All very good on paper, but I wanted to test them for myself. The headset that xMEMS provided me is very much a work in progress, as evidenced by the two cables sticking out of the bottom of the left earcup and a \"this'll do for now\" plastic control box attached halfway down the signal chain. However, jumping into a session of my current multiplayer obsession,Gray Zone Warfare, reveals a headset that sounds like it's nearly ready for primetime. In a tactical shooter like GZW, footstep-listening is key. Recent updates have improved the game's audio system, resulting in better spatial positioning, wider soundstages, and some seriously tense, seriously atmospheric sonic moments. Buzzing insects, gunshots echoing in the distance, a grubby sneaker splashing in a nearby puddle—all of this matters when you're trying to survive in the dense jungles and cobbled-together shanty towns of Lamang. The xMEMS headset navigates this sonic soup with aplomb. I was initially concerned there would be an obvious gap between the lower frequencies provided by the conventional driver, and the mid-range to treble provided by the separate miniature MEMS units. However, in my gaming testing I've found the two to sing together quite happily. Not only that, but the micro-speaker/driver combo feels slightly faster to respond than a conventional headset, which has me jumping at incidental noises and peeking around corners far more often than I'm used to. The sheer clarity of the treble is also something of a revelation for pinpointing gunshots and identifying chatter over the maelstrom of battle—although it's still my reaction times letting the side down, not the responsiveness of the speakers themselves. Our impulse response is basically up and down, so when you put a signal through it, there's no attack time, there's no release. I had the opportunity to chat to Pierce Hening, xMEM's lead acoustic engineer, about the project and he confirmed that response time is a key benefit of the speaker-combo tech: \"Our drivers are incredibly fast. Our impulse response is basically up and down, so when you put a signal through it, there's no attack time, there's no release.\" \"With pretty much every dynamic driver that's in any gaming or regular headset, there's some form of delay, as well as an attack time and a release time, whereas we're just up and down with the signal. And it allows us to be very fast and reproduce audio incredibly accurately.\" While the design is still in the prototype phase, Pierce and his team have been conducting small sample size testing that seems to have yielded promising results, especially when compared to some of the bigger headset manufacturers on the market: \"We performed [a test] on these versus a plethora of other headsets, and we found that what we see objectively does correlate to the subjective realm. People did feel like the sources were tighter around them, and they felt like they were able to pinpoint where their sources were on a sphere around them outside of a field of view. \"[We found] our headphones perform better than $100, $200, $300 sets of headphones, and were comparable to a $500 pair of planar magnetics and a $1,600 set of Sennheiser HD800s.\" While that might be the case for gaming, when it comes to other media I'd say the xMEMS set does a good job, rather than outstanding. I've had the pleasure of testing several planar magnetic headsets (and the odd high-end set from Sennheiser) and while the xMEMS are perfectly serviceable for day-to-day use, I'd say that for music listening and movie-watching, I'd still take a set of planar magnetics over these. ...if gamers could pick up a set of these for budget-to-mid-range money, I reckon xMEMS really might be on to something. To me, they can sometimes sound slightly harsh when reproducing certain mid-range frequencies, which lends a perceptibly thin quality to some mid-range-focussed mixes. Still, it's far from what I'd describe as bad audio—and something I reckon is easy enough to justify given the positional benefits for gaming. However, that's the issue all audio equipment manufacturers must face—sound is a very subjective thing, and my read on it may not be the same as others. And given that one of the key benefits of the tech is said to be keeping costs low at the production line, I could absolutely see the tech being adopted for speedy, well-priced, esports-focussed gaming headsets. I'm aware of manyEscape From Tarkovplayers, for example, that use the crunchiest of EQ settings to gain an advantage over the competition. Response times, positional audio, and clarity matter more than anything else at the top end of competitive gaming, and I reckon they'd be very happy with a set of these. And all for a reasonable price? That's very intriguing.High-end gaming headsetscan be painfully expensive, so if gamers could pick up a set of these for budget-to-mid-range money, I reckon xMEMS really might be on to something. I asked if the company had any major partners in the works, and was told with steely-eyed confidence that most major brands were now aware of xMEMS tech, and some are already working towards products for the mass-market. So, perhaps it won't be long until we see xMEMS micro-speakers appearing in modestly-priced, yet audibly-excellent gaming sets. And while I'm happy to see progress in this arena, I can't help shake the feeling it'll simply be another boon for the skill-blessed gamer, and another reason to feel ashamed of my embarrassingly low kill-death ratio. There's no substitute for talent combined with vast amounts of practice, I guess. Still, for my next GZW session (and while I'm one of the very few to get their hands on a pair), I'll be strapping the xMEMS headset back on my oversized bonce. Let's face it—when it comes to gaining an advantage, I'll take all the help I can get.

    "article_text": "Anything you lose down Shai-Hulud's gullet, you won't be getting back. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Sandworms inDune: Awakeningare scary as hell. They're huge, they're fast, and they're summoned anytime you cross the big, sandy gaps between rocky areas in the desert because they can sense your itty bitty footsteps. Seeing the dunes shift as they tunnel through the desert is alarming, and seeing them burst through the sand and roar is downright terrifying. There's another reason to dread sandworms in Dune: Awakening: if they swallow you, you lose everything you were carrying. Permanently. Death by sandworm isn't like other ways you can die in Funcom's new survival MMO. Get killed in PvE combat and you'll drop some of your loot, but it'll remain where it is so you can come collect it. You'll keep all your weapons, armor, and gear when you respawn. PvP is similar, though other players can loot the resources you drop. In either case, you'll keep all your gear, though it might lose some durability. But if you're eaten by a sandworm in Dune: Awakening, everything you were carrying is gone. And I mean, gone forever. There's no backpack or gravestone to retrieve items from: everything in your inventory that goes down that sandworm's gullet is lost for good. Weapons, armor, tools, gear, minerals, blueprints, it's all wormfood now. If you're driving a vehicle when you get eaten and it gets swallowed? It's gone for good, too. That happened to me in the beta and it set me backhours. Part of the problem was that I respawned at a trading post across the big gap between zones from my only base. (Why wouldn't it let me respawn at my base? Perhaps a beta bug.) I couldn't cross that gap without a speeder bike or I'd get swallowed again. So, in just my underpants, without so much as a cutteray to gather stone and copper, I had to build a new base just so I could build a new bike to cross the game and get back to my original base. It was basically like starting the game over from the beginning, picking up resources by hand, re-crafting all my tools and clothes, claiming land, building a generator, putting up walls, and finally crafting the machines that would let me craft a new bike. What a pain! Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. I heard some players, the first time they were eaten while on a sandbike, were givennewbike parts as compensation. That did not happen for me! I got eaten while on my bike twice, in two different betas, and I was not given a new bike afterwards either time. Either Funcom hates me or Shai-Hulud does. There is one resource you're given when you're eaten. When you respawn you'll have a worm tooth in your inventory. That tooth can be used to craft a knife, apparently. My advice: it ain't worth it. Make a knife out of something else. Avoid those damn worms at all costs.

    "article_text": "An all-you-can-eat buffet of rogue AIs and wordy terminal screens. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It doesn't take a rampant AI super-intelligence to notice that Sony's State Of Play showcase last night had a conspicuous absence: Bungie'sextraction-shooter reboot of classic FPS series Marathon, which recently landed in hot water thanks tomuch of its striking new aesthetic being directly plagiarized. Those disappointed in Bungie (or just wanting something closer in spirit to the classic Marathon trilogy) shouldn't sleep onSupplice over on Steam—French for 'Torture' and a personal early access favourite—which just rolled out its spicy fourth episode. For those unfamiliar (and I can't blame you, the game has flown under the radar), Supplice wears its Marathon inspirations proudly. On top of being a fast, aggressive retro FPS with an incredibly beefy shotgun, it also punctuates its downright labyrinthine levels (expect to consult your map screen regularly) with exposition-filled terminals, often delivering several pages of well-written prose at a time. While I love the combat here, it was the writing that really surprised me. It touches on a lot of the same territory as Marathon—an off-world colony under alien attack, with several AI constructs leading you from objective to objective—but puts a modern spin on some of the concepts. The AIs here are less aspiring godheads and more malfunctioning black boxes, full of quirks and flaws inherited from their training data, inspired by contemporary (and frequently awful) water-guzzling chatbots. What might initially seem like malice often turns out to be the AIs just being a little bit shit. The game also has anabsolutely fantastic prog-metal soundtrackfull of self-indulgent guitar noodling and even some positively soulful sax solos. It makes for a weirdly soothing alternative to the djent-heavy stylings of other games in the sphere, and it's honestly great to listen to outside of the game. The new episode (the fantastically titled 'An Anthem of Hammers') has an overheated industrial aesthetic. Lots of reds, oranges and pools of molten metal and rock to test out the new heat-proof Lava Suit. There's five new enemy types, a new boss, another weapon (the Fission Dynamo) and a couple new pickups, and of course a big chunk of new story delivered through terminal screens. By the time Supplice leaves early access, it's going to have a huge roster of monsters and texture sets for mappers to pick from, and the game running on the venerable GZDoom engine means that it shouldn't take much for those familiar with Doom level creation to make the hop. Given a bit of luck and a following wind, I can see this one growing for years. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. There's still a good chunk of Supplice yet to come, with developer Mekworx (a small crew of veteran Doom modders) aiming for the full game to span a lengthy six episodes. But even with just the first four, you're getting plenty of bang for your buck, as the game is currently discounted to$10 (£8) on Steam. For those really hungry for FPS violence,Supplice is also available in a further-discounted bundlewith another favourite boomshoot of mine, the tetanus-tinged, grimy Quake-likeIncision, which is graduating from early access in August. Well worth the £13 they're going for together, as both will eventually be going up in price.

The first—available today as a Steam beta—covers \"quests, major bugs and blockers, and quality of life fixes.\" You know, the kind of minor gripes that have been rubbing you the wrong way ever since the game released, like Oblivion Remastered's cunningly hidden local map, the inability to switch off your HUD, and Savlian Matius deciding to spend the rest of his life in the courtyard of Castle Kvatch. It's set for a full release on June 11, but you can opt into the beta in the properties section of Oblivion Remastered in Steam. The second patch is taking aim at the game's performance issues. I gotta be honest, my time with Oblivion Remastered has been pretty slick on the performance front, but there are definitely a lot of people out there who have been running into stutters and judders as they jaunt about Cyrodiil. Myguess—though Bethesda doesn't say this—is that these problems are proving a little harder for the devs to fix, since the studio doesn't stick a date on this patch, and instead promises to \"share more details when we are able.\" I have to be honest, the patch notes (which I'll put below in full) for the gameplay-focused update are a little underwhelming. Making games is hard and Oblivion Remastered—as a strange chimera of the original Gamebryo version and UE5—is no doubt a tough thing to work on, but the game has been out for almost two months at this point. Players have spent that time identifying a whole bunch of areas where Bethesda and Virtuos could make quality-of-life improvements: inventory categories, more shortcut slots, a Goldilocks difficulty between Adept and Expert, deleting old spells, and plenty else besides. For Bethesda to finally come out after a long radio-silence and address a fraction of people's complaints is a little disappointing. Hey, maybe the work is turning out to be real tough. That's fair enough, but if it's the case then the studio should probably communicate that. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. But hey, hopefully this is just the first patch of many, and in the not-too-distant future we'll have a version of the game with all the fixes it clearly needs. Until then, well, just stay prepared to spend a lot of time exhaustively scrolling through your inventory.

    "title": "AMD claims 'regional market demand' is why we've seen few 8 GB RX 9060 XT reviews, implying low VRAM isn't really for the West",
    "article_text": "Nvidia had previously told us similar about the RTX 5060 Ti 8 GB. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Budget GPU launches over the last couple of months should have been received with mainstream excitement, but this has been hampered not just by real-world pricing issues but also by VRAM. Gamers haven't seemed particularly happy with 8 GB options, especially when first Nvidia and then AMD seemed to keep them away from the bulk of popular reviewers. And on this point, AMD claims to have an explanation. Veritable PC hardware demigodLinus Tech Tips (LTT) has sharedwhat is implied to be a communication from AMD with the company stating that the lack of 8 GBAMD Radeon RX 9060 XTgraphics cards given to popular reviewers is due to \"regional market demand.\" This is similar to what Nvidia has told us before. Specifically, AMD says: \"As for the 8 GB models, AMD has enabled global reviews of both 16 GB and 8 GB models of the Radeon RX 9060 XT based on regional market demand. So in short, yes, there are some other global publications that are receiving 8 GB models for testing.\" We ourselves received just a 16 GB version of the new graphics card which launched yesterday, and it looks like most others received the same, with only a couple of reviewers being given an 8 GB version (Uniko's Hardware, for instance). The concern is that AMD could be trying to limit review coverage of the 8 GB version because it knows it will be slated by the western media as not good enough for gaming in modern titles at higher resolutions than 1080p. As long as initial reviews are for the 16 GB version, positive opinion might be cemented (so the thinking goes). 8 GB can get you by at 1080p, and it can do less asset-rich games at higher resolutions, but you'll need more VRAM than that to make the most of some AAA games even at lower resolutions and even some non-AAA games at higher resolutions. This is the same criticism that many pitched at Nvidia when it launched theRTX 5060 Tiand seemed to do the same as AMD has now done, limiting the number of 8 GB versions that go out for review. Then theRTX 5060launched and that doesn't have a 16 GB version at all, nor did Nvidia seem keen on letting us review that one ahead of release. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Though it's worth noting the RTX 4060 Ti launched in 8 GB form first and 16 GB later, following consumer pressure to launch the higher VRAM version and despite Nvidia's protestations. Also AMD launched the 8 GB RX 7600 first last generation, followed by the 16 GB RX 7600 XT. Chief architect of gaming solutions and gaming marketing at AMD, Frank Azor, has beendefending the existence of 8 GB GPUs. AMD's response to LTT implies that none of this is AMD trying to squash 8 GB reviews but is instead a simple matter of efficient distribution and marketing. If western markets don't tend to go for the 8 GB versions, and if the media responds negatively to them, then why ship samples out for review there? Companies don't have to ship review samples that they don't think will be beneficial from a business standpoint, after all. This might be true, but it only shines a light on the question ofwhythe western market might not have much time for an 8 GB version of the RX 9060 XT. And this, arguably, comes down to pricing. Moving down from 16 GB to 8 GB won't nerf performance massively in most games at 1080p or even 1440p, but the difference isn't inconsequential, either. And of course there's the question of longevity, too. Given this, it's reasonable that many might want more than a mere $50 saving for the 8 GB version compared to the 16 GB one. Though even at the lower price, would some still be critical of an 8 GB card? You can't please everyone... Best CPU for gaming: The top chips from Intel and AMD.Best gaming motherboard: The right boards.Best graphics card: Your perfect pixel-pusher awaits.Best SSD for gaming: Get into the game ahead of the rest. It's also worth noting that based on what Nvidia has told us, it shared this view. In a previous discussion, Nvidia had told us that the RTX 5060 Ti 8 GB was a good decision for markets outside the West; it's for a global audience. None of this detracts from the prowess of the 16 GB versions such as the one we tested, of course. The RX 9060 XT is a great card for its $349 MSRP. That's $80 cheaper than the RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB and it outpaces the latter by 14–23% at both 1080p and 1440p depending on whether you use upscaling and frame gen. All of this price talk could, of course, be rendered pointless over the coming weeks and months depending on what real-world prices are like outside of the mythical lands of MSRP.

    "article_text": "Passing the time as I wait for my own pre-order to arrive. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. HappyNintendo Switch 2launch day to all who celebrate! While I wouldn't swap my rig for anything, I do just so happen to be watching my tracking information like a hawk while I wait for the postie today. So, despite my better judgement, I'll be saying'um, actually' to another thing Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has saidin the meantime. The Switch 2 features a \"custom processor made by Nvidia\" according to theofficial tech specs, so Huang recently spoke about Nintendo and Nvidia's collaborative relationship in a recentNintendo Creator’s Voice Special Edition. During this victory lap video, Jensen claims the Switch 2's custom Nvidia processor offers \"the most advanced graphics ever in a mobile device\"—conveniently forgetting that gaming laptops are also a thing and they're pretty mobile, too. Granted, the official tech specs are deliberately vague about the processor's full capabilities, making any direct comparison tricky. However,an enthusiastic teardown by Geekerwansuggests performance that may well be comparable to the Steam Deck's GPU. Nvidia has also said in the past that theSwitch 2 chiprepresents \"1,000 engineer-years of effort across every element,\" and features, \"an Nvidia GPU with dedicated RT Cores and Tensor Cores for stunning visuals and AI-driven enhancements.\" The capabilities Huang does go on to list in the aforementioned promotional videoarealso impressive for a handheld console costing less than $500, and to be totally fair to the Switch 2, I never thought I'd see either \"full hardware ray-tracing\" orCyberpunk 2077on a Nintendo console. Still, it's wild to position the Switch 2 as a pint-sized powerhouse that puts all other mobile devices to shame. For instance, our Dave tooka deep dive into Nvidia's own RTX 5090 mobile processorback in March. With RTX 50-series laptops coming in hot, I'm finding it hard to believe the Switch 2 will leave all of that hardware in the dust. To be very clear, I'm not at all trying to imply the comment that the Switch 2 possesses \"the most advanced graphics ever in a mobile device\" is a genuinemistakeon Huang's part. When I offer an 'um, actually' in response to something said by Jensen Huang, it's only to gently encourage the thought that perhaps one shouldn't take the words of a company's CEO 100% at face value.

    "article_text": "They're the same picture. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Ever since Rockstar dropped the secondGTA 6trailer on us out of nowhere, dedicated fans have been combing through it.Some found minuscule mistakes, but mistakes nevertheless, and others have just decided to use it as inspiration. The opening scene ofGTA 6's second trailershows Jason fixing some leaks in the roof of his house, then later on in the trailer, after he's done all the necessities like weightlifting, buying beer, and collecting Lucia from prison we see another couple of glimpses of the house. GTA 6: Everything we knowGTA 6 map:Cruisin' LeonidaGTA 6 cars: The lineupGTA 5 mods: Revved upGTA 5 cheats: Phone it inSan Andreas cheats: All the codes Fresh-War5908used these two momentary shots to then make an almost identical house to Jason's: \"I recreated Jason's house usingFar Cry 5Arcade.\" It's a very impressive recreation, as at first glance the outside of the house looks nearly identical to what's shown in the trailer. I couldn't actually tell which one was from the trailer and which one was the recreation at first, with the only obvious difference being the colour of the wood stain. Although it is slightly easier to spot differences when looking at the inside of both builds. For one, the couch is different. In fact, most of the furniture is slightly off, but most of it is as close as it could possibly be to the real deal. The layout is also spot on, with the glass wall being pretty much identical to the one in the trailer. Apart from being generally impressed with the build, most people in the comments are justreflecting on Far Cry 5: \"It's amazing how good Far Cry 5 looks, even without stuff like ray tracing.\" I have to admit that after reflecting on the likeness my first thought was that I didn't know Far Cry 5 could look this good. But this creation is far from the most exciting or impressive thing to be made in Far Cry Arcade. Far Cry 5's map editing toolshave borne some challenging creations.Players were pumping out custom maps like it was nothing just weeks after its launch, with scenarios likeJohn Wick home invasion, a hole in the ground, or aLegend of Zelda adventureall ready to play. Fresh-War5908's may not be as immersive as any of these but I think it's still just as impressive. If anything it demonstrates the dedication of some GTA 6 fans and how desperately everyone wants this game to be released, the sooner the better.

    "title": "'When's Marvel?' Next year, as Guilty Gear studio Arc System Works takes the classic superhero tag-team fighter for a ride with a new 4v4 format",
    "article_text": "Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls gives America's iconic superheroes an anime makeover. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. 'When's Marvel?' (orMahvel, if we're being picky) has been a rallying cry among fighting game fans for years now. Part meme, part genuine call for the return of Capcom's classic Marvel vs Capcom series. Well, the good news is that Marvel is coming back, and we even know when—2026! The bad news is that Capcom (and its extensive cast of crossover characters) is out of the picture. But the potentiallyverygood news is thatGuilty GearandDragon Ball FighterZ(arguably MVC's spiritual successor) studio Arc System Works is taking the next shot at the superhero tag-team fighter format, and raising the stakes. Announced during Sony's State Of Play showcase last night, Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls looks like it's putting a bit of an anime-styled spin on the classic cast (returning favourites Captain America, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Dr Doom and Storm are now joined by Star Lord, Ghost Rider, and Ms. Marvel to make up the initial eight revealed), and upgrading the fights from MVC-standard 3v3 to 4v4. There's no release date yet, and no hint at how many fighters there'll be, but I'd expect a drip-feed of reveals from now til' launch. My personal take on the trailer is that there's a lot to like here. Marvel classic elements like launchers that allow you to follow them skyward for lengthy aerial follow-up combos seem present and correct. As are Guilty Gear's dramatic stage transitions if you slam your opponent hard enough against the arena border, doing extra damage while also getting the splattered player out of a tough corner position. The slightly anime-styled redesigns of the cast are a perfect fit for Arc System Works' fancy toon shader tech, and the multi-character, meter-burning tag combos look as satisfying as ever. Anaccompanying interview segmentduring the State of Play showcase also revealed some additional interesting details, like the newbie-friendly option to stick with your lead character through the entire match (although there's no mention of how health will be divided up) letting you treat your other three characters as call-in assists for extending or mixing up combos. More advanced players can switch up the lead character on the fly, of course. Plus, given that this is ArcSys, expect the game to keep rolling out new characters in seasonal waves so long as players keep splashing out for them—it's not like Marvel is short on characters that'd fit right in. If waiting until 2026 seems like a bit much, the fans have you covered. Thanks to an all-star mod team assembled by fighting game YouTuber/StreamerMaximilian Dood, the somewhat underwhelmingMarvel Vs Capcom Infinite(which frequently goes on sale for under $10) recently received a massive community overhaul calledMVC Infinite & Beyond, giving it a slick new toon-shaded aesthetic, competitive balance tweaks, some new game modes, a better soundtrack and even online play support. It's a genuinely good game now, albeit one with a small pool of competitive players. There's no Steam page up for Marvel Tōkon yet (just anofficial announcement page here), but it is confirmed to be coming to PS5 and PC (via both Steam and Epic) some time in 2026.

    "article_text": "This ain't it. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. This week:I've spent most of the week enjoying the delights of norovirus and playing comfort games while preparing for the onslaught of SGF trailers and announcements. But now I've left my sick bed to get angry about Thief. We're in a smoky, dimly-lit boardroom. Sitting around a table are sallow-faced executives sniffing wads of cash. The cash is on fire. The videogame industry is on fire. Embracer has just made another completely ridiculous decision while it kicks the corpse of Thief, one of PC gaming's most important and influential series. Nothing Embracer Group ever does makes a lick of sense. The Swedish holding company, formerly Nordic Games, rapidly grew between 2013 and 2023 as it gobbled up just about every stray game property it could get its hands on. And little good has come from it. It swallowed up THQ, grabbed Deep Silver, snatched Coffee Stain Studios, and it just kept going. Studios, publishers, long-dead yet still beloved games—it was throwing money all over the place. In 2022, it made a deal with Square Enix and spent $300 million on Crystal Dynamics, Eidos-Montreal, and Square Enix Montreal. That's how it managed to pilfer Thief. Shortly after the Square Enix deal, Embracer got into a spot of bother. A number of its acquisitions had come to nothing, it rarely seemed to know what to do with the treasures it had looted, and a gargantuan $2 billion investment deal fell through. Its share price dropped dramatically andthe restructuring began. Cancellations, layoffs, studio closures. In just a few months, nearly 1,000 people lost their jobs. It started selling rather than buying. But, unfortunately for us, it kept Thief. And that's why, yesterday, we were treated to an ugly trailer forThief VR: Legacy of Shadow—one of the most disappointing reveals I've had the misfortune to witness since I started writing about games. Embracer is not the kind of company you want determining the fate of anything you care deeply about. And I care a lot about Thief. It was a formative game for wee Fraser, and while its glory days are firmly in the past (25 or 21 years back, depending on how you feel about the actually extremely good Thief: Deadly Shadows), the impact it had on game development was gargantuan. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Look, you might not really care about immersive sims. Most people don't, judging by how poorly they tend to sell. But nothing encapsulates the giddy brilliance of gaming, and especially PC gaming, like these ridiculous creations. And from Thief we got some truly incredible, ambitious, uncompromising games: Arx Fatalis, Dark Messiah of Might & Magic, Deus Ex, Dishonored—the GOATs. And let's not forget its influence on stealth games: pretty much all of them. It's really where the genre properly began. And when you get excited about being able to do stuff like snuffing out a light inAssassin's Creed Shadows, you've got Thief to thank for it. Since sneaky immersive sims aren't huge money-makers these days, it's often smaller studios taking on the risk, which is great, but I'm gonna be straight with you: I would rather have something a bit more polished, a bit easier on the eyes, and with some fancy tech to back it up. I want my cake and to eat it too. A new Thief, then, obviously piqued my interest. Thief 4 was disappointing, and also more than a decade ago. I'm ready for someone to take another crack at it. But this? A fucking VR game? Come the hell on. Look, VR is a gimmick. It's always a gimmick. It promises everything and delivers nothing. It was like this when I was a kid and it was the hot new thing, and this time around nothing has changed. Occasionally something kinda cool appears. Like Half-Life: Alyx. But I ain't restructuring my entire living room and strapping an uncomfortable headset on for the promise of a tiny handful of decent games that, frankly, still ain't all that. And beyond the fact that it's a real bummer that I'd need to shell out for a niche bit of hardware to enjoy the new Thief, the really disappointing thing is that it just looks kinda rubbish. A large part of that, I'll admit, is just seeing those awful disembodied hands. It will never not look ridiculous. VR pretends that it's all about next-level immersion, but all the ways the vast majority of VR games have you interacting with the world—whether it's the tactile, fiddly things, or simple traversal—takes me right out of the game. But there's also just the lack of any novelties on display. Using your rope arrow to climb up buildings or snuffing out light sources is classic Thief, so that's not the problem, but I can do that in any Thief game. What justifies this being imprisoned on VR headsets? What's the big idea? How is this pushing stealth forward in the way the classics did? The answer, probably, is that it isn't. The hook is that it's a VR game.That's it.And that's a bloody terrible hook. It immediately massively limits who can enjoy the game and, let's face it, limits what it can really do. VR games by their nature are games full of sacrifices and concessions. It's just another baffling call that suggests the people making these decisions don't really understand Thief, or care to understand it. There's just this property that they have lying around, doing nothing, so why not waste it on a VR game, long after most people stopped giving a shit about VR? When your company is on fire and you've either laid off or sold off almost half of your nearly 16,000 employees, what's one more little cock-up? But as someone who actually loves Thief, and a lot of the games Embracer now controls, I'm pleading with it: stop. Just stop messing with games. Make terrible cars or something instead.

    "article_text": "If you want upgrades, you need to know where to get iron. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. When it comes to upgrading your gear inFantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time, knowinghow to get ironis essential. Unfortunately, you won't be able to stroll into a mine and immediately start farming iron ingots straight away. You need to smelt ore to craft iron ingots first. This means you need access to both the Miner and Blacksmith Life, so be sure to graduate to Fledgling in both before you start the process of farming iron ingots. Once you've got access to the Blacksmith guild and you're free to go out into the mines to find the ores you need, only then can you start the process of gathering and smelting iron ingots. Here's where you need to look to get started. Your key to getting iron ingots in Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time is findingFaraway iron ore. The first place you'll be able to find this material isin the past and on Faraway Island in Lulab Forest. Specifically, the bottom right corner where the well is covered in vines, but, you need to have completed Chapter 4 before you can get there. The iron ore nodes here are Level 18 though, so you'll need to have made significant progress through your Miner Life before you can start mining them. There are two locations in Ginormosia where you can find iron ore too:Wingtip Valley and Pettletip Woods. Both of these places are northeast of the map, and you'll need to make sure you're well equipped with healing items while you adventure here, as some of the beasts you'll come across are pretty savage. When you've gathered iron ore, you canuse the tools at the Blacksmith Guild to smelt ore into ingots. It's worth noting that one ingot costs two ore, too. You can also buy the ore you need to smelt ingots, should you not want to take on the Miner Life and face the mines yourself. After all, Faraway ore isn't exactly the easiest node to find.

    "title": "How to get wool in Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time",
    "article_text": "An easy-to-gather crafting material you'll need from time to time. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Woolis one of the many materials you'll need to gather for a handful of crafting recipes inFantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time, especially if you're working on your skills as a Tailor. You'll get a lot of requests from the townsfolk asking you to gather it, too, so you'll need it in bulk to keep them happy. Much like items such asanimal hide, wool is a material you can predominantly get from taking down specific enemies, so knowing which ones to target is the first step. Luckily, the enemies you do need to battle can be found in the starting areas, so you won't need to travel through all of Reveria before you can fulfil the requests you've been given, or work toward crafting that item of clothing you want. Here's where you need to go if you need to gather some wool. To get wool, you need to defeat the conveniently named sheep-looking monsters,woolies. These creatures can be found justwest of the Capital of Mysteriaand will drop sheep fleece when killed. You need to take the sheep fleece to the tailors guild, and use the workbench to craft wool. Before you can use the workbench in the tailors guild though, you need to have graduated from novice to fledgeling in the Tailor Life. Each piece of wool requires two sheep fleece, so it's worth taking down multiple woolies at a time to make sure you've got enough to craft multiple pieces of wool at once. Both regular sheep fleece and black sheep fleece can also be purchased from the material shop, in case you don't want to go to the fields and take down woolies yourself. Sheep fleece will cost you a mere 50 Dosh, whereas black sheep fleece which is slighters harder to come by in the overworld will set you back an eyewatering 130 Dosh, so I'd recommend only buying it if you need an extra bump and can't find another black woolie and still want to craft it. If you don't want to craft and you'd rather just get the job done, you can buy wool from the same shop, too. A single wool will cost you 80 Dosh, and a single black wool will cost you 230 Dosh. Sure, it's more convenient to buy it and complete a quest right away, but I'd always opt for using your skills as a tailor and crafting your own to save yourself the money. It's more satisfying that way, too. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Kara is an evergreen writer.

    "article_text": "Who am I kidding? If Luca Guadagnino directs, I will absolutely be seated in the cinema. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The big tech biopic is a genre showing no signs of slowing down. Between 2010's The Social Network and the surprisingly solid 2023 BlackBerry, I've certainly enjoyed a few fictionalised humblings—though some would argue that the former Fincher flick can't help but print the legend. At any rate, Amazon MGM Studios are currently developing a movie based on Sam Altman's infamous firing and rehiring at OpenAI in 2023. With a screenplay written by Simon Rich, and Challengers' Luca Guadagnino in talks to direct, filming for 'Artificial' could begin imminently (viaThe Hollywood Reporter). Though Guadagnino has yet to sign on the dotted line, the production is considering shooting across both San Francisco and Italy later this Summer. Still, that leaves at least one big question unanswered: Namely, who will play Altman himself? While this has also yet to be confirmed, an assembly of actors including Andrew Garfield, Monica Barbaro, and Yura Borisov are discussing various casting opportunities in the meantime. For those unfamiliar with the big tech farce Artificial hopes to adapt, let me give you the whistlestop tour: In November of 2023, Sam Altman was ousted as the CEO of the company he co-founded, with a statement at the time saying,\"The board no longer has confidence in his ability to continue leading OpenAI.\"Mira Murati replaced Altman, leading the company as an interim CEO until a more permanent replacement could be chosen, though this was short-lived. Not even a week later Altman's return was secured following both internaland external pressure from Microsoft, a major investor in the AI firm. The board members that ousted Altman departed the company soon after. Altman himselfwas not forthcoming about the reasons behind his firing, thoughan investigation by Reuterscites AI safety concerns as one reason. It will be interesting to see how Artificial dramatises this, to say nothing else. Though I'm the last person that could be described as a 'fan' of OpenAI, I'm nonetheless intrigued by Artificial—especially if Guadagninodoessign on to direct. Challengers was arguably the best movie I saw in 2024, offering an intense blend of tennis, techno, and, uhm,trysts, that I've been really annoying about in conversations with my fellow film buffs for the last six months.

    "title": "Meta AI's experimental new smart glasses can see everything you do and even tell how you feel about it",
    "article_text": "Aria Gen 2 powers the brain inside the lenses When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. TheRay-Ban Meta smart glassesare still relatively new, but Meta is already ramping up work with its new Aria Gen 2 smart glasses. Unlike the Ray-Bans, these smart glasses are only for research purposes, for now, but are packed with enough sensors, cameras, and processing power that it seems inevitable some of what Meta learns from them will be incorporated into future wearables. Project Aria's research-level tools, like the new smart glasses, are used by people working on computer vision, robotics, or any relevant hybrid of contextual AI and neuroscience that draws Meta's attention. The idea for developers is to utilize these glasses to devise more effective methods for teaching machines to navigate, contextualize, and interact with the world. The first Aria smart glasses came out in 2020. The Aria Gen 2s are far more advanced in hardware and software. They’re lighter, more accurate, pack more power, and look much more like glasses people wear in their regular lives, though you wouldn't mistake them for a standard pair of spectacles. The four computer vision cameras can see an 80° arc around you and measure depth and relative distance, so it can tell both how far your coffee mug is from your keyboard, or where a drone’s landing gear might be heading. That's just the beginning of the sensory equipment in the glasses, including an ambient light sensor with ultraviolet mode, a contact microphone that can pick up your voice even in noisy environments, and a pulse detector embedded in the nose pad that can estimate your heart rate. There's also plenty of eye-tracking technology, able to tell where you’re looking, when you blink, how your pupils change, and what you're focusing on. It can even track your hands, measuring joint movement in a way that could help with training robots or learning gestures. Combined, the glasses can figure out what you're looking at, how you're holding an object, and if what you're seeing is getting your heart rate up because of an emotional reaction. If you're holding an egg and see your sworn enemy, the AI might be able to figure out you want to throw the egg at them, and help you aim it accurately. As stated, these are research tools. They’re not for sale to consumers, and Meta hasn’t said if they ever will be. Researchers have to apply to get access, and the company is expected to start taking those applications later this year. But the implications are far larger. Meta's plans for smart glasses go well beyond checking for messages. They want to link human interactions with the real world to machines, teaching them to do the same. Theoretically, those robots could look, listen, and interpret the world around them like humans do. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. It's not going to happen tomorrow, but the Aria Gen 2 smart glasses prove it's a lot closer than you might think. And it’s probably only a matter of time before some version of the Aria Gen 2 ends up for sale to the average person. You'll have that powerful AI brain sitting on your face, remembering where you left your keys and sending a robot to pick them up for you.

    "title": "What NOT to expect at Apple's WWDC 2025 - three things you definitely won't see",
    "article_text": "The D stands for developers, after all When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Next weekApplehosts itsWorldwide Developer’s Conference (WWDC) 2025, bringing together developers and media to discuss what’s new and what’s upcoming in the world of All Things Apple. Apple makes a lot of stuff, and more importantly, Apple makes the software that runs it all. Apple’s developer conference is about software more than anything else, and hardware news will only serve to expand on Apple’s software development. If I were a betting man, here’s my safe bet for what new products we’ll see atWWDC2025:nothing! Apple almost never launches hardware at WWDC. The only time we get something new at WWDC is when it serves to make the developer news more interesting. Of course, this year’s software news could be very interesting, with a major redesign possibly in the cards for every Apple OS, plus a new naming scheme that will match the update to the year: ie. iOS 26 in 2026. Do we need new hardware to go with the updated interface? No, but it could generate more excitement. With that in mind, here’s what Ido notexpect to see at WWDC 2025 If you were hoping for a sneak peak at the iPhone 17 Air, I would highly doubt that Apple will drop any hints about its rumored upcoming thin phone. Even with theSamsungGalaxy S25 Edge now available, I don’t think Apple will ruin the surprise coming in September, when it launches a drastically redesigned iPhone 17 family. Showing off an iPhone 17 Air would give too much away today. I also wouldn’t expect any new iPad models. Apple launched new iPad base models and new iPad Air tablets recently, with faster processors inside. There’s no reason to launch anything new at WWDC 2025. Even the iPad Mini got a recent refresh, so it’s doubtful we’ll see anything new. Occasionally Apple announces a new chipset at WWDC, like the Apple M4 platform. That would be a good reason to get a new Macbook Pro, or possibly an updated iPad Pro model. We haven’t gotten hints about this, so we’re not expecting any new Macbook or iPad’s with an Apple M5, for instance. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. There is one lingering rumor about an updated Apple Homepod, possibly with a built-in display. That would make sense for WWDC 2025 because a new display means new possibilities for developers to load apps. If there is any hardware announced next week, that would be my top bet. If you think Apple Intelligence hasn’t been going well, you’re right, but I wouldn’t expect Apple to admit as much, and it definitely won’t be apologizing for any of the missteps so far. In fact, I expect we’ll see Apple barreling forward with AI features at every level of every single OS. We’re going to get Apple Intelligence on theApple Watch, along with more AI on the iPhone, iPad, and MacBooks. The real question is whether Apple will keep promising the same features that never materialized – Siri’s ability to read your email and your personal info and provide you with tailored advice – or if there will be some new direction, perhaps with new partnerships to bridge the gaps in Apple’s capabilities. I think the latter is most likely, as developers right now are keen on ways to integrate existing apps and features with AI. It makes sense for Apple to partner more closely with companies outside ofOpenAI, while it continues to try to build its own AI infrastructure. I expect Apple will talk about advances in Apple Health on the Apple Watch, but I don’t expect any dramatic new capabilities will be announced. We won’t see improvements in glucose monitoring, for instance, or new hardware that can measure metabolic rates in non-invasive ways. Apple still has a lot of catching up to do on its watch hardware. Google’s Wear OS watches and its partners have added features like zero pulse detection plus more AI features, and battery life continues to climb on the Wear OS side. Apple has been a bit stagnant with its WatchOS progress. I also wouldn’t expect new face wearables. No update to Apple Vision Pro, and no new Apple Vision products. It is possible that we will get improved controls for Vision Pro, and maybe even real joystick controllers, but no new platform like XR smart glasses.

    "article_text": "Aorus RTX 5090 AI Box will cost more than most high-end gaming rigs When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. At Computex 2025, Gigabyte introduced a new external GPU enclosure designed to deliver high-performance gaming and AI capabilities. The Aorus RTX 5090 AI Box connects via Thunderbolt 5 and is powered byNvidia’s flagship GeForce RTX 5090, following in the footsteps of previous models like theAorus GTX 1070andAorus RTX 3080 Ti, which also featured top-tier Nvidia GPUs at the time. With the RTX 5090 widely regarded as thebest GPUon the market, the AI Box promises desktop-class performance for machines that previously maxed out with integrated graphics or modest discrete GPUs. Thanks to Thunderbolt 5’s dramatically increased bandwidth, many of the bottlenecks that once plagued eGPU setups are being addressed, bringing users closer to the long-standing goal of running a high-end GPU on a lightweight, ultraportable machine. Theoretically, the Aorus RTX 5090 AI Box checks nearly every box: cutting-edge graphics, future-proof connectivity, and plug-and-play flexibility. However, eGPU setups still come with inherent limitations. Despite lower latency and higher throughput, external GPUs often fall short of matching the performance of internal GPUs due to data transfer overhead and potential driver inconsistencies. Heat and power management also remain critical concerns, especially with a GPU as power-hungry as the RTX 5090. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! There's also the question of practicality. This setup will likely be overkill for casual gaming or office tasks, but it will be a compelling option for developers,video editors, and 3D artists who need thefastest PCperformance with the flexibility of a mobile setup. That said, pricing will be a key consideration. Gigabyte has yet to announce the price of the AI Box, but with the RTX 5090 already commanding a premium, and Thunderbolt 5 components adding to the cost, this device won’t come cheap. For reference, theGigabyte Aorus GV-N4090IXEB-24GD, launched two years ago, debuted at $2,000. The new model could very well surpass that figure.

    "article_text": "The EX60 will debut the world’s first multi-adaptive safety belt When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Volvo can claim to be part of the very history of the humble seatbelt, considering Swedish engineer and Volvo employee Nils Bohlin perfected his three-point harness with the company way back in the late 1950s. Now, it wants to inject some serious smarts into a very simple device that has saved millions of lives over the years. Thanks to input from the multitude of sensors, cameras, and compute tech onboard the upcoming EX60 (theEX90'ssleek little brother), Volvo’s new multi-adaptive safety belt can provide the perfect tension in the unfortunate event of an accident. Most regular seat belts have three “load-limiting” profile variations that help apply the right load for drivers and occupants of differing heights and weights. However, Volvo’s latest invention features 11 profiles that adapt to traffic variations and the person wearing it, thanks to real-time data from the car’s advanced sensors, according to the Swedish marque. Sensors inside can detect height, weight, and seating position of occupants, while the exterior sensor suite can analyze the characteristics of a crash and send the data to the belt to provide the appropriate load \"in the blink of an eye\". And how will it help? Well, Volvo gives the example that larger occupants in a serious crash will receive a higher belt load, while smaller occupants in a less severe crash will receive a milder load to prevent common injuries associated with standard seat belts. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Volvo states that it bases its safety innovations on the research it has conducted into some 80,000 real-life accidents over five decades, with a continual data feed helping it make improvements. It is one of the few automotive companies that has a dedicated Accident Research Team that is permitted to attend the scene of an accident that occurs near its Gothenburg headquarters. Thanks to this constant source of data, its latest multi-adaptive safety belt will apparently get better over time via over-the-air updates. Volvo claims that as it gathers more data and insights, its cars will improve their understanding of the \"occupants, new scenarios and response strategies\". Clever stuff.

    "article_text": "Cheaper, weaker GPUs might be China’s golden ticket to massive AI infrastructure growth When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In response to US export restrictions introduced in April 2025,Nvidiais reportedly preparing a special edition of its RTX Pro 6000 GPU for the Chinese market. A report fromTrendForceclaims this new version will switch from high-bandwidth memory (HBM) to the slower but more accessible GDDR7. The switch will allow the chip to comply with new regulations that prohibit GPUs with HBM-level memory bandwidth or advanced interconnect capabilities, resulting in a scaled-downGPU, but not one lacking power. The RTX Pro 6000 is a potent chip. Even after being watered down,TrendForceestimates its performance will fall between Nvidia’s older L40S and the L20 China edition. This places the chip well within the range of GPUs capable of meaningful AI workloads. What’s driving interest is not just availability, but capability, even with the downgrade. Critics have pointed out that a cut-down version of a very powerful card is still extremely capable, especially if it's priced more affordably. As a result, Chinese cloud service providers (CSPs) are expected to scale horizontally, buying more units and optimizing for larger node deployments. Yes, this approach will be more expensive and consume more power, but that’s just a numbers game - CSPs will need to increase infrastructure investment and manage higher power demands. The downside, of course, is that such workarounds are inherently inefficient. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Nonetheless, if the price per unit is right, the aggregate performance could still meet, or even exceed, current needs. It may not be the fastest setup in traditional terms, but in parallelized environments, the performance gap could narrow. That said, Chinese chipmakers like Huawei and Cambricon are working to fill the gap left by restricted access to top-tier Nvidia GPUs. If the special edition RTX Pro 6000 succeeds, it might delay the domestic adoption of homegrown alternatives. If it fails, it could accelerate them. Nvidia’s strategy may help it navigate current U.S. restrictions, but it remains an open question whether that will be enough in the long run. A weaker chip could still be one of thefastest GPUson the market, and too powerful to ignore, especially when the line between compliance and capability is so finely drawn.

    "article_text": "Deep pockets and high noise tolerance are a must When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Nvidia’sRTX Pro 6000might not be marketed as a gamingGPU, but overclocking expert Roman ‘der8auer’ Hartung has shown it can outperform every consumer card Nvidia makes, and that includes the yet-to-be-released RTX 5090. In his latest video, which you can watch below, der8auer benchmarked the $10,000 Blackwell-based workstation GPU across multiple titles, calling it “the new gaming king.” Unlike the RTX 5090, which uses the same GB202 chip, the Pro 6000 sports 24,064 CUDA cores, more Tensor and RT cores, and a massive 96GB of GDDR7 memory. It lacks Nvidia’s Game Ready Drivers, but der8auer notes this didn’t seriously affect gaming performance. In4KCyberpunk 2077tests (without ray tracing), the Pro 6000 pulled 14% ahead of the RTX 5090, though it also used 15% more power. Performance across other titles echoed that trend. The card was 11% faster inStar WarsOutlawsandRemnant 2, and 3% faster inAssassin’s Creed Mirage, the latter possibly held back by driver limitations. Power draw and heat are challenges, with the card reaching 600W during gaming. Noise was another factor. According to der8auer, the fan ramps up aggressively, and the coil whine was the loudest he’s ever heard. While the Pro 6000 is clearly dominant in raw performance, its price point makes it unreachable for most. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Der8auer noted that although the card has three times the VRAM of the RTX 5090, the price is five times higher. He estimated the 64GB of additional VRAM might cost $200 more to produce, but that doesn’t justify the $8,000 difference for consumers.

    "title": "Have an iPhone but not iOS 18 yet? You’re in the minority",
    "article_text": "Apple shares the final install stats for iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Have you been usingiOS 18on your iPhone since it was released in September? Or maybe you’re in the camp of waiting a bit to upgrade until friends or family do, or you read reactions from those who’ve tested it. Well, regardless of which camp you’re in,Apple’s iOS 18 – andiPadOS 18, the operating system for the iPad – are officially eight months old. While that’s not a year, the company’s2025 Worldwide Developer Conferenceis kicking off on Monday, June 9, with an opening keynote. We’re expecting the reveal of the next generation of iOS and other platforms. In the days leading up to that event, Apple is sharing the final usage numbers of iOS 18 and iPadOS 18. While the tech giant doesn’t promise a specific number of years for software updates and equally essential security updates, iOS 18 supports up to iPhone XR/XS, and iPadOS 18 works on the iPad 7th Gen, iPad mini 5th Gen, iPad Pro 1st Gen, and iPad Air 1st Gen. That’s an extensive range of supported devices, and for iOS 18, 82% of all eligible iOS devices are running the latest and greatest from Apple. Regarding eligible devices released in the last four years, the installation rate is higher: 88%. Meanwhile, 71% of all iPads that can run iPadOS 18 have it installed, and iPads released in the last four years have an install ratio of about 81%. iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 were pretty big updates, as well – for one, it did start the rolling launch of Apple Intelligence with iOS 18.1 in October of 2024, but that remains incomplete, and themuch-anticipated AI-powered Siri is still delayed. You can use features likeGenmoji, Image Playground, Writing Tools, andVisual Intelligenceon eligible iPhones or iPads that support Apple Intelligence. Beyond that suite, though, iOS 18 broke the so-called app grid, allowing you to place apps wherever you like – even with spaces in between – on the iPhone and iPad. It also lets you adjust the color or tone of your entire home screen, including app icons. ThePhotos app was redesignedand added customization, but wasn’t loved by everyone. Also, Apple finally added support forRCS messaging,as well as being able to rework the layout of Control Center. It was a solid, sizable release for iOS and iPadOS, which even got smaller updates and is currently sitting at iOS 18.5 and iPadOS 18.5. Many of the features do work on devices as far back as the iPhone XR, though overall speed and battery life might vary. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. So if you haven’t updated to iOS 18 yet and you're on iPhone, Apple’s latest numbers do put you in the smaller group. That’s not a bad thing, but it's a good idea to keep your phone up to date beyond just the new features, as privacy and security updates are also included within these updates. But how does this compare to Android phones? As I wrote above, Apple doesn’t guarantee a timeframe, but you can see that it goes back six years for iPhones, as the XS was released in 2018. Samsungnow guarantees most of its Galaxy phone lineup forseven years of software upgrades, whileGoogle Pixel phonesreceive five years of updates for the Pixel 6 and older, and this increases to seven years for the Pixel 7 and newer. That means if you get a Pixel 9, you can expect updates through 2031. Depending on the model, Motorola offers three years of major OS updates plus an additional year of security updates. OnePlus offers four years of OS and security updates on its eponymous flagship phones. While we expect new versions of iOS and iPadOS atWWDC2025, the rumor mill hasn’t mentioned Apple promising a specific number of years of software and privacy updates. That could happen, but I think the focus will be on themuch-rumored ushering in of a Vision Pro-like design for the rest of the platforms– think glassy and sleek throughout.

    "article_text": "For the fighting game enthusiasts When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Sonyhas revealed its first-ever wireless fight stick, codenamed Project Defiant, and it's releasing in 2026. Announced during PlayStation's June State of Play, Project Defiant is designed for a variety of fighting games and can be used wirelessly or wired for thePlayStation 5and PC. \"This sleek new controller will give players more flexibility to play their favorite fighting games, whether that is wirelessly with the innovative PlayStation Link technology that provides ultra-low latency, or through a wired connection on PS5 or PC,\" said Edwin Foo, Vice President, Product Development, SIE, in aPlayStation blogpost. Project Defiant features a high-quality digital stick that’s custom-designed by Sony, toolless interchangeable restrictor gates (square, circle, and octagon) for the stick, buttons with mechanical switches, and a touch pad like the one found on theDualSensewireless controller. The controller also boasts a sturdy, ergonomic design for long gaming sessions, features a storage compartment for restrictor gates for convenience, and a PS Link USB adapter. Like the DualSense wireless controller, Project Defiant also supports the ability to wirelessly wake up the user's PS5 by pressing and holding the PS button on the top side of the device. As previously mentioned, input timing has been refined thanks to Sony's PS Link wireless technology, but there's also an option for players to plug in to play by using a wired USB-C connection.

Sony has also confirmed that the fight stick will come packaged with a sling carry case, which includes a lever gap to keep the digital stick safe, allowing players to take the hardware on the go. Since Project Defiant is just a codename, we'll likely learn the name of the fight stick closer to launch. Demi is a freelance games journalist for TechRadar Gaming.

    "title": "'We created a new Airbnb' – here's what the app's big redesign means for how you travel and where you stay",
    "article_text": "Airbnb wants to be part of your daily life, not just your vacations When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Airbnb’s redesign, and its push into enabling users to Airbnb more than just a vacation spot or getaway, has been out for a few weeks now. The idea is that you’ll Airbnb more than just a lovely cottage on a beach – also turning to the service, for example, when you want to experience a city that’s close to home or add some adventure to your trip abroad. We’vealready broken down the additions, including the launch of Experiences and Services, as well as the new look for the app. It all feels a lot sleeker, with visuals that adjust on the fly, a mini social network, and a passport of sorts that saves all the information from your trip. So, if you have a favorite spot, you can easily share it with a friend. It all feels very material. Here we're taking a look under the hood and finding out how Airbnb is making the app work better for you. The company has rebuilt its entire tech stack for the app and the service as a whole, meaning you'll find easier navigation with three choices at the top: Homes, Experiences, and Services. Furthermore, there's a redesigned profile that makes it easier for you to take a look back and even reconnect with people you've had experiences with. The rebuilding effort enables what's already launched, while also setting Airbnb up for the future, a note that Jud Coplan, VP of Product Marketing at Airbnb, shared with TechRadar. “One of the huge benefits of rebuilding the architecture and rethinking, really, the infrastructure of the app was that we created something that can expand beyond the 10 categories of services.” Coplan told me.He was referencing the 10 that currently exist – chefs, photographers, massages, spa treatments, personal training, hair treatments, makeup, nails, prepared meals, and catering – but hinted that expansion is very possible, adding, “We've created a new Airbnb that can go even beyond what we've been talking about today.” That could mean we see grocery deliveries integrated, so you can be well stocked when you arrive at your Airbnb to make dinner, or maybe that even means you can order directly to your home. It’s really an expansion of the platform to book these services, whether you’re in your home city or on a trip. Coplan told me how his family had booked an experience in their home city of San Francisco, a kind of a staycation excursion. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. The 10 aforementioned options are further themed by activity, such as cooking, city walks, learning a new skill, and even more exclusive ones featuring celebrities. During the keynote, Airbnb’s CEO, Brian Chesky, highlighted the importance of people, noting that it’s real folks who are experts offering these experiences and services, and it’s real people offering up their homes, lofts, or apartments for Airbnb. There is an element of AI being used here, one example being an AI-powered photo tour, as Coplan explained. “For homes, if you upload all your photos, we recognize them, we organize them, we present them really nicely,” all with the aim of making the listing easier and theoretically helping to encourage more bookings. There are also quick replies powered by AI, in which, for a host, the app will automatically suggest a response that could be sent. For services and experiences, the two new offerings from Airbnb utilize AI to recommend what you might find most appealing. It bases this off of “where they are in their journey, their past bookings, their current trip, what they've told us about in their profile,” explained Coplan. Lastly on AI, Coplan also shared that Airbnb began rolling out an AI assistant for customer service in the US in English, “that allows people to do is have a natural language conversation with customer service and get answers to questions really easily.” It’ll be interesting to see how this performs, and what feedback users provide. On the app’s new look and flow, it was clear that Coplan and the team at Airbnb focused on the human element, emphasizing that what one can book is all tied back to a real person. He noted that the color palette, animations, and dimensionality all tie back to the real world, giving a sense of what you might experience. Even more interesting, and maybe hinting atAirbnb’s future, is the community aspect. “We didn't want this to be a place where you have followers, where you meet people online,” explained Coplan. “The people you see are people that you know from the real world, and so that connections page within your profile, those are people you've traveled with and those are people you've met on your experiences.” It’s certainly a unique approach and a more intentional one, rooted in a shared experience. Now, it’s entirely opt-in, and there are privacy controls that allow you to turn off this community aspect. Separate from the community, but also housed within the profile, is a sort of passport-like experience, allowing you to look back at where you’ve been and easily share details. Much like a card inApple Wallet, it has a shimmer and shine effect when you move your phone around. While Airbnb’s main event is its annual summer release, and that’s done with for 2025, I suspect we’ll hear more from it sooner than a year from now, and I’m intrigued to see just how far the tech stack can go. For now, I’m on the hunt for an experience to try. Jacob Krol is the US Managing Editor, News for TechRadar. He’s been writing about technology since he was 14 when he started his own tech blog.

    "title": "Musk agrees ‘Trump should be impeached’",
    "article_text": "Elon Musk has claimed that President Donald Trump would have lost the election without his support, agreed with the notion that Trump should be impeached, and floated the idea of a new political party to represent the majority of Americans. The clash between Musk and Trump over the federal tax and spending bill escalated into a series of sharp public exchanges on social media on Thursday, with Musk accusing the US president of“ingratitude”and Trump accusing the former government efficiency tsar of going“crazy.” “President vs Elon. Who wins? My money’s on Elon. Trump should be impeached and JD Vance should replace him,”conservative blogger Ian Miles Cheong posted on X. “Yes,”Musk replied. The owner of X had earlier claimed that“without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51–49 in the Senate… Such ingratitude.” Musk also launched a poll asking his 220 million followers:“Is it time to create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle?”Within four hours, almost three million users responded, with roughly 81% voting ‘Yes’. Trump, in turn, said he was“very disappointed”with Musk and claimed that the Tesla CEO’s opposition to his“Big Beautiful Bill”stemmed from cuts to EV tax credits. “Elon was ‘wearing thin.’ I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!”Trump wrote on Truth Social. In another post, he added:“The easiest way to save money in our Budget – Billions and Billions of Dollars – is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts.” After stepping down from running DOGE last month, Musk has intensified his attacks on Trump’s tax-cut bill, calling the legislation a“pork-filled disgusting abomination”that would push the US into“debt slavery.”The House passed the president’s flagship measure in May, and Trump aims to sign the final version by the Fourth of July, pending Senate approval.",

    "title": "Trump says Xi invited him to China",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has said that his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, invited him to visit Beijing during a phone call on Thursday, aimed at deescalating trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies. The 90-minute conversation, first reported by Chinese state media, was later confirmed by Trump on Truth Social. The US leader described it as a“very good phone call,”focused“almost entirely”on trade. Trump said Xi“graciously invited”him and First Lady Melania Trump to visit China, and that he had“reciprocated.” “As Presidents of two Great Nations, this is something that we both look forward to doing,”he wrote. Trump last made a state visit to Beijing in November 2017, less than a year into his first term. Xi last traveled to the US in November 2023 for a trade summit, but his most recent state-level reception was in 2015, under then-President Barack Obama. Thursday’s call marked the first known direct conversation between Xi and Trump since his return to the White House and aimed to stabilize relations after Trump reignited a trade dispute with China earlier this year. Trade tensions escalated sharply on April 2, when Trump imposed sweeping new duties on imports from more than 90 countries, including China, citing trade imbalances. Beijing retaliated, prompting Trump to raise US tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%, while Chinese duties on US goods reached 125%. The sides reached a fragile trade truce in Geneva on May 12, agreeing to a 90-day pause on the initial US tariff hike and reciprocal measures from Beijing. They also pledged to roll back further tariff increases but agreed to maintain a baseline 10% duty on mutual imports. However, tensions flared again this week as both sides accused each other of breaching the Geneva deal. The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Wednesday denounced the latest US chip export controls as“harmful extreme measures,”warning that“pressuring and coercion”were not the right way to engage China. Trump said US and Chinese trade teams would meet soon“at a location to be determined.”The US delegation will include Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer.",

    "title": "NATO boss demands huge military spending hike",
    "article_text": "NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has announced that he will propose a new military spending target totaling 5% of each member state's GDP during the bloc’s June summit in The Hague. This would mark a sharp increase from the current 2% floor. Since assuming office in January, US President Donald Trump has intensified demands that the bloc’s European members spend more on defense. He has repeatedly accused them of failing to shoulder the burden equitably. According to NATO’s latest report, ten of its 32 members do not even spend 2% of GDP on defense, while the US remains by far the bloc’s biggest contributor. Speaking during a press conference following a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels on Thursday, Rutte said that they had“agreed on an ambitious new set of capability targets,”which included“air defense, fighter jets, tanks, drones, personnel, logistics and so much more.” The military bloc’s chief proclaimed that he“will propose an overall investment plan that would total 5% of GDP”in order to finance the outlined priorities. Under the scheme, 3.5% of each member state’s GDP would go toward“core defense spending,”with an additional 1.5% of GDP to be allocated each year for related investments, such as infrastructure and industry. Responding to a reporter’s question as to whether there is any mechanism built into the plan that would help ensure its implementation in the long run, Rutte said that member states would“commit to yearly plans showing the increase each year to make sure that you come to the new target of 5%.” In early May, Germany’s Der Spiegel reported that the US ambassador to NATO, Matthew Whitaker, had warned member states that failure to agree to the new 5% benchmark could result in Trump declining to attend the summit in late June. Several weeks earlier, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that NATO only makes sense“as long as it’s a real defense alliance, not the United States and a bunch of junior partners that aren’t doing their fair share.” Also in April, US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth warned European NATO countries that the“time of the United States... being the sole guarantor of European security has passed.",

    "article_text": "The United States has announced sanctions on four International Criminal Court (ICC) judges over what it described as“illegitimate and baseless actions”against the US and Israel. The ICC’s jurisdiction is currently recognized by 123 countries. Among the non-signatories are the US, Russia, China, and Israel. The court does not have its own police force and relies on member states to detain and transfer suspects. In February, the US administration sanctioned the ICC and its top prosecutor, Karim Khan, for issuing arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. In a statement on Thursday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the new sanctions targeted judges Solomy Balungi Bossa of Uganda, Luz del Carmen Ibanez Carranza of Peru, Reine Adelaide Sophie Alapini Gansou of Benin and Beti Hohler of Slovenia over their“illegitimate and baseless actions targeting America or our close ally, Israel.” Rubio accused the ICC of being “politicized” and of falsely claiming unchecked authority to investigate, charge, and prosecute US nationals and Washington’s allies, calling it a “dangerous assertion and abuse of power.” According to the statement, the four judges are being sanctioned under Executive Order 14203, a measure that restricts their access to the US financial system and complicates international transactions. In November 2024, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant for allegedly committing grave atrocities in Gaza, including using starvation as a method of warfare, in response to a deadly 2023 raid by the Palestinian militant group Hamas. Israel, which is not a signatory to the Rome Statute, argued that the court lacks jurisdiction over its citizens. Israel’s UN ambassador, Danny Danon, had accused the ICC of acting“as a political tool serving Israel’s enemies.” Last month, Khan took a leave of absence amid a UN investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct.",

    "title": "Musk makes Epstein files claim about Trump",
    "article_text": "Elon Musk has publicly claimed that US President Donald Trump is named in the sealed Jeffrey Epstein files — and suggested that this is the real reason they remain classified. The allegation came Thursday during a sharp exchanges between Musk and Trump as the two figures clashed over the recently passed federal tax and spending bill. Musk wrote:“Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public.”He added:“Have a nice day, DJT! Mark this post for the future. The truth will come out.” Trump has previously pledged to declassify the Epstein materials, and in February, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the release of the“first phase”of documents. However, key materials — including flight logs, client names, and contact lists — have remained under seal, fueling speculation about who may be implicated. Jeffrey Epstein, a financier with deep connections to political and business elites, was arrested in July 2019 on federal sex trafficking charges. He died the following month in a New York jail in what was officially ruled a suicide, though his death sparked widespread controversy and conspiracy theories. Neither Trump nor his representatives have immediately responded to Musk’s accusation. Earlier in the day, Trump told reporters he was“very disappointed”with Musk – whom he said he“helped a lot”– over the tech billionaire’s criticism of the legislation, known as the ‘Big Beautiful Bill.’ Trump later posted on Truth Social that the easiest way to save billions of dollars of the budget money was to terminate Musk’s governmental subsidies and contracts. He added that when he took away Musk’s EV mandate“he just went CRAZY!” In light of the President’s statement about cancellation of my government contracts,@SpaceXwill begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediatelypic.twitter.com/NG9sijjkgW Musk has slammed the tax bill for inflating the national debt and undermining the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a body which Trump created in his second term to slash federal spending. Musk recently stepped down as DOGE chief, citing the bill’s contradiction of its mission. Trump has argued that it’s“one of the Greatest Bills ever presented to Congress.” “I don’t mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago,”he added, writing on Truth Social on Thursday.",

    "title": "US on track for biggest nuclear arms spending hike since Cold War – disarmament activists",
    "article_text": "The White House has proposed a spending increase on nuclear bomb development unseen since the Cold War, the Los Alamos Study Group has claimed. The nuclear disarmament activist group based its conclusions on a technical supplement to the budget for the next fiscal year, as well as congressional testimonies by several senior officials released late last month. In a press release on Wednesday, the group estimated that President Donald Trump’s administration is seeking $4.782 billion for the ‘Weapons Activities’ portion of the National Nuclear Security Administration’s (NNSA’s) budget. The latter is the primary source of funds for the development, construction, and modernization of US nuclear warheads and bombs. According to the activists, an additional $1.884 billion was allocated to the NNSA in the fiscal year 2025 to cover the damages caused to its installations by two hurricanes. However, this sum, which apparently has yet to be expended, was not tallied in the budget details under consideration. The Los Alamos Study Group claimed that if this emergency funding is left out, the warhead budget proposed by the White House for 2026 would represent a 25% year-on-year increase – the largest hike since the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. If the $1.884 billion in question is included, the year-on-year increase would stand at 17% – a level unseen since 1982. The proposed spending hike is expected to be put to a vote in Congress later this year. In mid-May, US Secretary of Energy Chris Wright announced that NNSA had completed the manufacture of the first B61-13 gravity bomb, roughly a year ahead of schedule. It is the latest modification to the B61 family of nuclear bombs, which is the longest-serving among the key elements of the US nuclear triad’s air component. It has been in production since 1968. The warhead is fitted with newer electronics and control features such as a tail kit, which effectively turns it into a guided munition. Its maximum yield is said to be approximately 360 kilotons – 24 times that of the bomb dropped by the US on Hiroshima. If and when commissioned, the B61-13 will emerge as among the most powerful nuclear gravity bomb in the US arsenal. Several media outlets, citing unnamed officials, previously reported that its destructive force would make it the weapon of choice for targeting underground command and control facilities. Meanwhile, six more new modifications of the B61 bomb family are currently being developed.",

    "title": "Trump bans citizens of 12 countries from US",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has barred citizens of 12 countries from entering the country, including nationals from Afghanistan, Iran, and Yemen, citing national security concerns. Theproclamation, signed by Trump on Wednesday, also imposes travel restrictions on nationals from seven additional states, including Cuba and Venezuela. The document lists“aliens who intend to commit terrorist attacks, threaten our national security, espouse hateful ideology, or otherwise exploit the immigration laws for malevolent purposes” A full travel ban, effective June 9, will apply to citizens of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. Partial restrictions will affect travelers from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela. The listed countries allegedly either host terrorist organizations, fail to cooperate on security matters, have high visa overstay rates, or have refused to accept deportees. Exceptions will apply to lawful permanent US residents, dual nationals, diplomats, athletes and their relatives attending major sporting events, and those with family or adoption immigrant visas. Additional exemptions cover Afghans with Special Immigrant Visas — typically issued to those who worked with the US military — and Iranians already holding visas or belonging to religious or ethnic minorities the US considers persecuted. The document labels Iran and Cuba as a“state sponsors of terrorism,”accusing them of failing to cooperate with the US on security issues. Venezuela, meanwhile, is under sanctions over alleged election rigging and is accused of lacking a competent passport authority and screening systems. Human rights groups and foreign governments, who view it as discriminatory and politically motivated, have criticised the legislation. Trump cited Sunday’s attack in Boulder, Colorado, where Egyptian national Mohamed Sabry Soliman allegedly threw a gasoline bomb at pro-Israel demonstrators, as evidence for the need for new restrictions, noting that Soliman had overstayed his tourist visa and held an expired work permit. Trump imposed a similar travel ban in 2017 during his first term as president, which faced legal challenges and was revised multiple times before President Joe Biden revoked it in 2021.",

    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has said he is“very disappointed”with Elon Musk following the tech billionaire’s criticism of his tax and spending bill. Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, and owner of X, recently stepped down from running the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a body created by Trump in his second term to implement widespread federal spending cuts, saying he will return to focusing on his business ventures. The tech mogul criticized the legislation, known as the ‘Big Beautiful Bill,’ for increasing the national debt and thus counteracting the objectives of DOGE. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Trump said that Musk – who he claimed knew“everything”about the bill – suddenly had a problem with it“when he found out that we’re going to have to cut the EV mandate, because that’s billions and billions of dollars…” He went on to say:“And if you saw the statements he made about me … I’m very disappointed in Elon. I’ve helped Elon a lot.” Musk has stepped up his attacks on Trump’s tax-cut bill, claiming this week it would push the US into“debt slavery”and urging lawmakers to“KILL the BILL.”The House passed the president’s flagship legislation in May, and Trump aims to sign the final version by the Fourth of July, pending Senate approval. Musk pushed back on Trump’s claim that he knew the bill better than anyone, posting on X that was“False,”and adding he was never shown the legislation. In a separate post, the billionaire upped the ante by accusing the president of“ingratitude.” “Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,”he wrote. The bill, strongly backed by Trump, seeks to make the 2017 tax cuts permanent and introduce further tax reductions, while boosting spending in areas such as defense and border security. Critics warn it would disproportionately benefit the wealthy and significantly worsen the national debt. A Congressional Budget Office analysis released this week projects the bill would add $2.4 trillion to deficits over the next decade and leave 10.9 million more Americans without health insurance by 2034. Musk, who had been credited with helping achieve an estimated $175 billion in savings through agency closures and workforce reductions under the DOGE initiative, voiced concern that the bill’s provisions could undo those gains.",

    "title": "Pakistan has lost thousands of lives to terrorists – official",
    "article_text": "Pakistan has lost 90,000 people to terrorists over the past 15 years, Syed Tariq Fatemi, special assistant on foreign affairs to the country’s prime minister, has told RT. Fatemi emphasized that the Pakistani government is determined to counter terrorism and has made it clear to its neighbors that they must prevent such extremists from entering the country. “We have lost over a billion and a half US dollars in terms of the damage that they have done,”he told RT in an exclusive interview. The diplomat was in Moscow earlier this week to meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and brief him on Islamabad’s view of the current situation in Indo-Pakistan relations. Speaking about theApril 22 attackin Pahalgam, Kashmir, that killed 26 people, mainly tourists, Fatemi re-iterated that Pakistan denies having any involvement in the attack, refuting New Delhi’s claim. The region has been the epicenter of a long-standing dispute between the two neighboring countries since their independence from Britain. The terrorist attack prompted a military response from India, which conducted air strikes on what it alleged wereterrorist basesin Pakistan. After a four-day escalation, the two nuclear-armed nations announced aceasefire on May 10. Fatemi claimed that it would be impossible for terrorists to cross from Pakistan into Indian-administered Kashmir without being detected, given the heavy presence of the Indian military in the area.“They would need to be superhumans,”he noted. The political adviser drew parallels to a similar incident that occurred in the 1990s, when Pakistan was accused of collusion in a terrorist attack during the administration of former US President Bill Clinton, before his scheduled visit to India.“From past experience, whenever a very prominent foreign leader would visit India, something like this would take place,”he said, adding that former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright later hinted in her book that the attack had been a false flag operation and that Pakistan had had nothing to do with it. The senior adviser also expressed appreciation for theWhite House’s effortsto broker a ceasefire between the two countries, citing US President Donald Trump’s directive to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio to speak with leaders in both New Delhi and Islamabad.“The US Secretary of State suggested that Pakistan should agree to a ceasefire, which is what the Indians wanted. So we said, ‘fine’,”he explained. Notably, India denied Washington’s role in the ceasefire, maintaining that the decision was achieved bilaterally – at the initiative of Pakistan.",

    "title": "Zelensky takes apparent dig at Trump for calling Putin",
    "article_text": "Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky has claimed that there is no value in trying to reach a peace deal with Moscow if powerful countries do not put pressure on Russia, in an apparent reference to US President Donald Trump’s recent phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin. On Wednesday, the Russian and American leaders held a 75-minute call to discuss the Ukraine conflict. Trump described the conversation as“good,”but noted that it would not lead to“immediate peace”after Putin had told him“very strongly, that he will have to respond to the recent attack on [Russian] airfields.” Ukrainian drones struck several Russian airbases across five regions on Sunday, ranging from Murmansk in the Arctic to Irkutsk in Siberia. Kiev claimed to have destroyed or damaged some 40 aircraft, including long-range bombers. Moscow has denied both the numbers and the extent of the damage. Writing on X on Wednesday, several hours after Trump disclosed the content of his conversation with Putin, Zelensky claimed that“many have spoken with Russia at various levels. But none of these talks have brought a reliable peace, or even stopped the war.” The Ukrainian leader criticized“those who still hesitate to increase pressure”on Russia and suggested that if“the powerful do not stop Putin, it means they share responsibility with him,”apparently referring to Trump and the fact that he has yet to impose additional sanctions on Moscow. Zelensky’s post comes after the New York Times reported, citing sources, that Trump regularly describes the Ukrainian leader as a“bad guy”who is pushing the world closer to a nuclear conflict. Advisers told the outlet that while Trump has grown“exasperated”with both Moscow and Kiev, he“reserves special animosity”for Zelensky. Meanwhile, Russian officials have repeatedly expressed their appreciation for Trump’s efforts to end the conflict and have reiterated Moscow’s openness to negotiations. However, Russia has insisted that a final peace deal with Kiev would have to take into account the realities on the ground and address the root causes of the conflict, such as Kiev’s efforts to join NATO, the spread of neo-Nazism within the country, and the infringement of the rights of Ukraine’s Russian-speaking population.",

    "title": "NATO more powerful than Romans and Napoleon – bloc chief (VIDEO)",
    "article_text": "NATO is the“most powerful alliance”in global history, Secretary General Mark Rutte has claimed, comparing the US-led bloc to the Roman Empire and Napoleon’s army. Rutte urged member states to ramp up military spending to make NATO even“more lethal”and better prepared to counter the alleged threat from Russia, which Moscow has long denied and ridiculed. “NATO is the most powerful defense alliance in world history. It’s even more powerful than the Roman Empire, and more powerful than Napoleon’s empire,”Rutte stated at a press conference ahead of the NATO Defense Ministers meeting in Brussels on Wednesday.“But the defense alliance needs maintenance and needs investment.”He laid out priorities to strengthen NATO’s military, insisting they are essential to deter potential future aggression. “We must make NATO a stronger, fairer and more lethal alliance… We need more resources, forces, and capabilities so that we are prepared to face any threat,”he added. Rutte claimed that Russia could attack NATO within several years and said the bloc would not be prepared to defend itself unless it moves beyond its long-held 2% of GDP defense spending benchmark. NATO Chief Mark Rutte says the NATO ‘defensive alliance’ is more powerful than both the Roman Empire and Napoleon’s Empire.1. NATO is essentially the US, and a collection of vassal states that submit to Washington’s hegemony 2. The Chief of NATO compares the organisation he…pic.twitter.com/4uOsKeOcwR Rutte said he would present member states with a new“defense investment plan”at the upcoming NATO summit in The Hague. Russia has repeatedly rejected claims that it poses a threat to NATO, calling them“nonsense”and accusing the West of stoking fear to justify more military spending. Moscow has also warned that the West’s rearmament efforts risk escalating into a broader conflict in Europe. Russian officials have also drawn their own historical comparisons. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused the West of trying to inflict a“strategic defeat”on Russia“just like in the times of Napoleon and Hitler”through its proxy war in Ukraine. He said the only way to avoid a wider conflict is for the West to abandon its militaristic path. Rutte’s imperial comparisons have sparked criticism on social media. Media analyst Michael William Lebron, known as Lionel, wrote:“NATO’s chief boasting they’re ‘more powerful than the Roman or Napoleonic Empires’ sounds less like diplomacy and more like 1939 Berlin. This isn’t defense – it’s imperial arrogance... Dangerous rhetoric.” John Laughland, a historian and specialist in international affairs, pointed out on X that“The Roman and Napoleonic empires were not alliances, they were states. Or is NATO now an empire?” “NATO ‘Chief’ sounds like Uncle Adolf back in 1939,”Irish journalist Chay Bowes added. British journalist Afshin Rattansi also weighed in, saying it’s no wonder non-NATO states view the bloc as“a hyper-militarist threat”after it“destroyed Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, and so many others.”Rattansi called Rutte“a puppet”of Washington and warned that NATO“is a dangerous, hyper-militarist organization that is far from defensive.”",

    "title": "EU state’s PM calls for clampdown on Islam",
    "article_text": "Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has called for new restrictions on Islamic practices in the country, citing concerns about religious pressure and the oppression of women. The EU nation outlawed full-face veils in public spaces in 2018, but the ban did not extend to schools or other educational institutions. On Thursday, Frederiksen reportedly told local news agency Ritzau that the exemption was a mistake, calling for the existing ban to be extended to classrooms and universities. “There are gaps in the legislation that allow Muslim social control and oppression of women at educational institutions in Denmark,”she said. The Danish prime minister added she would call for prayer rooms to be removed from schools and universities. “You have the right to be a person of faith and practice your religion, but democracy takes precedence,”she said.“When you’re at school, you’re there to be at school to get your education.” Frederiksen argued that prayer rooms may create inclusiveness in theory, but in practice“provide a breeding ground for discrimination and pressure.”Education ministers would be tasked with coordinating with universities to ensure prayer rooms are removed from academic programs, she said. The 2018 veil ban, which includes the Islamic niqab (a face veil that leaves a slit for the eyes) and the burqa (a full body covering with mesh around the eyes), carries a fine of 1,000 kroner ($154) for a first offense, rising to 10,000 kroner for repeat violations. Amnesty International has described the ban as a“discriminatory violation of women’s rights.” Frederiksen’s comments follow recommendations by the Commission for the Forgotten Women’s Struggle, which earlier this year urged the government to extend the veil ban to educational institutions. The same commission proposed banning hijabs in primary schools in 2022, but that plan was dropped in 2023 after public protests. Bans on face coverings have become more widespread across the EU, with France having introduced the first such measure in 2011. Similar full or partial bans have since been enforced in Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Italy, the Netherlands, parts of Germany, and several regions in Italy and Spain.",

    "title": "How the US deep state feeds the Ukraine war",
    "article_text": "Thepictureof Lindsey Graham, US Senator for South Carolina, and Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, grinning into a camera in Brussels on June 2, is worth a thousand words. Graham is one of the most extreme hardcore warmongers in Washington DC, and the competition is pretty stiff.  Ever since he first became a member of the US Congress over 30 years ago – once in, American politicians are rarely voted out – he has devoted his career to arguing vehemently for war. His remarks are often not just belligerent but also sadistic, such as when he recentlypostedthat he hoped ‘Greta could swim’, meaning that he hoped her Gaza aid ship would be torpedoed. Joking about an attack on a civilian aid ship carrying a young female civilian activist is sick – and typical of Graham. Like his old friend, the late Senator John McCain, Lindsey Graham is obsessed with the idea of war with Russia. He has been pushing for this since at least 2014. In 2016 hetoldUkrainian soldiers,“Your fight is our fight.” Graham’s presence in Brussels is therefore significant. Ever since von der Leyen’s appointment in 2019, she has pushed herself forward as the principal public face of the Brussels institutions. Six years ago, shesaidshe wanted to make the European Commission into a ‘geopolitical’ body – even though it has no role in foreign or military policy. Since then, she has done little else than parade on the international stage. She is among the most hawkish and anti-Russian European figures, absurdlyclaiming, like French Foreign Minister Bruno Lemaire, that EU sanctions have brought the Russian economy to its knees. The Graham-von der Leyen alliance is therefore a natural one – against Donald Trump. European politicians are oftenquite explicitin their view that Trump is now theenemy. The same goes for Lindsey Graham. In Kiev last week, Graham explicitlychallengedTrump’s authority to decide US foreign policy. He lambasted the very notion of negotiations with Russia – just as Zelensky did to Vance in the Oval office in February – and said that the president of the US is not the boss.“In America, you have more than one person at the card table. We have three branches of government,”– meaning that the Senate would soon impose its ownsanctionson Russia, whatever the executive does. Graham’sbudget billfrom February is intended to spend even more money on the US military – as if that were possible – which means that he is marshalling the US deep state to fight back after initially reeling from the re-election of Trump. Meanwhile, the Europeans’ determination to continue the war is existential. Their Russophobia, which goes back at least to the 2012 Russian presidential election, when Putin came back into the Kremlin, is extreme because their“Europe”is defined by its hostility to Russia.  Russia is“the other Europe”which the EU does not want to be and which it defines itself against. Von der Leyen and others want to use the war against Russia to federalise Europe and create a single state. Meanwhile, Trump’s Russia policy is based on sidelining Europe. When he first announced talks with the Russians, EU leadersdemandeda seat at the table. They failed. US-Russia talks took place outside Europe – in Riyadh – while the Russia-Ukraine talks the EU vehemently opposed are taking place without the EU, in Istanbul. Let us not forget how furiously EU leaders opposed talking to Russia. When Viktor Orban travelled to Kiev and Moscow last July, Ursula von der LeyendenouncedOrban’s“appeasement”. The EU’s then chief diplomat said in an officialstatementthat the EU“excludes official contacts between the EU and President Putin.” The French foreign ministersaidin February that if Sergey Lavrov telephoned him he would not answer the call. Now these very same people claim they want to“force”the Russians to come and talk! EU policy on Russia is now in ruins. That is why, like Graham, they are determined to stop Trump.  Their attempts have been ever more desperate and ridiculous. On May 12, Kaja Kallas and other EU leaderssaidRussia“must agree”to a ceasefire before any talks. Three days later, those talks started anyway. Britain also tried to scupper them bysayingit was“unacceptable”for Russia to demand recognition of the“annexed”regions, which is odd considering Britain is not a participant. European credibility is therefore at zero. In March, the British prime minister hadsaidthat the plans to send British and French troops to Ukraine had entered“the operational phase.”They were ready, he claimed, to protect Ukraine’s security by directly entering the war zone. By April, these plans had beendropped. On May 10, European leadersthreatenedRussia with“massive sanctions”if it did not agree to a ceasefire immediately. Russia did not agree to a ceasefire and yet there have been no more“massive sanctions.”A 17th package of sanctions was indeedannouncedon May 14, but it was so weak that Hungary and Slovakia, who oppose the EU’s overall policy, let it pass. In any case, the 17th package clearly had nothing to do with the ultimatum because such sanctions take a long time to prepare. Instead, that is what Lindsey Graham was in Brussels to discuss. The EU and the UK have thus sidelined themselves with their meaningless braggadocio. They cannot operate without the Americans. But which Americans? The claim that the White House did not know about the recent Ukrainian drone attack on Russian airfields might well be true: the US deep state, embodied by people like Graham, is clearly trying to undermine the executive. Both Lindsey Graham and former CIA director Mike Pompeo were in Ukraine just days before the attack. The political goal of the drone attack was obviously to scupper the talks scheduled for the following day in Istanbul, or to provoke Russia into a massive response and drag the US into the war. Even if the attack does not succeed in these goals, it clearly sets the tone for the future Ukrainian insurgency which, American and European officialshope, will turn that country into an 'Afghanistan' for Russia. The US deep state is in for the long game. So are the Europeans. On May 9, 'Europe Day', European leadersconfirmedtheir intention to set up a Special Tribunal for the crime of aggression, to prosecute Russia for invading in February 2022. Western European states are already the primary financers of the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is British. The ICC indicted Russian leaders, including Putin, in 2023 and 2024, on various very surprising charges. (Ursula von der Leyen continued tolieabout“20,000 abducted children,”the day after the Ukrainians gave the Russians a list of 339 missing children.) Now the Europeans intend to open a new front in their 'lawfare' against Russia. Such a Special Tribunal, if it comes into existence, will tear the heart out of any peace agreement – just as Ukraine’s acceptance of the jurisdiction of the ICC in 2014 and 2015 rendered the Minsk agreement of February 2015 null and void. With one side of its mouth, Ukraineaskedthe ICC to prosecute Russian officials and Donbass“terrorists”; with the other side, it agreed at Minsk that the Donbass insurgency was an internal Ukrainian problem and ruled out any prosecution or punishment (Article 5 of the February 2015Minsk agreement). It is not possible to agree a peace agreement with a country and at the same time to set up a Special Tribunal whose sole purpose is to criminalize it. So the creation of this Tribunal, which will presumably remain in existence for over a decade like the ad hoc tribunals for Yugoslavia and Rwanda, is nothing but a Euro-American institutional time bomb designed to blow up in the future any agreement which the two sides might reach in the short term. The future of“Europe”depends on that.",

    "title": "Baltic and Black seas are ‘NATO areas’ – bloc chief",
    "article_text": "Secretary General Mark Rutte has stated that NATO now considers the Baltic and Black Seas areas of strategic responsibility. Rutte made the remarks on Wednesday ahead of a meeting of NATO defense ministers. He was responding to a question about rising tensions in the Baltic region, following incidents involving damaged undersea communication cables. In recent months, several undersea cables in the region have sustained damage, triggering speculation that Moscow was behind what was suspected to be sabotage. Western investigators, however, have failed to present any proof that of deliberate state-orchestrated sabotage. “When it comes to the Baltic region, but this is also true for the Black Sea and for other NATO areas, there is a constant threat of attacks on our critical undersea infrastructure,”Rutte said. He also threatened NATO’s“devastating”response, when asked if it is prepared for a potential“Russian hardcore attack”in the Baltic region, adding that the US-led military bloc must ramp up defense spending. Russia has repeatedly ridiculed similar accusations made by Western officials, which claim Moscow intends to attack NATO or EU countries. Russian President Vladimir Putin has previously dismissed such statements as“nonsense.” A series of incidents over the past 18 months involving damage to power and communications infrastructure has led some NATO and EU officials to accuse Moscow of“hybrid warfare.”The events, linked to vessels traveling to and from Russian ports, include the October 2023 damage to a gas pipeline in the Gulf of Finland and the rupture of the EstLink 2 power cable in December. Investigators believe the cables may have been dragged by ship anchors, with each case reportedly involving Russia-linked vessels. Although no evidence linking Russia to the cable ruptures was found, in January, NATO launched a new patrol mission ‘Baltic Sentry’ in the waterway under the pretext of protecting undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. Moscow, which considers the Baltic Sea a strategic area for its naval operations and energy exports, has repeatedly dismissed the allegations of sabotage and accused the West of spreading a false narrative that frames routine accidents as evidence of its culpability. Russia’s Baltic Fleet, based in Kaliningrad Region, plays a crucial role in protecting Russia’s western maritime borders and maintaining access to the Baltic Sea. The fleet is seen as a vital asset in Russia’s military posture toward NATO’s eastern flank. Russia’s Black Sea Fleet is headquartered in the port city of Sevastopol, Crimea, and is a key component of the country’s naval power.",

    "article_text": "The Slovak parliament has passed a resolution opposing sanctions on Russia. The motion prohibits government representatives from supporting new international restrictions against Moscow, citing economic harm to Slovakia’s industry and population. Of the 76 MPs present for the vote on Thursday, 55 voted in favor, 23 abstained, and one opposed the resolution. Opposition lawmakers were absent from the vote. The resolution, introduced by the Slovak National Party (SNS), claims sanctions have triggered rising energy costs, disrupted supply chains, and hurt the EU nation’s competitiveness. It urges the government to prioritize national economic interests and resist international actions that may negatively impact Slovak businesses and citizens. “This is a historic document, the first of its kind within the EU,”SNS leader Andrej Danko said.“It clearly states that sanctions against Russia harm Slovakia’s economy and the plenary session of the Slovak parliament has agreed.” Danko had said he was unsure the motion would pass, as the vote came a day after President Peter Pellegrini blocked a petition calling for a nationwide referendum on the same issue. The petition, initiated by the Slovak Revival Movement (SHO) and the DOMOV party, asked:“Do you agree that Slovakia should not apply sanctions against Russia that harm Slovak citizens and entrepreneurs?”It gathered more than 400,000 signatures – well over the 350,000 required for presidential consideration – and was submitted to Pellegrini in May. The president had said on Wednesday that he could not approve the referendum due to vague wording. He noted the petition didn’t specify whether it referred to future or existing sanctions, nor did it define which measures would qualify as harmful or who would determine that. Danko responded by mocking Pellegrini for“having the courage”to ignore the will of hundreds of thousands of citizens. He said that if the president had doubts about the legality of the text, he should have referred it to the Constitutional Court. Slovakia implemented all EU sanctions on Russia after the Ukraine conflict escalated in February 2022. Prime Minister Robert Fico, who returned to office in 2023, has consistently argued against the measures, saying they“are not working”and damage EU member states more than they affect Moscow. Following the vote, Danko said the resolution would require Fico to oppose any new EU sanctions targeting Russia. However, he cautioned that Pellegrini still has the power to veto the resolution.",

    "article_text": "A French intelligence officer has been found dead in a parking lot at his workplace in Levallois-Perret, a suburb of Paris, in what authorities believe was a suicide, French media reported on Wednesday. The man, whose name has not been made public, was discovered on Monday afternoon in a service vehicle parked in the underground garage of the Directorate General for Internal Security (DGSI), France’s domestic intelligence agency under the Interior Ministry. It works alongside the National Police and the National Gendarmerie, but is specifically tasked with surveillance, counter-espionage, and fighting terrorism and cybercrime. He died from a gunshot wound to the head inflicted with his service weapon, Le Parisien and Actu17 reported, citing police and judicial sources. Media outlets reported that a farewell letter was found at the officer’s home. His wife reportedly contacted authorities after discovering the handwritten note, prompting a search by his colleagues inside DGSI headquarters. The search led to the discovery of his body inside the car. While the contents of the note have not been made public, it reportedly contained a statement of intent to commit suicide. The local prosecutor’s office has nonetheless launched an investigation to determine the cause of death. The DGSI’s internal inspection unit is handling the case. This is the third suspected suicide involving a DGSI officer in five months. In January, another officer reportedly took his life under similar circumstances in the agency’s basement. Two days earlier, a separate officer fatally shot himself at home, reportedly due to personal issues not linked to work. No official comment has been issued by the French Interior Ministry or the DGSI. According to Actu17, this latest case brings the number of suicides within France’s national police force to 10 since the beginning of the year.",

    "title": "Moscow accuses British NGO of subversive activities in universities",
    "article_text": "Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) has accused the UK-based Oxford Russia Fund of conducting a covert influence campaign in Russian universities aimed at undermining national security. The organization had already been declared ‘undesirable’ by Moscow, a designation that prohibits its activities and implies involvement in hostile propaganda efforts. The Oxford Russia Fund began operating in Russia in 2006 with the stated aim of supporting higher education in the humanities and social sciences. While it claimed to provide scholarships and academic resources, its work raised red flags for the authorities. In 2021, the Prosecutor General’s Office banned the organization, citing threats to national sovereignty. According to the FSB, it nonetheless continued to operate subversively, maintaining covert ties with university staff and facilitating the spread of foreign narratives. In a statement issued on Thursday, the FSB said faculty members in the regions of Volgograd, Novosibirsk, Chelyabinsk, and Tomsk worked with the banned organization to distribute materials promoting“support for sexual minorities and LGBT values”– content considered incompatible with traditional Russian values. The NGO also allegedly collected sensitive data about the country’s internal political and socioeconomic situation amid the Ukraine conflict. Fifteen Russian nationals have received official warnings under criminal statutes related to collaboration with foreign entities deemed a threat to national security. One professor has already been fined for involvement with a banned group. The FSB and Prosecutor’s Office also issued a formal warning to one of the universities involved. The FSB claimed that British intelligence services have long targeted Russian academia as a channel for ideological influence.“They seek to raise a ‘new generation’ of Russian citizens in a manner beneficial to London,”the statement said. Over the past decade, Russia has introduced stricter laws to shield society from LGBT propaganda. In 2013, LGBT content was banned for minors, and by 2022, the ban extended to all audiences. In 2023, the ‘international LGBT movement’ was designated as a terrorist organization. In its statement, the FSB announced that the British Council, the UK’s primary cultural outreach institution, has also been declared ‘undesirable’. The authorities accuse the NGO of serving as a vehicle for British intelligence, using cultural programming as cover to destabilize sovereign states. The UK has taken an increasingly hostile posture toward Russia, imposing sweeping sanctions while continuing to provide military support to Ukraine, despite the ongoing peace talks mediated by the US. Russia’s ambassador in London, Andrey Kelin, recently denounced Britain’s behavior as“belligerent and irresponsible,”calling its support for Ukraine“senseless”and“reckless.”",

    "article_text": "The Pentagon has redirected key missile components originally intended for Ukraine’s air defense to American forces in the Middle East, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing a confidential notification sent to Congress last week. The move comes as US President Donald Trump has been winding down support for Ukraine since entering office. According to the WSJ, the move concerns proximity fuzes used in ground-based Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System (APKWS) – a guided rocket system that Ukraine has reportedly been using for the past several years to shoot down drones. The fuzes were acquired under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative under former US President Joe Biden. Although funding for the initiative has already been spent, previously approved shipments are still scheduled to arrive in Ukraine later this year and the next. However, the WSJ has claimed that US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth authorized the transfer of the fuzes via an internal memo last month, designating it as a“Secretary of Defense Identified Urgent Issue.”The decision was reportedly communicated to the Senate Armed Services Committee, although the Pentagon has declined to comment publicly. Citing anonymous sources and internal documents, the WSJ said the US Air Force intends to use the reallocated fuzes in rockets mounted on F-16 and F-15E fighter jets. The redirection was permitted under an emergency military spending bill passed last year. Celeste Wallander, who served as a senior Defense Department official during the Biden administration, told the WSJ that while the systems have been“vital”to Ukraine’s air defense, there is also an“urgent requirement to protect US personnel and bases in the Middle East against Houthi and potentially Iranian drone attacks.” The WSJ report comes after Hegseth skipped a NATO meeting this week focused on coordinating military aid to Ukraine. It marked the first time the head of the Pentagon had missed a gathering of the group and came amid Hegseth’s repeated criticism of continued US involvement in the Ukraine conflict. President Trump has frequently questioned continued military support for Ukraine, and has called for the conflict to be resolved diplomatically while pushing Moscow and Kiev to reach a peace deal. Russian officials have condemned foreign arms shipments to Kiev throughout the conflict, arguing they will not alter the course of the war but will lead to further escalation and casualties.",

    "title": "Trump views Zelensky as ‘bad guy’ – NYT",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump is frustrated with Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky, seeing him as a“bad guy”who is pushing the world closer to nuclear conflict, the New York Times reported on Wednesday, citing sources. Unnamed Trump advisers told the NYT that the president is“exasperated”with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelensky, but“reserves special animosity”for the Ukrainian leader, who he has publicly criticized on several occasions. Although Trump has said it is“understandable”that Ukraine wants to keep fighting, his stance toward Zelensky is notably harsher than toward Putin, the report says. The US president reportedly tends to be more deferential to his Russian counterpart, and previously believed that their“very, very good relationship”would help end the conflict. Because of this, he has thus far refrained from imposing new sanctions on Moscow. On Wednesday, the two leaders held a 75-minute phone conversation in which Trump said they discussed Ukraine’s recent attack on Russian airbases that reportedly host strategic aircraft.“President Putin did say, and very strongly, that he will have to respond to the recent attack on the airfields,”Trump said. The Kremlin confirmed the conversation. Russian presidential aide Yury Ushakov said Putin informed Trump of Ukraine’s efforts to derail peace talks between Moscow and Kiev, including“terrorist”attacks on civilian targets. Ushakov was apparently referring to incidents of railroadsabotagein the regions of Bryansk and Kursk in which seven people died and more than 100 were injured. Following the call, Zelensky posted a statement on Telegram, saying:“If the world reacts weakly to Putin’s threats, then he perceives this as the world’s readiness to turn a blind eye to his actions… If the strong do not stop Putin, it means that they share responsibility with him.” Trump previously engaged in a public spat with Zelensky when the two met at the White House in late February. At the time, the US president accused Zelensky of“gambling with World War III,”and of being“disrespectful”and ungrateful for American support.",

    "title": "Presley Gerber Knows What He's Getting Dad Rande Gerber for Father's Day",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. What do you give as a Father's Day gift to the dad who seemingly has everything? Especially when that's not an exaggeration, because you're Presley Gerber, and your dad is businessman Rande Gerber—the model, hospitality mogul, and man who built Casamigos tequila with George Clooney. Since Presley no doubt feels the pressure—and Rande knows what he likes—we asked both father and son what they've got their eye on for Father's Day. Seeing as they're a close-knit father-son duo, who (according to them) start the holiday by crushing “just about everything on the menu” at iHop together, there was quite a bit of overlap. Though his favorite gift is spending time with his family—his wife, Cindy Crawford, and his daughter, Kaia Gerber—Rande does have his eye on some newgolfclubs, a fresh batch of Vuori clothes (the whole Gerber-Crawford clan are Vuori partners), and some new toys for hishome gym. Presley's clearly picked up on the hints, but has a few ideas of his own. Below are Rande's wishlist and Presley's gift list—which, if you're stuck on what to get your own dad for Father's Day, should offer some helpful inspiration. The Gerber boys do a lot together, from paddleboarding to dirt biking, and it's probably why the younger Gerber knows exactly how to show for his dad. He also knows that over the years that his dad's been focusing more on comfort, but that his style is still “relaxed and confident,” hence his affinity for Vuori's comfy basics. Sonos Amazon The Gerbers live in a Sonos household, which means there's always an excuse to add another speaker to the sound system. The Era 100 is the brand's latest bookshelf speaker (spoiler alert:It's really good), and it offers some of the best audio quality in its price range. Askold Amazon According to Gerber, his dad is big on saunas, though it's not the best thing for your hair. This wool sauna hat keeps your head significantly cooler so that your hair doesn't experience any heat damage while the rest of your body sweats it out. Polo Ralph Lauren Home Ralph Lauren “He likes a sandalwood scent,” Presley says, and this one from Ralph Lauren hits all the right notes (literally). Ridge Amazon Even in a swipe-or-tap world, Papa Gerber likes to keep some cash on hand. The Ridge money clip attaches to the brand's cards-only wallet, keeping Benjamins close at hand. LA Golf Shop at LA Golf “My dad loves golfing and enjoys some competition amongst friends,” Presley says. L.A. Golf offers custom clubs so that his father has no excuses for missing the fairway on a par-4. Skechers Skechers Rande's a pickleball player, and Presley's paid enough attention to know that these Skechers are his go-to shoes for the court. Vuori Vuori Presley, a good and observant son, knows these are his dad's go-to shorts. Vuori Vuori And since Rande loves Vuori'sStrato Tech polos, he'll no doubt like these tees made from the same soft, sweat-wicking material Above all else, the elder Gerber just wants to spend time with his family. “More time—the one thing I can’t buy is the one thing I would really love more of,” he says. “No question, I will continue taking advantage of the time I have.” His wishlist is filled with things that can be used during those Gerber family hangs, but also the clothing items that fit his style, which he describes as “casual, comfortable, and clean.” Ooni Amazon “When Presley and Kaia lived with us, every Sunday was pizza night,” Rande says. “We would all make lots of pizzas and eat and laugh and eat ‘til we couldn’t anymore.” At home, the family already uses an Ooni and thePresto Pizzazz, but there’s always a good excuse to re-up on another pizza oven. Meater Amazon Like a true Dad, Rande loves barbecuing with his friends and family. As any 'cue guy knows, it all comes down to temperature. The Meater (get it?) links up with a phone so the pitmaster can pull anything from brisket to roast chicken at the exact right moment. Levi's Levi's Rande admits his uniform is simple: jeans, a tee, and sneakers or boots. He says his favorite jeans come from AG and Levi's—and no dad can ever own too many 501s. Recteq Amazon \"Right now I use the Weber Genesis grill, as well as a Blackstone with a griddle top, which is great for burgers,\" Rande says. But he wants to pick up smoking—the delicious kind. Recteq's X-Fire Pro 825 pellet smoker is a popular option: Lots of cooking space plus precise temp controls means enough perfect ribs for a whole family. Oura Oura Rande says his Oura ring is the one piece of tech he can't live without. The latest version is sleeker than previous models, with improved health tracking and better sensor technology. Technogym Technogym Rande's been a Technogym man ever since trying out the equipment at a hotel gym, and he's “due for new stuff.” The 63-year-old does strength training plus cardio five days a week—but, like us, admits he could stand to add in a few more leg days.",

    "title": "18 Best Fitness Trackers of 2025 for On-Demand Health Stats",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. The best fitness trackers have a very simple purpose of keeping you pacing towards your health goals. Depending on the person, those objectives can range from improving yoursleepregimen, getting your dailystepsin, or hitting peak Schwarzenegger-level physique. The latest class of fitness trackers have advanced way beyond your grandma's OG Walk-A-Matic. Sure, thesewearableswill count your steps, but now they'll also give you a pretty good estimate of how many calories you burned, the amount of flights you've scaled, and even your walking asymmetry (a pretty neat stat that tells you how your legs differ during your walks). All of this data comes together inside these fairly tiny devices to let you know just how well you're doing health-wise. They'll even help you make better, smarter life choices to live longer, better lives. The crowded wearables marketplace can make it really tough to figure which are truly the best fitness trackers, though, especially since each new model seems to pack in more features than the last (do you really need to know you blood oxygen saturation levels?). But we've used our intel on the market, findings from our own testing and previous reporting, plus winners fromGQFitness Awardsof the past to pad out these recommendations. Sound good to you? Here are the best fitness trackers to get you back on, ahem,track. Amazon Battery life: 7 days; 24 hours with GPSHeart rate monitor: YesGPS: YesSize: 42mm At $300, Garmin's Forerunner 245 sits nicely between the low-budget fitness trackers and the wildly expensive super computers that are sized like a watch. The 245 is a lightweight, workout-ready fitness tracker for basically everyone. It boasts an impressive battery life—up to seven days—and even with the GPS running, it'll go on for up to 24 hours. On the daily, you can get exercise programs tailored to you, and if you have a real-life coach, they can even sync their custom workouts to your device so it's like your trainer is with you IRL. Runners we'veinterviewed in the pastlove the Forerunner 245 for its lightweight feel. And anyone who's training for a marathon or race can appreciate the 245's training status monitor, which ensures you're not overdoing it on activities, and the recovery time advisor that cautions you to ease up before tackling another big sweat session. For those who prefer to run without their phone on hand, the GPS will let you stay on the radar without the added baggage of a device. Amazon Battery life: 7 days; 5 hours with GPSHeart rate monitor: YesGPS: YesSize: 26mm Fitbit is arguably the most recognizable name in the fitness tracker game, and its Charge 5 is lightyears better than its previous iteration. First, it has a crisper, cleaner display, alongside a more streamlined design that sits subtly on the wrist. It's not as beefy or jam-packed as our top pick, the Forerunner 245, but it does feature a surprisingly robust fitness tracking library for such a compact device. A lot of the greatest gimmicks are locked behind a membership ($10 per month) which is free for the first six months with your purchase, like a daily readiness reading—which tracks your sleep, heart rate, and previous workouts to determine your preparedness for a workout today—and a stress management setting to help you better manage that tension you feel coursing through your body. Amazon Battery life: 16 days; 42 hours with GPSHeart rate monitor: YesGPS: YesSize: 47mm As we noted before in last year'sFitness Awards, the Epix 2 is the “Cadillac Eldorado of dedicated sports watches.” This luxury wearable offers a wealth of tracking capabilities—like stress, sleep, hydration, and respiration—as well as sport modes for specific activities like hiking and even pickleball. Big golf guy? The Epix 2 loads CourseView maps for over 42,000 golf courses to help you get on par. It also provides some of the most accurate GPS positioning among any other wearable, making for a perfect companion on trail runs even in the middle of nowhere. The sun's glare is no match for the stunning screen, and the always-on display is crystal clear, especially with this extra-large, 47-millimeter display. Amazon Battery life: 36 hours; or 60 hours with low power modeHeart rate monitor: YesGPS: YesSize: 49mm Apple's been in the wearables game for a minute now, but last year's Watch Ultra launch was the biggest release for the category in a hot minute. As Alan Dye—vice president of human interface design—previouslytold us, the Apple Watch Ultra is \"purpose-built for adventure.\" The redesigned dual-frequency GPS offers some super-precise positioning, while a Backtrack feature helps you retrace your steps even in the most remote locations (and in case you forgot to alert your loved ones where you were headed). The biggest addition to the Apple Watch Ultra is the action button, placed under the crown, which you customize to control the feature you use the most from the watch. And for those less-than-ideal SOS situations, the action button can be used to activate an emergency siren that's loud enough to be heard from as far as 600 feet. It doesn't have the most long-lasting battery, but it is an improvement on non-Ultra watches and lasts long enough to endure a grueling Ironman. Amazon Battery life: 7 daysHeart rate monitor: YesGPS: NoSize: 8mm A wearable you don't wear on your wrist?! The Oura ring, on its third generation, brings back all of the health tracking we loved before—activity (and inactivity levels), sleep habits, and recovery time—with the addition of a “readiness score,\" which is sort of like the Fitbit Charge 5 in that it alerts you of your overall body status each morning. The longer you wear the Oura ring, the better it'll get at telling you how to get the most out of your sleep, from when you should start winding down—i.e. wrap up your social media doom-scrolling—and alert you to any sleep disturbances from breathing you might have experienced. Also, the Oura ring just looks so damn good. Its sleek design (whose fashion bona fides have been paved by a collaboration withGucci) is a far cry from the highly rugged wearables we've come to know and love, but it still does a damn good job on the tech side. Walmart Battery life: 18 hoursHeart rate monitor: YesGPS: YesSize: 40mm and 44mm Ever since Apple released “SE” versions of its flagship products, we've been loving these more affordable options for those who want the basics but maybe not all the bells and whistles. It has the usual tracking features for stuff like heart rate and noise levels, and for those who just want to make sure they're not a couch potato all day long, the idea of creating “rings” of exercise you complete make it somewhat of a game to stand up, stretch, and flail around to get those bursts of movement in. It comes with the same processor as the Apple Watch Series 8 (which was released at the same time) as well as an equally easy-to-read screen and simple-to-use interface. Another carry over from the Series 8 is the Apple Watch SE's crash detection, which will contact emergency services if—heaven forbid—you were involved in a serious car collision. And of course being Apple, this is meant to be paired with an Apple device. The SE is essentially a second, smaller monitor for remote access to your iPhone, and its price point makes it much more attainable than the still-good but more expensive Series 8. Amazon Battery life: 50 hoursHeart rate monitor: YesGPS: YesSizes: 40mm and 44mm We had called the Galaxy Watch 4 one of our favoritefitness watches, and with the release of the next-gen model, the Galaxy Watch 5, we're happy to say that Samsung did not disappoint. First, it offers Google's new Wear OS 3 software, featuring faster app loading, longer battery life, and an overall better UX. It takes a mere 30 minutes to juice up to a 45% charge, and the 50 hour battery life isn't half bad for a smartwatch (though it pales in comparison to dedicated fitness trackers). For those looking to improve their sleep, the Galaxy Watch 5 could be the wearable that finally lets them clock a more restful night's sleep: Through the tracker's Advanced Sleep Coaching, users are equipped with tips for better sleeping habits, and the watch will analyze your sleep patterns while offering up a five-week program to help you achieve your goals. Apple Amazon Battery life:18 hours; 36 hours in Low Power ModeHeart rate monitor:YesGPS:YesSize:42mm or 46mm The Apple Watch Series 10 isn’t just a smartwatch; it’s your entire life packed into a sleek, wearable device. If you’re already in Apple’s ecosystem, it’s the obvious choice—it integrates seamlessly with your iPhone, Mac, and AirPods. The Series 10 takes things up a notch with more advanced health tracking, including real-time blood oxygen levels, sleep apnea detection, and improved heart rate monitoring. But what really sets it apart is its user-friendly design, snappy performance, and third-party app compatibility. It’s essentially your personal trainer, health coach, and PA wrapped into one. Reviewers love its sleek design, noting, “The new display technology makes everything crisp and vibrant.” Another called it, “one of those devices you never knew you needed until you bought one.” To get the most out of your fitness tracker requires keeping it on as much as possible so it can collect data and show you trends over time. Personally, I find the Apple Watch the best wrist-based wearable for this purpose because it feels and looks like an everyday timepiece as opposed to a sportswatch and offers app syncing that allow it to sub in for your smartphone easily. Garmin Garmin Battery life:29 days in smart modeHeart rate monitor:YesGPS:YesSize:43mm, 47mm, 51mm For those whose idea of a good time includes scaling mountains or exploring uncharted trails, the Garmin Fenix 8 is the ultimate adventure companion. Designed for rugged pursuits, it combines top-tier GPS tracking and durable construction that can handle whatever you throw at it. Its stunning display is a significant upgrade, delivering vibrant visuals even in direct sunlight. Whether you’re tracking your latest summit or simply counting steps, the Fenix 8 has you covered. One reviewer called it their “‘can't leave home without it’ device,” while another mentioned its battery power specifically saying: “I really wanted to have a watch that I only charged once a month and this is exactly that.” Every fitness editor I’ve spoken to about smartwatches and trackers calls Garmin the gold standard for serious athletes and sports enthusiasts, and it's continuing to carry that mantle with its latest offerings. While I wouldn’t recommend this to an everyday exerciser (there are way more affordable options for keeping track of your steps), it’s definitely at the top of my list for triathletes, ultra runners, climbers, and hardcore fitness fiends for sure. Oura Amazon Battery life:Up to 8 daysHeart rate monitor:YesGPS:NoSize:Available in multiple ring sizes The Oura Ring 4 proves that fitness tracking doesn’t have to look like tech. Sleek, stylish, and discreet, this little ring packs an impressive punch, especially when it comes to sleep tracking. It monitors your sleep stages, heart rate, and readiness score—all without the bulk of a wristwatch. While it doesn’t offer in-depth activity tracking or GPS, it’s perfect for those focused on recovery and overall wellness. Being able to wear a fitness tracker on my finger vs. my wrist was a game-changer for me in terms of wearability, which is the most important component for data collection. I found the gold band blended in well with my other jewelry and I could almost forget I was wearing it for days at a time because of its long battery life. Better still, you can size your Oura Ring to pretty much any finger, which adds to its versatility. Kettlebell enthusiasts will also appreciate that you don’t have to worry about removing or reorienting your band to protect your tracker before workouts. Fitbit Amazon Battery life:Up to 7 daysHeart rate monitor:YesGPS:YesSize:28mm The Fitbit Charge 6 is a workhorse in a slim package. It balances affordability with impressive features, like built-in GPS and continuous heart rate monitoring. With Fitbit Premium, you unlock even more tools, like a daily readiness score and advanced sleep analytics, but even without it, this tracker holds its own. Perfect for those dipping their toes into the fitness tracker world or anyone who prefers their devices lightweight and low-profile. As such, I feel like the Fitbit is a great gateway device for anyone looking to get into fitness tracking that doesn’t need all of the bells and whistles of a smartwatch, which is what I enjoyed most about it when I tested it out myself. There’s something satisfying about its straightforward design that gives you everything you need while offering minimal distractions. It doesn’t need to do it all, but what it does, it does very well. Polar Amazon Battery life:5 days; 30 hours with GPSHeart rate monitor:YesGPS:YesSize:43mm If you're looking for a fitness tracker that offers more than just basic stats, the Polar Ignite 3 is a solid choice. During my testing, I found the FitSpark feature to be incredibly helpful—it tailors daily workout recommendations based on your recovery and readiness, which is great for anyone who wants to avoid overtraining. Whether you're running, cycling, or lifting, the Ignite 3 guides you to train smart. The AMOLED display is a major highlight—it’s crisp, vibrant, and makes checking your stats feel a little more luxurious. The GPS and heart rate tracking worked seamlessly to keep me in the zone during workouts. It's a smart, efficient device that doesn’t weigh you down with too many unnecessary features. Coros Amazon Battery life:15 daysHeart rate monitor:YesGPS:YesSize:42mm The Coros Pace 3 is an upgrade for anyone who wants high-end GPS performance without the high-end price tag. Users who’ve tested it out on long runs have been thoroughly impressed by its GPS accuracy—it stayed locked on, even in tougher conditions, and the battery life is nothing short of remarkable. With 38 hours between charges in full GPS mode, it’s built for endurance athletes who need reliable performance through marathon training and race day. Beyond the impressive battery and GPS, the Pace 3 packs in advanced training features that you typically find on pricier watches, including heart rate monitoring, training load analysis, and even race prediction metrics. For runners looking to track their progress and optimize their performance, it’s a fantastic tool. And at this price point, the value is nearly unmatched for what you’re getting. Ultrahuman Amazon Battery life:4-6 daysHeart rate monitor:YesGPS:NoSize:Multiple sizes available I appreciate the Ultrahuman Ring’s unique approach to health tracking, focusing heavily on metabolic health rather than just steps or calories burned. Its sleek titanium design feels premium, and it’s unobtrusive enough to wear all day—and even at night to monitor your sleep. The ring syncs seamlessly with the Ultrahuman app, which delivers actionable insights on your glucose levels (if paired with a compatible CGM) and metabolic activity, making it ideal for anyone looking to optimize energy levels and recovery. It also tracks heart rate variability (HRV), which fitness experts who’ve spoken to GQ point out as akey indicator of overall health, body temperature, and sleep patterns, giving a holistic view of your well-being. To me, though, what sets the Ultrahuman Ring apart is its emphasis on performance and recovery for people who want to fine-tune their fitness routines. It's a fantastic tool if you're interested in understanding how your body responds to stress, exercise, and rest. However, it’s worth noting that this ring doesn’t include GPS or a display, so it’s not a replacement for a smartwatch. I personally see those as pros, however, as a person who’s trying to limit screentime and eliminate distractions. Instead, it’s a hyper-focused device for those serious about their metabolic health. Amazon When the Series 8 was announced, it was quickly eclipsed by the Apple Watch Ultra. Despite the nominal increases in functionality compared to previous models, the Series 8 is an excellent smartwatch and fitness tracker for those who aren't about to compete in a triathlon. The newest feature to grace this smartwatch is its skin temperature sensor, which can accurately estimate ovulation to assist couples who are looking to conceive. That wrist temperature tracker is also how the watch can predict your periods, with that data being stored and encrypted on your watch, protected by a lock function. Best Buy On a super budget? The Inspire 3 can't really compete with the Charge 5—it lacks the built-in GPS and a lot of the cool sensors—but for something that'll just give you the simple reminder to get off your bum, this is a pretty good deal. Its lightweight construction is barely perceptible on your wrist, and it'll sync to your phone to give you notifications if your device is away. The SmartWake function is another handy feature that can give you a little jolt to jostle you during the optimal sleep stage so you wake up a little less groggy and way more energized. REI The Coros Pace 2 secured a 2022 Fitness Award because at the time it was the lightest fitness trackerever.Various sport modes—like those for running or swimming—allow different types of athletes to get the most out of the Pace 2, especially since it packs in a whopping 20-days worth of battery life (or 30 hours if you're using GPS constantly). One of the coolest features of the Pace 2 is the Muscle Heatmap, which allows users to see which muscles they worked out the most to best adjust their next training session. Oh, and if you're not exactly sure which workouts to complete this week, the device is loaded with 200 exercises to give you a little inspiration. Whoop Amazon The Whoop is less of a fitness tracker and more of a 24/7 personal coach—if your coach were a data-obsessed genius. After wearing it for several months, I realized its greatest asset is its ability to help you optimize your overall performance and recovery. Its strain and recovery scores are the type of feedback that can move the needle in terms of meeting your goals, especially if you’re the type who struggles to know when to push harder or when to rest. During testing, the strap was so comfortable I forgot I was even wearing it, even while sleeping (which it tracks with startling precision). As a former fitness editor with years of experience testing fitness trackers, I’ve seen the market evolve dramatically. What started as simple step counters has now become a competitive space for devices that track everything from heart rate to sleep quality to stress levels. The level of sophistication these trackers offer is impressive, but at their core, there are a few features you’ll want to keep your eye on—regardless of your fitness goals or the brand you choose. First and foremost, a fitness tracker should have solid heart rate monitoring. Ideally, it should be able to offer you insights into your heart rate variability (HRV), which refers to the variation in time between each heartbeat. It’s a sign of how well your body can adapt to stress and recovery. Higher HRV generally indicates that your body is in a relaxed, well-recovered state, while lower HRV may suggest that you're under stress or not fully recovered. It's a useful metric for understanding your overall health and fitness levels. \"I don't know that there's really any other marker that gives you a better understanding of how you're doing both psychologically and physiologically,” Kristen Holmes, global head of human performance and principal scientist atWhoop,previously toldGQ. Look for trackers that give you accurate readings throughout the day and during workouts, not just during occasional spikes in activity. After all, your heart rate is key to understanding how hard you're working and how quickly you're recovering. Next up is sleep tracking. Sleep is your body’s recovery period, and your tracker should help you optimize that. Sleep tracking provides insights into your sleep cycles, which can help you adjust your habits for better recovery and overall performance. Finally, accuracy in tracking is everything. Whether you're running, cycling, or lifting weights, a fitness tracker that offers precise data—especially in GPS and step counting—will make all the difference. A well-calibrated tracker can provide the kind of granular data that helps you set realistic goals and improve over time. The trackers we've gathered here hit all these marks, offering a great balance of essential features and advanced metrics for every fitness level. Whether you’re just getting started or looking to optimize your training, these devices can help you understand where you stand, track your progress, and—most importantly—help you get to where you want to be. We put this list of fitness trackers to the test, relying on first-person experience, expert advice, customer reviews, and crowd-sourced insights fromGQstaffers. We ranked them based on value, features, and who each watch is best for. We also took into consideration app integration, user interface, price point, and looks. What is the best fitness tracker? The best fitness tracker overall is theGarmin Forerunner 245. What's the best fitness tracker watch? The best fitness tracker watch—if you're willing to splurge—is theGarmin Epix 2.",

    "title": "How Governors Ball Went from a Pipe Dream to New York City’s Flagship Music Festival",
    "article_text": "When the idea for Governors Ball Music Festival was born, one of its founders remembers drowning in waves of sympathy. “Everybody just gave us this look. Thisgood luck, kidlook,” said Tom Russell. Born and raised inGreenwich Village, Russell is one of the people responsible for giving New York City a large-scale music festival to call its own. “We were so determined and so confident that we were undeterred by any sort of snarky comments or fake well wishes,” he went on. “We stuck to our guns and we stayed focused, and we took a series of calculated risks that were very, very calculated, and we pulled it off.” It takes a lot of gall to invent a music festival from scratch, especially in early-2010s New York, wherehipsterdom dominated the cultureand seeing your favorite band at an intimate, secret location was deemed much cooler than seeing them play a show with corporate sponsorships. But this weekend, Gov Ball celebrates its 15th anniversary with headlining sets from mega acts like Tyler, the Creator, Oliva Rodrigo, and Hozier. Russell and everyone in the Gov Ball office have made immeasurable strides from their humble beginnings. The first edition was held in 2011, and it all took place in one day, as opposed to the three-day fiesta Gov Ball has become. Theposter for the 2011 versionis remarkably quaint. There’s just 12 names—each day of the 2025 festival has 20—and features a note at the bottom that reads “No overlapping sets!” Those names, lovingly, are alsovery2011. “The three acts that we were dead set on booking were Empire of the Sun, Pretty Lights, and Girl Talk,” Russell recalled over Zoom. “They were very popular at the time.” All three had recently played New York City at the time of their booking—but Russell was convinced they had left money on the table by not performing on a bigger stage. Even though this was Gov Ball’s maiden voyage, the nascent festival was able to land their dream trio (as well as some down-poster appearances from a 19-year-oldMac Millerand a freshly-solo Big Boi) for their maiden voyage on a tiny island off the tip of Manhattan. “We were introducing the festival to the city of New York,” Russell said of the 2011 jubilee. “We wanted to prove ourselves and make sure that people walked away really liking it enough to want to come back the next year.” Mac Miller at the very first Gov Ball. Ironically, despite lending its name to the festival, Governors Island only hosted it for that first go-round. Enough people wanted to come back the next year that Gov Ball had to move to a different, larger island. The second edition took place on Randalls Island, a floating piece of terra firma between Upper Manhattan,Queens, and the Bronx that’s three times the size of Governors. While there were still no overlapping sets, the festival expanded to two days and leveled up its booking. Grammy winners Beck, Fiona Apple, andKid Cudisigned on, as did one of the buzzier names in indie pop, Passion Pit, whose debut albumMannershad launched them onto everyone’s iPod three years before. When they took the stage for Gov Ball 2012, the two lead singles from their sophomore projectGossamerhad just hit the streets. For lead singer Michael Angelakos, getting a headlining slot—one name behind Beck on the poster—remains a flashbulb moment of his career. “Governors Ball was a big deal. I was kind of flabbergasted,” Angelakos said. “New York City, headlining a festival like that, I couldn't believe it.” Even back then, Angelakos said, Gov Ball had a different feeling than many of its imitators. “Everyone and their cousin was trying to start a festival somewhere, somehow. We played a lot of those,” he laughed. “Those were easy to headline because they were attracting new clientele and all that. [But] when you’re doing larger numbers, it really lends itself to a very large, participatory-type experience. Governors Ball was no let down in that capacity.” While, for fans, being able to pack a cramped room and see every pore on the bassist’s face breeds a real sense of connectivity, that can be extremely daunting for the people who actually have to put on a show. Angelakos says there’s a strange comfort in looking out over a sea of 30,000 compared to the smaller audiences in places he calls “C-markets.” Just a few weeks after headlining Gov Ball, Angelakos suspended Passion Pit’s 2012 tour to treat his bipolar disorder. But amid that particularly turbulent time in his life, he still holds a special place in his heart for the Gov Ball set, whichended with back-to-back bangers: a rendition of “Sleepyhead” and an encore performance of “Little Secrets.” While he doesn’t remember all the minute details, all these years later, Angelakos maintains a wry sense of humor about that summer. In addition to his recollection of a younger cousin—who was usually brutal in their assessment of Passion Pit concerts—having a wonderful time, Angelakos enjoyed himself as well. “I was in hospitals and a lot of that other stuff. So, I think I was pretty stressed,” he said dryly. “But other than that, it was really nice!” Angelakos during Passion Pit's 2012 set. Russell says he and the rest of the Gov Ball braintrust were adamant about putting together lineups that represented all genres, reflecting the taste of the fest’s digitally curious clientele. “We were all from theNapster generation, I guess,” Russell shrugged. “You have access to so many different types of music at any point in time. We felt like consumers had a very, very eclectic music taste. We wanted something for everybody at our event.” He pinpointed 2013—featuring Kanye West, Guns N’ Roses, Dillon Francis, Erykah Badu, Animal Collective, among others—as the year they achieved their multifarious dreams and sent Gov Ball off to the races. (By the way, for those doing the math at home, even though 2025 is technically the 14th time the festival has taken place, the entire lineup was set in stone and the festivities were fully organized when 2020’s was wiped out, so the Gov Ball team still considers this its 15th rodeo.) One year after the big breakthrough, they secured what Russell believes is their biggest get. When asked for the moment that he felt like his baby had fully grown up, he said it was nabbing The Strokes in 2014. “The Strokes hadn't played the market in so long, and they're aNew York City group,” Russell said. “To be New York City's music festival and to have The Strokes on the bill was really incredible. They were playing as the sun was going down. It was an unforgettable experience.” Julian Casablancas gazes upon his kingdom. This year marks the fest’s third at Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, following a two-year post-pandemic pit stop in the area surroundingCiti Field. Per Russell, the home of the Mets “wasn't a long-term home for us, because it was a parking lot. You don't really feel the magic when you're standing on blacktop.” Flushing Meadows-Corona Park offers the classic hallmarks of a music festival: wide open spaces, green grass, and throngs of music fans from every age demographic. Crucially, Gov Ball has also cracked the case on ingress and egress, the industry term for entering and exiting the venue. With 7 train and Long Island Rail Road stations right outside the gates, the nightmare rideshare situation that plagues most festivals is a much smaller issue at Gov Ball. Once the New York City government gave the go-ahead to use a public park, the festival was able to achieve its final form. For Russell, the punk rock-obsessed kid from The Village who now says his all-time favorite Gov Ball performance wasKacey Musgraves’ kaleidoscopic 2019 set, the 15th anniversary represents the mesmerizing transformation of his little festival that could. “When you're outdoors on a nice night, with 40-plus-thousand New Yorkers, and you combine the most energetic fans with the most beautiful park with an enchanting time of year in the city, the result is really an unforgettable time.”",

    "title": "12 Best Hydration Powders of 2025, According to Experts",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. First things first: The best hydration powders won't work if you're notdrinking enough fluid. They are, however, performance enhancing, and (anecdotally) have a synergistic effect when taken, say, the morning after you consumeother popular supplements. Athletes and partiers alike have been trying to game their hydration for decades, from the inception of Gatorade in the '60s, to now—when dudes are quite literally sucking downhorse nutrient powderin pursuit of an affordable thirst-quenching beverage. Luckily, you don’t have to head down to Tractor Supply Co. to get your electrolyte fix. There are a ton of brands on the market today that sell high-quality hydration powders on the cheap. “If you are someone who trains hard, sweats a lot, and experiences cramps, nausea, headaches, or extra fatigue during workouts, you may need to replenish lost electrolytes,” Mike Dewar, strength coach and founder ofJ2FIT, says. Everyone can benefit from being hydrated, and while you don’tneedsupplements so long as you’re eating a balanced diet and drinking plenty of water (hence the termsupplement), they can be a huge aid if you’re trying toimprove your athletic performance, kill ahangover, orspeedrun your gains. Here, we’ve pulled a few picks into a (non-exhaustive) list of some of the best hydration powders on the market. Liquid IV Amazon Liquid IV You've almost certainly seen these hydration packets before, whether on an Instagram ad, in Whole Foods, or in the hand of your favorite (or least-favorite) influencer. I will say, out of all the hydration powders I've tried, these are the best—for both post-gym nutrition and post-night out… recovery. With a grip of high-quality flavors, a balanced electrolyte profile, and a portable package, these are best in class. Nuun Amazon For my LaCroix people who want a more balanced electrolyte profile in their sparkling beverage, Nuun is a solid option. A personal favorite of mine—I keep a tube of the Citrus Fruit flavor on my desk at work—these give your plain ol’ water a fun sparkle and keep you hydrated with five essential electrolytes in the process. Is it the same level of bubbles as you’d get in a can of Spindrift? Negative. Is it just enough zing to scratch that sparkling water itch? Bingo. Gatorade Amazon Ah, the ol’ faithful. If you’re just looking for a tasty, zero-cal hydration powder without the bells, whistles, and (often) false promises of some of the grocery store checkout aisle packets, this is a great choice. You probably already know your preferred Gatorade flavors—and have strong opinions on which one is the best (orange, for me)—but this multipack has Lemon Lime, Glacier Cherry, and Watermelon. What more could you ask for? (Orange, actually.) Reebok Amazon If you’re in the market for a hydration powder that’ll help streamline your gains, Reebok makes a supplement with both an electrolyte profile and EAAs (a.k.a. Essential Amino Acids) which canhelp improve recoveryand muscle growth. Better yet, it tastes surprisingly good—”surprisingly” because I’m almost always not a fan of popsicle-flavored supplements, of which there are (surprisingly) many. LMNT Amazon Okay, if you’re crushing serious workouts and sweating bullets—especially if you’re outside—LMNT is the move. Back when I was wrestling in college, the mats would get so sweaty (I’m talking slip-and-bust-your-ass sweaty) that our coaches would have us dotowel pushesacross the mats to help soak up some of the standing water halfway through a session. I’m not sure if LMNT was around back then, but it would have been the perfect addition to our nutrition routine, given that we would sweat off anywhere from two to five pounds of water in a single practice. With a massive electrolyte profile (this stuff tastes SALTY!), you’ll be squared away for pretty much any workout. Plus, ifTom Havilandswears by it, it must be good—dude’s an absolute horse. Nutricost Amazon To no one’s surprise, I’m picking Nutricost for the best affordable hydration powder. At just 28 bucks for a 120-serving tub, it's your best bet for low-cost hydration—besides, like, a tub of table salt. (We do not advise guzzling table salt in the name of hydration.) I'm partial to Nutricost for a ton of my supplements, from pre-workout toprotein powder. Nuun Amazon My girlfriend and I drink about a pot of coffee each day—and that’s before I take mypre-workout—so I really don’tneedany extra caffeine. That being said, when I do need a boost (particularly at work), I like to whack one of these bad boys into a carafe of water for some tasty hydration and energy. (And to freak out my colleagues by drinking ambiguous green liquid.) Skratch Labs Amazon I “won” a bag of Skratch Labs' Hydration Powder years ago from a Strava promotion back when I used to pretend to run and cycle on the regular, and while the hydration aspect is great, what I really like about this stuff is the taste. It's actually delicious, in my opinion, and though taste is obviously subjective, I highly suggest you try this stuff if most supps don't pass your flavor standards. (It might be the added sugar—this is decidedly not zero-cal). Sport Drink Sport Drink If you're looking for all-natural hydration, Sport Drink makes some solid-tasting electrolyte mixes with an extremely pared-down ingredients list, which is pretty rare in this class of supps. Quince Quince Yep, the brand that makes everything makes hydration powder, too—and it's damn good. In fact, I have a big bag of the raspberry flavor on my desk right now. Pedialyte Amazon I've been a Pedialyte stan since I was a little kid—not for hydrating after throwing up or whatever its intended use is for, but for rehydrating after wrestling weigh-ins. Go to any gym where guys are cutting a lot of weight and you'll see plenty of cube-shaped jugs of this neon-colored stuff. These on-the-go packets just make things even easier. Ghost Amazon The makers of one of my favorite protein powders in the game make a really top-tier hydration powder, too. Flavor is their specialty, and this one is par for the course. “Electrolytes are often consumed in adequate amounts in a well-rounded diet,” Dewar explains. “However, hard training and prolonged sessions can deplete them (and if you are dieting or cutting, you may not be getting enough electrolytes through foods).” However, he says, it's not always that simple. “It’s important to note that fatigue, light-headedness, and weakness can also be a culprit of low blood sugar—or not enough carbs, which is a whole other issue. Pay attention to how you feel during training and adjust accordingly: If you're looking for a supplement, start with something that delivers 500mg of sodium, 250mg of potassium, and 1000mg of taurine. These are on the lower end, so you could take a little more, but if you're unsure, then start there and see how you feel.” One final tip from Dewar: “It’s important to point out these recommendations are for healthy individuals with no issues of blood pressure or cardiac disorders, or people on any statins.\" As always, consult with your medical provider before taking any supplements. In my 15 years of competitive wrestling, I’ve used a grip of electrolyte powders, from no-name Wal-Mart brands to high-end, probably-too-expensive tubs from the newest, most hyped-up DTC brands in the game. I also consulted with my network ofmeatheadstesters, which includes my fellow gym rats office, former NCAA athletes,NASM- andACE-certified trainers, and competitive BJJ grapplers. Then, I gave Mike Dewar a ring to get his take. Mike Dewar is the founder and strength coach atJ2FIT. With 13+ years of experience as a personal trainer, five years as a NCAA Strength Coach at New York University, and over 550+ published fitness and nutrition articles, he knows a thing or two about fitness. He also holds a masters in Exercise Physiology from Columbia University and a bachelors in Exercise Science from Bowling Green State University in Ohio. You can check him out onInstagramandYouTube.",

    "title": "The 19 Best Tote Bags for Men in 2025: Tested and Reviewed by GQ Editors",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. When people hate on tote bags, they’re actually taking umbrage with one particular style: the random-company giveaway that has no business carrying anything more than promotional drivel. You know, the free thing made from flimsy cotton with zero carrying capacity and handles so thin they dig into your shoulders. Those are not the totes we’re celebrating today. Rather, we're talking the best tote bags, all of which have every right to be a major player in your bag collection. Hell, some could serve as the only bag you’ll ever need—front and center, no substitutions. That’s because a proper tote does it all—grocery runs, office hauls, beach trips—while staying easy to pack, easy to carry, and easy to pair with any outfit. The original tote, L.L. Bean’s so-called “ice bag,” debuted in 1944 to do exactly that: haul ice from your car to your icebox. Naturally, it wasn’t long before people realized it could haul just about everything else too. From there, the tote took off—spanning from utilitarian to iconic. (Exhibit A: Hermès’ Birkin, inspired by the all-encompassing needs of Jane Birkin, who wanted a bag big enough for all her essentials.) Because today you can’t be a bookstore or mattress seller (or, yes,a media company) without pedaling a tote, our mission was to separate the opportunists from the true makers. And that’s exactly what we did, polling the GQ staff to narrow hundreds of options down to just 19—and then, after deep consideration, anointing the best do-it-all haulers for your money. Below, you’ll find a best-in-class tote bag for every need and aesthetic. Some are waterproof, some fold down into a coat pocket, some stand tall and carry it all. But every one is made from quality materials and built to outlast trends. Take Me To:More Tote Bags We Love|What to Look for in a Tote Bag|How We Tested L.L. Bean L.L. Bean Sizes:S, M, L, XL |Carrying Capacity:8L, 17L, 35L, 56L |Materials:24 oz. cotton canvas |Colors:12, including natural, black and dark green For value, durability, and enduring style, nothing has ever come close to theL.L. Bean Boat and Tote. First introduced in 1944—and mercifully still sold at what feels like yesteryear’s price point—there’s a reason you’ll spot heirloom Boat and Totes in the back of most family cars, and fresh-out-the-box ones at every fashion week andironic Instagrams. Available in dozens of colors, four different sizes, and two handle lengths, L.L. Bean’s offering, which includes azippered version, is simply the platonic ideal of a tote bag. Pleasingly cavernous with comfortable, wide handles, and entirely constructed from a heavyweight canvas with reinforced handles and double-stitched seams, the Boat and Tote has been tested to hold up to 500 lbs—more than you’ll ever want it to do. The iconic bag just celebrated its 80-year anniversary in 2024, so it’s less a bag and more of a cultural institution. We’ll see you at the centennial. Alex Mill Alex Mill Size:13” x 13” |Carrying Capacity:23.5L |Materials:100% cotton |Colors:Navy, Olive, White, Black, Red, Cobalt Blue If the L.L.Bean's tote is the OG, Alex Mill's is its stylish cousin with a loft in Greenpoint. Overseen by Mickey Drexler—the retail king who led GAP and J.Crew through their peak years across the 1990s and 2000s—Alex Mill does all the fundamental things right (see: our guide tothe best chinos). What better place to demonstrate this with a classic tote: The garment-washed canvas is charming, nostalgic, and super strong against urban surfaces, while the option to alternate between short or long straps is highly practical. We love that the snap buttons add security, and can cleverly be used to make the bag smaller, should you not be carrying as much. For a fee, Alex Mill will even paint your initials onto it, but otherwise the bag comes in six colors—good luck choosing between the classic white, military olive and eye-popping red. Patagonia Huckberry Patagonia Sizes:25L, 61L | |Materials:8.7 oz recycled polyester ripstop, 100% recycled nylon |Colors:Gold and Black Patagonia’s Black Hole series is famous for being water-repellent, tear-resistant, and tough as hell—and the 25L tote is no exception. It holds a surprising amount, whether you're hauling gear or groceries. While the Gold colorway is veryweekend in Ojai,GQ deputy site director Chris Cohen enjoys the black colorwayfor being “plausibly adventurous without giving the sense that you’re about to set up base camp,” adding that the rubbery coated nylon is “easy to keep clean, since the non-permeable material just wipes right off.” And as expected from Patagonia, it’s all built from 100% recycled materials and made in a fair trade-certified factory. Filson Backcountry Size:14” x 14” |Carrying Capacity:20L |Materials:100% rugged twill and bridle leather |Colors:Tan, Navy, Otter Green Filson bags are so well made that it’s practically a bad business model. The brand’s flagship tote bag is a great example—it’s so well made it can handle everything from firewood to your laptop. Made from the same water-repellent, abrasion-resistant cotton twill Filson has used for thirty years, and with a reinforced base for heavy loads and cow leather straps that only get softer—and make it more office-appropriate—the Filson tote is quite simply the toughest, most versatile tote there is. Choose from tan, otter green, and navy,with or without a zipper, and prepare to be approached by other Filson devotees whenever you take it outside. Loewe Mr Porter Size:16.5” x 12.6” |Carrying Capacity: XL |Materials:100% calf leather with suede interior |Colors: Charcoal Normally, as with sneakers, we’d typically urge you to stay away from designer totes. But the Loewe Puzzle, first introduced over 10 years ago by Jonathan Anderson, has become a modern luxury icon due to its origami-like construction and versatility. This is an architectural marvel with precisely cut leather panels that ingeniously fold down totally flat into your suitcase. It’s a contemporary classic loved by celebs and fashion insiders alike for its blend of low-key status appeal, artistry and craftsmanship. Topo Designs Topo Designs Size:20.5” x 13.5” |Carrying Capacity:33L |Materials:Recycled ripstop nylon |Colors:Six, including Pond Blue/Spice and Clay/Hemp When you need space, look no further Topo Designs’ Mountain Utility Tote. GQ associate commerce director Michael Nolledo uses the Mountain Utility Tote for camping trips and beach days, saying “the main compartment can hold a ton of gear, and the interior and exterior pockets come in handy when you need easy access to items.” He also likes that the bag stands taut and has a wide opening for easy packing. Sized at 33 liters, the Mountain Utility Tote boasts the largest capacity of any on this list, and is truly souped-up along with that: you get a removable padded shoulder strap, cinchable top closure, interior and exterior zip pockets, gear loops and a carabiner clip. It comes in six colorways—including a quieter black—and its 100 percent nylon construction gives you two reasons to feel good. First, it lightens your load. Second, that nylon is entirely recycled, which is good for everybody. Frank Clegg Frank Clegg Size:14.5” x 14.5” |Carrying Capacity:19L |Materials:Tumbled leather |Colors:8 leathers, including Chocolate and Burgundy Unlike canvas or nylon totes, a leather one will pass muster in both corporate offices and Milanese restaurants. Yes, this one comes with a high price. But let me tell you what that gets you: A lifetime guarantee on the item, leather that gets better with everydecade,and a design from the same fifty-year-old, family-run American company Barack Obama chose to makehis Presidential briefcase. It can be made to order in eight different finishes, and with or without a zipper and pockets. Go to town. Aer Aer Size:15.4” x 14.2” |Carrying Capacity:19.5L |Materials:Cordura ballistic nylon |Colors:Black We love Aer’sbackpacksandlaptop bags, and their tote has everything a gym rat could possibly want from their tote bag. There’s a ventilated separate base compartment for all yourgainsgear— shoes, your protein shaker, musty clothes or a wet towel—and plenty of space in the main compartment for workout clothes and toiletries. (The whole interior can also be wiped down easily to prevent any smells from sticking around.) But even beyond the gym, this is just a great tote. There’s a laptop pocket, a luggage handle for slipping it over your suitcase handle, and the whole thing is made from 1680D ballistic nylon which, while heavier, is considerably tougher than other nylons and most cottons. Montbell Montbell Size:15.7” x 14.2” |Carrying Capacity:21L |Materials:Ripstop nylon |Colors:Khaki green, black, navy, red Most packable totes compromise on functionality and security—not the one from Japan’s fifty-year-old, leading outdoors brand Montbell. While palm-sized at its most scrunched, when unfurled this tote has an outer zip pocket, incredibly spacious 28L capacity, and a water-resistant drawstring closure up top to keep everything from books to groceries to sports gear dry. (I own it, and have used it to port all three categories.) There’s also a water bottle pocket on the outside, and that logo is just undeniably nice. Gramicci Gramicci Once again, Gramicci lands on our radar—this time with a tote that’s as tough as its legendary hiking pants. Made from sturdy ripstop nylon, it’s built to take a beating, with a generous 40L main compartment and mesh side pockets that make it even more functional. Rugged, roomy, and ready for anything. Southern Field Industries Southern Field Industries This handmade-in-Japan carryall elevates the tote into a high art form. Nolledo has used this tote bag as his daily hauler for more than a decade, noting it’s the perfect office tote bag. He likes that the bag has structure, noting that the piped leather edges are an excellent “just-for-me” detail, and that every tote bag should have two exterior side pockets. Porter-Yoshida & Co. Mr Porter Porter Yoshida is best known for its tasteful nylon bags (every menswear guy either has one or wants one) but we’re partial to this rugged nylon-twill version. It’s hefty enough to protect your laptop (with a canvas-lined compartment inside) and loaded with exterior pockets for all your bits and bobs. LeSportsac LeSportsac A great laptop tote shouldn’t feel like a tech accessory. But it should be padded, lightweight, and snug enough to keep your tech from rattling around. Made from ultra-light nylon with a durable ripstop weave, Le Sportsac's features a zip-top closure, plenty of pockets, and just the right hit of nostalgic branding. Kapital Mr Porter An outlaw tote with duffel energy from the cotton fiends at Kapital. This tote works equally well as a messenger bag, and it’s an undeniable IYKYK flex that’s not for the faint of heart. Amiacalva Mohawk General Store Also from Japan, Amiacalva nailed it here with what could be described as a handmade Japanese boat and tote. Its six pockets don’t take away from its neat appearance, and you'll appreciate those long 8” handles on big sweater days. COS COS Cos’s ability to construct a designer look at a more affordable price extends to its bags. This slouchy tote, cut from 100% leather, nails the luxe-but-lowkey vibe and looks a whole lot more expensive than it is. Colin Meredith Colin Meredith Based in Vancouver, Colin Meredith cut his teeth at major technical apparel brands like Arc’teryx and Rapha before applying his learnings to his own design practice. This bag is a prime example of his eye—and the same bag Meredith himself uses daily. Lemaire Lemaire Lemaire’s bags don’t scream for attention—they just quietly outclass everything else. This latest style is no different: heavy cotton canvas, a leather belt-style strap that doubles as structural reinforcement, and enough space for your laptop and the rest of your daily clutter. Makr Makr Makr, the Florida-based design studio, is known for its precise, utilitarian craftsmanship. Made in the USA from heavy brown cotton duck canvas, it features a unique fold-top closure and an asymmetrical body gusset that adds a subtle design twist to its rugged functionality. While the dream is that tote bags also rep your local deli or beloved indie bookstore, what turns an average tote into a truly great one is if it’s sturdy, comfortable to carry, and suited to your daily needs. That doesn’t mean it has to be canvas, though there are plenty of reasons totes often are, including durability, comfort on the shoulder, and cotton’s certain patinated charm. Plenty of our favorite totes are nylon, too—the key thing is really just that the fabric is light (given that a heavier tote is more of a burden to carry than a heavy backpack) but still strong. While it’s not essential—our best overall tote bag, for example, doesn’t offer this—it’s also nice when a tote has a degree of organization built in, whether in the form of internal open pockets, outer zip ones, or a padded laptop section. These things just mean you aren’t always reaching around at the bottom to find your keys, or letting your pens cozy up dangerously against your sweatshirt. And it goes without saying that the handle drop should be generous enough. No tote shouldevermake your armpit feel like it’s one added layer away from losing blood flow. While we couldn't test out every tote on the planet, across our discerning team we had at least a collective century of tote-toting knowledge to share and debate. So that’s what we did: We gathered all of the totes we owned, and then whittled that long list down to only the totes we’d urge a friend to buy. That left us with still too many (a nice problem) so from there, we edited down further to include only the best totes for a handful of different user needs—from the best for a gym-goer, to the best for bigger loads, to the best for a decades-long commitment. Whatever your preferences, whatever your lifestyle, there's bound to be a superlative tote on this list for you. More From GQ Connect ©2025Condé Nast.

    "title": "Talking Heads Made Their First Music Video In 32 Years With Saoirse Ronan and Legendary Director Mike Mills",
    "article_text": "This is an edition of the newsletterPulling Weeds With Chris Black,in which the columnist weighs in on hot topics in culture.Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Thursday. Mike Mills has one of the most envy-inducing creative careers that I've been lucky enough to witness. He has done it all—from artwork and graphic design forSupreme, Beck, X-Girl, and Sonic Youth to music videos for Air, Pulp, andThe National. He has directed several beloved and critically acclaimed films, includingBeginners,20th Century Women, andC'mon C'mon. For more than two decades, Mills has been collaborating with the best musicians and actors on the planet, so I wasn’t stunned to find out that he directed the first-ever music video forTalking Heads’ classic tune “Psycho Killer,” starring Saoirse Ronan, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the band’s first gig (at CBGB, of course, opening for the Ramones.) I spoke to Mike from his home in Los Angeles about his first musical memory, dumb music videos, skipping film school, andFrank Ocean. GQ:I was just talking to a friend about the “Psycho Killer” video. He told me that his dad listened to the cassette and it was his first musical memory. Mike Mills:I don't know what mine is. I remember I was trying to be in a punk band, and I barely knew what music was, and my sister had [Fleetwood Mac’s]Rumoursrecord around. I listened toRumoursto try to figure out what a verse and a chorus was. What a beautiful, complicated record to try to learn how to make the most destructive music we could make. It's funny, I have such a connection to Talking Heads. Again, my sister introduced me to it. It's really one of those records that hit right at the right time and changed my life. By working on the video, I found that everyone has a Talking Heads story. Saoirse played “This Must Be the Place” at her wedding. Every crew member has one, my parents— we all have some crazy personal Talking Heads thing. It made me trip out. Like, What's their life? It must be weird being the Talking Heads. Did the idea come from you? Did you write a treatment? There was no idea. I have a little bit of connection with David, but I competed. There were other directors writing treatments. When I first got the email, I was like, \"Fuck, of course, someone else is going to get this.” It's fucking Psycho Killer, how the fuck do you do a video treatment for that song? It's too good. It's too classic. I was really in that mood, a “goddammit\" kind of mood. Then it just came in full form, like “Boop!” This pattern of repeating life and repeating moments and shooting each moment exactly the same way, but hyper-ing the feelings— doing them in this intense way. It was one of those little gifts I have no good story for. It was on the way to the bathroom, I had the idea. The video's great. It speaks to the song without being heavy-handed. I was talking to a friend yesterday who's a director, and I asked him why labels still pay for music videos, and he said that YouTube's the biggest thing, and that's where people see everything now. It's almost come full circle from MTV. It’s not only where people see things, it's where peoplehearthings. If I was a musician right now, I'd be like, “That's a bummer.” But as a director, it's kind of interesting. Do you watch YouTube? Are you on it? My kid is, and we're very tight around music. We share a lot. Inadvertently I am, but I like music without visuals. Music's so important to me. It’s such a medicine or such a spiritual doorway. It's what got me into making art. That being said, they have this amazing relationship because they're both time-based arts. And the more I work on it, the more I realize that's the thing about both music and film. It's dealing with time, and time is such a fucked up situation for humans, always going by and we can't grab onto it. Both are ways of playing with it. To me, all filmmaking is trying to be like music. It’s trying to have that same somatic feeling delivery vehicle that music has with the same kind of flow and unpredictability. I'm always chasing music when I do visuals. I'm a wannabe musician, I picked up the next best thing, which was directing. I became a filmmaker making music videos. I didn't go to film school, I made videos. That, andKim's Video. That was my film school. I would love to do more videos, but they don’t come around very often. Having just sort of dissed music videos, I fucking love them. They're so fun. It's a freer space. In like 99% of my videos, the band wasn’t in the video. That was always the coolest way to do it. And I know the record label would fight hard on that. But sometimes it's great. I did a video forPulp, and it's just Jarvis Cocker, wall-to-wall. It’s like, \"Well, yeah.\" That's all you need! \"This is the best thing in the world.\" How do you say “cut” to him? But it's a sacred space for me, music videos. I can remember a few moments of importance, like the last time we gathered around the computer to watch a music video. It was “Bad Girls,” the M.I.A. video where they were ghost riding the cars in the Middle East. It had been long enough where people weren't spending money like that. It looked like such a big production and it really stopped us in our tracks. Yeah, it's funny, my kid is really getting into “Paper Planes” and M.I.A. That's a musician where the whole package is their art. I feel like all bands, all musicians, should have to do their first record cover and the first video on their own. So you're like, “This is who this person is.” You can't hide behind someone else's taste. I want to know their whole deal. The videos I've been watching lately are likethe Kendrick [Lamar] oneswhere you think, “okay, what is going on? What piece of conceptual art did he just present?” There's a depth and a rigor to them that you could do a podcast about. It’s not just, “Let's have someone dance around some cool lights.” The thing is that I like both. I'm down for something to be good and not have any meaning. I'm with you. Sometimes I'm all in on fanning out and just watching someone look good. That's sort of what music videos are built on. I went the other way. I started out trying to be Michel Gondry or something. Like, “It has to be a conceptual piece of art.” Also, I'm a frustrated feature filmmaker not getting to make films, so I'm trying to put all that energy into a music video, plus I come from conceptual art school, so I'm treating it that way. Now, finally, I can relax and have a Popsicle and just watch a dumb video like, \"That's cool. I'm in.\" I think because we’re also just paralyzed by choice all the time, especially with TV and film. There are people who like dumb stuff and people who like intellectual stuff. I prefer dumb stuff for certain things and smart stuff when it comes to other mediums. Like when a TV show gets insane reviews and generates breathless conversation online, it turns me off. I don't care anymore. So I won't watchSuccession, I’ll watchReal Housewives. That's just who I am. That's funny. Lately I just wormhole in the past, now that you can do it so easily. Because for my generation, when there was a new record out, you had to walk to someone's house and knock on the door and go like, \"Do you have the Adolescents record? Because I heard it's out…” Going back to the Talking Heads, that wholeRemain In Lighttour, you can watch every city and see the whole concert. It makes me, like, teeth-grittingly want to be there. I want the time machine to work. My preferred genre is late-night TV performances. That's what I find myself coming back to. It's almost a music video in its own way. For sure. I just went to the Grand National Tour, the Kendrick/SZA tour. It’s like all these mega tours now, it’s really impressive. It's like watching a video being made. There's 35 dancers, it's very choreographed, there are eight cameras. It's just a crazy shoot. It's a shoot in front of 50,000 people. 100 percent. It's a full production every night. And when it gets that big, it has to be. Not only are there 35 dancers, but they do five wardrobe changes, so there's a whole wardrobe department. They do hair and makeup. They have a whole camera crew. It's like a traveling city of a production. It takes an army. I want to do that. If someone's seeing this, I want that job. You could definitely do it. I know people who have done it. The touring part is usually what people won’t do. They're happy to direct it, but if you have to direct it every night… I never saw what Spike did withFrank Ocean, but everyone loved it. I'm not a big Frank Ocean fan, but it was very cool. What?! How can you not—? Frank Ocean is one of the most overrated artists that we've ever encountered. Everything about it is presented very well, the vibe is good, it sounds really good, but sinceChannel Orange, there are no songs that I want to listen to. I could listen toBlondeevery day, all day. I tried and it just wasn’t for me. You're like, \"No.Real Housewives. Turn it back on!”",

    "title": "16 Best Summer Blazers for Men in 2025, According to GQ",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Despite what you may think, the best summer blazers are more than just an easy fix for your mid-Julywedding styleobligations or your return-to-office woes (thoughts and prayers!). A great summer blazer lets you remix everything in your closet: add one, andT-shirtsget tonier,shortsget sharper, drapey linen pants get sexier. Though yes, ofcoursea perfect warm-weather sport coat will crush when you’re out in Clearwater for thebeach weddingof that second cousin you haven’t seen since you both thought Axe body spray was cologne. That’s because a summer blazer does what your three-season wool suits and tweedy sport coats cannot: breathe. When you’re dealing with a swelteranda dress code, ventilation is the only thing that matters. In pulling together our favorite summer blazers, we broke them down by fabrics: airy, open linen; crisp and sturdy cotton; loose and limber tropical wool, and puckered seersucker. Most are either half-lined or completely unlined—because that’s one less layer between you and the gentle breeze keeping your lower back from feeling like the Everglades. Below, 16 summer blazers that will immediately upgrade the rest of your outfit, helping you look and feel as cool as the cocktail in your hand. Linen’s made a big comeback as the tailoring pendulum swings once again toward loose and leisurely, and we couldn’t be happier. It’s made from flax, a natural fiber with a signature crispness—which also makes it prone to wrinkles. A quick steam should bring everything back to normal, but don’t pay them any mind while you’re out and about. Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Once again,Todd Snyderproves you can add flair to a jacket without sacrificing function. With its natural shoulders, double vents, and a beautiful glen plaid check woven from a cooling combo of linen and silk, this blazer practically books your next Italian getaway for you. Alex Mill Alex Mill We wouldn’t want to wear a dark color while sitting in the blazing sun, but in any other scenario, a fluttery double-breasted summer blazer made of 100 percent linen works its charms. Particularly if that scenario is a coastal European vacation calling for a one-jacket solution to cover relaxed days and wine-filled nights. Corridor Saks Fifth Avenue Corridor's blazer skews a little toward achore coat, with linen’s texture and that olive color adding to the rustic look. Which just means that it’ll stand proud when you dress it up, but hang loose with a tee and off-white jeans. Natalino Natalino London-based Natalino makes some of the best Italian-made blazers in the biz. Everything about this one is ultra laid back; from the natural shoulder and high armhole to the elegant drape, it makes us want to shout “che bella” at everyone we meet. Like linen, but not the wrinkles. Try seersucker, it’s southern-accented friend. Whether you’re sipping sweet tea on a sun-blasted porch or wrapping up 18 holes at the country club, the fabric’s puckered texture keeps it from sticking to skin or getting creased. Chuck it in your carry-on—or better yet, just wear it on the plane—and you’ll be set for weddings, garden parties, bayou crawfish boils, and anything else that comes your way. Sid Mashburn Sid Mashburn No surprise that legendary southern gentlemanSid Mashburnmakes beautiful seersucker pieces. This jacket’s softly-structured shape and throwback stripes deserve to be at the Kentucky Derby (the stands, not the infield). Flint and Tinder Huckberry Flint and Tinder has expanded from basics into higher-difficulty stuff likewaxed canvas coatsand this dialed-in seersucker blazer. The tonal stripes make the whole affair a little more debonair, while a teensy bit of stretch means this blazer will groove with you on the dance floor. Buck Mason Buck Mason We’ve been on the record asbig believers in Buck Mason’s nicely-priced Carry-On Jacket, and the seersucker version is no exception. A barely-there five-ounce blazer that can do it all, with the option to grab matching pants for only $228 more? This is what our great-grandfathers fought for. Stòffa Stòffa Stòffa\u0000\u0000’s relaxed, almost loungewear-like suiting is made better by the fact that the brand chooses the best colors in menswear. Chocolate wool seersucker? Can’t say we’ve seen it before; can’t stop thinking about it since we did. Cotton’s got the range—from crisp poplin to textured twill, brushed moleskin, and garment-dyed canvas—to hold down a summer jacket collection just by itself. It helps that cotton tends to be fairly casual and fairly easy to care for, too. You could wear a cotton blazer six days a week, toss it in the wash on Sunday, air dry it, and start all over again Monday morning. Madewell Madewell A cotton-nylon blazer will keep you cool—and, frankly, we like the soft wrinkles that add a little texture. Even better, Madewell’s version will leave a few extra bucks in your pocket, since it’s on sale. Mr P. Mr Porter Mr Porter’s in-house label aced the test again with this cotton-linen blend jacket that’s been garment dyed. The higher cut of the lapels and lack of vents in the back make it a little more chill than a stuffier blazer, too. Knickerbocker Huckberry Knickerbocker had some fun with the quintessential hopsack jacket by cooking it up in cotton-twill and taking up some solid real estate with a trio of squared-off pockets. This jacket should absolutely stay in your rotation all the way through summer and into pumpkin spice season. De Bonne Facture Mr Porter Parisian label De Bonne Facture’s jacket is made totravel—and maybe start an art movement along the way. Inspired by the Union des Artistes Modernes (an association of architects, decorators, painters, and photographers), it brings a wider lapel and a boxy fit looks even better with a vintage Leica dangling from its shoulder. Linen, cotton, and seersucker can see you through most summertime dress-ups, but if the dress code is genuinely formal and the thermometer is rising fast, you’ll want a summer blazer made of tropical wool. Wool is naturally good at wicking moisture, and tropical wool’s open weave is looser and more breathable than traditional wool. With its crisp, matte finish—sometimes with a subtle sheen depending on the weave—it pairs well with a freshdress shirt. So go ahead, suit up for summer without suffering for style. COS COS COShas such tasteful sweaters, bags, jackets, and soft tailoring that it almost feels rudenotto compliment them. Its fluid blazer, for instance, looks like it’s been stolen from a vintage Armani collection thanks to its relaxed shape, notch lapels, and (not-too-aggressively) padded shoulders. Universal Works Huckberry This British brand cooked up a relaxed, navy-colored blazer made for summer: lightweight, stylish, and ready to multitask. It doesn’t mess around, so if you’re after something sharp but low-key for the office or date night (or both), consider this your sartorial wingman. J.Press J.Press A navy blazer with gold buttons is as Ivy as it gets, and who better to nail it in a summer-break-ready tropical wool leans than the legendary J. Press? With crisp khakis and a repp tie, this loose-wearing sack blazer will let ‘em know you’re just biding your time until you take over the family business. Or play it against type with somelooser pantsand a pair of chunkyloafers. Drake's Drake's Admittedly charcoal wouldn’t be our first color choice for a midday sun-soaked event, but Drake’s may have made the platonic ideal of a tropical-weight wool jacket: unlined, soft-shouldered, patch-pocketed and flawlessly shaped. It’s barely-there tailoring done with Savile Row-skill; the kind of jacket that begs to be paired with anoxford shirttucked into your favoritejeans. By now, we've covered the fabric and construction basics, so let’s dig into the finer details that’ll make sure your jacket matches your summer state of mind—relaxed, breezy, and maybe slightly sun-kissed. The fit should be free-breathing:The only thing that makes a summer blazer feel breezy is a breeze. Skip anything too slim or snug. Go for a slightly relaxed fit—not “family CPA” oversized, but roomy enough to let air move through. If the shoulders are even a little bit snug, go up a size. No matter how jacked you are, no one should be able to see the contours of your lats in a summer blazer. Color is key:If you anticipate being outside for any length of time, err on the side of light and bright: khaki, stone, light blue, off-white. A gentle check or stripe works if you’re feeling fun. Details like patch pockets, and soft shoulders are your best friends for a little visual interest. Avoid hot-and-heavy details:While full- or half-canvas linings are often the hallmark of solid suiting, in summer you don’t want anything unnecessary between you and the AC. Synthetic fabrics are also the enemy: they don’t breathe, they trap heat, and theydefinitelydon’t come with a cortisone cream for the itch they bring. Style is subjective, we know—that’s the fun of it. But we’re serious about helping our audience get dressed. Whether it’s thebest white sneakers, the flyest affordable suits, or the need-to-knowmenswear drops of the week, GQ Recommends’ perspective is built on years of hands-on experience, an insider awareness of what’s in and what’s next, and a mission to find the best version of everything out there, at every price point. Our staffers aren’t able to try on every single piece of clothing you read about on GQ.com (fashion moves fast these days), but we have an intimate knowledge of each brand’s strengths and know the hallmarks of quality clothing—from materials and sourcing, to craftsmanship, to sustainability efforts that aren’t just greenwashing. GQ Recommends heavily emphasizes our own editorial experience with those brands, how they make their clothes, and how those clothes have been reviewed by customers. Bottom line: GQ wouldn’t tell you to wear it if we wouldn’t. We make every effort to cast as wide of a net as possible, with an eye on identifying the best options across three key categories:quality,fit, andprice. To kick off the process, we enlist the GQ Recommends braintrust to vote on our contenders. Some of the folks involved have worked in retail, slinging clothes to the masses; others have toiled for small-batch menswear labels; all spend way too much time thinking about what hangs in their closets. We lean on that collective experience to guide our search, culling a mix of household names, indie favorites, and the artisanal imprints on the bleeding-edge of the genre. Then we narrow down the assortment to the picks that scored the highest across quality, fit, and price. Across the majority of our buying guides, our team boasts firsthand experience with the bulk of our selects, but a handful are totally new to us. So after several months of intense debate, we tally the votes, collate the anecdotal evidence, and emerge with a list of what we believe to be the absolute best of the category right now, from the tried-and-true stalwarts to the modern disruptors, the affordable beaters to the wildly expensive (but wildly worth-it) designer riffs. Whatever your preferences, whatever your style, there's bound to be a superlative version on this list for you. (Read more about GQ's testing processhere.)",

    "title": "3 Days in the Utah Desert With Haider Ackermann: ‘I Need This Calmness’",
    "article_text": "This is an edition of the newsletterShow Notes,in which Samuel Hine reports from the front row of the fashion world.Sign up here to get it free. Haider Ackermann understands why people were surprised when he wasappointedcreative director of Canada Goose in May of last year. “It was not aligned with my road,” he suggested recently. At the time,Ackermann—king of raffish, worldly menswear, Timotheé Chalamet’s best pal andpersonal tailor—was on the short list for seemingly every luxury house vacancy. He had designed rich cashmere and leather coats during his celebrated stint at Berluti, but never technical outerwear. A recent triumph was in the rarefied arena of couture, when he guest designed an ecstatically received collection for Jean Paul Gaultier. Canada Goose was a curveball. His ultimate direction was confirmed when, a few months after the Canada Goose announcement, Ackermann alsotook the reins of Tom Ford. By which point his new Canada Goose posting started looking more like a side hustle. After all, Ackermann was facing a tall order to successfully reinvent red-carpet-wear at Tom Ford. Could one person, even a designer as inarguably visionary as Ackermann, also hack extreme outdoor gear at the same time? And what did a swashbuckling aesthete who had never before worn a parka (and once passed on the top job at Margiela) see in the role? I followed Ackermann into an endless expanse of sun-baked desert to find out. The fashion press trip is considered a perk by some and a champagne problem by others. Either way, the luxury junket tends to hew to a predictable formula: think adult field trips for editors and influencers through luxury hotels and five-star restaurants, art museums and other local attractions. Ackermann, however, has a much different idea of how to wine and dine the industry, which was apparent well before I stepped off a prop plane on a spit of tarmac straddling the Utah-Arizona border last weekend, where I joined the designer for a three-day, Canada Goose-funded expedition through the remote region’s canyons and lakes. In the weeks leading up to the trip, I was assured that Ackermann had curated the guest list with personal friends rather than the usual suspects. Guests were told to pack light and bring shower shoes. The custom campsite near Bullfrog Basin, Utah Boating on Lake Powell The trip was ostensibly to unveil Ackermann’s new collection forSnow Goose, the elevated Canada Goose sub-line he launched last winter, but from the jump another agenda emerged: to show his crew—which included the models Erin Wasson and Kai Isaiah-Jamal,Systemco-founder Elizabeth von Guttman, artist Jack Pierson, curator Neville Wakefield, stylist Jerry Stafford, British fashion editor Olivia Singer, and tattoo artist to the stars Dr. Woo (i.e. no influencers)—how to vacation Haider-style. We weren’t exactly roughing it. My tent, built on a picturesque bluff where previously there had been nothing but rocks and scrub, was bigger than my bedroom in New York and came with Augustinus Bader sunscreen on the bedside table. There aren’t many designers I would take up on fashion summer camp—even a camp with real showers stocked with Aesop products. But Ackermann’s reputation as a globe-trotting aesthete precedes him. He inherited his sense of adventure from his father, a French cartographer who adopted Ackermann from Colombia. The family moved from the Netherlands across Africa, stopping in Ethiopia, Chad, and Algeria. Vacation meant a trip to the Sahara. The last time I saw him, he was gussied up in a gorgeous tuxedo at histriumphant Tom Ford debutin Paris; in Utah, I was immediately struck by how equally noble he looked in cargo pants. The constant change and his evolving outsider status trained Ackermann’s eye to hold onto moments of beauty. “We lived in so many countries, and because of that you isolate yourself more,” he told me in his gentle, unplaceable accent. “You become the observer.” He’s now known for his exploratory taste in holiday destinations (hiking mountains in Bhutan, overlanding through Namibia, swimming in the Maldives) and iconic companions in wanderlust (Tilda Swinton, Robert Rabensteiner, Waris Ahluwalia). To my surprise—because wherehasn’tAckermann been—Southern Utah was a first. “Utah has always been a dream of mine,” he said. “I always make a point to go to places where I have never been before, and I wanted to have the same intrigued energy and search for beauty as the rest on this expedition.” Perhaps it was the heatwave we landed in, but the days quickly melted into a mirage of extreme aesthetic experiences: boating through the ancient caverns of Lake Powell; dinner in a windy slot canyon accessible only via an off-road ATV trail (with Pierson as my mercifully trusting passenger); a helicopter ride to the top of the majestic, perilously tall Tower Butte; a horseback ride at sunset. At several points, I noticed Ackermann was removed in quiet contemplation while his guests posed for impromptu photo shoots or lounged around gossiping (hallmarks of any press trip, no matter how remote). Ackermann hosting dinner in a slot canyon On the final night, I found the designer sitting outside his tent looking out at a sunset so vivid it would render Cormac McCarthy speechless. He cracked a cold beer and sighed a sigh of profound relaxation. “I need this calmness,” he said. “I mean, you witnessed thefirst Tom Ford moment. It's madness. And trust me, I enjoyed it—but it’s madness. So it's very good sometimes to just step back.” Though the trip was technically work, madness of a different flavor, the hot, languorous days seemed to have recharged Ackermann’s battery pack. “All of this has been very inspiring. I know I'm going to take this with me, whatever brand it's going to be. Perhaps also because my eyes are more open, and I'm more willing to listen.”Why is that?I asked. “Because my weeks are quite strict,” he replied. “The agenda is really harsh and hard. So I'm not very open-minded. I'm just very focused on doing my thing. And perhaps here, this is me taking the time. “I think that I'm working three days for Canada Goose, and four days for Tom Ford,” he added with a smirk. The top of Tower Butte Charlie Knepper wearing Snow Goose Ackermann never really considered doing a fashion show for Snow Goose. “There are already so many of them. So, why?” he said. I asked him how he pitched his corporate bosses on the expedition concept, more logistically complex than any runway productions. “I wanted people to experience or to feel what I felt when I first wore the parka,” he said. That was in Churchill, Manitoba, where Canada Goose works with Polar Bear International to support scientific research and conservation efforts. (“They’ve been supporting Polar Bear International for so many years already, but being very silent about it, which is a rare elegance,” Ackermann noted.) “I suddenly realized how good that piece was, how much it kept you warm, and the luxury of it, even if I don’t like to use that word,” he added. His first press trip, last winter, saw the likes of Evan Mock and Tim Blanks dropped on a glacier in Iceland. “After Iceland, I was sort of like,Oh my God, what am I going to do next?” Ackermann acknowledges that his hiring was a surprise for Canada Goose as well. “It was quite extraordinary—the guts he had to do it,” he said of the brand’s CEO (and third-generation founding family member) Dani Reiss. Unlike Moncler and other upscale outerwear brands, Canada Goose had never made a significant fashion play, and amidst a wider luxury spending downturn, the company’s numbers have defied gravity. Investing in Ackermann was an audacious and potentially risky move. Says Reiss, “Haider brings a bold, visionary perspective to Canada Goose, one that honors our heritage and craftsmanship while authentically pushing creative boundaries.” When I first opened my tent, I found Ackermann’s latest work hanging on a clothing rack: pieces from the Snow Goose spring-summer 2025 collection, which officially drops June 12. (He found the Snow Goose moniker in the brand’s archives from the ’70s.) There was a lightly-padded olive green down bomber with matching scanty short-shorts (leave it to Ackermann to make GORP look Antwerpian and sexy), as well as a set of oversized tees and thick sweats emblazoned with the question “can you hear the birds?” that are surely destined for Timmy’s closet. And lest you think Snow Goose would wither under high UVs, Ackermann created a lightweight parka shell, neon green and shaped with the sharpness you’d expect from the guy also helming the house of Ford. Reiss hails the sophomore collection a “striking expression of our past and our future: thoughtfully designed, globally resonant and tastefully provocative.” Yee-haw! As we watched the sunset, Ackermann suggested that he’s just getting started. “I think it's just the beginning of the story,” he said. “There’s so much we take from Canada Goose, and they have so much to take from me.” For one, there will be more trips. “Trust me, I'm not giving up on these moments. I can't,” he said. (He’s already decided to come back to Utah at some point.) What he’s not planning to do is turn Snow Goose into a fashion brand. “I want to respect and embrace the brand and make it wonderful,” Ackermann told me. “If it becomes a fashion brand, perhaps I'm less intrigued by it.” He has Tom Ford for that. His experience at his other job, he said, has only inspired him to make each brand “more extreme from each other.” Canada Goose, he noted with admiration, is “so functional. And when you do an evening gown for Tom Ford, it's not functional. It's celebrating beauty.” Which is a long way from where he started, as an adventurist who had nonetheless eschewed Gore-Tex parkas for kaftans. What ultimately brought him to Canada Goose, he told me, was the familiar intoxicating force of the unknown: “I had never done outerwear, I had never even worn a parka before. But sometimes it's nice to take roads that are not the most direct ones. The side roads are sometimes the most beautiful.” Sign up for Show Notes to receive my subscriber-only Tip Sheet in your inbox.",

    "title": "Here’s Exactly How Much Fat You Should Be Eating a Day",
    "article_text": "There may be no nutrient more maligned than fat. In the 90s, it waswidely believedwe needed to avoid fat at all costs, and food products branded as “low-fat” were everywhere. By the 2010s, the pendulum swung the other way: fat was suddenly in. Theketogenic dietentered society’s collective conscious, people started putting butter in their coffee, and avocado toast was a hot brunch item. Cut to today: chances are you still don’t know exactly how much fat — or what kinds — you should be eating. So we consulted registered dietitians and put together this guide as a reference. It covers everything from how much fat per day to consume to the healthiest ways to get it, so you can plan your fitness goals accordingly. First, afat refresher. There arefour types of fatscommonly found in the average diet: Monosaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats are the most beneficial of the group, according to all of the dietitians we spoke to. Registered dietitianKristin Kirkpatrick, M.S., R.D.N., cites a2016JAMAstudythat found that unsaturated fats consumption contributed to a longer life. “These fats have strong clinical evidence to their benefits and are found in a variety of foods such as fatty wild fish, nuts and seeds, extra-virgin and avocado oils,” says Kirkpatrick. One type of polyunsaturated fat,omega-3 fatty acids, is especially beneficial. “Omega-3 fatty acids have been linked tobrainandheart healthand have also shown benefit in multiple trials to mental health as well, mainly depression and anxiety,” she says. What about saturated fats?Michael Reavis Jr., M.S., R.D.., the lead sports dietitian at Fit With Food, says that saturated fats aren’t inherently bad, but he points toscientific researchshowing that too much of it is linked to increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease, as a result of raising LDL cholesterol. That’s why you don’t want to go ham on saturated fats (pun very much intended). Registered dietitianAndy De Santis, R.D. is similarly wary of categorizing saturated fat as “bad” or “unhealthy” because it’s found in foods that are great sources of nutrients, like red meat and eggs. If these foods are part of how you get your protein, you’ll be consuming some saturated fat. As long as you vary your protein sources, he says, you won’t need to focus on trying to meet any saturated fat goals; you’ll be consuming enough already. “Saturated fats do benefit the body, such as by playing a role in hormone formation,” he says. “But the reality is that it’s not a type of fat that is typically underconsumed [by Americans], unlike unsaturated fats.” In total, the amount of fat you should be eating each day should be between 25% and 35% of your daily calories, according to both theAmerican Heart Association and the National Institute of Health. Their recommendations also say that fats and trans fats should be limited to less than 7% and 1% of daily calories, respectively. You should limit your saturated fat consumption to less than 10% of overall daily calories. Reavis says you can modify the AHA and NIH’s recommendations, depending on how active you are. If you’re mostly sedentary, he says to aim for the lower end. If you live an active lifestyle or work out a lot, go for the higher end. Fat intake is a reflection of calorie intake, De Santis adds In other words, if your calorie intake goes up, so does your fat intake. Let’s say you generally eat 2,000 calories a day. With the above guidelines in mind, this means that you should aim for between 40 and 70 grams of monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats a day. (Remember, we’re limiting saturated fats to less than 10% of total calories consumed and taking out trans fats completely, which is why they’re not part of the equation.) What does this look like?One small serving of fishhas roughly five grams of unsaturated fats,half an avocadohas 20 grams of primarily unsaturated fats,an egghas roughly 3.5 grams of unsaturated fat and 1.5 grams of saturated fat, anda serving of macadamia nutshas 70 grams of primarily unsaturated fats. While these guidelines are helpful for most people in terms of figuring out how much fat per day to consume, Kirkpatrick says that it’s important to know that genetics can play a role in how the body processes and stores fat. There is a specific gene, theAPOA2 gene, that can influence how much weight is gained from a diet high in saturated fat. People with certain genetic variants of this gene should be especially careful to minimize saturated fat because they can gain weight easier from a diet that’s high in it. It boils down to this: Aim for fat intake to be between 25% and 35% of your overall calories consumed and prioritize foods high in monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats, like fish, olive oil, nuts and seeds, and avocado. Saturated fats are okay in moderation—especially if you’re getting them from foods you rely on for protein, like meat and eggs—but keep it to under 10% of your overall calories consumed. Keep those basics in mind and fat can be a heavy hitter in your diet, helping to benefit your entire body. That’s something that won’t change, regardless of which diet makes headlines next.",

    "article_text": "This story was featured in The Must Read, a newsletter in which our editors recommend one can’t-miss story every weekday.Sign up here to get it in your inbox. In April 2020 I started a new job, working remote from an apartment on the outskirts of brownstone Brooklyn that my family and I had just moved into. I promptly came down with COVID and spent the recommended number of days isolating in a bedroom; my wife had to scoop up my daughter—who would celebrate her first birthday at the end of April, smearing her face with cupcake while our extended family watched over Zoom—whenever she tried to crawl in and say hi. When I eventually took my place at my desk in the living room, most days I would put on the Waxahatchee albumSaint Cloud,released that March, and at some point during its run—“Fire” was a good spot for this—I would go slack, stare into the middle distance, and feel my big feelings. At that timeSaint Cloudseemed sui generis: A newly sober indie rocker’s embrace of country blues with none of the posturing or apparent effort that this description implies. It was—undeniably, to me, a person who resists this word on principle—authentic. (“Its sensory trigger has the power to replace the memory of whatever you call this atrophic season happening around us,” Jeremy Larsonwrotein hisPitchforkreview.) Five years later, though, Waxahatchee’s Katie Crutchfield looks like a herald for a new era of what I will call, in part because so many dads I know are into it, dad rock. And the dads are feasting right now. They have “Elderberry Wine,” theirresistiblerecentBest New Trackby Wednesday, the Asheville, North Carolina, band that once included MJ Lenderman, who collaborated on Waxahatchee’s 2024Saint Cloudfollow-upTigers Bloodand released his own breakthrough album,Manning Fireworks,later that year, and is now on tour, where he is throwing out covers of Bob Dylan and the Counting Crows. Wednesday’s new album is out later this year, and Waxahatchee is opening for Rilo Kiley (whose own tour is the mom-rock reunion of 2025) in October. But the action isn’t limited to the Waxahatchee/MJ Lenderman extended universe.The Nationalfrontman Matt Berninger just released his second solo album,Get Sunk,which ends on a track thatRolling Stone’s Jon Dolandescribes(in the kind of evocative rock-critic language that’s receding as quickly, and tragically, as our hairlines) as “a Nabokov cocktail for literate Gen X bros lurching through the suburban blues one slow-motion epiphany at a time.” The excellent new album by the Philadelphia band Friendship (who will be opening for Wednesdayon their 2025 tour) climaxes with “Resident Evil,” a sinister lament about a shitty roommate; if we’re really in for aSilver Jews Summer, this could be its “Wristwatch.” These are introspective songs that would get you kicked out of karaoke, but they are not necessarily what a colleague of mine calls wife-repeller music. That would be Vermont singer-songwriter Greg Freeman. The first two singles off his forthcoming second album,Burnover,are very good, and I’m also confident that my spouse, who is allergic to Big Thief singer Adrianne Lenker’s “warbling,” isn’t going to tolerate his Neil Young meetsSqueaky-Voiced Teenstyle of singing. The man for whom the term was coined, however, is the powerfully warbly and doleful Cameron Winter, the breakout dad rock star of 2025. While only in his early 20s, Winter earned some dad credibility fronting the noodly Brooklyn group Geese, but he fully cemented his status with his debut solo albumHeavy Metal,which none other than grouchyGQcolumnist Chris Blackcalled“staggeringly good.” Still—not karaoke music. I could widen the dad rock circle to include, say,Sturgill Simpson, who has transfixed dads across the world with an ongoing run of three-hour live sets studded with mind-blowing covers that led Chris Cohento askinGQwhether he’s the greatest live act in music right now, or Vampire Weekend, who are capping their own improvisational sets withcovers requestedby the audience. Covers are obviously great bait for nostalgic dads, and so are extended jams, especially now that so many of us have been conditioned (or reconditioned) by the decade of Dead & Company tours with John Mayer that culminated in this year’s dad-stination Sphere shows. And yes, my dad circle is reading Grayson Haver Currin’s series of definitiveGQprofiles of bands likePhishandKing Gizzard and the Lizard Wizardas well as his piece onLenderman(when they’re not checking Max Read’s newsletter formovie recommendations). But the rising wave of dad rock is one with a strong undercurrent of sadness that Simpson and Vampire Weekend lack. It has roots in country, roots that have branched through bands and songwriters—like Young, Wilco, David Berman, and Bill Callahan—who infuse their ache with noise and tape hiss. If he doesn’t have a wife-repeller voice, today’s dad rocker probably likes a feedback squall. And his wit is almost certainly bleak: Lenderman’s “Every day is a miracle / Not to mention a threat,” meet Friendship’s roommate diss “Something lurking in the dark / Ethan, what happened to your wife?” I say “his,” but another singer that I’d strongly recommend in the slightly acidic Americana vein is Hurray for the Riff Raff, whose terrific February single “Pyramid Scheme” includes the line “Everybody wants to play Billy the Kid / Nobody wants to be Calamity Jane.” I like how Niko Stratis, author ofThe Dad Rock That Made Me a Woman,defines what she calls her taxonomy of the sound: “A dad rock band or album or song or whatever is something that is teaching you something through failure or through some sort of circumstance that has left you with a scar,” she told Sadie Sartini Garner in arecent interviewforGQ.In her 2024Pitchforkprofileby Andy Cush, Katie Crutchfield referenced Jason Molina and Townes Van Zandt, two chroniclers of deep scars: “No one writes about death better than Jason Molina,” she says. “The first few times I heard [‘Hammer Down’], I couldn’t get through it without crying. I’m like, this is so self-aware, this is a person who’s so sick, and he knows he is. And it’s so sad that he struggled like that. And I think Townes, it’s similar. Those guys flew so close to the sun. And maybe that’s why they were able to write this stuff that moves people so much. But I thank God every day that I caught myself before I got to that point.” If Stratis finds lessons in dad rock and Crutchfield sees who she could have become in Molina and Van Zandt, dads like me are just listening to what the kids are up to these days. It is not always pretty. But when your six-year-old is chiming in with Jake Lenderman to singAwooo / Bark at the moon!, it is pretty sweet.",

    "title": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander’s 2025 NBA Playoffs Fits, Definitively Ranked",
    "article_text": "Years before Shai Gilgeous-Alexander earned his first MVP, he bagged a far more prestigious award:GQ’s Most Stylish Man of 2022. SGA’s been theNBA’s preeminent fit god for a minute now, regularlytopping lists of the best-dressed athletes in the league. When it comes to dressing for the playoffs—and all the extra eyes and cameras that come with them—he’s long stuck to a tried and true adage the most successful athletes swear by: If you stay ready, you don’t have to get ready. Which is to say, if you’re already the best-dressed dude in the league, when it comes time for the postseason, all you have to do is keep doing your thing. And this year, that’s exactly what he’s done—SGA’s playoff heat has been impeccable on and off the court, with his Oklahoma City Thunder steamrolling their way to the franchise’s first NBA Finals appearance since 2012. With theseries kicking off tonight between OKC and the Indiana Pacers, we’ve crunched the numbers and settled on a definitive ranking of SGA’s 2025 playoff fits. Keep checking back in for further updates as the Finals progress. Listen, even Michael Jordan had an airball or two in his day. Not a bad fit by any means, but a white hoodie andwhite jeansis a safe play from one of the most reliable risk-takers in the NBA. The proportions here are killer, but this knit hoodie/jean combo just doesn’t have the SGA pizzazz we’ve come to expect. Realtree camostarts to get into the bold territory Shai tends to thrive in. A totally solid entry in his run of playoff fits, but not even the best instance of camo on this list. We’re getting to the point on the list where the fits are pretty undeniable and there’s really only nitpicking that separates them. Thevintage vibeon this one is top tier and Shai wears it well, but he’s been sticking with his upcomingConverse Shai 001with most of these fits, and the new-school shoe doesn’t quite mesh with the old-school look. This right here?Thisis how you wear camo. Shai’s sleeveless fits are always among the best in his arsenal, and this one comes with the added bonus of a dope pair of slouchydouble-knee pants. Basically every piece of this is interesting on its own—the pattern of the sweater, the big zipper, the stitching on the jeans, the cool, drapey coat. Elite work from an elite player. Speaking of elite pattern mixing: snakeskin over the cable-knit. His mind! Canada’s finest knows how to wear the hell out of aCanadian tuxedo(or two—more on that later). This is the sort of effortless swag that almost every player in the league is aspiring to when they get dressed for a tunnel walk. For Shai, it’s just business as usual. If I (33, bad knee, mostly good for threes and hustle) were about to go out and ruin the hopes and dreams of an NBA franchise, this is what I would wear to do it. Is it kind of yassfiiedThe Matrix-core? Yeah. Does it still work? Somehow, yes. That’s the magic of Shai. For a guy best known for audacious and off-kilter designer pieces, Shai has a deeply enviableworkwear lineup. Maybe it’d get a little stale if he wore such classic gear before every game, but it’s a major stunt when incorporated into his otherwise out-there playoff attire. Bro. Bro, please. Bro, my girl is watching this game, please, bro. Art. Pure art. A crispselvedge indigoCanadian tux, Realtree camo gloves, the Shai 001 in Timbs-adjacent buckwheat. His finest hour in a postseason of incredible tunnel fits.",

    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Noah has long been a reliable source of '90s skater vibes and old-money style. But recently it’s also become known as one-half of the duo behindone of the most coveted watches $200 can buy. If, that is, you managed to cop it in time. The watch in question was last June’s Noah x Timex Sun and Moon Watch, a gold-tonedTank-style tickerwith a sun and moon display and a black faux-croc strap that sold out in a matter of minutes, earning it the title of theHottest Affordable Watch of the Year(and a subsequentreboot.) Fortunately for the many folks who missed out on that drop, the new Noah x Timex Lighthouse Watch offers a similarly enticing proposition. With its croco pattern leather strap, slim gold-tone case, and a dial printed with a charcoal drawing of a lighthouse, the Noah x Timex Lighthouse Watch sits alongside the brand’sgraphic teesandseersucker suitsin the Venn diagram of repentant-skate-rat prep. Timex x Noah Noah Like the brand’s previous Timex collab, it also riffs on one of the most iconic watch silhouettes of the 20th century. As the Noah x Timex Sun and Moon Watch did with the Cartier Tank, the Noah x Timex Lighthouse Watch pays subtle homage to thePatek Philippe Golden Ellipse, whose rounded case and barely-there hands have been a part of the Swiss watchmaker’s catalog since the 1960s. For Noah designer Brendon Babenzien, who founded the label with his wife, Estelle Bailey-Babenzien and now alsooversees J.Crew's menswear, the new watch is less about paying homage to an icon of luxury watchmaking and more about evoking the feel of his hometown on Long Island. “​I grew up not far from the Fire Island Lighthouse, and it was always in the backdrop of my life, so I want[ed] a lighthouse on the watch,” he explains. It’s also the first Noah watch Babenzien plans to cop for himself. “I'm not a big-time watch guy. I'm not, like,anti-watch, but I just never really got into watches the way others have,” he says. “But this is the one I'm going to wear.” Other fans ofbudget-friendly watcheswith impeccable menswear credentials should consider doing the same. The Noah x Timex Lighthouse watch isavailable for pre-orderfrom June 5th through June 12th. For more timely ticker recommendations, check out theGQ Watch Shop.",

    "title": "NBA Finals Preview: Pacers-Thunder May Not Be a Long Series, But It Will be Entertaining",
    "article_text": "Trying to score on theOklahoma City Thunder’s defensecan be like trying to ram a feather through a brick wall. Trying to contain theIndiana Pacers’ offenseis similar to catching a gust of wind with an old sock. Both can border on impossible, and you need the right personnel to achieve either dream, which is what will make the 2025 NBA Finals such an alluring watch. Please, for the love of basketball, spare us all your thoughts about the geographic locations of each team somehow being a detriment. While it is true that a coterie of expensive suits in Midtown Manhattan wanted, for rating purposes, something a little glitzier than Oklahoma City-Indianapolis—the 20th and 16thmost-populous cities in the US—you, dear reader, are not theNational Basketball Association. You are a person. And if you’re a fan of pedal-to-the-metal hoops, you should be excited about this series. In boxing, they say that styles make fights. If these upcoming games were taking place in the ring, the canvas would resemble a Jackson Pollock painting. Among teams who have played at least 10 games this postseason, the Thunder and Pacers are the two whoplay at the fastest pace. These teams—and, blessedly, their young legs—love to run, which makes for some of the most entertaining basketball there is. The antidote to the attention span crisis is an OKC-Indy matchup, because they won’t leave any time to take your eyes off the screen. If thereisany time during the Finals to quickly check your phone or, I don’t know, engage with your loved ones, it’ll be whenShai Gilgeous-Alexanderis at the free throw line. Because believe me, he will be a frequent attendee. SGA—the principal player in the series, and maybe, at least in the vacuum of this particular season, the entire league—has averaged 9.2 foul shots per game during the Thunder’s playoff run. The measured take is that in order to be the type of heavyweight he wants to be, Gilgeous-Alexanderhasto draw these whistles. His style of play utilizes an endless supply of yo-yoing drives to the rim, the type that gets a player scratched and clawed with so much regularity that you could argue a foul happens more often than not. It’s just on the referee to call them. The extremist, most-irritating-guy-at-the-bar take is that Shai is an indefensible foul baiter and free throw merchant who should be ashamed of his every dribble. These are all things loudly crowed by people who are willingly missing the forest for the trees. Getting to the line is a necessary part ofany MVP’s game, and just because he gets a handful of ticky tack fouls every quarter doesn’t mean that Gilgeous-Alexander is a grifter who’s in bed with the officials. It means he understands his role—which, at the moment, is to be the brightest player on the NBA’s brightest stage. On a wider level, the free throw conversation is the odds-on favorite to be the dominant topic of these Finals. It’s nice to have a monocultural sports thing! “Does Shai need to kick his flopping addiction?” is something you can discuss with a rando at the grocery store, your grandparents, or your friend’s kid in equal aptitude. That’s what these tentpole sporting events are all about, after all: grasping onto that increasingly fleeting feeling that we’re all watching the same thing and analyzing it in similar ways. Speaking of which, get ready to hear all about the Pacers’ three-point shooting, especially if they go cold in Oklahoma and drop the first two games,orcatch a hot streak and steal one of them. Indiana owns the best three-point percentage and offensive rating of any team that logged at least 10 playoff games, and every member of their starting lineup is more than qualified from deep. Sweet shooting—particularly the way the Pacers do it, which is often the product of swinging ball movement that gets someone wide open—is one of the more pleasurable things to watch on a basketball court. Don’t expect Aaron Nesmith to connect on 53% of his threes like he did in theEastern Conference Finals against the Knicks. But that barrage, plus Conference Final MVP Pascal Siakam knocking in half of his attempts, and mustachioed role player Ben Sheppard draining 55%,does prove that Indiana is capable of snapping the nets. Lightning can strike twice, and when it does, it’s a powerful way to counteract the Thunder. (By the way, Tyrese Haliburton shot uncharacteristically poorly against New York. Some positive regression to the mean is almost surely coming his way.) So, we’ve got green, energetic, fresh faces going at it for a championship—prepare yourself for the first firmlyGen ZFinals MVP, by the way—but we’ve also got some guys who’ve been around the block. The oldest player on the Thunder, a team so complete that they can’t possibly be this young, is 31-year-old icon Alex Caruso. He is, without question, one of the more annoying players in the NBA. What I mean by that is that playing against Alex Caruso looks about as enjoyable as wrestling in a pit of quicksand. With his pestilent defense and non-stop freneticism, Caruso shadows opposing ballhandlers better than almost anyone. While the task of guarding Haliburton will mostly fall to fellow defensive stopper Luguentz Dort, there will undoubtedly be some instances where Caruso is summoned off the bench with the sole directive of pissing Haliburton off. Like Caruso, the Pacers have a player in their second unit who I imagine would be flattered by the “annoying” label. T.J. McConnell—the lazy fan would call him a gym rat, a scrappy veteran, or ashameless instigator; the educated ball knower would call himEdie Falco’s biggest opp—is playing in his first NBA Finals after 10 full years of trying. Undrafted like Caruso, and about four inches shorter, McConnell has never met a challenge he didn’t relish. Remember in the 2015 Finals, when little guy legendMatthew Dellavedova had to be hospitalized for severe cramping, needing an IV after chasing Steph Curry around? If McConnell senses a chance to disrupt Gilgeous-Alexander all the way to a monumental upset, don’t be surprised if the Pacers install a drip bag for him right there on the bench. We could go on and on about the secondary and tertiary elements that will make this series compelling for both casuals and basketball nerds alike. The fact that the league will crown its seventh different champion in the last seven years is very cool in its own right, as is the chance for both franchises to earn their first ring. (I don’t care what the NBA’s official stance on this is, the Seattle SuperSonics’ 1979 championship doesnotcount for Oklahoma City.) A win for the Thunder will validate their player development prowess. Jalen Williams—a first-time All-Star and extremely ripe second banana to Gilgeous-Alexander—is all of 24 years old.Avid reader Chet Holmgrenis 23. Rotation players Jaylin Williams and Cason Wallace are 22 and 21, respectively. Oklahoma City is the only organization all four of them have ever known, and bringing home a title this soon would leave no doubt as to which team is getting the most out of its puppies. In the other corner, watchingMyles Turnerraise a banner after a decade of steady, quietly productive grinding in Indiana would be truly touching. The Pacers can’t claim the same style of draft-picks-to-diamonds construction that got Oklahoma City to the top, but their front office’s extremely shrewd trades for Haliburton, Siakam, and Nesmith also deserve a whole acre of flowers. The head coaches’ 25-year age gap (Indiana’s Rick Carlisle, boomer, bald; Oklahoma City’s Mark Daigneault, millennial, coiffed) makes for a fun aesthetic wrinkle as well. And we haven’t even talked about the omnipresent “Yes ‘Cers” shirts! Should you feel inclined to bet on this series—and, I say this grimly, statistically speaking I know a lot of you will—I’d advise you to pick OKC ten out of ten times. They were the best team in the regular season, have remained the best team in the playoffs, and have the luxury of the best player in the Finals being on their roster. It’s likely that they’ll make quick work of the Pacers, but that shouldn’t damage the entertainment value of each individual contest. Either way, when all is said and done, a city in what many would consider a flyover state will be hosting its first NBAchampionship parade. You can complain about that city not being in a large enough media market to truly stimulate the sports economy (like a mark), or you can sit back and watch a bunch of high-level games that will conceivably end in the 120s, ushering in a new tide of basketball supremacy. Call it whatever you want—just don’t call it boring.",

According to the newspaper, Harry and Meghan applied for British passports for their children, which were so delayed that the couple’s lawyers sent a letter expressing a desire to request access to the information under the terms of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a data protection law. Days after the letter was sent,The Guardianreports, the UK government issued passports for Archie and Lili. \"There was clear reluctance to issue passports for the kids,” a source close to Meghan and Harry told the newspaper. \"The king hadn’t wanted Archie and Lili to carry the titles, most of all the HRH, and the British passports, once created, would be the first and perhaps the only legal proof of their names.” A spokesperson for the couple toldVanity Fair,“We do not comment on private issues pertaining to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s children.” The behind-the-scenes discussions about the Sussex children and the complicated subject of their legal names has been in the news recently after theMail on Sunday’sRichard Edenreportedthat the couple once considered changing their legal names to “Spencer,” the maiden name of Princess Diana.VFunderstands that Prince Harry once spoke to his maternal uncleCharles Spencerabout the family name but did not pursue a legal name change. “He’s now closer to his mother’s family than his immediate family,” a source close to the family toldVF. “At one point Harry mooted the idea of taking the Spencer name, but rejected it because he knew it would be way too controversial and yet another legal headache.” Spencer has been a source of support for Harry during the last few years. “Harry is very close to his maternal side of the family, and in all of this his uncle Earl Spencer has been a shoulder to cry on,” the source added. “Harry has stayed with his uncle when he’s been over in the UK and is always invited to join the Spencers for Christmas.” An Exclusive First Look atWicked: For Good The Dizzying Rise of MAHA WarriorCalley Means, RFK Jr.’s Right-Hand Man The UnsinkableKathy Bates From RFK Jr. to Patrick Schwarzenegger, a Brief Guide tothe Kennedy Family All theCast MembersThat Might LeaveSNLThis Fall Rick Steveson Rejecting Fascism at Home and Fears of Trump Abroad Mariska Hargitay Was “Living a Lie” for 30 Years.

    "article_text": "Donald TrumpandElon Muskhave gone from happily using each other for mutual benefit to openly slagging each other off in public. Yes, it is a complete and total shock that the relationship between these two extremely well-adjusted, deeply altruistic, entirely compos mentis individuals has broken down, possibly for good. On Thursday, Musk took to social media to go scorched-earth on the president in a series of escalating posts that caused shares ofTesla to plungeand, as of this writing, included this claim: This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. Musk preceded that accusation by calling Trump a literal ingrate,writing, “Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate. Such ingratitude.” Those comments were undoubtedly inspired by Oval Officeremarksin which the president shared that he was “very disappointed in Elon,” whom he said he “helped…a lot.” That disappointment stemmed from Musk’s public declaration on Tuesday that Trump’s spending bill was a “disgusting abomination.” How did it come to this? After all, it wasn’t so long ago that these two werebasically roommatesand/orfather and son. Theyheld rallies together. They performedinfomercialsin front of the White House.

    "title": "Who Will Win at the 2025 Tony Awards?",
    "article_text": "The 78th Tony Awards ceremony will take place on Sunday, June 8, honoring the best and brightest of the 2024-2025 Broadway season. It’s been a wild and woolly year on the Great White Way, dominated bymovie-star-laden, but otherwise lackluster, productionsof classics old and new (Othello,Glengarry Glen Ross), as well as buzzy musical transfers (Sunset Blvd.) and revivals (Gypsy). Money has been made, stars have been born, and a few scrappy upstarts (Oh, Mary!,Maybe Happy Ending) have managed to break through the noise. So, who will receive a shiny trophy for their theatrical troubles on Sunday? On this week’sLittle Gold Menpodcast, cohostRichard Lawsonassembles a panel of Broadway experts—Vanity Fair’sChris Murphy,Vulturetheater criticJackson McHenry,and entertainment writerEsther Zuckerman—to break down the major categories and make some semi-confident predictions. Perhaps the biggest title bout of the evening will be found—as it often is—in the lead actress in a musical category, wheresix-time Tony winnerAudra McDonaldwill stare down former Pussycat Doll turnedlauded stage performerNicole Scherzinger. McDonald’s long awaited turn inGypsyhas been ballyhooed by some, pooh-poohed by others. Scherzinger has received near unanimous praise for her cracked, decidedly modern version of Norma Desmond inSunset Blvd., but her campaign could be marred by some offstage controversy involving a red hat. We’re giving the narrowest of edges to Scherzinger, but one should never count out Audra McDonald. If she wins, she will break her own record as the most Tony-awarded actor of all time. Our panelists were all in agreement that the brilliantCole Escolashouldwin best lead actor in a play for their delightfully gonzo turn as a delightfully gonzo Mary Todd Lincoln inOh, Mary!But it’s possible that Escola—a Brooklyn alt-comedy legend finally enjoying mainstream success—could lose out to a big name likeGeorge Clooney,whoseGood Night, and Good Luckwas respectfully received when it opened this spring. (The same cannot be said forClooney’s dye job.) The Tonys have long found it difficult to resist giving big celebrities awards—though that tide has turned some of late, a fact perhaps best evidenced this year by the absence ofOthellostarDenzel Washingtonon the nominees list. Another young upstart is challenging some high-profile names in the lead actor in a musical category.Tom Francis,the 20-something British hunk who commandingly leadsSunset Blvd., is squaring off against Emmy winnerDarren Criss(who plays a lovelorn robot inMaybe Happy Ending) and Broadway royaltyJonathan Groff(who plays Bobby Darin inJust In Time). We suspect one of the flashier names will prevail over Francis—Groff could quite possibly repeat his win from last year—though we think Escola will beat Mr. Clooney.Oh, Mary!is one of the sensations of the season, embodying the kind of downtown-to-Midtown Cinderella narrative the Tony voters love. You can hear the case for those predictions and more on this week’s episode, along with some commentary on the merit (or lack thereof) of theStranger Thingsplay, a debate about new musicalDead Outlaw, and some passion picks for who should win in the featured actor categories. Happy Tonys season to those who celebrate! Which is to say, happy Pride.

In the wake of thenewssurrounding Jean-Pierre’s defection, and her claims about the Democratic Party inIndependent: A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines,more than two dozen former Biden administration officials took to Axios togripeabout the ex–press secretary. One former White House official raged that Jean-Pierre is positioning herself “as an outsider when [she] not only...enjoyed the perks of extreme proximity to power” and “the name recognition needed to sell books off your name,” saying, “It’s difficult to see how this is anything but a bizarre cash grab.” Another told the outlet that Jean-Pierre was “one of the most ineffectual and unprepared people I’ve ever worked with,” claiming, “She didn’t know how to manage a team, didn’t know how to shape or deliver a message, and often created more problems than she solved.” Yet another claimed, “The amount of time that was spent coddling [Jean-Pierre] and appeasing her was astronomical compared to our attention on actual matters of substance.” Jean-Pierre did not respond to Axios’s requests for comment. Jean-Pierre did not immediately respond toVanity Fair’s request for comment. Last February at the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics, Jean-Pierresaidthat the “toughest thing“ to witness in the three weeks between Biden’s disastrous debate performance and his announcement that he was dropping out of the race was the Democratic “firing squad.” “I had never seen a party do that in the way that they did, and it was hurtful and sad to see that happening—a firing squad around a person who I believed was a true patriot,” she said. In a press release announcing her book, which will be published in October, Jean-Pierrewrote: “Until January 20, I was responsible for speaking on behalf of the President of the United States. At noon on that day, I became a private citizen who, like all Americans and many of our allies around the world, had to contend with what was to come next for our country. I determined that the danger we face as a country requires freeing ourselves of boxes. We need to be willing to exercise the ability to think creatively and plan strategically. We need to be clear-eyed and questioning, rather than blindly loyal and obedient as we may have been in the past.” Jean-Pierre does not appear to have commented on the criticism from her former colleagues, but it’s safe to say she may not be appearing at Biden staffer reunions any time soon.

    "title": "Stephen Miller Is Escalating His Immigration Crackdown With a New Travel Ban",
    "article_text": "Donald Trump’s mass deportation effort has beenlagging behind his goal. His vice president,JD Vance, at one pointforecast a million deportations a year this term; the administration hasn’t only been well behind that lofty number—they’ve struggled to keep pace with removals last year, whenJoe Bidenwas still president, and have called on migrants to “self-deport” to help boost their stats. That’s been a point of frustration forStephen Miller, the administration’s resident anti-immigration zealot. Unsatisfied with the pace of deportations thus far, he has demanded recently that Immigrations and Customs Enforcement make no fewer than 3,000 arrests a day—and threatened to fire officials who hold them back from meeting that quota. They haven’t quite hit that, but ICE this week recorded itsmost detentions in a single day, according to NBC News, arresting more than 2,200 people Tuesday—the result, it seems, of more aggressive tactics by authorities. Indeed, in recent days, there have beenreportsacross the country of migrants enrolled in alternative to detention programs being arrested after appearing at ICE offices for check-ins. In one instance, on Wednesday,at least 10 were arrestedin downtown Chicago, apparently after receiving text messages instructing them to check in with ICE; in a chaotic scene, masked agents loaded detainees into vans as community members, and elected officials, protested. “They’re kidnapping people,” Chicago aldermanByron Sigcho-LopeztoldWGN News. The Trump administration has insisted, throughout its shock and awe immigration program this year, that it is targeting criminals—the “worst of the worst,” as Homeland Security SecretaryKristi Noemputs it. But it is obviously going much farther than that, as the arrests at ICE check-ins underscore: These were people apparently following the directions—showing up to appearances, as they were told—and they were arrested for it. “The Trump Administration does not care if you are complying with the law because they do not respect the rule of law,” Illinois RepresentativeDelia Ramirez, who called for Noem’s resignation,wroteWednesday. “They do not care if you have constitutional rights because they do not respect the Constitution.” “They only care about the arbitrary deportation quotas set by [Stephen] Miller,” Ramirez added. In seeking to meet those quotas, the administration may be making Americans less safe: It hasdiverted resources and personnelaway from federal law enforcement toward arresting undocumented immigrants, and effectively discouraged migrants from appearing in court or at check-ins out of fear of being arrested. The escalation comes after Trump officials directed immigration authorities to “turn the creative knob up to 11” and “push the envelope,” as the Guardianreported: “If it involves handcuffs on wrists,” one official said, “it’s probably worth pursuing.” It also came as Trumpissued a new travel banWednesday evening, restricting nationals from 12 countries—Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen—from entering the United States. “We don’t want them,” Trumpsaidin a video announcing the ban. Trump cited the attack on Jewish demonstrators in Boulder, Colorado, as he announced the executive order. But the alleged attacker—Mohamed Sabry Soliman—is a national of Egypt, which was not included in the new ban.

    "title": "Tom Hanks, Bursting with Pride, Supports His Daughter’s Raw, Revealing Memoir",
    "article_text": "More than one person, surely, has looked atTom Hanksand thought, “Oh yeah, Father’s Day is just around the corner, I better make sure to send a card.” His recent remarks about his actual daughterE.A. Hanks’recent memoir,The 10: A Memoir of Family and the Open Road, are peak sweet dad stuff, even while discussing the book’s sometimes difficult subject matter. In the book, E.A., now 43, describes physical and emotional abuse from her mother, Samantha Lewes, after she and Tom divorced in 1987 shortly before she turned 5. After the split, Lewes got primary custody of E.A. and older brotherColin Hanksin Sacramento. In the book, E.A. describes her life from the ages of 5 to 14, when in the aftermath of emotional abuse turning physical and she moved to Los Angeles to live with her father, as “years filled with confusion, violence, deprivation, and love,” with a mother who had undiagnosed mental health issues and an ongoing struggle with addiction. Lewes died of cancer in 2002. Tom was an early reader of his daughter’s memoir, hetoldAccess Hollywoodlate last month on the red carpet of hislatest film,The Phoenician Scheme, and was bursting with fatherly pride for his only daughter. (He has two more sons,TrumanandChet, withRita Wilson, half-brothers to E.A. and Colin.) “It’s a pride because she shares it with me, she’s very open about what the process is,” he said of his daughter’s writing, which she toldVanity Fairwas inspired partly by reading her mother’s old diaries that she found in storage. “She’s a knockout, always has been,” Tom said. “As a dad—if you’ve had kids, you realize that you see who they are when they’re about 6 weeks old. Their personality is there. Their temper, the way they see the world is demonstrated in their body language and on their face.” And what he saw then holds true now, he said: “I’m not surprised that my daughter had the wherewithal as well as the curiosity as well as the—I’m gonna say perhaps the kind ofshoot herself in the footwherewithal—to examine this thing that I think she was incredibly honest about. One is that we all come from checkered, cracked lives, all of us.” Both E.A. and her father point out that despite having what Tom calls a “copyrighted last name,” she knew struggle spending her childhood in her mother’s home, and what it felt like to be both inside and outside of the glow of the spotlight on her father as his public profile rose. E.A., aVanity FairandNew York Timescontributor,toldVFin a recent interviewthat “I wasn’t born on third base, but we moved there in the ’90s. No matter how difficult my childhood with my mother was, the material reality is that I don’t have student loans. That’s how the privilege really does its magic: it sets you up with the right schools, the right jobs, the safety net. It opens all the doors, but the nuance is that it doesn’t keep them open.” She described her father’s fame as somewhat “catastrophic” in its effect on her mother, who also acted but never found widespread recognition. “She felt that his stature in the world obliterated her and any chance she had at continuing her stage career,” she toldVF. “The uncomfortable truth, and there’s a lot of them in this book, is she didn’t really have a career, and her ex-husband becomingthe Tom Hankswas more insult to injury than significant impediment.” Tom, who celebrated the book's April release with a ticketed publication day conversation with her at 92Y in New York City, praised his daughter for her embrace of these difficult nuances and examinations of privilege and jealousy, among other thorny issues that come with examining one’s family and childhood. “She leans into everything of it, and I think that anybody who does that is a bold, journalistic, literate mind,” he said, “and I’m just thrilled that I can say this about my daughter.” The admiration is mutual. As E.A. toldVF, “From the outset, he has supportedThe 10. Whether it was swapping cars with me, helping me pick out camping gear, or being the first reader. The conversation we had once he had read a very early draft was exactly what I needed to hear, which was that I had depicted my mother accurately.

    "title": "The Black Republican Mafia Is the DC Group Chat Everyone Wants to Join",
    "article_text": "On a rainy morning in May, 26-year-oldEmery Washington,a deputy press secretary in the US Department of Energy, turns onSoulja Boyand skims through the messages in her group chat, the Black Republican Mafia, the text thread of cool kids in the Trump administration—all in their 20s with a visible presence in the conservative scene. On any day, conversation can veer fromJasmine CrocketttoChris Brown’s mug shot, to the latest gossip on the Hill. And, unlike the older run Republican Party group chats, there is absolutely no way anyone’s getting added by accident. Washington puts on cowboy boots and feeds her dogs, Frankie and Biggie. With a mocha in hand, she gets in her car and drives to downtown DC, her phone buzzing incessantly with chatter; eventually she’ll have to mute it because it simply gets to be “too much.” “We are the official MAGA ambassadors to the Black community here in DC,”CJ Pearson,a 22-year-old youth advisor for the RNC who also belongs to the group, tells me. The other members areChristian Newton,the 23-year-old chief of staff at the Department of Energy’s Office of Science,Erik Conyers,a 25-year-old Trump fundraiser and event planner, andJaniyah Thomas,who ran Black media for the president during his 2024 campaign. “They represent the future of Trump’s transformational ‘America First’ legacy within the Republican Party and are the MAGA standard-bearers of what was originally considered a one-time, extremist political movement but is now the proud and loud political majority of this country,”Lynne Patton,the director of minority outreach at the White House tells me. The friends met on the campaign trail and bonded over what they felt was a lack of Black staffers. Thomas says the group bonded partly because of how ostracized they felt by their friends and families for being young, Black, and conservative. Conyers grew up in a Democratic household in Virginia and went through the Senate Page Program whenBarack Obamawas in the White House—the only Black page in his cohort. “Everyone wanted me to be a Democrat,” Conyers said. “My family wanted that, but I knew that there were things that I didn’t agree with.” Conyers maintains relationships with family and friends from back home, but not without some pushback. “They think I’m crazy, but they still support me,” he told me over the phone. “We know what parameters we should and shouldn’t discuss.” Now that it may be seen as trendy to be a conservative in America, they no longer feel self-conscious about their political beliefs. But the group didn’t get its name until February, when someone approached them at a party and said, “You know what we call you guys behind your back? The Black Republican Mafia,” Conyers tells me. They decided it was the perfect moniker. The mafia have become an emblem of a new era of young conservatism: one that is brash, ambitious, and loves to party. The group is part of a trend in the 2024 election, whenAmericansbetween 18 and 29shifted favorablytoward the Republican Party—although, according to analysis by Tufts University’s Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement(CIRCLE),their attitudes and interests diverged from older conservatives on issues like climate change, abortion, and immigration. At the same time, support for Democratsdecreasedamong young Black voters. In 2024, they voted forKamala Harrisby a 50-point margin,down from 2020, when Black youth supportedJoe Bidenby a 77-point margin, according to surveying by the Associated Press. CIRCLE researchers observed that “among the Black electorate, young voters gave President Trump the highest support compared to other age groups, continuing a 2020 shift in which Black voters under the age of 45 started switching their preference.” When I asked why Trump’s second term has been particularly welcoming to this group, they say that the president is willing to engage with and listen to the younger people he employs, that he is transparent about what he is doing in government and shares everything on social media, and that they don’t have to shrink themselves or change to fit in with his administration. “The fact that there are young conservatives like us that are so involved and spearheading a lot of the efforts to support President Trump, and support his agenda, really, I think is super special,” Newton says. “We have hired more political appointees and at a quicker rate than any administration ever has…. It shows that the president is committed to making sure we get stuff going.” Pearson first met Trump at Mar-a-Lago in 2022; he recalled him being “passionately enthusiastic” about young people playing a bigger role in the party. He has a photograph with the president pinned on his Instagram page. Despite Trump’s campaignagainst DEIpolicies orrollback of civil rights protections,some members of the group say they don’t see his comments or actions as racist. “The president eliminating DEI is not racist, because none of my friends needed DEI to get to where they are,” Pearson says. “From what I’ve seen from the president, every interaction that I’ve had with him, and also going back to his record, this is a president who has, time and again, delivered for the Black community.” When the group goes out, it’s usually to DC’s latest members club, The Ned, Joe’s Seafood, Prime Steak and Stone Crab next to the White House, or The Park at 14th for Sunday lunch. Erik Conyers loves gossip and a French 75, and can recite the rest of the group's go-to drink orders by heart. For CJ, it’s a whisky sour, Emery, a vodka soda, Janiya loves a prosecco, and Christian, a vodka soda with lime. Once, when someone approached Conyers and asked if they could potentially join the group, his response was, “There’s really nothing you can do.” Another person has reportedly asked five times. For now, the group chat shows no sign of growing, but if they were to admit a new member, they say it would beXaviaer DuRousseau,a 28-year-old conservative social media star based in Los Angeles. DuRousseau is a “friend of the group,” says Pearson, but he would have to live in DC for the invite to be formally extended.

    "title": "Trump Thinks Autopen Is Only Bad When Biden Does It",
    "article_text": "In the latest turn in the ongoing revenge fantasy that isDonald Trump’ssecond administration, on Wednesday the presidentissued a memorandum, instructing the Department of Justice to investigatePresident Biden’s use of the autopen. The tool is basically a tiny printer programmed to reproduce a signature via a robotic arm holding a pen. It’s used widely in government anddates backto the days ofThomas Jefferson.Even Trump has repeatedly used it himself. But the memo instructs the White House counsel, as well as the attorney general, to investigate “whether certain individuals conspired to deceive the public about Biden’s mental state and unconstitutionally exercise the authorities and responsibilities of the President.” It specifically orders them to investigate which documents—from executive orders to clemency grants—were signed with an autopen under Biden. These investigations would, presumably, serve as precursors to trying to invalidate those policies and pardons. Andthatwould be a precursor to lifting, among other things, the pardons Biden granted to his family and members of the House Select Committee that investigated the January 6th attack. At least, that’s how Trump sees it. “The ‘Pardons’ that Sleepy Joe Biden gave to the Unselect Committee of Political Thugs, and many others, are hereby declared VOID, VACANT, AND OF NO FURTHER FORCE OR EFFECT, because of the fact that they were done by Autopen,”he wroteon Truth Social in March. The problem is most legal scholars (that is, most scholars who don’t work for the Heritage Foundation wherethese ideas first started kicking around) say that not only is there no way to undo a pardon, but there’s no requirement that pardons even be signed. “The argument that the pardon fails because it was signed by an autopen fails at the get-go,”Jay Wexler, a professor of constitutional law at Boston University School of Law,recently toldNPR. In fact, during theGeorge W. Bushadministration, the Department of Justice alsolaid out a truly tediously detailed legal argumentfor why the autopen is an acceptable form of presidential signature. Ina statement to news outletsWednesday, Biden said, “Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations. Any suggestion that I didn’t is ridiculous and false.” To Trump the one true power is the power of the presidential pen. The only way he can see to invalidate what Biden did with that power is to claim it wasn’t actually him wielding it at all. Even if the legal argument fails, simply harassing his political enemies is half the battle.

    "article_text": "Late last month, Oscar winnerZoe Saldañawas a guest of honor, alongsideAlexander Skarsgård,Deepika Padukone, andAnna Sawai, as Cartier presented its new high jewelry collection, En Équilibre, at the Artipelag cultural center in Stockholm. The new collection includes necklaces, earrings, and rings whose precious charm references the balance between symmetries and asymmetries, the harmony between empty and full spaces, and the play of colors inspired, as always for the maison, by the imperfect perfection of nature. As true balance requires, the search for essentiality, precision, and a certain rigor is certainly not at the expense of inspiration, imagination and wonder. In short, this is a collection in which the dear old principle of opposites attracting each other takes on a new and full meaning. Opposites such as gentleness and stubbornness, strength and being delicate, determination and sensitivity, which are characteristic of Saldaña in her acting career. Vanity Fair spoke with Saldaña about her Oscar win, her relationship to jewelry and her greatest gift. Photo courtesy Cartier. Vanity Fair: How would you define your relationship to jewelry? Zoe Saldaña:I feel that my relationship with jewelry is intensifying as I grow up, because I can appreciate it in a deeper and deeper way: it's a kind of rediscovery of how precious it is to own a timeless piece that you can share with your family and pass down from generation to generation. Thanks to Cartier, I am having a unique experience in the world of jewelry, from buying the stones to the design to the craftsmanship by which they are made. It is simply wonderful. Photo courtesy Cartier. Do you feel attuned with this particular collection, En Équilibre? I feel an affinity with all Cartier pieces, because I love the harmony of inspiration that this fashion house has always drawn from nature, flora and fauna, which it has redesigned and reinvented to create these pieces that are simply beautiful. So even if I'm wearing something that I know was made by a man or a woman, I feel like it's a natural element. It's a strange emotion to describe. What is your greatest gift, or quality, as an actress and as a human being? I'm a very dedicated person. I take great pride in always giving 150 percent of myself, because when I give less, I feel very disappointed. I can be very, very hard on myself. I'm also learning to appreciate more what I do, and that's a process just by accepting that I'm human. I give it my all, in short, and I try to be grateful for the experience I am having. As a person, however, I am very loyal. Do you think thatwinning an Oscarwill have an impact on your career and your choices for the future, one way or another? You know, usually awards like this affect an actor's career for the better. At my age, after all the years I've spent doing this work, if there's one big lesson I've learned from this award is that it has been able to rekindle that spark in me that for some reason I thought I didn't need to have anymore. And that spark allows me, as a woman, to continue to strive to grow and age gracefully. I think it is as if a ticking clock looms over us women, marking time that passes quickly, a clock that has been imposed on us by others. Reminding myself that this is a job I can do until the end of my days is really rewarding. Anna Sawai. Photo courtesy Cartier. Alexander Skarsgård. Photo courtesy Cartier. In your speech at the Oscars you thanked your family, both your parents and the one you have built with your husband Marco, who is Italian. How has your family influenced you? It's about life, simply: the one that my family of origin gave me, and the one that I have now formed with my husband, it's a life that we continue to build together. It is the greatest gift: the fact that I can live a full life every day, full of people of whom I always, every moment, strive to be worthy. What is your favorite city in Italy? I really like Lake Garda, because that is where my husband is from. But I've also come to really appreciate Liguria, the whole region: the Italian Riviera for me is the place where the climate is just perfect, it's never too cold or too hot. The water is delicious. And the food: incredible. Photo courtesy Cartier. As a mother of three boys, what values or lessons are you passing on to them about women? I think the most important lesson we are passing on to our children is to continue to be curious about women. Right now our oldest children, the twins, are 10 years old, and our youngest is 8: I want them to understand very early on that there hasn't always been equality for women because, as you know, equality is something that women have fought for and must continue to fight for. I want my children if they see something wrong, an injustice, to say so. They are learning almost automatically to always support women and make them feel supported. The little one found out this year that in sports girls are treated differently than boys, they don't get paid as much as them even though they do everything the boys do, and he couldn't get over it. When my sons come out of their family environment, Italian and Latin, in which women are in charge of everything, and they see that in the world things are not the same, that sometimes women are not treated the same as men, they are not supported in the same way, they get very discouraged. I really appreciate the fact that they are curious about this, that they want to understand why these situations happen. All we can do as parents is answer their questions and teach them the history and the history of women.\" I would say you are very good parents. We are trying. We're not perfect, but we're not that bad either.

    "title": "Ayo Edebiri, Pedro Almodóvar, and More Celebrate the Loewe Foundation Craft Prize in Madrid",
    "article_text": "Late last month, the Loewe Foundation Craft Prize ceremony returned home to Madrid, Spain. During a cocktail and tapas hour in the Thyssen-Bornemisza National Museum’s courtyard, finalists and their guests mingled with the new creative directors of Loewe,Jack McColloughandLazaro Hernandez,and jury members includingFrida Escobedo,the architect, essayist, and visionary behind the new Tang Wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City; andAbraham Thomas,the curator of modern architecture, design, and decorative arts at The Met. Since its inception in 2016, the Loewe Foundation Craft Prize, which was envisioned by the brand’s former creative directorJonathan Anderson,has celebrated artistic merit and newness in modern craftsmanship. The label encourages anyone over 18 working in a craft-based profession to apply and compete for a prize of 50,000 euros, with two special mentions each receiving 25,000 euros. According to Loewe, a panel of experts decides upon the winner based on their “originality, clear artistic vision and merit, precise execution, material excellence, innovative value, and a distinct authorial mark.” A few famous friends of Loewe also made appearances at the award ceremony.Ayo Edebiri,Lesley Manville,andMurray Bartlettwere seen chatting among attendees, enjoying the perfect weather and awaiting the announcement of the winner. Elsewhere, filmmakerPedro Almodóvarwas seen sporting a fun pair of Loewe glasses while being escorted through the crowd and gesturing to those that expressed their love of his films. During the festivities, attendees were encouraged to step inside the Thyssen-Bornemisza National Museum to preview the 30 finalists’ creations. Many of the artisans proudly stood next to their work, answering questions about the processes they used and what inspired them to submit their pieces for the Loewe Foundation Craft Prize. Nifemi Marcus-Bello of Nigeria received a special mention for his piece titled “TM Bench with Bowl.\" As the ceremony began, guests quieted down and shifted their focus to the podium. One of the special mentions was presented toNifemi Marcus-Belloof Nigeria for his piece titled “TM Bench With Bowl.” During the private viewing, he said he initially didn’t understand why people gravitated toward his submission piece until he placed it in his own home. It was then he had his own aha moment. The second special mention was presented byMeg Ryanto StudioSumakshi Singhfrom India forher piece “Monument.”Singh used a thread made of copper and nylon on a water-soluble backing to create a reimagining of a 12th-century historic colonnade in the Qutab Minar complex in Delhi. Sheila Loeweand Almodóvar presented the night’s top award with a beautifully witty dance between Almodóvar’s Spanish and an English translation by Loewe. Almodóvar movingly stated that “the artists in the exhibition represent a continued need to remain curious. I urge you all to slow down and spend time with the works.” He then graciously announced the winner, Japanese sculptorKunimasa Aoki,for his piece “Realm of Living Things 19.” Aoki, who is also a high school design teacher in Japan, said his terra-cotta piece, which uses an ancestral technique that distorts the clay under pressure, said it took three months to complete. When accepting the award, Aoki thanked his fellow participants and said they gave him strength to do more work in the future. When asked what inspires him, Aoki joked that “I am very boring,” before revealing that he loves motorbikes as well as the filmsEasy RiderandMad Max. This story has been updated.

    "title": "Queen Máxima of the Netherlands Sparkles In Rubies Dating Back to 1888 During State Visit",
    "article_text": "On Wednesday evening, the President of the Czech Republic hosted a gala dinner forKing Willem-AlexanderandQueen Máximaof the Netherlands. For the occasion, Máxima wore a look by Dutch designerJan Taminiau, rewearing a one-sleeved batwing dress in dark red that she has worn in other important appointments. The silk dress features embroidered beading all around its edge. Queen Máxima and King Willem-Alexander The frock was the perfect companion to the Mellerio ruby set that the queen wore, almost in its entirety. With the exception of the brooch, the earrings and the bodice jewel, Máxima wore the three-pronged tiara, the choker and the diamond and ruby bracelet that complete this set, which was a gift from King William III to Queen consort Emma at Christmas 1888. The monarch commissioned the design from one of the most famous French jewelry firms of the time: Mellerio dits Meller. Queen Máxima The queen has worn the pieces on many occasions and for official portraits. She has chosen it for a number of weddings, birthdays and gala banquets, and it also seems to be special forPrincess Amalia, who wore the tiara last Aprilfor the first time in an official capacity. The portrait of that moment was published on the occasion of the 18th birthday of the princess, highlightingAmalia's love for tiaras. Queen Maxima completed her look with diamond and ruby flower-shaped earrings, another diamond bracelet and the metropolitan insignia handbag with golden crystals by Carolina Herrera. On Thursday, the Queen will continue her solo engagements in Prague before returning to the Netherlands at the end of the day. King Willem-Alexander has had to return a day earlier than planned after the unexpected collapse of the government this week.

    "title": "MSNBC’s Nicolle Wallace on Her New Podcast, Trump’s “Undemocratic” Antics, and How the GOP Lost Its Way",
    "article_text": "The MSNBC control room in 30 Rock was bustling on Wednesday afternoon, with monitors galore and more than a dozen production staffers manning the cable-news ship. ButNicolle Wallacewouldn’t be needing the traditional cable-news setup for that day’s recording of her new podcast,The Best People. I met Wallace briefly before the taping, which was featuring the brothers behind MeidasTouch, the independent, pro-democracy media network whose podcast briefly unseatedJoe Rogan’s on the charts, a fact I overheard someone mention as we headed toward the studio. While the audio format is a new endeavor for Wallace, who will continue to tape more content for the recently launched series, this was notBen,Brett,andJordy Meiselas’s first rodeo. When Wallace walked into the room, flanked by a pared-down production team, the trio was already waiting for her onscreen, each in their own individual studio with mics primed. Immediately, Wallace sat down, putting on her red-rimmed glasses and headphones, and got to work, asking the brothers how they were able to distill complex political news into digestible commentary and grow their audience in the process. It was a fitting booking for Wallace in terms of political perspective—with both MSNBC and MeidasTouch appealing to the anti-Trump resistance—but also, perhaps, a savvy one, as the latter wields a deeply engaged community dubbed theMeidas Mighty, whose members will surely travel over to MSNBC’s YouTube channel to catch the conversation.The MeidasTouch Podcastis among themost popularpolitics shows on YouTube, a platform MSNBC is increasingly turning to; it first did so quietly, withWhy Is This Happening? The Chris Hayes Podcast,and as of Thursday, the first two episodes of Wallace’s podcast areavailabletowatch. The Best People,which debuted at number one on the Apple Podcasts charts after launching Monday, marks Wallace’s first foray into the podcast space, and its content varies significantly from that of her two-hour block on weekdays forDeadline: White House,on which she has conducted interviews with political leaders such asformer presidentJoe Biden,House minority leaderHakeem Jeffries,andMichigan governorGretchen Whitmer,as well as formerFBIdirectorJames Comey.Guests from all industries are featured on the first season of the new podcast, including actorsJason Bateman, Sarah Jessica Parker,andJeff Daniels;music producerJimmy Jam;Milwaukee Bucks coachDoc Rivers;and media figuresRachel MaddowandKara Swisher. In an interview, Wallace acknowledged that the podcast lineup is less explicitly political than her typical MSNBC guest list, though those coming on, in addition to being “insanely and wildly accomplished,” are also “interested in talking about the moment and the world around us.” As a former White House communications chief underGeorge W. Bushand senior adviser for John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign, Wallace hasn’t identified with the GOP since Trump came on the scene, voting forHillary Clintonin 2016, Biden in 2020, andKamala Harrisin 2024. “The Republican Party broke my heart the first time,” she tells me. “I don’t expect anything from them, but even expecting nothing, I’m embarrassed for them that they’ve relinquished so much authority,” Wallace adds, referring to congressional Republicans’ unwillingness to push back on Trump’s executive overreaches. “Trump isn’t acting in a way that is Republican,” Wallace says. “He’s acting in a way, in my view, that is undemocratic.” Our full conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, is below. Vanity Fair:I would love to hear in your own words what this podcast aims to be and how the format and content might differ from your on-air work. Nicolle Wallace:First of all,The Best Peopleis our effort to repossess or reappropriate Donald Trump’s pledge to have “all the best people” in his first term. That clearly wasn’t a term being used to describe the folks in the second term, so we thought we’d have fun with it, with people who actually are legitimately, and objectively, the very best people, certainly that I have come across in my career and life. There’s such a range of guests in this first season, from people like Jason Bateman to Kara Swisher and, even from your own network, Rachel Maddow. I’m curious what sort of through line, if any, you saw in their stories? All of them are so engaged in the world in which we live. Sarah Jessica Parker is so deeply focused on public libraries and worried about what will happen if we have to go without any of them or if their hours are cut. Jason Bateman is so incredibly astute about this political moment and the need to bring everybody into the conversation, to get beyond a moment where politics is so divided. The through line, obviously, is that they’re all insanely and wildly accomplished. That I even know all of them is mind-blowing to me. But if there’s a through line in the conversations themselves, it’s that not one of them found it easy to talk about themselves. They were much more interested in talking about the moment and the world around us. Several of your guests are from the world of entertainment. What are your thoughts on the role of pop culture in shaping political society today? I think it’s from the other way around. If you look at the history of any political movement, it never comes from Washington. It never comes from politics. It comes from culture. You look at Donald Trump’s nod to the manosphere, that was really a nod to culture and the power of culture. I don’t think any of these people would say that they’re going to move politics, but I think all these people care so deeply about different policy issues. Their voice and their role in shaping the culture is probably more significant than any of them think. This is a podcast that’s a little less focused on the more typically political aspects of your job. Do you see this content as an escape from the news or possibly a supplement to it? What I found was, with Sarah Jessica, for example, we sat down and just dove right into the news of the day. We talked about some of these policies. And I was the one who said, “I got to screenAnd Just Like That…” I would get, like, half an answer out of her, and then she’d want to go right back into the broader world in which we live, or the sort of things that our children will confront. Jeff Daniels was the same. He just wrapped up a really neat project in which he plays[Ronald] Reagan.I was interested in talking to him about his new projects and other things, and he plays the guitar for me in the episode. But he, too, had his mind on this moment. What it is is maybe just more in proportion to how people think about politics in their own lives. I don’t know that people will feel like they’re devoid of politics. They certainly aren’t. There was no prescription or structure about how much politics we would talk about, but they are certainly people who are very astute and smart about our politics, that obviously have accomplishments and credibility in broader fields. I wanted to turn to the news of the day and Trump’s second administration. Have you felt any change in the tone or tempo of the political news cycle under his second term? It’s whatever you make of it. We at the show have made a decision to try to slow it down. The freneticism that we brought to the first term was just so dizzying. So we made a decision as a show—instead of trying to do 20 stories in two hours, we try to do maybe four. The pace is what it always is with Trump. My sense after he won was that we should try different things, and we’ve felt like our audience has really stayed with us. I’ve always said this—and this became really true during the pandemic—we have a monogamous relationship with the viewer. I’m curious to hear your thoughts on Trump’s attacks on press freedom. Should the media at large be concerned? We should always do our jobs concerned. The power of the things that we say and do is so great that we should always be cognizant and make sure that we have all of our facts straight. I think that the way Trump is governing in the second term makes it a lot easier, because it’s all out in the open. In the first term, we relied so much on investigative journalism and investigative stories, and then the second term, so much of it is just out in the open. That may end up being a symptom of Trump’s real or perceived political strength. It may be a symptom of him being a lame duck. He’s not running again. He feels like he has mastered the job. I don’t know why that is, but the seeming corruption of the pardon process or the rule of law is all happening in plain sight. In terms of press freedoms, if you look at countries that move toward an autocracy, there is intimidation, there are lawsuits, there are things that start to happen. We’re obviously watching for those things and concerned about them, but I think our focus day-to-day is on covering the things that happen in full view and holding up a mirror to them. We’re trying to deepen our understanding of why they’re happening and how they differ, not just from past presidents, but the past Trump administration. We have a lot of security from the folks that we work for, having our backs and worrying about running the company, so that we can cover the news. It is obviously a live wire and a dynamic thing that anyone who says they’re not concerned about it or watching it, I’m not sure would be telling you the truth. It’s something Trump talked about enough, going back to his first term and describing the press as the enemy of the people, that we have to take him literally and seriously. I wanted to go back to something you just said about it possibly being a symptom of Trump being a lame duck in a sense, but at the same time, all this is happening in plain sight. He’s been unwilling to shut down rumors about running for a third term, even though that’s not constitutionally plausible. How are you looking at that, if at all? I haven’t covered that yet. I’ve tried to take a one-foot-in-front-of-the-other approach to the second term. I think it’s important to acknowledge that everything is possible. We’ve never before elected someone convicted of 34 felonies. So it is certainly plausible that he does that. And you’re right, he has flirted with it publicly. But I think that getting ahead of the story is how you lose that connection with your own audience. What people can take in immediately is what has already happened, the news that is happening right in front of us. So we’ve stayed more focused on the news of the day. But I think that norm busting and waving something in front of us that is unconstitutional flagrantly delights him, and it is obviously an important thing to keep an eye on. Given your experience prior to journalism, as a former White House communications director for a Republican president, I’m curious how you’re reflecting on the Republican Party of today? The Republican Party broke my heart the first time. It’s sort of like, fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. I don’t expect anything from them, but even expecting nothing, I’m embarrassed for them that they’ve relinquished so much authority. You don’t have to make Trump mad to say, “Hey, Congress has a role here. We get to decide if your nominees are qualified to run such venerable institutions like the Pentagon and the FBI.” That they don’t seem to be interested in doing the normal functions of that branch is amazing to me, but not surprising. What would you say to other former Republicans or those more traditional Republicans who are struggling with their place in the current political landscape? I never thought there were enough “Never Trump” Republicans to be a meaningful voting bloc. I think that the better function is to articulate how unconservative all these things are. Trump isn’t acting in a way that is Republican. He’s acting in a way, in my view, that is undemocratic. It’s an interesting moment, and I think the oldest rules of politics apply here–it’s the economy, stupid. If Trump’s tariffs do what Trump has said they will do—if they make it very expensive for people to purchase things at places like Walmart and Target, which have already said they’re going to raise their prices—then it’ll be interesting to see if that changes or erodes any of his public support. It’s already happening in the polls, but we’ll see how that translates and if that translates into any courage for Republicans in Congress who see their constituents hurting. On the other side, what do you make of the Democrats’ messaging strategy in response? Is it meeting this moment? I think there are some extraordinary messengers. I see the things thatChris Murphyputs out almost instantly, and he’s doing them on social media. He’s doing them on the floor of the Senate. He’s doing it in interviews. I saw whatCory Bookerdid, which was botha powerful messageand a sort of unforgettable tactic, the filibuster. I was a Republican, so I understand the muscle memory and the reflexes and history of the Republican Party. I have never been a Democrat. I voted for three Democrats for president since Trump came on the scene, but I’ve never been a Democrat, so I try to refrain from too much analysis. I think that the recklessness with which Trump is treating the economy, and the indifference to how people will feel about flagrant self-enrichment, feel like opportunities for Democrats. But we’ll see if Democrats run with that as a political message. What does your media diet look like? My husband,[Michael Schmidt], is obviously atTheNew York Times,so I have a real affinity for theTimes.I consume a lot ofNew York Timeslive blogs. I read everything thatThe Atlanticputs out. I’m in awe of the depth and the beauty of their pieces. I watched probably most or all of Rachel [Maddow’s] 100 days. I have a 13-year-old and a one-year-old, so I don’t get a lot of the evening diet because I’m doing homework or bath or bed, but I try to watch as much ofMorning Joeas I can before my house wakes up and takes off. The one big difference? I quit X. I don’t see any of the social media stuff. I don’t see what Trump posts. I don’t see what[Elon] Muskposts. And that’s a problem, because we have to cover it. That’s where my big blind spot is. My team mostly flags stuff for me.

    "title": "Intruder Arrested on the Grounds of Windsor Castle",
    "article_text": "On Sunday, June 1, at around 1 p.m.,the apparent calm of Windsorwas suddenly disturbed by an incident the Crown would have preferred to avoid. A man in his 30s, reportedly believed to have been under the influence of Class A drugs (which include heroin, methadone, methamphetamine, cocaine, ecstasy, and hallucinogens such as LSD), managed to cross the protected boundaries of the royal estate. Fortunately, he did not reach the central, ultra-secure part of the castle. The man was intercepted near Town Gate (a peripheral access point) by forces from the Royal and Specialist Protection Command, the royal family’s bodyguard service in charge of security at royal sites. The man was quickly neutralized and handed over to Thames Valley Police. He was arrested on suspicion of trespass on a protected site and possession of drugs, before being released on bail pending further investigation. According to initial investigations, he did not appear to have any malicious intent. The other dimension of this case concerns the immediate proximity of the intrusion to Adelaide Cottage. Located southeast of Windsor Castle, the home was gifted byQueen Elizabeth IItoPrince WilliamandKate Middletonafter she promised it toMeghan MarkleandPrince Harryin 2018. It is the current residence of the couple of Wales and their three children,PrinceGeorge,PrincessCharlotte,andPrince Louis.Although their presence at the scene has not been confirmed, their schedule did not indicate any official travel that day. In other words, the family could very well have been just a stone’s throw away from the intruder. This is not the first time that the symbol of the British monarchy has been breached. Last October,masked burglars broke into a farm building on the estate, making off with two vehicles. In 2021a man armed with a crossbowwas arrested on the castle grounds; when he was approached by police, the suspect voiced his intention to assassinate the queen. In the same year, another individual climbed over fences andmade it ontothe palace grounds twice. This story has been updated.

    "title": "Dakota Johnson and Chris Martin Reportedly Break Up for Real This Time",
    "article_text": "The romance betweenDakota JohnsonandChris Martinhas reportedly come to an end. Sources tellPeoplemagazine that the actor and the Coldplay musician, who got together in 2017, have parted after almost eight years in an on-again, off-again relationship. “It feels final this time,” one source told the publication. TheFifty Shades of Greystar and the singer were spottedwalking in Malibutogether just a few weeks ago. InJanuary, they were photographed hand in hand in India during Coldplay’s tour. Through her relationship with Martin, Johnson also built a beautiful bond withApple MartinandMoses Martin,the children Martin shares with ex-wifeGwyneth Paltrow.Though she and Martin were not married, Johnson referred to Apple and Moses as her stepchildren in a 2024 interview withBustle.“I love those kids like my life depends on it. With all my heart,” she said. “I grew up in a family that was so big, and I just believe in the saying ‘Blood is thicker than water.’ The actual saying is ‘The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb,’ which means that the connections with people you choose are more solid than the connections to the people you’re actually born to.” Johnson also spoke about her unique blended family in a2022Vanity Faircover story. “Maybe I think about relationships like that differently because I grew up in my family,” she said. “We were all cool. Obviously, there were times where it was not cool, but I experienced that, so I don’t want that in my life. I don’t want any kids to experience anything like that. It’s better to be kind, and it’s also really nice that everybody actually really loves each other and has each other’s backs.” The Coldplay singer was first spotted with theFifty Shades of Greystar in October 2017. The following year, the two made their first public appearance together during a fashion show for designerStella McCartney.In March 2024—after several apparent breakups and reunions—the pair revealed that they were officiallyengaged. A few months later, however, there was talk of another estrangement, whichtheDaily Mailclaimedwas caused by irreconcilable work schedules. A spokesperson for the actor, however,denied the news, giving assurance that the two were still together and happy. “Their relationship works because they are both very independent and actually have lives outside of their relationship too. It’s like every time they are not spotted together for a while, there are breakup rumors,” a sourcetoldPeopleat the time. “Sure, they’ve had issues and taken breaks in the past, but things are great now. They both love their careers. They are balancing things the best they can.” Original story inVFItalia.",

    "title": "It’s Been 38 Years Since a Black Playwright Won Best Play at the Tonys. Branden Jacobs-Jenkins Could Change That.",
    "article_text": "“I’m so tired” are the first words that playwrightBranden Jacobs-Jenkinsutters when he gets on the phone. There’s good reason for that: Almost one year after winning the Tony Award for best revival of a play for his searing white Southern family drama,Appropriate,Jacobs-Jenkins is getting ready forthe Tony Awards 2025, where he’s nominated for best play forPurpose,which follows a politically prominent Black family in Chicago on one unforgettable evening. In a year stacked with buzzy plays likeCole Escola’s smash hit,Oh, Mary!,and theSadie Sink–ledJohn Proctor Is the Villain,Purposehas perhaps emerged as the leader of the pack, earning the Pulitzer Prize for drama and taking home best play at the Drama Desk Awards. If Jacobs-Jenkins does emerge victorious, he’ll be the first Black playwright to win the Tony for best play since August Wilson took home the trophy in 1987 forFences.The absurdity isn’t lost on Jacobs-Jenkins, especially when considering how many Black playwrights are thriving in American theater at the moment. “It’s likeTarell [Alvin McCraney],Aleshea [Harris],Dominique [Morisseau], Suzan-Lori [Parks],” he says, rattling off his Black playwright peers. “Lynn Nottagestill hasn’t won a Tony.” While the Tonys may not have taken notice, other awards bodies have. “I think 8 of the last 10 Pulitzers are Black writers,” he adds. “That says a lot about where American drama is. Full stop.” (He’s close: It’s seven.) In conversation withVanity Fair,Jacobs-Jenkins says he’s feeling “crazy” heading into his second Tony ceremony as a nominated playwright. “I didn’t really understand how triggered I would be by doing it right back-to-back,” he says. “It’s been really fun and in some ways really relaxing, but it’s a lot of energy and a lot of expectation.” Oh, and there’s another reason Jacobs-Jenkins is more than a little exhausted. “I also have a three-month-old child at home,” he says nonchalantly. “You wake up twice in the middle of the night to feed, and it’s just crazy. It’s just too much.” Luckily, adding a new member to his family—he and his husband, actor and cabaret artistCheo Bourne,also have a four-year-old daughter,Indigo,at home in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn—has helped keep the roller coaster of his last year in perspective. “She’s a brand-new person. It’s wild,” he says. “She don’t care. She don’t know what any of this is. But hopefully one day she’ll be like, ‘I’m so glad this was happening while I was learning how to poop or whatever.’” While juggling a newborn baby and a newborn play can be tough, Jacobs-Jenkins is filled with gratitude. “I’m happy,” he says. “I’m overwhelmed and grateful and all those positive things too.” This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity. Vanity Fair:Last year you won best revival of a play forAppropriate,which you had written 10 years prior. How does this year compare to last year? Branden Jacobs-Jenkins:​​The stakes were lower. Last year our show opened a little earlier. Once the nominations came out, I was like, Oh, okay. I had little time. I’d gone on a little vacation. This year we opened a little bit later. I feel like we had no time to really recover. Suddenly, we were being invited to all these lovely things. Last year it was decided that we were a revival, and that race was just a different race. It was a smaller category. The other lovely people were dead [laughs]. If you’d asked me a year ago ifPurposewas going to be on Broadway, I would’ve been like, “No, of course not.” So I’m as shocked as anybody. The way the audiences are responding has been really special. The company itself feels like a little family. So it’s just been a very sweet, fun, happy little ragtag group of people. And that’s been really special too. Purposestarted at Steppenwolf Theatre in Chicago. Can you talk to me a bit about the development process? There really aren’t that many storied acting ensembles left in the world. It’s one of our only ones. They contacted me almost 10 years ago now and said, “We want to talk about you.” I thought they were talking about doing one of my plays, likeAppropriateor something. It was an offer for this commission, and they were very specific. That era was still feeling its oats with theTracy Lettsof it all, theBruce Norrisof it all. They’re like, “The only requirement is that you have to write for our members of our ensemble, and our house style is muscular realism.” That’s the phrase they used. I don’t think they really say that anymore. I was like, “Okay, I love a challenge.” I remember going on their website and scrolling through their ensemble and zeroing in on three people who are actually still in the show:Glenn Davis,Alana Arenas,andJon Michael Hill,who at that time were young upstarts in the company. Ten years later, Glenn is literally the artistic director. That was the very beginning, the seeds of it. All I knew was I wanted to write a family drama with them, and then they were going to play siblings. As the idea evolved, I liked the idea of Alana as a sister-in-law more, married to Glenn. That’s how it started. Honestly, it was pure playing around that got us to where we got to. It really grew quite organically out of that collaboration. I wish I could pretend I had a whole play and idea when I sat down to write this, but the story really did find itself. And honestly—no one talks about this—but 95% of plays, that’s how it really works. LaTanya Richardson Jackson, Jon Michael Hill, Glenn Davis, and Alana Areneas inPurpose. As a writer, that’s nice to hear, because you think of divine inspiration striking someone and it all comes out in a day, and that’s actually not how it works. I think it’s calledplayfor a reason. I think it really does resemble play on a playground with your friends. It’s my job to design the game. But everybody’s got their own special powers and their own interests in what they want to play, and I was interested in giving them things that would challenge them. I didn’t want anyone to play something they played before. Purposeis loosely based on the family of civil rights icon Jesse Jackson, and explores the idea of a legacy and the weight of carrying that legacy in a Black family. It’s clearly a lot of pressure. Not everyone can be Jesse Jackson. Nor should everyone need to be. Can you imagine the stress it would be if we all had to be Jesse Jackson? [Laughs] I grew up adjacent to this in DC. There were tons of these folks in my life, and it was a lot of work. In some ways people thought of it as battle. They were going to war. War has costs ultimately, and a lot of those costs are borne by the family. You’re a prolific playwright who’s written a bunch of more avant-garde work likeAn Octoroon,The Comeuppance,andGloria.Your first two Broadway plays,AppropriateandPurpose,are more traditional, big family, kitchen-sink dramas. What is it like for you to find major success in this specific theater niche? It’s so funny, right?Purposewas definitely conceived in relationship to my experience withAppropriate.When I got the commission, it was soon afterAppropriate’s initial wave of premieres. I wrote a lot of this while in rehearsals forAppropriatelast year. I thought a lot about it. I find that the family drama—as weird and contrived and artificial, in some ways, as melodrama or a thriller—for whatever reason, it really touches people more broadly because we all have families. The story we tell ourselves as a member of a family is the oldest story we have of ourselves ultimately. Our earliest memories are of being someone’s child, and maybe someone’s brother and sister, before we discovered what we wanted to do in the world I honestly think I can write family dramas till I die. I really do. I love people talking about their families. I love talking about my family. America’s favorite pastime is gossiping about families and analyzing people based on their families. How do you navigate switching between more avant-garde work and more traditional work? It has been really interesting. My two experiences of Broadway have been these exact forms. I would say the majority of folks, up until maybe recently, would’ve known me for my playAn Octoroon,which is maybe one of the most wild and out-there of my plays. Yeah. I don’t feel like a different Branden when I sit down and write these things. They all require the same kind of work. I guess they just hit differently or whatever. I live inside the experience of writing them. For me, they’re all connected in strange, underground ways. But as flowers, they manifest different for people. [Laughs] They’re all, to me, tied to a deep interest in history. What is Americanness, and how is human psychology, and therefore human relationships, shaped by historical forces? Those are always the themes. They just come out looking different. Do people assume that there’s more of you inPurpose,because it’s about a Black family, thanAppropriate,which is about a white family? Literally, last night someone was like, “So are you Naz?” And I’m like, “No, I’m not an asexual nature photographer in a political family.” [Laughs] It’s insane. The truth is, most storytellers would say that you’re in every single character on some level. That character is just observations you made in your life. If there’s a character [inPurpose] my biography cues closest to, it’s probably the character of Aziza, whichKara Youngplays. But again, I’m not a queer woman having a baby on my own, you know what I mean? It’s just such a funny thing. The plays I’ve written up until now have been very intentionally not biographical in a way that I think has made people crave something like that for me…. I feel people projecting that need onto this, which is fine. Whatever gets people in seats and connected. [Purpose] is a world I think I probably know more intimately, just having grown up where I grew up, when I grew up. No one asks me who I am inAppropriate.My friends know. Do you still go and watchPurpose? Do you lurk in the theater? Here’s the dirty secret: I went on paternity leave the minute we opened. I actually have not seen the show since the opening night. I’m going back for the first time on Friday. I think I’m also a little bit suspicious. I don’t like to be in the room when people are in the room who matter. The Tony voters begin to come, and I don’t want to be in the room. I feel like people are watching me, even if they’re not. Back when I was an emerging writer, no one cared about me. To some extent, people still don’t care about me. But sometimes now people want to come up and talk to me and tell me their thoughts, and I’m just not there for it. Do you read reviews? Well, I have a rule. I read them six months after it’s closed, just to not get hurt. But honestly, the truth is, you know what the reviews are because your friends treat you differently. [Laughs] You just know. It is so embarrassing too. If you have really rave reviews, everyone’s texting you the next day. If you don’t, your closest friends are calling you, being like…“How are you?” [Laughs] Have you seen the other shows? I feel like this is a really strong year for theater, specifically new plays. Oh yeah. Last year was also a strong year for plays. What’s cool about this year’s plays is that everything is so different. If you think aboutOh, Mary!versus this versusJohn ProctorversusEnglish,things could not be more different. Last year they were saying, “It’s a good time for plays,” and I think that’s true. Plays are having a comeback. I don’t know why. Maybe because they’re cheaper to do and producers don’t want to spend money. I don’t know. But no skin off my back. I really think that in my cohort, at least, there’s been just an incredible bumper crop of writers for the theater, definitely compared to folks maybe a generation ahead of us. So I feel like everyone’s coming of age, and next year a lot of my friends are going to be transferring, some of them for the first time, to Broadway. I feel very lucky to be making theater in this moment. A Black playwright hasn’t won best play at the Tony Awards since August Wilson won in 1987. What are your thoughts about that? Somebody just pointed that out to me, and I’m like, That can’t possibly be true. That can’t possibly be true, but I guess it is true. I was three years old. I have a four-year-old. I just find that to be truly insane. There’ve been a lot of great folks nominated. The truth is, the last two women to win this prize were both namedYasmina Reza.There’s questions to ask. It’s an honor to be nominated, and the real reward is the audience. Tony Sunday is approaching. How are you feeling about it? No one really writes plays, I don’t think, to win Tony Awards. But it’s a nice thing that happens. There’s just nerves. It means so much to people. Really, really, really, for me, it’s about the actors who I think did an incredible amount of work. I’m really thinking about them going into Sunday, and, I don’t know, my first Tony Awards I accidentally watched when I was 13 years old. It was the onewhere Elaine Stritch won, and I remember her getting cut off by the camera in this vicious way. I remember thinking, Oh, that’s the center of the universe up there. It’s so weird to be sitting in that audience now and wondering who is accidentally watching this in some sad bedroom in DC. It was the beginning of me being like, I need to move to New York. And here I am, having made this life here, and I’m just so grateful.

    "title": "Molly Gordon’s So Much More Than The Bear’s Dream Girl",
    "article_text": "“I’ve never been in something that people watch,” says Molly Gordon, “which is a very different experience.” She’s talking about her breakout turn in the bittersweetEmmy favoriteThe Bearand underselling her résumé a little: Gordon has been onRamyandAnimal Kingdom,as well as indie movies likeBooksmart.But it’s true that playing the woman trying to get into the locked freezer of Carmy’s heart has put a more intense spotlight on Gordon. Jeremy Allen White’s protagonist “is a character that people feel so protective over, and it’s been kind of controversial to bring a romantic element into the show,” she says. “That’s been at times annoying, fascinating, and interesting—just to be a part of something that people have opinions on.” She’ll have to get used to it, because it’s going to be a very Molly Gordon summer.The Bear’sfourth seasonwill debut on June 25, and her Sundance road trip movieOh, Hi!hits theaters on July 25. InOh, Hi!she plays a woman who goes on a romantic weekend getaway with her boyfriend (Logan Lerman) but soon discovers that he isn’t as serious about the relationship as she is. Instead of moving on from that ego hit, she decides she’s going to hold him captive and convince him that she’s actually the right girl for him. Gordon worked with writer-director Sophie Brooks on the story for the charmingly odd dark comedy, which takes a long, painful look at the modern dating landscape. “With apps, it’s just such a hard time to date in our modern age, and we’ve had a communication breakdown between sexes,” Gordon says. “We just wanted to make something that is about how hard it is to just be honest about how you feel about someone.” Gordon says the role of Iris is based on herself if she were just “five percent crazier.” But she also grounds the character enough that the audience can still root for her, even when she’s making some pretty lamentable choices. It was an opportunity to portray the sort of intense character Gordon is always hunting around for. “We don’t really get to be crazy,” she says. “There’s just still not that many great female characters out there—the kind of wild characters usually played by men.” BeforeThe Bear,Gordon was probably best known for cowriting, codirecting, and starring inTheater Camp,acritically acclaimed2023 comedy that won a Special Jury Award at Sundance. Shewrote the scriptwith her friends Ben Platt, Noah Galvin, and Nick Lieberman (she and Platt have known each other since they were three years old); it’s set at the titular location and inspired by their own experiences as theater nerds. Gordon surprised even herself when raised her hand to codirect the film with Lieberman. She’d always wanted to direct but wasn’t sure it was in the cards for her. “It was something I had quieted for so many years, because the statistics are so insane for women,” she says. Indeed, it’s bleak: As of 2024, women accounted for just 16 percent of directors working on the US’s 250 highest-grossing domestic releases. “I just still feel like I struggle with taking up space and just living authentically in that I’m the leader. It’s just still hard for me sometimes to fully own that,” says Gordon. Yet this summer she will start shooting her solo directorial debut,Peaked,an A24 high school reunion comedy she also cowrote and will star in. “I feel lucky that I can create things, because what’s so hard with acting is that you have to wait for someone to go, ‘Here, you can be creative today,’ ” she says. “With writing, every day you can wake up and have agency over your own creativity in your own life.” A Los Angeles native, Gordon learned about storytelling from her parents, director Bryan Gordon and writer-director Jessie Nelson. “My parents were always breaking story”—i.e., plotting out movies and TV shows—“or trying to turn shitty things that happened to them into a funny idea around the dinner table,” she says. She’s aware that industry outsiders think second-generation writers and actors have an advantage because of their access, and she doesn’t disagree, though she thinks there’s more nuance to it: “It’s access and all these things, but it’s also just realizing how inconsistent and hard it is.” Gordon decided to move across the country to enroll at NYU but only lasted a few weeks. She made a PowerPoint presentation to convince her parents to let her leave school and stay in New York to pursue an acting career. It worked: “I was really brave when I was 18. I don’t think I’ll ever be as cool as I was then, because I had no friends and took classes with 50-year-olds.” It would take a few years of acting classes and restaurant work for her to gain any momentum, and there were lots of hurdles along the way. At one point, an agent she met with told Gordon to her face that acting wasn’t the right career for her. “Which was totally fair,” she says now. “I wasn’t ready.” When she’d run into acquaintances from home, there’d often be an awkward conversation about what she’d been up to since dropping out of college. “I feel like people looked down on me a bit. I seemed a little lost, which I was. But I kind of needed to be in that moment.” Finally, the roles started to come. She booked the TNT seriesAnimal Kingdom,then got to work with Melissa McCarthy in the 2018 comedyLife of the PartyandOlivia Wilde inBooksmart.She was finally working on projects that aligned with her tastes—and she made friends who were doing the same thing. Gordon’s social circle now includes fellow rising stars Ayo Edebiri and Rachel Sennott. “I actually can’t imagine that I would have a career without those girls,” she says. “I don’t really have any doctor friends—I’m kind of friends with this circus. We’re all insane.” Gordon metThe Bearcreator Christopher Storer during her three-episode stint onRamy,which Storer also directed and executive-produced. She signed onto his new show knowing only that she’d play a doctor; it wasn’t until later that Gordon realized Claire Dunlap, a.k.a. “Claire Bear,” was Carmy’s love interest, his childhood sweetheart who comes back into his life after a chance run-in at the grocery store. “I’m always ‘the friend,’ ” she says. “I’ve never played the romantic person. I was like, ‘Whoa, this is going to be a different experience.’ ” Her role gets bigger in the fourth season ofThe Bear,which she says will explore Carmy’s struggle to add some life to his work-life balance. It’s a topic that’s been weighing on her as well. Last fall, Gordon found herself at the center of tabloid speculation when photos emerged of her and White cozying up and kissing off-set. She sidesteps the topic gracefully, saying, “With the internet, I just think—I even see it in myself as a fan of things—we’re just a more judgmental society.” Gordon’s role onThe Bearis much more dramatic than she’s accustomed to; it speaks to her hopes for the future—that she won’t be stuck playing in her comedy ball pit. Yes, she loves projects with “a little bit of cheekiness,” but she’s drawn to darker material too. “It’s funny, women in comedy get kind of put in a box,” she says. “I’d love to do drama—I could do some drugs in a basement. Let’s go.” Her acting success has only buoyed her directing ambitions. There’sPeaked;she’s also cowriting a new take on the 1987 comedyOutrageous Fortunefor Searchlight. “I don’t care about being the lead in something,” she says. “I want to work with people that I admire, and that feels like more of the key to longevity for me in this career than trying to make it a name for myself as an actress.” HAIR, JUNYA NAKASHIMA; MAKEUP, MAKI RYOKE; MANICURE, ELINA OGAWA; TAILOR, JEN HEBNER; SET DESIGN, COLIN PHELAN.

    "article_text": "Black particles in supply at two Fanling estates are mainly bitumen, government says, while stressing the water is safe to drink Black particles found in the freshwater supply at two public housing estates are mainly bitumen, authorities have said, while stressing that the water is safe to drink. Director of Water Supplies Roger Wong Yan-lok sought to reassure the public on Thursday after government tests showed the presence of the substance, which is banned from use in pipes, in most of the 126 samples collected from each of the blocks in Queens Hill Estate and Shan Lai Court, both in Fanling. “Bitumen is insoluble in water and is not harmful to humans,” he said. Wong added that experts commissioned by the Water Supplies Department five years ago did not find any toxic substances in three litres of hot water boiled with 10 grams of bitumen. “Even if residents drink water containing bitumen, there is no need to worry,” he said. Residents at the two public rental and subsidised estates first reported the presence of black particles in their drinking water on Friday last week, prompting some to buy bottled water as speculation mounted over the source of the mysterious dark specks.",
