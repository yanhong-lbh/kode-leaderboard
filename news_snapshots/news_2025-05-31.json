    "article_text": "'Outnumbered' analyzes Elon Musk’s DOGE tenure and exit from President Donald Trump’s second administration. The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) saved over $5 million a year after discovering several agencies paid for far more software than they were actually using. For example, the IRS was paying for 3,000 licenses for software but only used 25. Once DOGE discovered the waste, it cut the remaining 99% of the licenses. \"Agencies often have moresoftware licensesthan employees, and the licenses are often idle (i.e. paid for, but not installed on any computer),\" DOGE wrote in a post on X. \"These audits have been continuously run since first posted in February.\" The Department of Labor slashed 68% of unused \"project planning\" software licenses, DOGE noted, and the Securities and Exchange Commission cut 78% of the remote desktop software programs it was paying for after finding the commission was only using 22% of the programs. TOP 5 MOST OUTRAGEOUS WAYS THE GOVERNMENT HAS WASTED YOUR TAXES, AS UNCOVERED BY ELON MUSK'S DOGE According to DOGE, the three changes savedover $5 million a year. DOGE raised a red flag in February that agencies were paying for more software licenses than employees when it shared a post about the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA). With 13,000 employees, GSA was paying for 37,000 licenses for WinZip, a program used to archive and compress files.

The most recent post comes as billionaire Elon Musk steps down as the face of DOGE. While DOGE was tasked with cutting $2 trillion from the budget, its efforts led to roughly $175 billion in savings due to asset sales, contract cancellations, fraud payment cuts and other ways to eliminate costs, according to an update on DOGE’s website.

The Tianwen-2 probe launched Thursday from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in southwest China's Sichuan Province aboard the workhorse Long March 3-B rocket, according to the China National Space Administration (CNSA). The target of the Tianwen-2 will be different from its predecessor, the Tianwen-1, which launched a year ago and landedon Mars.

    "article_text": "Chowdhury Navid spoke with Fox News Digital about the moments after his brother was attacked and provided an update on his condition. The brother of 27-year-oldNew York City Police Departmentofficer Chowdhury Nafees, who was beaten by two men in the Bronx Saturday, told Fox News Digital the suspects in the attack \"escalated\" their brutality after finding out Nafees was a police officer. That has prompted conversations about use-of-force policies that may prevent law enforcement from protecting themselves. Wayne Lucas, 23, and Taveon Hargrove, 23, were arrested inthe assaultthat left Nafees, who was in uniform on his way home from work, \"horribly mutilated.\" Just before 4 a.m. Saturday, Lucas and Hargrove allegedly forced the off-duty rookie officer to the ground, stomping on his face and causing multiple fractures. They then allegedly held a knife to his throat beforeforcibly removing his wallet, iPhone and gunand running away. Chowdhury Nafees was in the hospital for days after being transported by EMS in critical condition.(Fund the First) NYPD HUNTS FOR MAN ACCUSED OF BEATING OFF-DUTY COP AND STEALING HIS GUN, ALLEGED ACCOMPLICE ARRESTED Nafees' partner called the family and told them \"something happened,\" but they remained in the dark until the 45th precinct confirmed he had been rushed to a nearby hospital in critical condition. Chowdhury Navid, Nafees' brother, told Fox News Digital he and his mother went to the hospital and found Nafees unconscious and bleeding from his eyes. NYPD Officer Chowdhury Nafees is discharged from the hospital.(@NYPDPC) \"The left eye was completely, horribly mutilated,\" Navid said. \"There was a bootstrap on his face, which was clear that somebody stomped him very, very violently. You can see the tracks on his face. It was a horrible sight to see my brother, who I love the most, and someone who I always look up to … to be in a place where he's completely helpless.\" Chowdhury suffered severe head trauma and will need reconstructive surgery. His left orbital bone and right cheekbone were also fractured, among other injuries. CALIFORNIA OFFICER SHOT, KILLED KNIFE-WIELDING MAN AFTER ATTACK OUTSIDE POLICE HEADQUARTERS: BODYCAM VIDEO Navid recounted his father's reaction when he arrived at the hospital a short time later. \"My dad is a very strong man,\" he said. \"I never saw him cry ever in his life. This is the first time I saw him break apart.\" While the attack appeared to be random, Navid said it \"escalated dramatically\" when the suspects found out his brother was inlaw enforcement. NYPD officer Chowdhury Nafees sustained serious injuries to the head in the Bronx attack.(Fund the First) \"My brother recalled with one of the investigators [that the suspects learned he was a police officer because he was] wearing a vest on top of his uniform,\" he said. \"When they found out, my brother said he heard them saying, ‘Ah, s---. This is a cop.’ After that, everything escalated.\" \"They absolutely hated it,\" Navid added. \"If they could, they would have killed him.\" Retired NYPD Det. Robert Garland, who is helping the family raise money for Nafees' recovery, called for justice and challenged the department to be proactive in protecting officers. \"In an act like this, justice needs to be served,\" Garland told Fox News Digital. \"What I mean by that is not going to jail for three or five years. This is an attack on a police officer … and, in my eyes, this is an attempted murder. They should be in jail for life, or they should be up against the death penalty. Something like this should never happen again.\" MEAT CLEAVER-WIELDING MAN STABS YOUNG GIRLS IN BLOODY NYC ATTACK AS 11-YEAR-OLD CALLS 911: POLICE Law enforcement agencies' use-of-force protocols can also lead to an apathetic attitude toward officers and dissuade them from protecting themselves, according to Garland. \"That officer was scared about what he would do, about what his actions would be and how the job — the NYPD — would treat him if he took action,\" he said. \"Those perpetrators had a knife to him,\" Garland added. \"Could you imagine if he shot, if he drew his firearm and said, 'Police don't move,' and shot. By law, he had every right to do that. But he's thinking at that moment, ‘Should I do that? Am I going to lose my job? Am I going to be held publicly on trial?' … All those things will absolutely happen, and it's terrible. … Officers should be allowed to uphold the law.\" NYPD Officer Chowdhury Nafees leaves the hospital in a wheelchair as fellow officers offer their support.(@NYPDPC) The same concerns could affect potential recruits' likelihood of taking the oath of office. \"People are afraid to take the job because they're afraid of losing it,\" Gardland said. \"They're afraid of repercussions. They're afraid of being transferred in the middle of the night. \"The job needs to change, and that camaraderie needs to come back,\" he added. \"Unions, brotherhoods, everything has to come together and [they all need to] be there for one another. Unless that starts now and really gets tighter, no one's going to want this job. … They have to keep intact that thin blue line.\" NYPD officers stand outside the hospital as Chowdhury Nafees is discharged.(@NYPDPC) Nafees was released from the hospital Wednesday, though his family said he has a long road to recovery. \"His condition has improved dramatically over the last four or five days,\" Navid said. \"I'm really, really grateful to NYPD, [NYC] PBA, the people in the hospital, everybody. … It's a miracle what they were able to pull off. I'm going to be honest with you. If it was not in the United States, he would have been dead.\" Though Nafees is an educated engineer, Navid said his brother wanted to go back to the field \"because that's his passion.\" \"He could choose to make a lot of money just by doing [engineering], but he believes that this country needs more people on the street, serving the communities, way more than there is a need for engineers,\" Navid said. BODYCAM FOOTAGE SHOWS CHAOTIC MOMENTS LEADING UP TO FATAL OFFICER-INVOLVED SHOOTING \"He's driven by honor, driven by the necessity of the people,\" he added. \"He's one of those few people who will come [to] the front, and take the risk to do what's right for everybody.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP As of Friday, Fund the First, a fundraising platform started by Garland, raised just over $20,000 in donations for Nafees' family.

SIMI VALLEY, CALIFORNIA –Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said that theBiden administration\"strangled\" the state of Alaska with restrictions and red tape that was beyond levels imposed on North Korea, Iran and Venezuela combined. \"Alaska, a state that has had more sanctions, more restrictions on production of oil and gas in Alaska than everything we did to Iran and Venezuela and North Korea if they produced any combined. You know, the last administration just strangled Alaska. This awesome state of immense natural resources,\" Wright said from the Reagan National Economic Forum in Simi Valley, California. Wright joined the inaugural Reagan National Economic Forum on Friday at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library to celebrate PresidentDonald Trump's executive orders \"unleashing American energy\" and how the administration is tackling regulations that have prevented the growth of coal and nuclear energy in recent history. Fox News' Maria Bartiromo moderated the energy-focused panel. He pointed to the Gulf of America andAlaska as two key areasfor American energy growth, most notably in the Last Frontier State. US FEDERAL AGENCIES TO 'UNLEASH' COAL ENERGY AFTER BIDEN 'STIFLED' IT: 'MINE, BABY, MINE' Former President Joe Biden and Secretary of Energy Chris Wright.(Getty Images ) \"Alaska has been this great resource. It boomed and then it's been strangled. The idea is we export oil from the north slope of Alaska, comes by pipeline to southern Alaska, and then exported,\" he said. \"We want to build a pipeline from the north slope of Alaska that brings natural gas, not just oil.And then an oil, a natural gas export terminal on the southern coast of Alaska that in six days can sail to Tokyo or Taiwan or Korea. And then down to our allies in East Asia. So they're getting energy from us. But it would be awesome and great from a geopolitical stance to have a very short supply chain between a huge industrial American facility and our allies in East Asia.\" CHRIS WRIGHT CONFIRMED TO SERVE AS TRUMP'S SECRETARY OF ENERGY United States Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and Fox News' Maria Bartiromo.(Fox Digital ) Wright added that the Gulf of America is a key area of the country to build massive export terminals, where American energy can be exported to foreign nations. \"The export terminals today are almost entirely on the Gulf of America, on the Texas and Louisiana coast. And they're there because you can build things there. The natural gas comes from Pennsylvania, Ohio or North Dakota or Texas or Oklahoma. The gas comes from all over. But that's where you can build these giant facilities to export it,\" he said. TRUMP LAUNCHES 'DECISIVE COUNTERSTRIKE' ON DEM STATES THAT 'WEAPONIZED' COURTS AGAINST COAL: EXPERTS Wright added that America was recently the largest importer of oil in the world, but has since become the largest exporter.

Today, we're the largest exporter of natural gas and a net exporter of oil,\" he continued.

    "article_text": "Former Bernie Sanders staffer Tezlyn Figaro and Fox News host Will Cain discuss new revelations in the alleged cover-up of former President Joe Biden's decline on 'The Will Cain Show.' Hunter Biden was seen out and about with his family in Cape Town, South Africa, Friday amidRepublicans' investigationinto an alleged \"conspiracy\" related to his father's cognitive decline as president. The embattled son of the former president toured Cape Town with his wife, Melissa Cohen Biden, and son, Beau Biden Jr., driving a rented Toyota sedan, a big change from the black Chevy Suburbans he was used to traveling in before PresidentDonald Trumpyanked his Secret Service detail. In March, Trump terminated Hunter Biden's Secret Service detail after former President Joe Biden extended his son's detail indefinitely. Typically, children of former presidents only enjoy Secret Service protection if they are 16 or younger. Trump's move to remove Hunter Biden's detail came as the former president's son was once again vacationing in South Africa.

    "title": "Stephen Miller calls out CNN anchor's 'lazy assumptions' about Trump's executive power",
    "article_text": "White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller called out CNN's Pamela Brown on Friday for making \"lazy assumptions\" regarding the Trump administration's recent Supreme Court win to end deportation protections for roughly 500,000 migrants. White HouseDeputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller called out CNN's Pamela Brown's \"lazy assumptions\" regarding the Trump administration's executive power during an appearance on \"The Situation Room\" on Friday. Miller rejected the notion that district judges should have to \"green light\" each individual policy directive or executive order that PresidentDonald Trumpimplements, claiming that it challenges the will of the voters who put him in office. The Supreme Court on Friday stayed a lower court order that blocked the Trump administration from deporting roughly 500,000 migrants from Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela. The decision is a near-term victory for Trump as he moves to crack down on border security and immigration priorities in his second term. SUPREME COURT HANDS TRUMP WIN ON REVOKING PAROLE FOR 500K FOREIGN NATIONALS Miller argued that requiring district judges to approve each individual policy directive or executive order that the president implements challenges the will of the voters who put him in office. The order stays, for now. The lower court ruling halted Trump's plans to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) protections for some migrants living in the U.S., which allows individuals to live and work in the U.S. legally if they cannot work safely in their home country due to a disaster, armed conflict or other \"extraordinary and temporary conditions.\" Brown asked Miller whether he believes district judges should just \"rubber stamp\" whatever the Trump White House does, and if not, what checks and balances he thinks should be in place. \"It’s not the job of a district court judge to perform an individual green light or red light on every single policy that the president takes as the head of the executive branch,\" Miller replied. \"Just think about the premise baked into your question. Respectfully, Pam, you’re saying that when the American people elect a president of the United States of America…\" Brown interrupted before he could finish his thought, claiming that her words were being taken out of context, and that she was just asking what checks and balances should be in place. CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE \"I will answer the question happily,\" Miller responded. \"But look, when you have these kinds of lazy assumptions built into questions, it makes it hard to have a constructive dialogue.\" The Trump administration's Supreme Court win on Friday temporarily removed deportation protections for approximately 500,000 migrants currently residing in the United States.(JEFF KOWALSKY/AFP via Getty Images) The CNN anchor asked what \"lazy assumptions\" he thought she was making. Miller began to argue that district judges should not individually approve each executive action implemented by the president, but was interrupted by Brown stating that her question was being misinterpreted. She went on to clarify that she was questioning what checks and balances the Trump official felt were appropriate. Brown contended that her question about whether judges are expected to \"rubber stamp\" White House decisions was reasonable, before giving Miller the floor to finish his argument. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"When you say, ‘Do we think district court judges should rubber stamp each action’ — there is a premise that is built into that that is absurd,\" he asserted. \"The president is the sole head of theexecutive branch. He’s the only officer in the entire government that’s elected by the entire American people.\" \"Democracy cannot function — in fact, democracy does not exist at all if each action the president takes - foreign policy, diplomatic, military, national security - has to be individually approved by 700 district court judges,\" he continued. \"That’s democracy? So if there’s 15 communist, crazy judges on the court, that each of them as a team working together can block and freeze each and every executive action?\"",

The team on Friday announced thatPaige Bueckers, the No. 1 overall pick in this year's draft out of UConn, was put in concussion protocol.

CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Dallas Wings guard Paige Bueckers dribbles during the game against the Chicago Sky at Wintrust Arena in Chicago on Thursday.(Patrick Gorski-Imagn Images) The development will force her to miss at least two games. The team didn't provide any specific details on what led to the move, and it's unclear what prompted Bueckers to go into protocol. She had 15 points, eight assists and five rebounds in Thursday's game. Bueckers won't play in Dallas' home game on Saturday against the Sky or in Seattle against the Storm on Tuesday night. She will be re-evaluated after that. Dallas has lost five of their first six games to begin the season.

    "article_text": "Disgraced former Congressman ripped former Vice President Kamala Harris on \"The View\" Friday for hurting her 2024 campaign while she was on show last year. Despite going to prison for a sex scandal involving minors, disgraced former congressman and former New York mayoral candidateAnthony Weinersaid on Friday he can still do a better job than his Democratic colleagues did in the 2024 election. During an appearance on ABC's \"The View,\" Weiner explained that he is attempting to get back into politics by running forNew York City Councilbecause he believes, despite his baggage, that he’s a better politician than current Democratic figures. He also mocked former Vice President Kamala Harris, accusing her of ruining her 2024 presidential campaign while appearing on the same show. \"By the way, was this where Kamala Harris was sitting when she blew up her campaign?\" he asked as soon as he took his seat between the four co-hosts. ANTHONY WEINER SAYS VOTERS DON'T WANT WHAT 'DEMOCRATS ARE SELLING,' TALKS ABOUT COMEBACK AS FIERY CENTRIST Disgraced ex-Democratic Congressman Anthony Weiner mocked former Vice Kamala Harris during his appearance on \"The View.\"(Screenshot/ABC) \"Is this the spot?\" Weiner asked, gesturing to his chair. \"I hope I don’t have the same fate.\" Harris told \"The View\" last year that there \"is not a thing that comes to mind\" when asked what she would havedone differentlythan then-President Biden. The moment was widely seen as a turning point that led to the downfall of her campaign. Later in the interview, Weiner hit Harris again. He responded to co-host Joy Behar’s suggestion that even though men like Weiner and PresidentDonald Trumphave problematic pasts, a woman like the former vice president still can’t make it to the highest office. Though the aspiring city council member admitted female politicians are often judged harshly, he maintained that Harris made an obvious blunder in response to \"The View’s\" \"softball\" question last year. \"The problem is, it’s a little bit too easy an answer, though, because also there were things that Kamala Harris – I made a joking reference to the answer she gave on this show: ‘Is there anything you would do different?’ That is the softest of softball that – every politician dreams to have that question,\" Weiner replied. \"You still have to be a good candidate.\" Harris did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.

Additional sex scandals mounted in the following years, culminating in an FBI investigation that led to Weiner serving 21 months in prison and registering as a sex offender after sending sexually explicit images to a minor. After his dig toward Harris at the top of the segment, Behar pressed Weiner on why he believes he can get back into politics considering his scandal-plagued background. The aspiring city councilman said it’s because he believes he’s a better politician than many current Democratic lawmakers. \"I think what I said at the time was I couldn’t imagine there would ever be a chance that either people would want me back or that I would want to get back into that again,\" he replied. \"But when I woke up in November of ’24 and saw the election results, but more than who won, I looked around New York City and saw how many fewer Democrats even turned out to vote. And I started to say to myself, ‘Something is seriously wrong here.’\" Weiner said too many Democratic candidates were running \"frictionless\" campaigns and playing it too safe. He told the co-hosts that he felt compelled to jump back into politics because his contemporaries were not answering the public’s \"cry that they wanted things to change.\" He added that his past was not a \"good enough reason… not to get off the couch and try.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE Co-host Ana Navarro pressed him on his specific scandals, asking, \"Why should New Yorkers give you a chance at a political comeback?\" He replied, \"I’m doing the opposite of what a lot of politicians do in my position – ignore that problem, pretend it didn’t happen, blame someone else.  I am saying, yes, I did these things. I got into recovery. I tried to make my life better. And now, if I can be of service – and I’m a damn good politician. I come up with answers, I talk to people directly, I don’t try to butter over things, I try to be direct.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Look, all I can ever be is who I am right now and that brought me to this space,\" Weiner added.

    "title": "Trump to double tariffs on steel imports",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump has announced the US will double its current tariff rate on steel and aluminium imports from 25% to 50%, starting on Wednesday. Speaking at a rally in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Trump said the move would help boost the local steel industry and national supply, while reducing reliance on China. Trump also said that $14bn would be invested in the area's steel production through a partnership between US Steel and Japan's Nippon Steel, though he later told reporters he had yet to see or approve the final deal. The announcement is the latest turn in Trump's rollercoaster approach to tariffs since re-entering office in January. \"There will be no layoffs and no outsourcing whatsoever, and every US steelworker will soon receive a well deserved $5,000 bonus,\" Trump told the crowd, filled with steelworkers, to raucous applause. One of the major concerns from steelworkers about the US-Japan trade deal was how Japan would honour the workers' union contract which regulates pay and hiring. Trump began his remarks by saying he had \"saved\" US Steel, America's biggest steel manufacturer, located in Pittsburgh, with the 25% tariffs he implemented during his first term as president in 2018. He touted the increase to 50% as a way to ensure US Steel's survival. \"At 50%, they can no longer get over the fence,\" he said. \"We are once again going to put Pennsylvania steel into the backbone of America, like never before.\" US steel manufacturing has been declining in recent years, and China, India and Japan have pulled away as the world's top producers. Roughly a quarter of all steel used in the US is imported, and the country's reliance on Mexican and Canadian steel has angered Trump. The announcement comes amida court battle over the legality of some of Trump's global tariffs,which an appeals court has allowed to continue after the Court of International Trade ordered the administration to halt the taxes. His tariffs on steel and aluminium were untouched by the lawsuit. \"It is a good day for steelworkers,\" JoJo Burgess, a member of the local United Steelworkers union who was at Trump's rally, told the BBC. Mr Burgess, who is also the city mayor of nearby Washington, Pennsylvania, expressed optimism over the reported details of the partnership with Nippon Steel, saying he hoped it would help breed a new generation of steel workers in the area. He recalled \"making a lot of money\" in the years after Trump instituted steel tariffs in his first term. Although Burgess would not label himself a Trump supporter, and says he has only voted for Democratic nominees for president in the last two decades, he said: \"I'm never going to disagree with something that's going to level the playing field for American manufacturing.\" But so far the impacts of Trump's tariffs have largely led to global economic chaos. Global trade and markets have been upended and cracks have formed - or widened - in relations between the US and other countries, including some of its closest partners. The levies have strained relations between China and the US, the world's two biggest global economies, and launched the countries into a tit-for-tat trade battle. On Friday, without providing details,Trump accused China of violating a trucethey had reached over tariffs earlier this month over talks in Geneva. US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer later clarified that China had not been removing non-tariff barriers as agreed under the deal. China then shot back with its own accusations of US wrongdoing. Beijing's response on Friday did not address the US claims directly but urged the US to \"cease discriminatory restrictions against China\". China is the world's largest manufacturer of steel, responsible for more than half of global steel production, according to World Steel Association statistics from 2022. \"If you don't have steel, you don't have a country. You don't have a country, you can't make a military. What are we going to do? Say, 'Let's go to China to get our steel from the army tanks,'\" Trump quipped at the Pittsburgh rally on Friday. Trump's roughly hour-long, wide-ranging rally speech hinted at the deal he said he had made with Japan's Nippon Steel but he did not offer any new details. Both companies have not confirmed any deal was completed. While campaigning for president, Trump had said he would block foreign acquisition of US Steel, the storied 124-year-old American steel company. It is unclear how the reported partnership would operate and who would own the company. White House officials said Trump had convinced Japan's Nippon Steel to boost its investment in the US and give the government key say over the operations of the US factories. According to US media, Japan plans to invest $14bn over 14 months. Other reported details include that the companies had said they would maintain ownership of US steel in the US, with US citizens on the board and in leadership positions; pledged not to cut production for 10 years; and agreed to give the government the right to veto potential production cuts after that period.

    "title": "Healey sees defence spend rise to 3% of GDP by 2034",
    "article_text": "There is \"no doubt\" that UK defence spending will rise to 3% of GDP by 2034 at the latest, Defence Secretary John Healey has said. A source told the BBC this was Healey's opinion, not a new commitment. His comment comes as the government prepares to unveil its strategic defence review which will outline priorities for the military and security spending in the coming years. Earlier this year the Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer, laid out plans to increase defence spending to 2.5% by April 2027, with a \"clear ambition\" to reach 3% by 2034, economic conditions allowing. But it is understood that the strategic defence review, to be published on Monday, is based on the assumption that the 3% target is the trajectory spending will follow, with the possibility projects could be delivered faster if the target were brought forward. The review will state that the world and the threats the country faces are changing fast. It will recommend the deployment of new \"digital\" experts alongside troops to protect them from enemy drones and to control the army's own, future, unmanned weapons. Speaking to the Times newspaper, Healey said the UK defence spending target allowed the UK to \"plan for the long term... [and] deal with the pressures\". As a result of the review,the Ministry of Defence will spend more than £1bn to develop technologyto speed up decisions on the battlefield. Nato heads of government are set to meet in The Hague, in the Netherlands, next month, where it is expected that its secretary-general will call on allies to increase defence spending. Earlier this month, while addressing the alliance's parliamentary assembly, Mark Rutte suggested that the 32 member countries agree on a \"high defence spend target of, in total, 5%\". New money for defence will be found in part by reducing UK overseas aid from 0.5% of gross national income to 0.3%. The cut in aid prompted International Development Minister Anneliese Dodds to resign in February, telling the prime minister in a letter that the move would \"remove food and healthcare from desperate people - deeply harming the UK's reputation\". Four crew and 25 passengers were killed when the helicopter went down in foggy conditions over the Mull of Kintyre in Scotland on 2 June 1994. As the chancellor prepares to set government budgets for future years, who are likely winners and losers? Documents shown to court by MoD show the officer rejected every application referred to him in the summer of 2023. The Ministry of Defence confirms the fire broke out after a live firing exercise. Between 120 and 140 rear crew will be trained each year between RNAS Culdrose and RAF Cranwell.",

    "article_text": "Greater Manchester Police have arrested a man after a police sergeant was injured in an alleged hit-and-run. The officer, who has not been named, was hurt when his legs were crushed between two vehicles, the force said. A car \"reversed into the officer several times\" on Frodsham Street, Rusholme, at approximately 18:00 on Friday. The driver then fled the scene, the force said. A 41-year-old man is in custody and has been arrested on suspicion of assault, dangerous driving and failure to stop, GMP added. Wishing her colleague a \"speedy recovery\", Assistant Chief Constable Steph Parker  condemned any assault on an officer as \"wholly unacceptable\". These assaults take officers \"away from being able to serve and protect the public, which is what they come to work each shift to do\", she said in a statement released by GMP. Assistant Chief Constable Parker added: \"This incident is a reminder of the risks that our frontline officers face daily as they go about their duties to keep communities safe and respond to incidents.\" The GMP sergeant involved in the alleged hit-and-run is being treated in hospital and is not believed to have life-threatening or life-altering injuries. An investigation into the incident is now under way. Thanking people who had already come forward with information, the assistant chief constable asked anyone who had relevant CCTV or dashcam footage to call police on 101. GMP believe there may be other victims who are yet to come forward and have issued an appeal. Three people are arrested after police discovered the liquid drug at a home in Oldham. The panel ruled that Insp Toby Knight would have been sacked if he had not already resigned. The woman, who had said she had been raped, was arrested over social media posts she had made.

    "title": "Rugby league anger at no knighthoods in 130 years",
    "article_text": "Rugby league authorities say their players have been \"poorly treated\" by the honours system, as pressure grows for a first knighthood or damehood for the sport. The sport has gone 130 years without such an honour. \"It is surprising and disappointing that the relevant authorities have still not deemed anyone worthy of a knighthood or damehood for their services to rugby league,\" said a spokesperson for the Rugby Football League, which governs the sport. The Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, added his voice, telling BBC News the lack of rugby league knighthoods \"cannot be right\" when other sports, including rugby union, have had such honours \"quite regularly\". The leader of a cross-party group of MPs who support rugby league has suggested the \"scandal\" of the lack of top honours for stars of the sport was linked to snobbery and class prejudice. \"This, I suspect, is because they come from working class backgrounds, didn't go to the right schools, and didn't mix in the right social circles,\" said David Baines, chair of the all-party Parliamentary rugby league group. \"Well enough is enough. It's 2025, and myself and other MPs are clear it's time for things to change.\" Sir Lindsay Hoyle, who is a former president of the Rugby Football League, said: \"Rugby league has a long and proud history and is littered with examples of players who have excelled in the sport and inspired future generations to play the game.\" He says there is something wrong when the sport \"cannot boast one single player, over its 130-year history, who has received a knighthood\". \"I want to see rugby league given the recognition it deserves and hope this will be addressed in the near future,\" said the Speaker. In contrast, rugby union, often seen as having more middle class roots, has been getting knighthoods for more than 100 years. Among more recent rugby knights was Sir Bill Beaumont, awarded \"for services to rugby union football\" in 2018. There have been many other sporting knighthoods and damehoods, including in athletics, yachting, football, golf, tennis, horse racing, cycling and rowing. Next weekend will see the sport's showcase Challenge Cup Final at Wembley Stadium. And speaking on behalf of the MPs' rugby league group, Mr Baines said the lack of such an honour for rugby league was an unfairness to \"some of Britain's greatest sporting heroes\". That included \"legends of the game who overcame racial and class prejudice such as Billy Boston and Clive Sullivan, to modern heroes on and off the pitch like Kevin Sinfield,\" said Mr Baines. England starKevin Sinfieldhas raised more than £10m running for causes related to motor neurone disease, in memory of his late teammate Rob Burrow. Billy Bostonwas a celebrated Welsh-born rugby league player from the 1950s and 1960s, who is now aged 90. A petition was launched earlier this year to award him a knighthood. \"We do believe rugby league has historically been poorly treated in terms of recognition in various ways, including honours lists,\" said a spokesman for the Rugby Football League. There have been honours, such as CBEs and OBEs, but no knighthoods.The Prince of Wales personally gave Kevin Sinfield and Rob Burrow their CBEs last yearat the ground in Leeds where they used to play. ABBC analysis earlier this yearrevealed that a disproportionately low number of top honours, such as knighthoods and damehoods, were going to people from the north of England and working class backgrounds - which overlaps with the rugby league heartlands. In the most recent New Year Honours only 6% of higher awards went to people in the north of England and 4% to people from working-class backgrounds. The government has recognised there are problems with under-representation in the honours and an independent chair is being recruited to improve diversity and outreach. \"The government wants to ensure that the honours system reflects the diversity of UK society. Anyone can nominate someone who has made an exceptional contribution to be recognised,\" said a government spokesman.

    "title": "Scouse superhero Speedo Mick: From rock bottom to seeing life story on stage",
    "article_text": "Michael Cullen went from sleeping rough in Liverpool to raising £1m by doing charity walks in all weathers in just his swimming trunks. His story is now being celebrated in a stage musical. Just as Clark Kent turns into Superman when he changes into his famous red underpants, Michael Cullen transforms into Speedo Mick when he pulls on his tight blue trunks. \"I got a little inkling of what Superman feels like when he puts his knickers on,\" Cullen laughs. \"I do feel different when I'm in my Speedos. Something happens. There's a change. I get a little bit more fearless.\" Speedo Mick doesn't have Suerpman's tights and cape - just a pair of walking boots and, if it's cold, an Everton FC scarf and woolly hat. He has criss-crossed the British Isles bare-chested for charity come rain, shine or snow. His most extreme challenge was walking between, and up, the tallest mountains in England, Scotland in Wales in mid-winter. \"Minus 18 at the top of Ben Nevis. I walked to the top of it and survived it. I never got hypothermia,\" he marvels. \"So something happens when I put my Speedos on. I get a completely different frame of mind. I'm just so determined to get through the day without putting my clothes on.\" In photos, Speedo Mick often pulls a tough-guy bodybuilder pose for the cameras. But that bravado is part of the character. Sitting in a rehearsal room where actors are preparing for a musical that will tell his story, Cullen, 60, is fully clothed, softly spoken and sensitive. He first pulled on the Speedos to swim the English Channel in 2014, despite never having had a formal swimming lesson until he booked the support boat. \"It was miraculous that I got across because I was training with men who were born in a pair of Speedos,\" he jokes. \"They were faster swimmers than me, better swimmers than me, their technique was much better than mine. \"But I had something that they never had, and that was a determination...\" He trails off. \"I'm just getting a bit emotional... a determination and a will to complete something of that magnitude.\" That determination comes from \"the same place that my negativity comes from\", Cullen believes. He suffered \"a lot of turmoil\" during his childhood in Liverpool, using and abusing drink and drugs from his teens, and becoming homeless. \"I just got lost in it all, to be honest,\" he says. \"It was a sad life. It was terrible and it was torturous, and I was doing it to myself. But I just couldn't stop.\" He finally got clean in 2001, and resolved to turn the negativity in his life into something positive. \"It used to hold me down for a long, long time, but now it propels me forward. That's my engine. I suffered for a very long time, and now I just don't want to do that any more.\" After defying expectations and a shoulder injury to swim across the Channel, Cullen \"wanted the world to know that this had happened\". So he ordered a pair of blue trunks with the name of his beloved football team on the back, and \"went to all the matches after that with 'Everton' emblazoned on my bum\". \"The fans were so generous,\" he says. \"I could have got ripped to shreds at any point. But they were all applauding and passing money, and putting it in my bucket, and putting it in my knickers. There were not very many other places that you could put it!\" His scantily clad presence started raising smiles and funds at away matches, too. \"I had a front row seat as far as seeing all the generosity, all the kindness, and all the love that people could give,\" Cullen says. \"There's a lot of negativity going on in the world, and I was just seeing all this positivity. It was making a massive difference to me, as well as everyone else.\" Seeking new challenges, more money and bigger reactions, Cullen embarked on a series of increasingly ambitious charity walks - to Everton matches in Wembley and Lyon, then 1,000 miles from John O'Groats to Land's End. In 2021, he traipsed for five months and 2,000 miles between London, Edinburgh, Cardiff, Dublin and Belfast; before climbing Ben Nevis, Snowdon and Scafell Pike. Onlookers didn't always welcome the sight of a middle-aged man in skimpy swimming trunks, however. \"There was some really negative stuff as well,\" he adds. \"I got spat at, pushed to the floor, had a pint thrown over me, got thrown out of a few pubs after trying to go in to get a bit of food. \"Which was funny because I hadn't had a drink for 16 years and I was still getting thrown out of pubs.\" Speedo Mick's 2023 walk took the amount raised for charities supporting mental health, disadvantaged young people and homelessness past £1m. But that was his final major outing. \"I knew I only had a certain timeframe for me to carry on doing it in my Speedos. You can't be doing it when you're 80.\" And despite their similar taste in underwear, Speedo Mick is not Superman. The gruelling challenges took their toll, having \"a massive detrimental effect on my mental health and my personal relationships\", Cullen admits. Every mission has been followed by \"a big comedown\", he says. \"After the last one, I hit the ground at 1,000mph and I ended up in a clinic because I had a big breakdown. \"Looking back now, I wasn't managing myself. It feels like I paid a massive price by doing all that stuff. It was too much for me. It was all too much.\" The stage show, which opens at Liverpool's Royal Court theatre on Tuesday, has given Cullen a new focus. On the surface, it is about a \"total hero\" who \"took on lots of big life-affirming tasks and completed them and raised lots and lots of money\", says Boff Whalley, formerly of rock group Chumbawamba, who has written the music. \"But the real story is why he wanted to do that, and at what cost was he doing that. \"It's saying, 'He's like you, he's got problems and he's struggled with addictions and mental health problems, and this was his way of finding a way through those'.\" The show's writer John Fay agrees. \"He's a very inspirational and charismatic man. He can walk into a room and just make people smile. And the stamina of the guy, and the things that he's achieved, can seem superhuman. \"But the most important part about him is that he's extremely human. He's got his own fragility. He's like everyone else in the world.\" Liverpool actor Paul Duckworth is playing the title role, and says Speedo Mick is \"a local legend\". \"We all have our complexities and our vulnerabilities. He's a very thoughtful, very sensitive guy.\" As well as attempting to capture Cullen's character, Duckworth must pull off the Speedo Mick look. \"There's only a few moments [in the show] when he gets to throw on a T-shirt, because most of his achievements were all done in his Speedos,\" the actor says with a hint of trepidation. \"There's nowhere to hide. \"It was quite a shock when I put them on the other day. Michael was the only person who saw me in them. In Mick's words, 'You've got to own the knickers. You've got to own the Speedos, mate.' I'm trying to get that mentality.\" The show is the story of an eccentric, big-hearted but fallible character, although Cullen had reservations about putting it on stage. \"I was a little bit anxious over the fact that I'm making myself vulnerable again, because I'm telling everybody about my personal life,\" he says. \"They're going to see a completely different side here.\" However, he hopes the show will start conversations about addiction, mental health, overcoming challenges, and recovery. \"But the biggest message I hope people take out of it is that it's OK to be you, all of you, whatever's gone on in your life - it's OK to be you, and to take hope. \"Take hope from this story because you never know what's going to happen. I've got a play about my life on at the Royal Court theatre, and that's a win right there. It's amazing.\" Speedo Mick The Musical is at the Royal Court in Liverpool from 3 June to 5 July. Real Madrid agree a deal with Liverpool to sign England right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold. Ferries between Douglas and  Belfast, Heysham and Liverpool are running later than scheduled. He loves a goal celebration but fun-loving Jeremie Frimpong, who is joining champions Liverpool, is deadly serious when it comes to his football. Liverpool complete the signing of Netherlands right-back Jeremie Frimpong from Bayer Leverkusen for 35m euros (£29.5m) on a five-year deal. He is charged with multiple offences after 79 people were hurt when a car was driven through a crowd.",

    "title": "She defended drug lord El Chapo - now, she's running for office",
    "article_text": "As drivers sit in traffic near the Bridge of the Americas connecting Mexico with the USA, Silvia Delgado weaves between the cars handing out leaflets. \"I'm standing for penal judge,\" she says brightly. \"Vote for number 12 on the ballot papers!\" Most happily wind down their windows and accept a flyer from her. But in Sunday's rather unique election – the first of two votes by which Mexicans willchoose the country's entire judiciary by direct ballot– Silvia Delgado is not an ordinary candidate. Conspicuously absent from the short biography on her pamphlets is the name of her best-known client: she was the defence lawyer for the notorious drug lord,Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzmán. Her critics say her past defending the leader of the Sinaloa Cartel should disqualify her from standing as a judge. She gives that idea short shrift. \"Why should it? For doing my job?\" she retorts, her heckles immediately raised at any suggestion of a conflict of interest. \"For defending people's individual guarantees? For mounting an adequate technical defence for a human being? Why should that make me illegitimate?\" she asks. Silvia Delgado has not been convicted of any crime, is not facing any charges and is not under investigation – whether over her links to El Chapo or anything else. But a leading human rights and transparency organisation in Mexico called Defensorxs has included her in a list of 19 \"high risk candidates\" in the election. As well as Ms Delgado, the list includes a candidate with a drug trafficking conviction and another facing accusations of orchestrating violence against journalists. The director of Defensorxs, Miguel Alfonso Meza, believes the so-called \"high risk candidates\" are a danger to the legitimacy of Mexico's justice system: \"Someone that has already worked with a cartel, it is very difficult that they get out, even if it was only as a lawyer. It's not even about whether she's a good person or a bad person,\" says Mr Meza, referring to Silvia Delgado. \"The Sinaloa Cartel is not only 'El Chapo' Guzman. It is a company that has criminal and economic interests which are being resolved in the justice system. The cartel could pressure her to show loyalty because she has already been their employee.\" Silvia Delgado visibly stiffens at the mention of Defensorxs and Miguel Alfonso Meza. \"It's completely stupid,\" she bristles, claiming she has challenged them to \"dig into her past as much as they like\". She also dismisses their main accusation that she was paid with drug money and could be compromised if she is elected judge. \"How can you prove that? I received a payment which was the same as any normal monthly payment which was paid to me by lawyers, members of his legal team. I'm not his daughter or his sister or anything. I'm a professional.\" Ms Delgado is competing for one of more than 7,500 judicial position up for grabs – from local magistrates to all nine Supreme Court justices. While it was under discussion, the judicial reform prompted widespread protests by law students and a strike by workers in the legal system. Its critics maintain that electing every judge in Mexico amounts to the politicisation of the country's justice system. \"Of course, it's a political attack [on the judiciary],\" says Miguel Alfonso Meza. \"Former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador didn't like to have constraints from the judicial power. When the pressure became too great and the constraints too tight, the only solution they found was to remove all the judges in the country,\" he adds. This reform was passed beforePresident Claudia Sheinbaumwas sworn in, but she is a firm supporter of it and polls suggest it has broad approval among the electorate too. Supporters point out that the United States, Switzerland and Bolivia elect many of their judges. But Mexico will become the first country in the world to elect all of them. Markets remain unconvinced with investors fearful of the prospect of the ruling party controlling the presidency, the legislative branch and the judiciary. Miguel Alfonso Meza believes that problems will arise from \"the agreements and negotiations judges have to make with political actors… in order to get the support they need to win the elections\". One of the 64 candidates seeking a seat on the Supreme Court is Olivia Aguirre Bonilla. Also from Ciudad Juárez, her legal background is in human rights law and as an activist against gender-based violence in the notoriously dangerous border city. Like all the candidates, Ms Aguirre Bonilla has had to pay for her campaign out of her own pocket – candidates are banned from accepting public or private funding and forbidden from purchasing advertising spots. As such, she's primarily used social media to push out her 6-point plan from clamping down on exorbitant salaries to opening the Supreme Court hearings to the public. While she acknowledges the criticisms over the potential politicisation of Mexico's justice system, Aguirre Bonilla believes the vote is an opportunity for meaningful change of a collapsed, corrupted and nepotistic judiciary. \"I think all the citizens in Mexico are politicised, and we're all part of public life,\" she says. \"The difference here is that our 'untouchable' legal system – and it was untouchable because it was controlled by the elites, by privilege – for the first time in history will be voted in. It will be democratised through the popular vote.\" Many people in the judiciary were there through influence and familial connections, Aguirre Bonilla argues, and it lacks the legitimacy of the executive and legislative branches. \"This vote will grant the justice system true independence as it's not chosen by the President of the Republic but elected by the people of Mexico to represent them.\" So far, the arguments over constitutionality and legitimacy, over the process and the candidates have been bitter and fierce. Now all eyes turn to the polling stations, particularly on the turnout and abstention rates as indicators of Mexicans' backing for the reform. As for Silvia Delgado, the woman who defended Mexico's most wanted drug lord, she just hopes the people of Ciudad Juárez will respect her work enough to allow her to sit in judgement of other criminals who are brought before her. Nine alleged members of the Gulf Cartel have been arrested. Tariffs are a key part of the US president's political vision but economists fear a global trade war. The young men were shot dead in Guanajuato, a state where rival cartels are vying for territory. América Sánchez, 20, and Adal Jair Maldonado Marcos, 23, died when the tall ship lost power and drifted into the bridge. Authorities are examining the site in New York to determine how the collision, which killed two, occurred.",

    "title": "'A cry from the council estate' - the trans teen drama that pulls no punches",
    "article_text": "What It Feels Like For A Girl. A fairly innocuous title for a teen TV series, right? But the stars of BBC Three's new drama say it's taken on a deeper resonance since the show was filmed last year. That's because it's a coming-of-age story about a gender-questioning teenager growing up in a working class town near Nottingham. And it's hitting our screens just a few weeks afterthe Supreme Court ruledthat the terms \"woman\" and \"sex\" in the 2010 Equality Act \"refer to a biological woman and biological sex\". While some groups have celebrated the decision, some trans campaigners have expressed dismay. Given the court's ruling, even the title of the drama is divisive. Some will take issue with it as it is inspired by the autobiography of the same name from trans writer, journalist and trans rights campaigner Paris Lees. And that's because they believe that Lees isn't a woman - and that the Supreme Court judgement supports them. Hannah Jones, who plays sharp-tongued trans sex worker Sasha in the series, acknowledges the timing: \"The title of our show changed overnight. You know, the whole meaning of it is exactly what is going on in the news right now. Whatdoesit feel like for a girl? The trans narrative is so different for so many people.\" Maya Forstater, who set up the campaign group Sex Matters, has told the BBC she strongly opposes the drama's narrative: \"Presenting the idea of an effeminate boy 'becoming a girl' as an edgy coming-of-age story is presenting delusion as self-discovery.\" The series is a raw, hedonistic, brutal - but often hilarious - tale of Byron (Ellis Howard), a 15-year-old boy who is trying to find hisidentity and is desperate to escape the small-mindedness of hishome town. In the heady days of the early 2000s, the teen (based on Lees) is taken under the wing of \"The Fallen Divas\" while clubbing in Nottingham, a group of hedonistic, anarchic outsiders who soon become a second family. But beyond the hardcore party lifestyle, the dark underbelly of an exploitative sex work industry lures Byron in. Local drug dealer Liam - played by Jake Dunn - is an intoxicating influence on Byron, embarking on an underage relationship with this young wannabee while also enticing the youngster into selling sex. Grooming and child abuse are a constant backdrop. \"Essentially, he's Byron's pimp,\" explains Dunn. As can be the case in such instances, Byron is attracted to what he sees as someone with power, his own flat and independence - something he wants himself. \"He [Liam] is very enigmatic,\" explains Dunn. \"They [he and Byron] actually share a very similar back story. They sort of become magnetised to each other. [It's like] watching an unstoppable force meet an immovable object. \"Part of Liam's obsession and desire towards Byron is because Byron reminds Liam of Liam at that age.\" Dunn, who hails from Nottingham himself, based Liam \"off of two people I knew from Nottingham and a lad from Derby who really stuck in my head when I was a teenager, their voices and the way they acted\". He adds: \"At times Liam does feel very vulnerable in a strange way, and then he's also really hardened. And I think when you're working class from a place with no prospects, you're a survivalist and you'll do anything. \"He looks out for himself in a way that is really scary and coercive.\" The drama also doesn't shy away from a serious crime committed by Liam and Byron (which led to serious consequences for Lees in real life as a teenager). Lees has previously said that, \"for me, personally, the much more interesting journey of this bookis the class transition\", having become middle class in later life, after growing up working class. \"I was living in a different city, I had a different accent, I had a different way of making money, shall we say, a different set of friends. I can't connect that with my life today. And a lot of it is the class thing,\" Lees told the Guardian in 2021. Dunn says of the drama: \"The most exciting intersectionality of it is with the working class. What is that experience going to be for you if you are trans... and you are poor? What is the survivalist mechanism that exists for those people? \"It's a hard watch but at no point did the humour leave, at no point did the heart leave. And that's a testament to Paris's life.\" In a Huffington Post interview in 2019, Lees acknowledged things were easier for her in later life. \"I'm probably one of the most privileged trans women in Britain. If you're a LGBTQ kid in a council estate in Manchester and you're getting bullied every time you leave the house, you feel like it's not safe to go to school, and you're seeing all of this horrible stuff in the press – how is that going to make you feel?\" Ellis Howard concurs, and says of the book: \"I feel like it's a real cry from the council estate. \"So you come out swinging as an actor because of how authentic the book is in terms of Paris's experience.\" Byron lives a very split existence, navigating a difficult home life with a macho father alongside a dangerous, illegal lifestyle on the outside. Things get more challenging when, as an older teenager, Byron begins to transition. There is one stalwart ally in the family though, Byron's beloved granny played by Hannah Walters, who co-produced hit show Adolescence alongside husband Stephen Graham. \"We spoke a lot about code switching,\" Howard tells me.Code switchingis the act of changing one's environment to fit in in certain environments. \"I think it really highlights the pockets of Byron's life, where Byron is allowed to be who they are and where they aren't, or where they feel comfortable and safe enough to be,\" Howard says. \"You can't do that if you just see all of the the glam and the chaos... we all have to come home, and what does that look like, and how does that feel? And I think it's incredibly pertinent for when someone is trying to figure out who they are. \"When you taste authenticity, or when you collide into yourself - once you feel like that, you don't want to ever let it go.\" He adds that he has experienced this himself. \"I feel like that as a queer person. Once you've felt liberation, one never wants to walk backwards, and so to be forced to is such an awful and really draining experience, but I think one that is really important to show on television, because it then begs the question of why our society forces people to do that.\" The trans teen drama comes in the wake of theUK Supreme Court ruling in April this year, that a woman is defined by biological sex under equalities law. The campaign group For Women Scotland had brought a case against the Scottish government arguing that sex-based protections should only apply to people who are born female. The Scottish government had argued in court that transgender people with a gender recognition certificate were entitled to the same sex-based protections as biological women - but it was defeated. Since the decision,the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC)has issued interim guidancefor England, Scotland and Wales for places such as hospitals, shops and restaurants, that says \"trans women (biological men) should not be permitted to use the women's facilities\". However, part of the Supreme Court judgement stressed that the law still gives protection against discrimination to transgender people. The EHRC also states that trans people should not be left without any facilities to use. Following the Supreme Court ruling, Sex Matters' Maya Forstater, said: \"I think every organisation is going to have to tear up their policies and start again. It's much simpler than people have thought. There are men, there are women, there are spaces and services that are for men and women - most spaces and services. \"And then there are things that are single sex – and when things are single sex, it's not the start of a negotiation.\" Laquarn Lewis, who plays the indefatigable Fallen Diva Lady Die in What If Feels Like For a Girl, says the show's characters are \"just rebelling against how society is telling them they should be\". \"And that's exactly what we have to do with the recent law that's just been announced, we have to just rebel. Human rights must exist. The last thing we need to do is focus on such a small demographic who are a minority and just ostracise them and make them feel targeted and become victims.\" Howard is hopeful the show will be something of a beacon. \"It's a really scary time in our culture, politically, and so hopefully what the show does is provides relief, but also community. Because I think we need community. We need structure and safety now more than ever.\" What It Feels Like For A Girl will be on BBC iPlayer and BBC Three from 3 June. Grimsby artist Annabel McCourt's work, Per Ardua, will be unveiled on Wednesday in Scunthorpe. Events across June include a march, life-drawing classes, board gaming and poetry. Pop star Alexandra Burke is set to headline the 10th anniversary of Pride in Jersey. Tens of thousands gathered in the city to celebrate at one of the UK's biggest Pride events. Birmingham Pride officials say they have struggled to find a new site for the event from 2026.",

    "title": "How Bondi mass killer slipped through the cracks in Australia",
    "article_text": "For many, Saturdays are something to look forward to - relaxed times, enjoyed with family and friends. But Elizabeth Young \"dreads\" them. It's a weekly reminder of her daughter Jade's violent murder at Westfield Bondi Junction. \"On a lovely autumn afternoon, to learn your daughter is dead, stabbed in broad daylight, killed amidst fellow unsuspecting shoppers... [when she] was living, breathing, just an hour ago... it's the stuff of nightmares, of a parallel universe,\" Elizabeth told an inquiry into the mass killing this week. \"The moment [the attacker] casually plunged that knife into Jade, our ordinary lives were shattered.\" Her pain was echoed by families of the other victims who gave emotional testimonies on the final day of a five-week coronial inquest into the fatal stabbings on 13 April last year. The inquiry sought to understand how a 40-year-old Queensland man with a long history of mental illness was able to walk into the popular Sydney shopping centre on a busy Saturday afternoon and kill six people, injuring 10 others including a nine-month-old baby. The court heard hours of evidence from dozens of witnesses - doctors, survivors, victims' families, police - in a bid to find out how, or if, Australia can prevent a such a tragedy happening again. \"It seems to me that my daughter and five others were killed by the cumulative failures of numbers of people within a whole series of fallible systems,\" Elizabeth told New South Wales (NSW) Coroners Court. It was a mild, sparkling afternoon - the first day of school holidays – when Joel Cauchi walked into the sprawling shopping centre, just minutes from Australia's most famous beach. Just before 15:33 local time (GMT), Cauchi took a 30cm knife from his backpack and stabbed to death his first victim, 25-year-old Dawn Singleton. Within three minutes, he had fatally attacked five others – Yixuan Cheng, 27; Jade Young, 47, Ashlee Good, 38; Faraz Tahir, 30; and Pikria Darchia, 55. Cauchi also injured 10 others including Good's infant daughter. At 15:38, five minutes after his rampage started, Cauchi was shot dead by police officer Amy Scott, who had been on duty nearby and arrived at the centre about a minute earlier. As news outlets reported on the killings, Cauchi's parents recognised their son on TV and called the police to alert them about his decades-long struggle with serious mental health problems. Jade Young's family was also confronted by images of her on TV, describing to the inquest the horror of seeing video which showed her \"lifeless body being worked on\". Similarly, Julie Singleton, whose daughter Dawn was killed while standing in a line at a bakery, heard her daughter named as a victim on the radio before her body had even been formally identified and other relatives informed. The scenes at Bondi sent shockwaves across the nation, where mass murder is rare, and prompted a rush of anger and fear from women in particular. All except two of the 16 victims were female, including five of the six people who died. A key focus of the inquest was to scrutinise the multiple interactions Cauchi had with police and mental health professionals in the months and years leading up to the attacks. The inquest heard that Cauchi was once a bright young man with a promising life ahead of him. His family say he was a gifted student, and had attended a private school on scholarship before topping his class at university. At the age of 17, in 2001, Cauchi was diagnosed with schizophrenia and soon started taking medication for his condition. After a decade of managing it in the public health system, Cauchi started regular sessions with psychiatrist Dr Andrea Boros-Lavack in his hometown of Toowoomba in 2012. In 2015 he complained about the medication side effects, so Dr Boros-Lavack started to gradually reduce his dosage of clozapine – used for treatment-resistant schizophrenia – after seeking a second opinion from another psychiatrist, the inquest heard. She weaned him off clozapine entirely in 2018 and Cauchi also stopped taking medication to treat his obsessive-compulsive disorder the year after, she said. In 2019, for the first time in about 15 years, Cauchi was no longer on antipsychotic medications. No second opinion on completely stopping either drug was sought by Dr Boros-Lavack, she admitted under questioning. The inquest heard from medical professionals who said that in most cases, patients coming off antipsychotic medications transition to another one, rather than ceasing treatment altogether. Within months, Cauchi's mum contacted his psychiatrist with concerns about her son's mental state after finding notes showing he believed he was \"under satanic control\". Around the same time, Cauchi developed what Dr Boros-Lavack told the inquest was \"a compulsive interest in porn\". She wrote a prescription but told the inquest it was up to Cauchi to decide if he would start taking the medication again. In 2020, Cauchi left his family home, moved to Brisbane and stopped seeing Dr Boros-Lavack. At this time, after almost two decades of treatment, Cauchi had no regular psychiatrist, was not on any medications to treat his schizophrenia and had no family living nearby. The inquest heard he began seeking a gun licence, contacting three Brisbane doctors for a medical certificate to support his application. They either didn't request access to his medical file or weren't given his whole history by Dr Boros-Lavack, who said if they needed more information they could have asked her for it. The third doctor gave Cauchi the clearance he was after, but he never applied for a gun, the court was told. Meanwhile Cauchi was increasingly coming into contact with police. After moving to Brisbane, he was pulled over three times for driving erratically. In 2021, officers were called to Cauchi's unit in Brisbane after residents heard a man screaming and banging sounds. In 2022, Cauchi was reported to police after calling a girl's school to ask if he could come and watch the students swim and play sports. Officers tried to call Cauchi but weren't able to reach him. In January 2023, Cauchi had moved back in with his parents in Toowoomba and called police to complain that his father had stolen his collection of \"pigging knives\". At this time, his mother raised concerns with the officers, saying he should be back on medication. Authorities can't detain people for mental health reasons unless they are a risk to themselves and as the officers had assessed Cauchi did not meet that description, they left, the court heard. After the call-out, one of the attending police officers sent an email to an internal police mental health coordinator, requesting they follow up on Cauchi. However, the email was overlooked due to understaffing, the inquest was told. Months later, police in Sydney found Cauchi sleeping rough near a road after being called by a concerned passerby. By 2024 Cauchi's mental health had deteriorated, he was homeless, and isolated from his family. The inquest looked closely at Cauchi's mental health treatment in Queensland, with a panel of five psychiatrists tasked with reviewing it. They found that Dr Boros-Lavack had missed opportunities to put him back on anti-psychotic medication, one member of the panel saying she had \"not taken seriously enough\" the concerns from Cauchi's mother in late-2019. The panel also gave evidence at the inquest that Cauchi was \"floridly psychotic\" - in the active part of a psychotic episode – when he walked into the shopping centre. When questioned by the lawyer assisting the coroner, Dr Boros-Lavack stressed: \"I did not fail in my care of Joel.\" She had earlier told the inquest she believed Cauchi was not psychotic during the attack and that medication would not have prevented the tragedy. Dr Boros-Lavack said the attacks may have been \"due to his sexual frustration, pornography and hatred towards women\". But the next day, she withdrew that evidence, saying it was simply \"conjecture\" and she was not in a position to assess Cauchi's mental state, having not treated him since 2019. However the inquest is investigating whether Cauchi targeted specific individuals or groups. For Peter Young, the brother of Jade, the answer seemed clear. \"Fuelled by his frustration with not finding a 'nice' girl to marry\", his \"rapid hunt found 16 victims, 14 of which were women,\" he told the inquest. The NSW Police Commissioner in the days after the attack said it was \"obvious\" to detectives that the offender had focussed on women. However, during the inquest, the homicide squad's Andrew Paul Marks said he did not believe there was evidence that Cauchi had specifically targeted women. The inquiry also heard about a number of failings or near misses in the way security, police, paramedics and the media responded to the attack. It was told that recruitment and training pressures for the security provider meant that the centre's control room operator was \"not match fit\" for the role. At the exact moment when Cauchi stabbed his first victim, the room was unattended as she was on a toilet break. Security guard Faraz Tahir, the sole male victim of the stabbings, was working his first day on the job when he was killing trying to stop Cauchi, raising questions over the powers and protection given to personnel like him. His brother, Muzafar, told the inquest how Faraz died \"with honour as a hero\" and also acknowledged that Cauchi's parents had lost their son: \"We know that this tragedy is not their fault.\" The contractor responsible for security at the shopping centre has since updated its training and policies, as well as introducing stab-proof vests for guards. Several families criticised media coverage in the wake of the attack, telling the inquiry they hoped the industry would reflect on how they should report sensitive stories so as not to further traumatise those affected. After weeks of evidence, the inquest was adjourned on Thursday with NSW state coroner Teresa O'Sullivan expected to deliver her recommendations by the end of the year. At the start of the inquest, O'Sullivan said the hearings weren't about who was to blame for the attacks, but rather to \"identify potential opportunities for reform or improvement to enable such events to be avoided in the future\". \"I want the families to know their loved ones will not be lost in this process.\" Elizabeth Young, though, told the court, for her, \"nothing good\" will come from the inquest. \"At 74, I have lost my way in life,\" she said, describing the crippling impact of the killings. But she said the action the country needed to take was already obvious to her. \"My daughter was murdered by an unmedicated, chronic schizophrenic... who had in his possession knives designed for killing. \"[This is] another cry out to an Australia that doesn't seem to want to acknowledge that what happened... is essentially the catastrophic consequence of years of neglect of, and within, our mental health systems.\" Szubanski is best known for her iconic role as Sharon Strzelecki in Australian sitcom Kath & Kim.

    "title": "How controversial US-Israeli backed Gaza aid plan turned to chaos",
    "article_text": "The masked and armed security contractor atop a dirt mound watches thousands of Palestinians who have been kettled into narrow lanes separated by fences below. He makes a heart shape with his hands and the crowd responds - the fence begins to bend as they push against it. This jubilant scene was filmed on Tuesday, the opening day of an aid distribution centre - a vital lifeline for Gazans who haven't seen fresh supplies come into the strip for more than two months due to an Israeli blockade. But by that afternoon, the scene was one of total chaos. Videos showed thedistribution centre overrun by desperate civilianstrampling over toppled barriers; people flinched as sounds of gunshots rang out. This was the disorderly start to a controversial new aid distribution scheme operated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a newly created body backed the the US and Israel. GHF has been tasked with feeding desperately hungry Gazans. The UN said more than two million are at risk of starvation. The foundation, which uses armed American security contractors, aims to bypass the UN as the main supplier of aid in Gaza. It has been roundly condemned and boycotted by aid agencies and the UN. But Israel has said an alternative to the existing aid system was needed to stop Hamas stealing aid, which the group denies doing. To get a picture of the first few days of this new aid delivery system, BBC Verify has authenticated dozen of images at distribution sites, interviewed humanitarian and logistics experts, analysed Israeli aid transport data and official statements released by the GHF, and spoken with Gazans searching for supplies. GHF said it aimed to feed one million Gazans in its first week of operations through four secure distribution sites. A foundation spokesperson said on Friday, its fourth day of operations, that it had distributed two million meals. The BBC has not been able to verify this figure, which would be less than one meal per Gazan over the course of four days. GHF did not respond to our inquiries about how it was tracking who had been receiving them. In a video filmed at GHF's northern site near Nuseirat on Thursday, Palestinians can be seen being running away from a perimeter fence after GHF contractors threw a projectile that exploded with a loud bang, a flash and smoke. GHF in a statement said its personnel \"encountered a tense and potentially dangerous crowd that refused to disperse\". \"To prevent escalation and ensure the safety of civilians and staff, non-lethal deterrents were deployed—including smoke and warning shots into the ground,\" it said. \"These measures were effective\", it added, \"and no injuries occurred.\" BBC Verify cannot independently confirm this. Later that evening, GHF warned Gazans via Facebook that it would shut down any site where looting occurred. The GHF is not the only aid organisation facing serious challenges. The night before the GHF warning,a World Food Programme (WFP) warehouse was looted, resulting in several deaths which are still being investigated. In response to the incident, the WFP said humanitarian challenges \"have spiralled out of control\" and called for \"safe, unimpeded humanitarian access\" to Gaza immediately. The WFP did not respond to BBC questions about how it would implement further security measures at its warehouses. Palestinians seeking aid have characterised the GHF-led operation as disorganised, saying a lack of communication has contributed to the chaotic scenes seen this week. Things have been further muddied by misinformation. BBC Verify has seen at least two Facebook profiles purporting to be official GHF accounts, sharing inaccurate information about the status of the aid distribution centres. One page with more than 4,000 followers posted inaccurate information, sometimes alongside AI-generated images, that aid had been suspended or that looting at GHF centres had been rampant. A GHF spokesman confirmed to BBC Verify that both these Facebook accounts were fake. He also said that the foundation had launched an official Facebook channel. Transparency information online showed the page was first created on Wednesday, the day after distribution operations started. Aid organisation Oxfam and local Gazan residents have told the BBC that residents are instead relying on word of mouth to circulate information when aid was available. \"All of the people are hungry. Everyone fights to get what they want, how are we supposed to get anything?\" said Um Mohammad Abu Hajar, who was unable to secure an aid box on Thursday. Oxfam criticised the location of the GHF distribution sites, telling BBC Verify that it imposed \"military control over aid operations\". It's policy adviser, Bushra Khalidi, also questioned how vulnerable people, such as the elderly, would be able to reach these sites, which are located some distance away from some population centres. When the UN had been delivering aid before Israel's humanitarian blockade, there were 400 distribution points spread across Gaza. Under the present GHF distribution system there currently are four known sites. \"By and large, its designed to dramatically increase the concentration of the population by having the only sources of food remaining in a very small number of places,\" said Chris Newton, a senior analyst at the brussels-based think tank Crisis Group. \"You either follow all their rules and probably survive in a small radius around these sites or you are very unlikely to survive.\" The presence of armed security and Israeli soldiers at or near the distribution sites has also alarmed experts, who said it undermined faith in aid operations. \"Distributing assistance in this kind of environment is extremely difficult. [It's] much more effectively done when you are trying to work with, and through, the people there… rather than at the point of a mercenary's gun,\" said Prof Stuart Gordon at the London School of Economics. A GHF spokesperson said: \"Our ability - and willingness - to act under pressure is exactly why GHF remains one of the only organisations still capable of delivering critical food aid to Gaza today.\" Images and videos taken by eyewitnesses and the Israeli military showed the GHF boxes appeared limited to canned food, pasta, rice, cooking oil and some biscuits and lentils. \"Humanitarian aid is not just a food box that you slap humanitarian on and you call it humanitarian aid,\" Ms Khalidi said. The supplies being given to families should be accompanied by medical support, hygiene and water purification kits, said Prof Gordon. A 14-page document from GHF,seen by the BBC, promised to hand out water and hygiene kits at the sites. On Friday, only one of the four GHF sites was distributing aid. It opened for less than an hour after which GHF announced on Facebook that it had closed because all its supplies had been \"fully distributed\". When asked by BBC Verify why only a single site was operational and why its boxes ran out so quickly, a GHF spokesperson said supply \"will vary day by day\". \"Good news is we have provided two million meals in four days and will be ramping up in the coming days and weeks,\" the spokesman said. But many are still returning from distribution sites without boxes for their families. \"I am empty-handed like God created me,\" said Hani Abed outside the centre near Netzarim on Thursday. \"I came empty-handed and I left empty-handed.\" Additional reporting and verification by Emma Pengelly, Rudabah Abbass, Alex Murray, Thomas Spencer, Benedict Garman and Richard Irvine-Brown. What do you want BBC Verify to investigate? The US says Israel has \"signed off\" on envoy Steve Witkoff's plan and that it is waiting for a formal response from Hamas. Scenes of chaos and looting in parts of Gaza persist as food shortages continue. The biggest such move in years is condemned by the Palestinian presidency as a \"dangerous escalation\". Mohammed Sinwar was the target of a Israeli strike on the courtyard of the European hospital in Khan Younis on 13 May. The Israeli military says troops fired warning shots into the air but not at Palestinians during Tuesday's incident in Rafah.",

    "article_text": "An estimated 250 million bees escaped from an overturned truck in the US state of Washington on Friday, sparking warnings from authorities for the public to avoid the swarm of stinging insects. Emergency officials were helped by several master bee-keepers after the truck, which had been hauling roughly 70,000 lb (31,750 kg) of active honey bee hives, flipped over on a road near the Canadian border. \"The goal is to save as many bees as possible,\" Whatcom County Sheriff's Office (WCSO) said shortly after the incident. The authorities said the site of the crash would remain closed \"until the rescue is complete\". \"250 million bees are now loose,\" wrote Whatcom County Sheriff. \"AVOID THE AREA due to the potential of bee escaping and swarming\". Bee-keepers worked with police \"to assist in re-setting the box hives\", containers bee-keepers use to house honeybees. \"The plan is to allow the bees to re-hive and find their queen bee,\" WCSO said, adding: \"That should occur within the next 24-48 hours.\" In an update posted to social media later on Friday, police thanked \"the wonderful community of bee-keepers\", saying \"over two dozen\" had turned up to help with the rescue efforts. \"By morning, most bees should have returned to their hives,\" WCSO wrote on Facebook. Footage shared by police showed huge numbers of bees swarming around the overturned lorry. While some bee-keepers aim only to produce honey, many others rent out their hives to farmers who need the insects to pollinate their crops. President Donald Trump says the increase in tariffs will protect America's steel industry, along with an expected partnership with Japan. The Colombian pop star says she is \"devastated\", after also cancelling her previous show in Boston. Nasa pair Butch and Suni tell the BBC they feared being unable to get home when they failed to dock on the ISS. \"Mia\" also said the rap mogul sexually assaulted her \"on more than one occasion\", though he has denied all allegations. The former president announced earlier this month he had an \"aggressive form\" of prostate cancer.",

    "title": "Stranded astronauts didn't know if they would 'be able to make it back'",
    "article_text": "When astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore approached the International Space Station (ISS) last year with failing thrusters on their Boeing Starliner capsule, they were unable to fly forward to dock. And if they couldn't dock, they didn't know if they could make it back home again. \"Docking was imperative,\" Mr Wilmore told BBC News, two months after he and Ms Williams finally made a successful return to Earth. \"If we weren't able to dock, would we be able to make it back? We didn't know.\" The astronauts had been travelling on a test flight that was meant to last eight days. Instead, they ended up staying in space for nearly 10 months. The first challenge was to dock safely and successfully at the ISS, which they managed to do within several minutes after Mission Control on the ground helped them restart the craft's thrusters. Mr Wilmore said that the possibility they might never see Earth again \"definitely went through our minds\". But both astronauts said they didn't communicate the worst-case scenarios out loud in those moments, because they were trained to move on with solving problems. \"You sort of read each other's mind and know where we're going with all the failures,\" Ms Williams told the BBC. \"These were not expected,\" she admitted. But thoughts quickly turned to solutions: \"At the same time, you know, we're like, what do we have? What can we do?\" The pair's saga began in June 2024. They were taking part in the first crewed test flight of the Starliner spacecraft, which was developed by aerospace company Boeing. But after a number of technical problems during their flight, the option of Starliner carrying the astronauts home as planned was deemed to be a risk not worth taking - given that the pair could instead be brought back by another company, SpaceX. For that reason, they stayed in space until they hitched a ride back on a SpaceX capsule. For its part, Boeing maintained that its own capsule was safe to use - and was proven right when the craft returned, uncrewed, in September 2024. After months of experiments aboard the space station, Ms Williams and Mr Wilmoreeventually returned to Earth on 18 March. During this phase of their mission, the pair were repeatedly described as stranded, implying there was no means for them to get off the ISS. But that was not the case, as the space station always has spacecraft attached to it - which could have acted in an emergency as a lifeboat to carry the astronauts back to Earth. Nonetheless, the pair's stay was longer than expected - though the Nasa pair embraced this. \"We knew nobody was going to just let us down... we knew everybody had our back and was looking out for us,\" Ms Williams said. While in limbo, the pair even found themselves in the middle of a political row, after US President Donald Trump blamed his predecessor Joe Biden for abandoning them in space. But the astronauts said they ignored the politics and didn't feel abandoned. \"We can't speak to that at all,\" said Mr Wilmore. \"We understand space flight is hard, human space flight is even harder.\" After two months back on the ground, both astronauts say they are feeling fit and well, because the workouts that they undertook while in their zero-gravity environment paid off. Exercising in zero gravity means your body doesn't need much time to recover from the daily squats and deadlifts, Mr Wilmore explained. He said he performed squats and deadlifts \"every single day for almost 10 months\", meaning that he returned to Earth \"literally stronger than I've ever been in my life\". Ms Williams agreed - she went running days after landing back on Earth and once ran a full marathon in space strapped to a treadmill - but said it's not always easy to readjust to the weight of the world. \"Just getting gravity back on your head and your back and all that kind of stuff is a little bit painful,\" she said. Since their return, the pair have been working with Nasa and Boeing to fix problems with the malfunctioning spacecraft that took them into space last summer. \"We are very positively hopeful that there will be opportunities to fly the Boeing Starliner in the future,\" Mr Wilmore said. And both astronauts said they would personally fly in the craft again - once those technical issues were resolved. \"It's a very capable spacecraft,\" Ms Williams said. \"It has unique capabilities compared to other spacecraft that are out there that are really great for future astronauts to fly.\" Master bee-keepers are called to the scene after a truck containing 70,000 pounds of active honey bee hives flipped over. President Donald Trump says the increase in tariffs will protect America's steel industry, along with an expected partnership with Japan. The Colombian pop star says she is \"devastated\", after also cancelling her previous show in Boston. \"Mia\" also said the rap mogul sexually assaulted her \"on more than one occasion\", though he has denied all allegations.

    "title": "Ukraine accuses Russia of undermining next round of peace talks",
    "article_text": "Ukraine's president has questioned Russia's commitment to progressing peace talks after Moscow confirmed it was sending a team to talks in Istanbul on Monday. Russia is yet to send its negotiating proposals to Ukraine - a key demand by Kyiv. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow's conditions for a ceasefire would be discussed in Turkey. But Volodymyr Zelensky accused Moscow of  \"doing everything it can to ensure the next possible meeting is fruitless\". \"For a meeting to be meaningful, its agenda must be clear, and the negotiations must be properly prepared,\" he said. Ukraine had sent its proposals to Russia, reaffirming \"readiness for a full and unconditional ceasefire\". The first round of talks two weeks ago in Istanbul brought no breakthrough, but achieved a prisoner of war swap. Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Russia currently controls about 20% of Ukraine's territory, including the southern Crimea peninsula Moscow annexed in 2014. As the talks approached, both Russia and Ukraine reported explosions on Friday night and in the early hours Saturday morning. At least seven people were injured in an explosion in Russia's Kursk region, according to the acting local governor Alexander Khinshtein and Russia's state-owned news agency, TASS. Meanwhile, in Ukraine, officials said at least one person had been injured in explosions in the cities of Kharkiv and Izyum. On Friday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha reiterated that Kyiv had already sent its own \"vision of future steps\" to Russia, adding Moscow \"must accept an unconditional ceasefire\" to pave the way for broader negotiations. \"We are interested in seeing these meetings continue because we want the war to end this year,\" Sybiha said during a joint press conference with his Turkish counterpart Hakan Fidan. Putin and Zelensky are not expected to attend the talks on Monday. But Fidan said Turkey was hoping to eventually host a high-level summit. \"We sincerely think it is time to bring President Trump, President Putin and President Zelensky to the table,\" he said. Peskov said Russia's ceasefire proposals would not be made public, and Moscow would only entertain the idea of a high-level summit if meaningful progress was achieved in preliminary discussions between the two countries. He welcomed comments made by Trump's envoy to Ukraine, retired Gen Keith Kellogg, who described Russian concerns over Nato enlargement as \"fair\". Gen Kellogg said Ukraine joining the military alliance, long hoped for by Kyiv, was not on the table. He added President Trump was \"frustrated\" by what he described as Russia's intransigence, but emphasised the need to keep negotiations alive. On 19 May, Trump and Putin had a two-hour phone call to discuss a US-proposed ceasefire deal to halt the fighting. The US president said he believed the call had gone \"very well\", adding that Russia and Ukraine would \"immediately start\" negotiations towards a ceasefire and \"an end to the war\". Ukraine has publicly agreed to a 30-day ceasefire but Putin has only said Russia will work with Ukraine to craft a \"memorandum\" on a \"possible future peace\" - a move described by Kyiv and its European allies as delaying tactics so Russian troops could seize more Ukrainian territory. In a rare rebuke to Putin just days later, Trump called the Kremlin leader \"absolutely crazy\" and threatened US sanctions. His comments followed Moscow's largest drone and missile attacks on Ukraine. On Wednesday, Germany's new chancellor, Friedrich Merz, told Zelensky that Berlin would help Kyiv produce long-range missiles to defend itself from future Russian attacks. The Kremlin said any decision to end range restrictions on the missiles Ukraine could use would represent a dangerous change in policy that would harm efforts to bring an end to the war. Those who unbuckle before the \"fasten seatbelt\" sign is turned off face a fine, aviation authority says. The US president's remarks on Wednesday come as Russia intensifies its attacks on Ukraine. A brand new statue of the Soviet dictator Josef Stalin has been unveiled at a Metro station in Moscow. Friedrich Merz said earlier there were \"no longer\" any range restrictions on weapons supplied by Kyiv's Western allies. The BBC reports from Donetsk where swarms of fibre optic drones give Russia the edge as Ukraine defends towns behind the front line.",

    "title": "Pete Hegseth calls on Asia to boost military spending in face of ‘imminent’ threat from China",
    "article_text": "The US secretary of defence has called on Asian countries to boost their military spending to increase regional deterrence against China, which was “rehearsing for the real deal” when it comes to taking overTaiwan. Pete Hegseth, addressing the Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore on Saturday, reiterated pledges to increase the US presence in the Indo-Pacific and outlined a range of new joint projects, including expanding access to military ship and plane repair, including in Australia. “US allies in the Indo-Pacific can and should upgrade their own defences,” Hegseth said. “It has to be clear to all that Beijing is credibly preparing to potentially use military force to alter the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific … There’s no reason to sugar coat it. The threat China poses is real, and it could be imminent.” He said Donald Trump’s administration hadpushed European countries to boost their defensive spending, taking on a greater “burden” of responding to conflicts in their region, and it was time for Asian nations to do the same. Hegseth, who in March was revealed to have tolda Signal group chat that Europe was “pathetic” and “freeloading”on US security support in the region, told the Singapore conference it was “hard to believe” he was now saying this, but Asian countries should “look to allies in Europe as a newfound example”. “Deterrence doesn’t come on the cheap … time is of the essence.” A new study by the organisation running theSingaporeevent, the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, found that Asian spending on weapons and research is currently spiking, on top of what it said was a relatively consistent annual average spend of 1.5% of GDP. Hegseth said the renewed European focus on their region – particularly the Russia-Ukraine war – allowed the US to shift focus to its “priority theatre” in the Indo-Pacific. Hegseth said the US did not seek to “pressure” Asian countries to “embrace or adopt policies or ideologies”, but instead wanted to “work with you where our shared interests align for peace and prosperity”. “We’re not here to preach to you about climate change or cultural issues,” he said. “But a threat gathers. “We do not seek conflict with Communist China. We will not seek to instigate, subjugate or humiliate China. President Trump and US have an immense respect for China and their civilisation. But we will not be pushed out of this critical region.” In his speech Hegseth also took a swipe at the absence of any senior Chinese delegate at this year’s conference. “We are here this morning and, notably, someone else isn’t,” he said. Hegseth also appeared to referencecomments by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, at the conference on Fridaythat a “sense that [the US’s] promise might not be so ironclad is ushering in a new instability”. “An alliance cannot be ironclad if in reality or perception it is one-sided,” Hegseth said on Saturday. “As allies share the burden we can increase our focus on the Indo-Pacific, our priority theatre.” He said the US would conduct its “first-ever live-fire test of its mid-range capability system in Australia” in coming months, and had expanded cooperations and joint exercises. It would also establish repair capability and capacity programs in the region, including for P-8 radar systems in Australia for the US and its allies, while expanding contracts for regional ship repair. Hegseth’s speech reiterated much of the Trump administration’s defence and security position – blaming the previous administration for problems, pledging to strengthen the US military and secure the US border against unregulated immigration, while repeating plans to “take back the Panama canal”. He said Trump was spending $1tn – a 13% increase – on defence next year, citing advance weapons plans including the controversial Golden Dome. Speaking in Singapore after Hegseth’s address, US Democratic senator Tammy Duckworth told reporters – including the Guardian – that his comments about the US remaining in the Indo-Pacific region were welcome but he found his words “patronising of our friends in the Indo-Pacific in particular”. “I’ve gotta say his idea that we’re going to wrap ourselves around you – we don’t need that kind of language. We just need to stand together,” Duckworth said. “The US is not asking people to choose between the US and [China] … But we will make sure international norms are maintained and ask our friends to help us uphold them.” Duckworth, who is co-leading a bi-partisan delegation which also visited Taiwan, said the Trump administration “acts very quickly, but very incompetently”. “The point I’m making on this trip is that it’s not just about secretary Hegseth and the Trump administration,” she said. “Bipartisan support for the Indo Pacific in the legislature is actually growing.”",

    "title": "Australia’s trade minister says Trump plan to double steel and aluminium tariffs to 50% ‘not the act of a friend’",
    "article_text": "Australia’s trade minister, Don Farrell, has described Donald Trump’strade tariffsas “unjustified and not the act of a friend”, after the US president announced he would doubleimport duties on steel and aluminiumto 50%. Trump told a steelworkers rally in Pittsburgh that raising the tariff would “even further secure the steel industry in the United States. Nobody is going to get around that”. Ina social media poston Saturday, Trump clarified the increase from 25% to 50% would be effective from 4 June and would apply to steel and aluminium. Australia exports relatively little steel to the US. About 2.5% of US aluminium imports by volume come from Australia, but this is less than 10% of Australia’s total exports of the metal. Reiterating Australia’s stance on the tariffs, Farrell said on Saturday: “Australia’s position has been consistent and clear. These tariffs are unjustified and not the act of a friend. “They are an act of economic self-harm that will only hurt consumers and businesses who rely on free and fair trade. We will continue to engage and advocate strongly for the removal of the tariffs.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email The shadow trade minister, Kevin Hogan, said on Saturday that Trump’s announcement was concerning for Australian jobs. “The Albanese government needs to double its efforts to protect our steel industry and local jobs for our steelworkers,” he said. “We expect the United States to honour its obligations under the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement, just as Australia has always done. The strength of our economic partnership has been built on trust and mutual benefit, and any deviation from this agreement undermines the principles of free trade.” Hogan said the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, needed to personally meet Trump during the G7 talks in Canada taking place in two weeks “to develop a personal rapport with the United States president and protect Australian industries”. Hogan said: “The Coalition want the government to succeed because that is in the national interest.” Trump’s sweeping tariffs were initially blocked by a US court this week, which ruled them illegal, before the administrationwon a temporary pause on that ruling on Thursday. It is understood a national security provision – section 232 of theTrade Expansion Act– does give the US president authority to unilaterally raise tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. Marghanita Johnson, the chief executive of the Australian Aluminium Council, said a key concern was the potential for international trade flows to be distorted. The council would keep working with the government, she said. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion Mark Cain, the chief executive of industry group the Australian Steel Institute, said the increase in tariffs was disappointing. He said: “One of the concerns we have is that the subsequent disruptions to global steel trade could see Australia become a dumping ground for imported steel. And it could exacerbate the surge in imported low-priced steel that is damaging the industry.” In March, when the steel tariffs came into force, BlueScope Steel, which exports about 300,000 tonnes of steel a year to the US, said it was disappointed the industry had not received the same tariff exemption that was negotiated during Trump’s first term. The company produces more than 3m tonnes of steel each year at its Ohio plant. BlueScope said at the time it was working closely with the Australian government’s trade and diplomatic staff “to ensure the BlueScope investment proposition is fully understood”. Australian economist Prof Justin Wolfers, of the University of Michigan, told Guardian Australia the steel tariffs would probably have little effect on Australian industry, as demand for steel globally should allow companies to find other customers. He said: “We are talking about very small numbers of people [who work in the steel industry in the US]. But steel is used as an input for a broad array of manufacturing jobs. Steel will be more expensive – even American steel.” Wolfers pointed toprevious analysis of the impact of 2018 steel tariffsduring the first Trump administration, which found they created about 1,000 more steel jobs but about 75,000 jobs were lost from the wider manufacturing sector. Asked why Trump was implementing the increase, Wolfers said: “There are some questions better directed to a psychologist than an economist. Trump likes tariffs.”",

    "title": "Gambling company offered Melbourne man $25,000 on condition he withdraw complaint to regulator and be liable for ‘adverse media’",
    "article_text": "AMelbourneman says he was offered $25,000 by a gambling company on the condition that he withdraw a complaint to an industry regulator, agree to confidentiality provisions and indemnify them, including against adverse media coverage. Gordon Burns, 23, argues his 2022 betting frenzy with two bookmakers showed “consistent patterns of addictive behaviour” and alleges that no one from either company checked on him to minimise gambling harm. Burns, who lodged a complaint with the Northern Territory Racing and Wagering Commission (NTRWC), which regulates most online gambling companies in Australia, also alleges no one checked the source of his funds. The commission requires bookmakers “identify and respond to red flag behaviours” that indicate someone may be experiencing gambling harm. These red flags include someone increasing the amount and frequency of their deposits. Burns was 21 at the time of gambling with BetNation and BetDeluxe. Transaction data shows he made deposits of $10,000, $25,000 and $35,000 within eight minutes. Later the same day, he lodged three deposits worth $120,000 during a 17-minute period. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Shortly after lodging his complaint with the regulator in mid-March 2024, Burns received a WhatsApp message from a representative of the two bookmakers’ parent company, Amused Group. “Are you free for a brief call now?” the message said. “I wanted to discuss a settlement for your account.” When Burns asked how the representative had found his phone number, he was told someone at the regulator had shared it with them. BetDeluxe and BetNation were acquired by Amused Group in March 2023, a few months after the gambling in question, and Amused have said they did not acquire Burns’ account or “any liabilities associated with the conduct of the business before that date”. After the acquisition, Burns said he received an offerfrom Amused Group to settle his claims for $25,000, honouring an offer made to him under the previous owner, on the condition that he withdraw his complaint by the end of the day and agree to make no further complaints to the NTRWC or any other regulator. He also said the gambling company had told him that if the complaint proceeded with the regulator, the agreement and the financial offer would be void. He said he was told he would need to provide the company with an indemnity from all claims in relation to the subject of the dispute, including any adverse media. An Amused Group spokesperson did not comment on the specific allegations made by Burns nor the offer made to him “due to confidentiality and privacy considerations”. But they said the group “takes all customer complaints seriously and handles each matter in accordance with applicable laws”. The Consumer Action Law Centre’s chief executive, Stephanie Tonkin, said conditional settlement negotiations were common in many industries but expressed concern that they could be used to “silence victims and avoid scrutiny”. “In my view, [they] should be used in limited circumstances and should not prevent a complaint to a regulator,” Tonkin said. Lauren Levin, who has spent decades researching the harms of the gambling industry, said “in the majority of cases, the offer of quick cash proves overwhelming for people in difficult financial circumstances”. The Amused Group spokesperson said “confidentiality provisions are standard in many industries to provide finality and protect the privacy of all parties to a dispute”. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion “They are not intended to silence individuals or avoid regulatory oversight,” the spokesperson said. “In fact, such provisions often facilitate the resolution of complex and sensitive matters without the need for prolonged adversarial processes. “Amused Group remains committed to transparency, accountability, and the fair treatment of all our customers.” The company also said it was “committed to responsible gambling and customer wellbeing” and had “a dedicated team, systems, and policies in place to help identify and respond to potential indicators of gambling harm”. “We have invested heavily in responsible gambling measures, and believe our commitment in this area would compare favourably to any other operator in the market,” the Amused spokesperson said. Burns argues BetNation and BetDeluxe should have done more to protect him and that he did not withdraw his complaint because he wanted the regulator to investigate why, in his view, “so many red flags were ignored”. “The $25,000 might help me, but it is not going to help the next person that has suffered,” Burns said. Burns did not accept the settlement offer and says his complaint is still before the NTRWC. In a statement, a spokesperson for the regulator said it understood settlements were commonly offered by gambling companies. But they said this did not automatically prevent it from investigating serious allegations. “When the commission receives advice that a complaint is withdrawn due to the parties reaching a confidential settlement concerning the complaint, the commission undertakes an assessment to determine whether the subject matter of the complaint is sufficiently serious to warrant investigation and disciplinary action,” the spokesperson said. “There are a number of examples where the commission has disciplined a licensee after a complaint has been withdrawn.”",

    "article_text": "Just two of 30 European countries have set a date to stop their militaries from emitting planet-heating emissions, a Guardian analysis has found, raising concerns about the carbon cost of Europe’s coming rearmament wave. Austria and Slovenia are the only countries whose defence ministries have committed to reaching net zero military emissions, according to an analysis of 30 European countries, with only about one-third having worked out the size of their carbon footprint. The findings confirm a “longstanding blind spot” in assessments of global emissions, said Florian Krampe, who leads climate research at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri). “Ignoring military emissions is not just concerning with regard to climate change,” he said. “It ignores the growing recognition of climate change being a serious security risk for Europe and beyond.” Researchers estimate the world’s militaries account for 5.5% of global emissions – more than flying but less than steel making – but international climate treaties do not require governments to report their emissions. Campaigners have argued this “military exceptionalism” will harm long-term security by further heating the planet and increasing conflicts over resources such as water and food. The analysis of military climate plans from the 27 EU member states and the UK, Norway and Switzerland – all of whom have committed to reaching net zero emissions by 2050 – found nearly all their defence ministries lacked short-term targets to sharply cut emissions and long-term goals to bring their net climate impact to zero. The defence ministries of countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, Greece and the UK said they were “contributing” to their national net zero goals but had not set their own targets to do so. “Our overriding goal is and remains the preservation of peace,” said a spokesperson for the German Ministry of Defence. “Climate protection must not come at the expense of the performance of our weapon systems.” The British Royal Air Force has set itself an ambitious net zero target of 2040 – a decade earlier than the country’s national climate pledge – but other parts of the armed forces have not. A UK government spokesperson said the defence ministry would contribute to the country’s national climate goal “while maintaining or enhancing operational advantage”. Some countries’ armed forces have set net zero targets that cover only part of their output. Belgium’s defence ministry is targeting climate-neutral infrastructure by 2040, while Portugal’s aims to become carbon neutral in “mission support activities” by 2050. “Fully replacing all weapon systems or offsetting their emissions is economically unfeasible, which is why efforts are focused on support areas where this objective is attainable,” a spokesperson for the Portuguese defence ministry said. Other countries have set 2030 targets but not set a date to reach net zero. Norway plans to cut emissions by 20% from 2019 levels by the end of the decade, while Ireland is aiming for a 51% cut from 2016-18 levels. Campaigners say the efforts being made to cut military carbon emissions greatly lag behind other sectors of the economy and are likely to be insufficient to compensate for a rise in spending on fuel, infrastructure and equipment. Ellie Kinney, a military emissions campaigner at the Conflict and Environment Observatory, said there had been “considerable momentum” behind decarbonising militaries over the last two years that was now being threatened by Europe’s rush to rearm. “Military decarbonisation is essential for our future security,” she said. “We call on governments to set clear emissions reduction targets and publish thorough and transparent reporting of military greenhouse gas emissions.” While the military’s carbon intensity is likely to fall as the global economy grows cleaner, experts say the heavy fossil fuel consumption of vehicles such as planes, ships and tanks will require serious effort to clean up. Military sources say many actions that are being taken today – such as investing in solar panels, heat pumps and fuel-efficient vehicles – are driven by a desire to save money, though factors such as cutting pollution, reducing emissions and increasing energy independence also play a role. A spokesperson for the Austrian defence ministry, which is targeting climate neutrality in 2040, said it had made the most progress in decarbonising buildings through actions such as buying green electricity and expanding district heating. “However, reducing emissions in military mobility remains a major challenge, at least until civilian technological advancements become applicable to military operations,” they said. The defence ministries of Bulgaria, Hungary and Slovakia did not respond to requests for comment. Italy, Spain and the Czech Republic declined to comment. Total military spending in Europe rose by 17% to $693bn in 2024, according to data from Sipri, as part of a rearmament wave that comes after years of European Nato members failing to meet a spending commitment of 2% of their GDP. The political shift, which was triggered by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, has taken on new urgency in recent months after Donald Trump has cast doubt on US support for the defence of Ukraine. The challenge is ensuring that these defence investments do not further weaken climate commitments, said Krampe. “The defence sector can no longer be a blind spot in climate action,” he said. “Rising military spending should drive green innovation, not lock in carbon dependence.”",

    "title": "Polish presidential candidates neck and neck on eve of runoff vote",
    "article_text": "Poles will cast their votes on Sunday in the closest presidential runoff since the fall of communism, in an election that pits two different visions of the nation against each other.In Poland’s previous election in 2020, the conservative populist incumbent Andrzej Dudanarrowly wonthe second-round vote against the pro-Europe mayor of Warsaw, Rafał Trzaskowski, by 51% to 49%. This time it could be even closer. Polls show the difference between Trzaskowski and the nationalist rightwing historian Karol Nawrocki, who is backed by the Law and Justice party (PiS), which ruledPolandfrom 2015 to 2023, to be within the margin of error. At stake is whether the coalition government led by Donald Tusk, Trzaskowski’s political patron, will be able to pursue its progressive agenda or see it further blocked by a critical opposition president armed with the power to veto laws. In Siekierczyn, a rural municipality with 4,265 residents across eight villages in the south-west of Poland, the first round was decided by a single vote, catapulting the hitherto unknown area into the spotlight. “You probably often heard ‘my vote won’t change anything’. But look at Siekierczyn,” the winner, Trzaskowski,said in a social media video, rallying voters before the runoff. Noticeboards in the village are plastered with posters of candidates, and the mayor, Dariusz Furdykoń, 48, cherishes the attention that comes with the close result. The area faces challenges with rural revitalisation and energy transition, he says. In 2023, he turned a neglected bathing pond into a colourful outdoor playground; a new sports hall is to open this year. But he worries about depopulation as more people died (46) than were born (26) last year, and younger people leave for cities or seek work in Germany or the Czech Republic. Emotions are running high, he admits. “These differences come out at the dining table, during first communion, Christmas or Easter. The rift is between older, often less-educated people, and younger ones, who have been out and about,” he says. “Some are voters, others are believers. But what can you do? You need to talk with them, try to find a way forward.” In the first round, about 60% of residents cast votes. “But the weather was awful,” Furdykoń says. On Sunday, he hopes to see more come out; the municipality will even run a special bus service to polling stations. In the early afternoon, the sleepy village turns into a hive of political campaigning as a group of Nawrocki votersmeet to chatto the conservative TV channel Republika. Standing by their pickup emblazoned with Nawrocki’s poster, Henryk, a former councillor, and Janina Wójcik say they want “a candidate who, however lofty it sounds, serves Poland’s interests best”. They feel that “someone wants to take our freedom, our statehood,” as they worry about plans to create “a European army” and EU green policies. In contrast, the Donald Trump-backed Nawrocki is a Catholic and will guarantee their state pension payments and free prescriptions, they say. Others rush to point out that Trzaskowski only came first because of a polling station inside a prison, where he won by 77 votes. “People in the village didn’t vote for him; prisoners did. Not something to brag about, is it?” says Teresa Zembik, 62. Her husband, Wojciech, 63, is head of the local PiS branch and he doesn’t mince words. Political conflict “runs through families here”, he says. “These are not just political views, it’s a continuation of the war, and Poland is at stake. One group wants to fight for Poland, the other to destroy it in the interests of Russia and Germany.” Sign up toHeadlines Europe A digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week day after newsletter promotion As the group crosses the road from the parish church, another man splits from it and tears down a Trzaskowski banner on a nearby house. Its resident Monika misses the drama. When told about the incident by children, she pulls her phone out. “I will get another one up,” she laughs. She wants a “tolerant, clean and peaceful Poland” and rejects the dismissive tone about prison voters. “Folks make mistakes but then make amends. People are people.” Her daughter got her dad to vote for the first time this year. Maybe that won the first round, she wonders. She is not the only one to stake that claim. Picking up children from school, Mariola says her son turned 18 recently and voted for the first time, so it’s his vote that swung it for Trzaskowski. “I want to get reforms going,” she says, pointing to women’s rights – “the right to choose” – in particular. At a local supermarket, two Nawrocki voters, Dominik and Janusz, joke about another neighbour who also says he decided the vote. But they are tired of “dirty campaign tricks” against their candidate. They shrug off that Nawrocki took part in an organised fight between 140 football hooligans20 years ago (he called it an act of “noble combat”), and distrust reports he was allegedly involved in procuring sex workers while working as a student security guard at a hotel (a claim he strongly denies). Instead, they focus on the here and now, and want Nawrocki to lower national insurance payments for entrepreneurs. As president he could propose legislation, but he wouldn’t have a majority in parliament – at least for now. Despite the fevered atmosphere, there are still some voters who are yet to make up their minds. Wioletta, 44, voted in the first round for the libertarian far-right candidateSławomir Mentzen, who came third, and she doesn’t like the remaining candidates. “But I have to go. I’ll decide at the polling station,” she says. Adam, 40, says: “None of them convinced me yet.” He plans to watch YouTube and read up over the weekend. Aleks Szczerbiak, a professor of politics at the University of Sussex, said it was “very, very close,” with 5% yet to pick a side. It “might mean you get … disillusioned government supporters coming out in spite of everything” for Trzaskowski, or older voters who skipped the first round mobilise to back Nawrocki, or see another minor movement that could ultimately decide the result, he said. The diaspora vote could play a role, too, with about 700,000 registered voters abroad, including 185,000 in the UK. Ben Stanley, an associate professor at SWPS University in Warsaw, said: “The outcome is impossible to predict. There are too many moving parts, and even the slightest change on the day could tip the balance.” For what it’s worth, it is expected to rain again in Siekierczyn on Sunday.",

    "title": "More than €1bn in EU funds used in discriminatory projects, report says",
    "article_text": "Hundreds of millions inEuropean Unionfunds have been used in projects that violate the rights of marginalised communities, a report alleges, citing initiatives such as segregated housing for Roma, residential institutions for children with disabilities and holding centres for asylum seekers. The report, based on information compiled by eight NGOs from across Europe, looks at 63 projects in six countries. Together these projects are believed to have receivedmore than €1bnin funding from the European Union, laying bare a seemingly “low understanding” of fundamental rights across the bloc, according to one of the authors of the EU-funded report. While the report focused on six countries, those behind the analysis suggested that similar projects were probably widespread across the EU. “This is really just the tip of the iceberg,” said Ines Bulic of the European Network on Independent Living, describing it as “unacceptable” that funds provided by European citizens could have been used to amplify the discrimination and segregation of communities that already ranked among the bloc’s most marginalised. She pointed to a school in Greece for people with disabilities and special needs, which had been part of a wider EU investment in special vocational schools, as an example. “What we would like to see is investment in inclusive education, which is very much needed in all of the EU, such as accessible schools, investments in support teachers and other services that allow children to attend regular schools,” she said. Another example she gave was of an institution for children with disabilities in Romania, which had received €2.5m in funding, where children were being sent to live rather than being provided with support to remain with their families. “This of great concern. It is a right of all children, disabled or not, to grow up in their families.” Other examples highlighted in the report include the construction of social housing for Roma in Romania on the edge of a city. Far from any public service, the homes are built from shipyard containers and do not meet the minimum requirements for thermal or sound insulation and sanitation, the report notes. Several reception centres for asylum seekers across Greece were also flagged for their extremely remote locations and poor living conditions. Those behind the report cited several reasons to explain how millions of euros had ended up being allocated to projects seen as discriminatory. One was a seemingly “low understanding” of fundamental rights across some governments and parts of the EU, said Andor Urmos of Bridge EU, the organisation that had worked with various civil society groups across Europe to prepare the report. “That’s what we need to tackle in the future,” he said. “To have a common view, a common understanding that building a segregated school for Roma children is a violation of fundamental rights, as is building a residential institution for people with disabilities or locking up people in reception centres like what is happening in Greece.” The findings dovetail with a raft of recent reports. This week, the Council of Europesaid that school segregationwas resulting in lower-quality education for Roma, noting that the high concentration of Roma children in certain schools “appears to be the result of residential segregation, but also of continuing practices by school authorities to educate Roma children in separate classes or buildings”. Last year an EU agencyfoundthat the number of people with disabilitieswho were livingin segregated,at times harmful,settings had increased in many EU member states, while civil society organisationshave repeatedlyaccused EU-funded refugee centres of violating people’s rights. When contacted, the European Commission said it was aware of the findings of this week’s report and was looking into it. “It is important to highlight that the commission does not fund any organisation that does not fully respect fundamental rights and values,” a spokesperson said. “In case of violation of the applicable conditions, we have means to terminate the cooperation and recover the money, as necessary.” The report listed projects that were under shared management, meaning the commission relied on national authorities to ensure the legality and regularity of operations, it said. “Both the EU and its member states must continuously ensure that projects which are incompatible with European values or pursue an illegal agenda, do not receive support from government and European funds,” the spokesperson added. The report highlighted serious shortcomings in how EU funds are being managed and monitored, said Steven Allen of the Validity Foundation, a disability rights organisation that also contributed to the document. “We can see that both the EU member states, as well as the European Commission, are failing to prevent EU taxpayers money from facilitating and financing serious violations of the rights of multiple marginalised populations,” he said. The report’s release was carefully timed to come before planning takes place for the EU’s next budget, set to take effect in 2028. Its findings made it clear that the voices of those who often go unheard needed to be included in the decision-making, said Allen. Doing so could help unlock the transformative powers of EU funding, offering the potential to build inclusive education systems or overhaul areas such as public housing,where grievanceshave been linked to the rise of the far right. “EU funds do have the potential to be a powerful tool and to provide real, tangible benefits of the EU project to the most marginalised populations on the continent today,” he said. “And they can indeed be used as an antidote against the rise of creeping nationalism and far-right extremist politics. The funds must be better targeted.”",

    "title": "Germany vows to step up militarily but rhetoric may struggle to match reality",
    "article_text": "Within days of Russia launching its full-scale invasion ofUkrainein 2022, Olaf Scholz announced aZeitenwende, or historical “turning point”. The then German chancellor promised a security transformation by increasing defence spending, sending more aid to Ukraine, taking a tougher approach to authoritarian states and rapidly reducing Germany’s dependence on Russian energy. It was a psychological turning point for a country haunted by its Nazi past but now expected to step up – as the biggest economic power inEurope– to a threat to the continent. However, two years later, the German Council on Foreign Relations publisheda reportsaying Scholz’s transformation had yet “to deliver meaningful change”. So with a new chancellor, canZeitenwendebe for real this time? There is no lack of action, or rhetoric. Since taking office three weeks ago, Friedrich Merz has vowed Germany will have the strongest conventional army in Europe, hosted the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in Berlin and visited Kyiv, and attendedthe unveiling of German troops in Lithuania, the first permanent stationing of German troops on foreign soil since the second world war. Critically, he released the debt brake, so unleashing badly needed spending on the Bundeswehr, Germany’s military. In his opening speech as chancellor he promised to provide all necessary financial resources for this. Germany’s allies expect this, Merz said in his government statement, “indeed, they practically demand it”. He announced his intention to transformGermanyfrom a “dormant to a leading middle power”. He has already slipped easily into that role. In Lithuania he said “the protection of Vilnius is the protection of Berlin. And our common freedom does not end at a geopolitical line – it ends where we stop defending it”. This from a country that as recently as 2011 saw its federal president resign under criticism for suggesting military action might be necessary in an emergency to “protect our interests”. But not everything is going smoothly. On Monday, Merz had announced there were no longer any restrictions on the weapons supplied to Ukraine by Britain, France, Germany and the US, and that Ukraine could now do “long-range fire”. The implication was that Germany’s prized 500km-range Taurus missiles was to be finally made available, as indeed Merz had vowed while in opposition. This meant Moscow was vulnerable to these bunker-busting bombs, as were Crimea’s strategic bridges. A response from Moscow was immediate. Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, said: “To hear from the current German leader that Germany will regain its position as the leading military power in Europe just after we celebrated the 80th anniversary of the defeat of Hitler’s anniversary is quite symptomatic. History apparently teaches these people nothing.” The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has reminded the world of the Nazi past of Merz’s father, and warned yet again of the threat of world war three. The reality of what Merz is offering Ukraine is somewhat more complex, as is what he can do to meet Nato’s wider demands of an expanding German army. The day after his “no limits” commitment he was forced to qualify his statement by saying this had been the case for a long time, and then prevaricating on whether he would meet his opposition pledge to supply Taurus. The strong suspicion is that the finance minister, Lars Klingbeil, of the Social Democratic party – Merz’s coalition partners – blocked Merz. The episode was reminiscent of the paralysis that disfigured the previous coalition government. It may also be in office that Merz has been made more aware of complexities including the need for Ukrainians to have six months’ training on their use, and the implications of the German soldiers giving training inside Ukraine. The government has now retreated to a position of strategic ambiguity on what he will do, and focused on offering Ukraine a partnership to jointly build missiles. Merz’s allies said the episode was not entirely futile. Thomas Röwekamp, of the Christian Democratic Union, who is chair of the Bundestag’s defence committee, told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper that by rejecting range limitations, Merz had “removed one argument preventing the Taurus from being delivered”. This is not yet a “commitment” to the delivery of Taurus but the reason for the previous refusal had been “removed”. The wider risk for Merz is that his rhetoric does not match the reality of what he can deliver, and rebuilding a German army after decades of neglect will take many years. For instance in 2021, Germany agreed by 2030 to provide 10 brigades to Nato – units usually comprising about 5,000 troops. It currently has eight brigades and is building up the ninth in Lithuania to be ready from 2027. Overall, it has approximately 182,000 soldiers serving in the force, plus, according to the defence minister, Boris Pistorius, 60,000 available reservists. By comparison, during the cold war up to 500,000 soldiers served in the Bundeswehr, which had access to about 800,000 reservists. By 2031, the number of active soldiers is to grow to 203,000. Still, however long it takes, and whatever the missteps, Germany’s partners have already mentally adjusted to the return of Germany as the premier military force in Europe.",

    "title": "Worried about weed: should London follow New York and decriminalise cannabis?",
    "article_text": "The last timeLondondabbled in decriminalising cannabis, it brought one part of the capital to a brief but giddy high. In 2001, an enterprising Scotland Yard borough commander empowered his officers in Lambeth to caution rather than arrest those carrying small amounts of the drug for personal use – freeing them, according to the scheme’s proponents, to concentrate on more serious crimes. The softly-softly approach wascontroversialin some political and policing quarters, but wildly popular in the borough – and some of its results were dramatic. Over six months,more than 2,500 hours of police officers’ timewere saved on processing cannabis arrests, while arrests for dealing class A drugs rose by almost a fifth. Non-drug crimefell by 9%overall, withsharpdeclines in burglaries and street robberies. Almost two-thirds thought it had improved relations between the police and the community. The Lambeth experiment would end after a year, however, after the man behind it, Brian Paddick, was transferred following newspaper allegations about his private life –later acknowledged to be false. Lambeth’s residents may have been dismayed, organising public meetings and petitions to call for Paddick’s reinstatement (“He’s not a very naughty boy, he’s the Messiah,” readone poster) butMetropolitan police plansto introduce the measures across the capital were quietly shelved. Almost a quarter of a century on, could decriminalisation be back on the cards for London? Sadiq Khan this weekindicated his support, after an independent commission into cannabis regulation, promised by the mayor in his 2021 election manifesto,published its findings. Classifying cannabis as a class B drug was disproportionate to its harms, it said, and the sanctions users were subject to for personal possession “cannot be justified”. Instead, the panel recommended, “natural” (but not synthetic) forms of the drug should be re-classified, allowing Londoners to use small quantities without penalty. They did not, however, call for full legalisation: those producing or supplying the drug would still be breaking the law. The move, the report said, would have the important added benefit of addressing racial inequalities in the way the Met polices cannabis possession by stop and search. Black people are nine times more likely to be stopped and searched by the police, accordingto 2021 figures– but are no more likely to be carrying cannabis. “It is clear a fundamental reset is required,” said the commission’s chair, Lord Falconer, and Khan agreed: “I’ve long been clear that we need fresh thinking on how to reduce the substantial harms associated with drug-related crime in our communities.” As both men know, however, the mayor has no power to change drugs laws in the capital, and the government was quick to slap down any such suggestion. “We have no intention of reclassifying cannabis from a class B substance under the Misuse ofDrugsAct,” the Home Office said in a statement. The fact that, 24 years after the Lambeth experiment, the debate over cannabis feels so familiar may be a feature of the drug’s ambivalent place in British consciousness. Legislators may be immovable on the issue today, but cannabis was briefly reclassified as a less harmful class C drug in 2004, only to be moved back to class B five years later – arguably, the report suggests, for political reasons. The British public are broadly in favour of loosening restrictions – but not overwhelmingly so. AYouGov pollthis week found 54% supported decriminalising cannabis possession for personal use, with 34% opposed and 13% unsure. Askedif decriminalisation would lead to more drug use, almost exactly the same proportion (42%) said yes as those who said it would make no difference (43%). While almost a third of people have tried it at some point,cannabis use is actually falling across England and Wales– particularly sharply in London, where the proportion of those aged 16-59 who had used the drug in the past year was 6.2% in 2022-3, compared with 14.3% in 2001-2. From a health point of view, discussion of the harms of cannabis is nuanced. “If you’re looking at harm at a population level, the vast majority of the millions of people who’ve ever smoked cannabis in this country since the Beatles have not come to any real harm,” noted Harry Shapiro, director of the drug information serviceDrugWise. But while most health professionals agree that a low or moderate use of the drug is likely to be minimally harmful for most people, others are anxious to emphasise the risk to a minority, especially from the much stronger forms of the drug that increasingly dominate the market. Dr Emily Finch, chair of the addictions faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCPsych), said: “It’s obvious to say that many people with cannabis have no problems at all, but there are several circumstances where it can be incredibly dangerous.” Most seriously, for a small proportion, she continued, cannabis greatly increases the risks of developing psychosis, but even among other users, there can be other risks. “People say – would tell you – that cannabis isn’t addictive. There’s really good evidence that that isn’t true, and that there is a significant group, maybe 5% of cannabis users, who do become dependent on cannabis use.” In addition, she said: “We need to understand that it’s not helpful for 11- to 15-year-olds to use large amounts of cannabis.” About a third of people who use cannabis develop a problem with the drug at some point in their lives, according to the RCPsych. The drug’s increasing potency in the market has significantly increased the risk of it causing psychosis and other harms, agrees Sir Robin Murray, professor of psychiatric research at King’s College London. “People need to know that cannabis, particularly modern cannabis, is a risky drug to take every day … Probably a couple of joints at the weekend is not going to do you much harm, but certainly daily cannabis carries an increased risk. If you take skunk-like cannabis every day, you’re about nine or 10 times more likely to go psychotic.” Finch broadly rejects the suggestion that cannabis is a gateway drug to stronger substances, however: “For some people, it might be part of a pattern of overall illicit drug use but I don’t think that’s necessarily the case. For many people, it isn’t.” Perhaps the most striking thing about Britain’s agonised discussions of its drug laws is the degree to which the country is increasingly an international outlier. In recent years,Portugal,South Africa, andLuxembourg, theAustralian Capital Territoryand many states in the US are among places to have partially decriminalised or fully legalised recreational cannabis use and, in some cases, permitted the development of a new, entirely legal market. “Cannabis is a commodity, it is circulated in markets and has a supply chain,” said Toby Seddon, professor of social science at University College London, who has researched international models of regulation and advised Khan’s commission. “The question we have as societies is: how do you want to regulate this? For the last 100 years, we’ve regulated it through using the criminal law. And we’ve observed how that’s worked and not worked. “If you prohibit something, you’re trying to reduce it to as close to zero as possible. And that manifestly hasn’t worked because it’s still really easy under prohibition to get hold of cannabis.” Which has led many other countries to try another way. Non-medical cannabis islegal in Canada, where the federal government controls production licences but each territory can decide how it manages its sale. InUruguay, the first country to legalise cannabis sales in 2013 to counter drug-related crime, there is a state-run, not-for-profit model, in which the government issues licences, sets prices and oversees the potency of products. Germany legislated last year to permit individual consumption and cultivation, though critics say its implementation has beenhampered by red tape. A similar critique has also beenlevelled in New York, where recreational marijuana use waslegalised in 2021. For a measure of how far apart the UK and US are on this issue, it is striking to recall that Kamala Harris, three weeks before last year’s presidential election,pledged to fully legaliserecreational marijuana at the federal level if elected;Donald Trump too has saidhe would support the measure in Florida. Any move towards that position in Britain, let alone Seddon’s suggestion that the UK should nationalise cannabis production and control its sale as a state-run enterprise, seems inconceivable at present, as he acknowledged. As a result of that, he said, “you might think, this [report] is just a waste of time. “But you could also make a case that these things, in the long run, contribute to turning the dial a little bit,” he added. A similar critique, Seddon pointed out, was made ofa major study in Canadain the 1970s that recommended legalising personal use and was largely ignored by the then prime minister, Pierre Trudeau. Decades later, his son Justin steered a similar measure into law.",

    "title": "Vapers warned not to stockpile ‘fire risk’ disposables before UK ban",
    "article_text": "Vapers have been warned not to stockpile soon-to-be-banned disposables before Sunday’s outright ban as they “pose a significant fire risk”. The Local Government Association (LGA) said users were stocking up on single-use e-cigarettes while they could, as shops would face fines for selling them after the ban takes effect. And although the temptation from consumers may be to hoard their favourite flavours, the LGA said the lithium batteries inside could become a hazard if not stored correctly. David Fothergill, the chair of the LGA’s community wellbeing board, said: “We want to remind businesses to ensure all remaining stocks of disposable vapes are sold, and only buying vapes that follow the new regulations. “If businesses have any single-use vapes in their possession after Sunday, they will not be able to sell them to shoppers and must ensure they are stored and disposed of safely. “We would also urge caution to anyone stockpiling disposable vapes. Failing to store disposable vapes correctly could cost lives, given the significant fire risk they pose.” According to research by Haypp, an online nicotine retailer, 82% of disposable vape users are planning to stockpile. The ban is designed to reduce youth vaping and tackle the environmental damage caused by millions of the devices being thrown away each week. Retailers have been told to clear remaining stock and ensure leftover products are disposed of safely. Material Focus, a non-profit focused on improving electrical recycling in the UK, said 5 million disposable vapes were incorrectly discarded each week in the UK in 2024 – nearly four times higher than the previous year. Many contain lithium-ion batteries, posing fire risks and leaching toxic chemicals into the environment when binned incorrectly. Scott Butler, the executive director of Material Focus, said: “Thirteen vapes every second are being incorrectly gotten rid of, and that’s a huge environmental pollution problem. The liquid in many vape batteries is toxic and could run into waterways, as well as harm animals. It’s also a significant fire risk because lithium batteries are known to cause fires when crushed with general waste.” “Vapes are a huge environmental pollution problem, so we hope the ban goes some way to reducing waste,” he added. Disposables are also the most common device used by children who vape, with more than 20% of UK children having tried vaping, according to Action onSmokingand Health (ASH). The devices are often sold in sweet flavours and brightly coloured packaging, which campaigners say appeal to underage users. Under the new rules, only vapes that are rechargeable, refillable and fitted with a replaceable coils (the heating element) will be allowed. Experts worry the industry may have already found ways to sidestep the UK government’s ban, while cheaper vape imports rerouted from the US risk pushing down prices further. There are also concerns that newUS tariffs on Chinese imports may increase cheap vape shipments to the UK, making enforcement of the ban more difficult. Hazel Cheeseman, the deputy chief executive of ASH, said: “There’s already a sizeable illegal market. Whether the disposable vapes ban makes that risk greater, I guess that depends on how quickly the legitimate retailers are making products available to people that suit their needs. “People don’t necessarily want to go looking for illegal products if they can buy legitimate products in their local corner shop or supermarket that meet their needs, why would they go off looking for dodgy ones?” There are also concerns about policing the vapes at borders and ports, said Kate Pike, the lead officer for vaping at the Chartered Trading Standards Institute, who stressed that stronger import controls would be essential. “We have extra funding to do more at ports and borders … From our point of view, it’s important, because obviously it makes a big difference if we can stop [illegal vapes entering the country],” she said.",

    "title": "TfL blocks ads calling on people to lobby MPs to decriminalise abortion",
    "article_text": "Transport for London has blocked adverts that urge people to lobby their MPs to vote to decriminalise abortion from running on its network because it claims they could bring the police and City Hall into disrepute. Parliament is expected tovote on whether to decriminalise abortionin England and Wales in the coming weeks, with amendments tabled to the criminal justice bill seeking to change the law. The adverts from the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (Bpas) charity, which have been approved by theAdvertising Standards Authority, have appeared on display boards across England and Wales. They feature anonymised case studies of women who have been investigated by police, and in some cases prosecuted, after terminations or pregnancy loss. “The language is not inflammatory, derogatory or hateful,” Bpas said in a letter toTfL, seen by the Guardian. “It is an accurate representation of real women’s experiences. It is intentionally simple, to the point, with a clear democratic call to action.” In 2024, campaign material from Dignity in Dying was displayed on the TfL network, including in Westminster tube station. In the same year, it allowed pro-choice campaign material on buses across London, sponsored by Doctors for Choice andAbortionTalk, which featured the slogan “abortion is healthcare, not a crime”. At the time, a TfL spokesperson said: “We reviewed this advertising campaign against both our advertising policy and the Committee ofAdvertisingPractice (CAP) code, and it was found to be compliant.” Bpas said it had requested “an immediate in-depth explanation of the decision to reject our material” from the transport body. In a response from TfL, also seen by the Guardian, Chris Reader, the organisation’s head of commercial media, told the charity: “The reason for the rejection is that the proposed advertisement makes serious allegations about the police. “The Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime (Mopac) is a member of the GLA group and one of its functions is to hold the Metropolitan police service (MPS) commissioner to account for the police service inLondon.” He added that “because Mopac’s functions in respect of the MPS are to some extent regulatory”, the “nature of the copy could bring Mopac into disrepute, given its responsibilities in relation to the MPS”. Bpas’s chief executive, Heidi Stewart, said the charity intended to appeal against the decision by the transport body. “At a pivotal moment for abortion law reform in this country, TfL regulations have silenced the voices of women who have been left utterly traumatised by our archaic legislation and by those enforcing it,” Stewart said. “This cannot be allowed to happen again.Womendeserve to have their stories told – and the public has a right to hear them. We will be challenging this decision at the highest levels.” Tonia Antoniazzi, one of the Labour MPs putting forward an amendment aiming to change the law, said she was “stunned” by the decision to ban the adverts from the network, adding it was an attempt to “silence desperate women’s voices and dodge accountability”. Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion She added: “In the last month, we’ve heard how police forced through the prosecution of a woman for abortion offences, have issued guidance telling police to search the homes of women who’ve had stillbirths, and that decisions about enforcement on abortion are made at the highest levels of the Met. “It’s not hard to see why they wouldn’t want the public to know. It’s not these women’s stories that bring the police into disrepute – it’s their own actions.” Antoniazzi’s amendment, which would remove women from the criminal law related to abortion in England and Wales, is backed by charities, trade unions, and medical colleges, including the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists as well as Bpas. “The police cannot be trusted with abortion law – nor can the CPS or the wider criminal justice system,” she said. “My amendment NC1 to the crime and policing bill will give us the urgent change we need to protect women.” A separate amendment, put forward by another Labour backbencher, Stella Creasy, seeks to decriminalise abortion, as well as write into law a human right to access abortion. A TfL spokesperson said: “The proposed advertisement did not comply with TfL advertising policy because it made negative references about the police.”",

    "title": "UK forging ahead with US trade talks, despite court block on Trump’s tariffs",
    "article_text": "British officials are forging ahead in their trade talks with the US despite a recent court decision overturning many of Donald Trump’s tariffs, and hope to have a deals covering cars, metals and aeroplane parts in place within weeks. A team of British negotiators spent much of last week in Washington talking to their American counterparts about how to implement the deal was signed earlier this month, including how quickly it can be passed by parliament and Congress. The talks come despitea ruling last weekby a federal court overturning Trump’s blanket 10% tariffs, which Downing Street believes will eventually be overruled by the president’s allies on the supreme court. But on Thursday night, an appeals court paused the ruling while it looks more closely at the arguments – allowing Trump’s administration to keep them in place. One government source said: “Some countries are viewing the court ruling as an indication that they were right not to negotiate over tariffs. We’re taking the opposite view, and trying to get this deal implemented as soon as possible.” A government spokesperson said: “The UK was the first country to secure a deal with the US in a move that will protect British business and jobs across key sectors, from autos to steel. “We are working to ensure that businesses can benefit from the deal as quickly as possible and will confirm next steps in due course.” The US presidentannounced the US-UK trade dealearlier this month from the Oval Office, calling it “very special for the UK and special for the United States”. Trump surprised Downing Street with the timing of his announcement, informing Keir Starmer just hours before he made it, with many of the finer details still to be ironed out. Under theterms of the agreement, for example, British car companies will be allowed to export 100,000 vehicles a year at a 10% tariff rate. But the deal does not set out how the Americans will view cars assembled in the UK with a considerable proportion of parts made in other countries, nor how parts themselves will be treated. While the details are being fleshed out, some British companies are being forced by their American customers to reduce their prices, while others say they are simply not exporting at all. Earlier this week, a federal court ruled many of Trump’s tariffs were illegal, and that he should first have sought the approval of Congress. But while that ruling applied to the 10% rate Trump has applied to products from across the world, it did not apply to the higher 25% rate he has imposed on cars, steel and aluminium. Downing Street has decided to continue negotiating with the US as if the court ruling did not apply, not least because British officials believe it is likely to be struck out by the supreme court, which is dominated by conservatives. Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion On Friday night, Trump unexpectedly announced he would bedoubling foreign tariffs on steel and aluminium imports to 50%. It was not immediately clear how the announcement would affect the trade agreement negotiated earlier this month that saw tariffs on UK steel and aluminium reduced to zero. Last week, a UK team landed in Washington, including the prime minister’s business adviser, Varun Chandra, the business department’s head of trade relations, Kate Joseph, and the deputy national security adviser, Jonathan Black. Michael Ellam, the senior Cabinet Office official who played a major role in getting the deal signed, is now concentrating on the EU reset deal, one source said. The team spent much of last week talking to Howard Lutnick, the US commerce secretary, Jamieson Greer, the US trade representative, and Brooke Rollins, the US agriculture secretary. Rollinshas been pushingfor the UK to open up to more US agricultural and food products, though Starmer has insisted he is not willing to reduce welfare and safety standards to do so. Officials are hoping car tariffs will be dropped in the next two weeks, while steel and aluminium ones could take a few weeks longer. They also believe the US will reduce tariffs on British-made aeroplane parts almost to zero, having promised to give the UK a “significantly preferential outcome” when deciding tariffs on future products. Discussions about pharmaceutical products, which account for approximately £7bn worth of exports to the US, are still going on, however, given Trump has not yet said what tariffs he intends to impose on the sector. The talks with the US are continuing at the same time as officials get closer to a controversial £1.6bn trade deal with Gulf countries. The Guardian revealed on Friday that that deal contained no concrete provisions on human rights, modern slavery or the environment.",

    "title": "Trump announces 50% steel tariffs and hails ‘blockbuster’ deal with Japan",
    "article_text": "Donald Trump announced on Friday he was doubling foreign tariffs on steel imports to 50%, as he celebrated a “blockbuster” agreement for Japan-based Nippon Steel’s to invest in US Steel during a rally inPennsylvania. Surrounded by men in orange hardhats at a US Steel plant in West Mifflin, Trump unveiled the tariff rate increase, declaring that the dramatic hike would “even further secure the steel industry in the United States”. “Nobody is going to get around that,” Trump said, of the tariff rate hike from what was 25%. In a social media post after the conclusion of his remarks, Trump announced that the 50% tariffs on steel would also apply to imported aluminum and would take effect on 4 June. “This will be yet another BIG jolt of great news for our wonderful steel and aluminum workers,” he declared in the post. It was not immediately clear how the announcement would affect the trade dealnegotiated earlier this monththat saw tariffs on UK steel and aluminum reduced to zero. Trump’s Friday tariffs announcement came a day after a federal appeals court temporarily allowed his tariffs to remain in effect staying a decision by a UStrade courtthat blocked the president from imposing the duties. The trade court ruling, however, does not impede the president’s ability to unilaterally raise tariffs on steel imports, an authoritygrantedunder a national security provision called section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. The precise relationship between Nippon Steel and US Steel raised questions on Friday, even for some of Trump’s allies. The president has thrown his full support behind the deal, months after insisting he was “totally against” a $14.9bn bid by Nippon Steel for its US rival. The United Steelworkers union had previously urged Trump to reject Nippon’s bid, dismissing the Japanese firm’s commitments to invest in the US as “flashy promises” and claiming it was “simply seeking to undercut our domestic industry from the inside”. Speaking to steelworkers,Trumpinsisted that US Steel would “stay an American company” after what he is now calling “a partnership” with Nippon, the Japanese firm that offered $14.9bn for its US rival. ButUS Steel’s websitelinks to a standalone site with the combined branding of the two companies that featuresa statementdescribing the transaction as “US Steel’s agreement to be acquired by NSC”. On thewebsite touting the deal, there were also multiple references to “Nippon Steel’s acquisition of US Steel” and the “potential sale of US Steel to Nippon Steel”. Even pro-Trump commentators on Fox expressed bafflement over the exact nature of the deal. “This is being described as ‘a partnership’, this deal between Nippon and US Steel – but then it’s described as an acquisition on the US Steel website,” Fox host Laura Ingrahampointed outon her Friday night show. She asked a guest from another pro-Trump outlet, Breitbart: “Who owns the majority stake in this company?” When the guest said he did not know, Ingraham suggested Trump might not be aware of the details. “I don’t know if he was fully informed about the terms of the deal. We just don’t know.” Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden, hadblockedNippon’s acquisition, citing national security concerns, during his final weeks in office. During his remarks at the rally, Trump gloated that the Nippon investment would once again make the American steelmaker “synonymous with greatness”. He said protections were included to “ensure that all steel workers will keep their jobs and all facilities in the United States will remain open and thriving” and said Nippon had committed to maintaining all of US Steel’s currently operating blast furnaces for the next decade. The president also promised that every US steel worker would soon receive a $5,000 bonus – prompting the crowd to start a round of “U-S-A!” chants. Trump told the steelworkers in attendance that there was “a lot of money coming your way”. “We won’t be able to call this section a rust belt any more,” Trump said. “It’ll be a golden belt.” During the event, Trump invited local members of United Steelworkers on to the stage to promote the Nippon deal, which saw its leader break with the union to support it. Praising the president, Jason Zugai, vice-president of Irvin local 2227, said he believed the investments would be “life-changing”. But the powerful United Steelworkers union remained wary. “Our primary concern remains with the impact that this merger of US Steel into a foreign competitor will have on national security, our members and the communities where we live and work,” United Steelworkers president David McCall said in a statement. “Issuing press releases and making political speeches is easy. Binding commitments are hard.” Trump framed the administration’s drive to boost domestic steel production as “not just a matter of dignity or prosperity or pride” but as “above all, a matter of national security”. He blamed “decades of Washington betrayals and incompetence and stupidity and corruption” for hollowing out the once-dominant American steel industry, as the jobs “melted away, just like butter”. “We don’t want America’s future to be built with shoddy steel from Shanghai. We want it built with the strength and the pride of Pittsburgh,” he said. In his remarks at a US steel plant, Trump also repeated many of the false claims that have become a feature of his rallies including the lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him. He gloated over his 2024 victory and, gesturing toward his ear that was grazed by a would-be assassin’s bullet last year at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, said it was proof that a higher power was watching over him. He also called on congressional Republicans to align behind his “one big, beautiful bill,” urging attendees to lobby their representatives and senators to support the measure.

    "title": "Trump says he is doubling tariffs on imported steel to 50% – as it happened",
    "article_text": "This liveblog is now closed. Donald Trump just announced at his rally in Pittsburgh that he is increasing the tariff on imported steel from 25% to 50%. The US president told steel workers: “We are going to be imposing a 25% increase. We’re going to bring it from 25% to 50% the tariffs on steel into the United States of America, which will even further secure the steel industry in the United States.” This concludes our live coverage of the secondTrump administrationfor the day. Here are some of the day’s leading developments: Donald Trumpmade a surprise announcement doubling tariffs on imported steel and aluminumfrom 25% to 50%during a speech in Pittsburgh celebrating a deal between US Steel and Japan’s Nippon Steel Corporation. The exact nature of the US Steel deal Trump blessedremained unclear. Although the president insists that it is “a partnership”, Nippon Steel has never withdrawn its bid to buy and control US Steel as a wholly owned subsidiary. The US Steel website still describes the deal as “US Steel’s agreement to be acquired by NSC”. If the deal is a purchase of US Steel by its Japanese rival, Trump would be breakinga campaign promiseto block any such sale. Trump helda bizarre press conferencein the Oval Office withElon Musk, during which the billionaire said farewell to his role as a special government employee and the president repeated false claims about government spending his donor-turned-aide had stopped. The Supreme Courtruledthat the Trump administration can, for now, revoke the temporary protected status of more than 500,000 refugees fleeing violence or persecution in Haiti, Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua. Those legal immigrants are now subject to deportation if they choose not to leave their new homes in communities like Springfield, Ohio, where they were falsely accused by the president of eating pets. Trumpannouncedon social media that he had firedKim Sajet, the first female director of the National Portrait Gallery. Legal experts suggested that Trump does not have the power to fire Sajet, an employee of the Smithsonian, which is not run by the executive branch. Even pro-Trump commentators on Fox are baffled at the ongoing uncertainty over the exact nature of the deal between US Steel and its Japanese rival Nippon Steel Corporation celebrated by the president at his rally on Friday. “This is being described as ‘a partnership’, this deal between Nippon and US Steel; but then its described as an acquisition on the US Steel website,” the Fox host Laura Ingrahampointed outon her show Friday night. She then asked a guest from another pro-Trump outlet, Breitbart, “Who owns the majority stake in this company?” When the guest said that he did not know, Ingraham suggested that Trump himself might not be aware of the details. “I don’t know if he was fully informed about the terms of the deal. We just don’t know.” It is indeed the case thatUS Steel’s websitelinks to a standalone site with the combined branding of the two companies that featuresa statementdescribing the transaction as “U. S. Steel’s agreement to be acquired by NSC.” The same site also features a statement praising “President Trump’s leadership” that says: “U. S. Steel will remain American, and we will grow bigger and stronger through a partnership with Nippon Steel”. Candace Laing, the president and chief executive of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce is not happy with the new 50% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum Trump announced on Friday. Here is her statement: Unwinding the efficient, competitive and reliable cross border supply chains like we have in steel and aluminum comes at a great cost to both countries. In 2018, under the last round of steel and aluminum tariffs, we saw significant net negative job loss in America. Doubling the steel aluminum tariffs to 50% is antithetical to North American economic security. The fact remains that Canada is a reliable and secure trading partner that supplies materials that sustain American jobs.” Ina postto his social media platform from Air Force One, as he flies back to Washington from Pittsburgh,Donald Trumpjust announced that his new 50% tariffs on steel also apply to imported aluminum and will take effect on Wednesday, 4 June. Donald Trump just wrapped up his speech to steelworkers in Pittsburgh, which closely resembled a campaign event, despite the fact that he is no longer eligible to run for the presidency again. The main news of the speech, at a US Steel plant near Pittsburgh, celebrating the sale of the company to Japan’s Nippon Steel, was Trump’s announcement that he was doubling tariffs on imported steel, from 25% to 50%. Despite a court ruling this week that Trump does not have the authority to impose tariffs at will, he does have the authority, as president, to unilaterally raise tariffs on steel imports, under a national security provision called Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. Near the start of his rally at a US Steel factory outside of Pittsburgh,Donald Trumpwas presented with a Pittsburgh Steelers jersey by the former Steeler Rocky Bleier. The jersey had Trump’s name and the No 47, in honor of his role as the 47th president. Bleiernotedthat a Steelers jersey with that number “hangs in the National Football League Hall of Fame”. What Bleier did not say is that the hall-of-famer who wore that number for the Steelers was his teammateMel Blount, a great defensive back. Blount, however, is not a Trump supporter. In 2024,he endorsed Kamala Harrisin her campaign against Trump. In 2016, Blountappeared alongside Joe Bidenat a campaign rally for Trump’s opponent Hillary Clinton. Donald Trump just announced at his rally in Pittsburgh that he is increasing the tariff on imported steel from 25% to 50%. The US president told steel workers: “We are going to be imposing a 25% increase. We’re going to bring it from 25% to 50% the tariffs on steel into the United States of America, which will even further secure the steel industry in the United States.” Speaking to steelworkers in Pittsburgh,Donald Trumpjust insisted that US Steel will “stay an American company” after what he is now calling “a partnership” with Nippon Steel, the Japanese firm that offered $14.9bn for its US rival. It remains unclear how the deal Trump initially opposed is different from a takeover by the Japanese firm. Two powerful California state senators have invited the former leaders of CBS News and 60 Minutes to testify as part of an investigation into whether the network’s parent company, Paramount, might have violated state laws against bribery and unfair competition. As Semafor reports, a letter asking for testimony from the former 60 Minutes producer Bill Owens and the former CBS News president Wendy McMahon, who both recently resigned, comes as Paramount hasreportedlyoffered Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign $15m to settle a lawsuit filed against CBS over the fairly standard editing of an interview with Kamala Harris, the former vice-president, in October. Trump has so far refused to settle and threatened to file an additional suit against the company, which needs federal approval for a merger with the entertainment company Skydance. The chief executive of Skydance, David Ellison, is the son of the pro-Trump billionaire Oracle Corporation co-founder and chairman, Larry Ellison. A copy ofthe letter,obtained by Semafor, shows that it was sent by the chair of the California state senate energy, utilities & communications committee, Josh Becker, and the judiciary committee chair, Thomas Umberg. “Your recent resignations from CBS’s leadership, amid public reports of internal concern about the editorial and ethical implications of the proposed settlement, suggest that you may possess important, first-hand knowledge relevant to our legislative oversight responsibilities,” the lawmakers wrote to the former CBS News leaders. Donald Trump is about to speak at a rally in Pittsburgh to celebrate what he is calling a “partnership” between US Steel and Nippon Steel, after insisting for months last year that he was “totally against” the $14.9bn bid by the Japanese firm for its US rival. Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden hadblockedNippon’s acquisition of US Steel, citing national security concerns, during his final weeks in office. The Trump administration undertook a review of the proposal this year. While the White House has been vague about the exact terms of the deal, and what changed Trump’s mind about it, he was extremely clear about his opposition to the takeover on the campaign trail last year. “They want to strip us of our wealth and seeing our – you’ve seen our companies being sold off to foreign countries all the time,” Trump told voters in Saginaw, Michigan at a rally last October. “And how about US Steel? I’m not going to let them sell US Steel. I don’t care, even if it’s maybe good.” “This was the most important, 65, 70 years ago, US Steel was the most important company in the world. Now, Japan wants to buy it. I would not let that happen,” the candidate said. “I hope it doesn’t go through before I get there because if I get there and it’s not done, we’re not letting that – we’ll help it. We’ll help it get along. But we’re not letting them buy US Steel.” After he won the November election, Trump reiterated his opposition to the deal in a social media post. “I am totally against the once great and powerful U.S. Steel being bought by a foreign company, in this case Nippon Steel of Japan,” he wrote in December. “As President, I will block this deal from happening. Buyer Beware!!!” After meeting Japan’s prime minister at the White House in February, Trumpannouncedthat Nippon, a company he repeatedly called “Nissan” by mistake, would be investing in US Steel rather than buying it. Then last week, Trumpannounced on social mediathat he would approve what he called “a planned partnership between United States Steel and Nippon Steel”. Asked by reporters about the deal on Sunday, Trump, again calling Nippon “Nissan” by mistake,insistedthat it was an investment rather than a purchase or merger. Among those unclear about how this was different from the sale Trump had promised to block were the leaders of the United Steel workers union. The USW said ina statementon Wednesday that the terms of the “partnership” remained unknown to them. At this time, we cannot say whether the “planned partnership” described in Friday’s message on Truth Social or news reports since then represents any meaningful change from the merger proposed in 2023, under which Nippon Steel would acquire U.S. Steel and make it a wholly owned subsidiary. Throughout recent months, as the public conversation has turned to Nippon “investing” in U.S. Steel or “partnering with” U.S. Steel, Nippon has maintained consistently that it would only invest in U.S. Steel’s facilities if it owned the company outright. We’ve seen nothing in the reporting over the past few days suggesting that Nippon has walked back from this position.",

    "title": "Olympic boxing champ Imane Khelif requires gender test to continue fighting",
    "article_text": "Algeria’s Olympic boxing champion Imane Khelifmust undergo genetic sex screening in order to participate in upcoming events, the sport’s governing body said, as it introduced mandatory sex testing for all boxers in its competitions. World Boxing announced the new policy on Friday and specifically mentioned Algeria’s Khelif, who won the women’s welterweight gold at the Paris Olympics last year and prompted a gender-eligibility row. “Imane Khelif may not participate in the female category at … any World Boxing event until Imane Khelif undergoes genetic sex screening in accordance with World Boxing’s rules and testing procedures,” the organisation said in a statement. “World Boxing has written to the Algerian Boxing Federation to inform it that Imane Khelif will not be allowed to participate in the female category at the Eindhoven Box Cup or any World Boxing event until Imane Khelif undergoes sex testing,” it added. World Boxing is responsible for organising bouts at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, after being granted provisional recognition by the International Olympic Committee. Under the new policy, all athletes above the age of 18 who want to participate in a World Boxing-owned or sanctioned competition will need to undergo a PCR, or polymerase chain reaction genetic test, to determine what sex they were at birth and their eligibility to compete. The PCR test is a laboratory technique used to detect specific genetic material, in this case the SRY gene, that reveals the presence of the Y chromosome, which is an indicator of biological sex. The test can be conducted by a nasal or mouth swab, or by taking a sample of saliva or blood. National federations will be responsible for testing and will be required to confirm the sex of their athletes when entering them into World Boxing competitions by producing certification of their chromosomal sex, as determined by a PCR test. Reuters news agency reported that Khelif could not be reached for comment, while the Algerian Boxing Federation did not immediately respond to questions about the development. Khelifsaid in March: “For me, I see myself as a girl, just like any other girl. I was born a girl, raised as a girl, and have lived my entire life as one.” “I have competed in many tournaments, including the Tokyo Olympics and other major competitions, as well as four World Championships,” she said at the time. “All of these took place before I started winning and earning titles. But once I began achieving success, the campaigns against me started.” The 26-year-old is targeting a second gold medal at the 2028 Games in Los Angeles after her triumph in Paris. Her Olympic success, along with that of Taiwan’s Lin Yu-ting, led to a raginggender eligibility debate in Paris, with high-profile figures such as United States President Donald Trump and Elon Musk weighing in. In February, Trump signed an executive order banning transgender athletes from competing in women’s sports. Khelif said she would not be intimidated by Trump as she is not transgender.",

    "article_text": "At least 10 people have been killed after a stone quarry collapsed in Indonesia’s West Java province, with the country’s disaster agency saying search efforts are ongoing to find missing people buried beneath the rubble. The collapse took place early on Friday at Gunung Kuda mining site in Cirebon, West Java. Footage from the scene of the accident shows excavators moving large rocks and emergency workers placing victims in body bags in an ambulance. Footage circulating online showed rescuers struggling to retrieve a body from the devastated area. Another showed people scrambling for safety as thick dust rose from a pile of rocks and soil that had collapsed. Indonesia’s National Agency for Disaster Countermeasure (BNPB) said at least 10 people had been killed, but gave no estimate on the number of people missing. It said heavy machinery – including three excavators – were buried and rescue operations would continue throughout Saturday. Rescue teams have already pulled a dozen injured people from the debris during a gruelling search effort, according to Cirebon district police chief, Sumarni, who uses a single name. Sumarni said authorities are investigating the cause of the collapse, adding that the owner and quarry workers have been summoned for questioning. He said police, emergency personnel, soldiers and volunteers – supported by five excavators – are trying to locate any further trapped workers. Rescue efforts are being hampered by unstable soil, risking further slides, he added. On his Instagram account, West Java governor Dedi Mulyadi said the site was “very dangerous” and did not “meet safety standards for workers”. The governor added that the mine was opened before he was elected and he “didn’t have any capacity to stop it”. Mulyadi said he has taken action to close the Gunung Kuda mine and four others in West Java considered to be endangering lives and the environment. Illegal mining operations are commonplace across Indonesia, providing a tenuous livelihood to low-wage workers while coming with a high risk of injury or death due to landslides, flooding and tunnel collapses. Much of the processing of sand, rock or gold ore also involves workers using highly toxic materials like mercury and cyanide with little or no protection. In May, torrential rain triggered a landslide and floods near a small mine run by local residents in the Arfak Mountains in Indonesia’s West Papua province,killing at least six people. Last year, a landslide also triggered by torrential rain struck an unauthorised gold mining operation on Indonesia’s Sumatra island, killing at least 15 people.",

    "article_text": "United States President Donald Trump has accused China of violating an agreement to mutually roll back tariffs and trade restrictions for critical minerals, as he suggested China was in “grave economic danger” until he agreed to cut a deal earlier this month. Posting on his Truth Social platform on Friday evening, Trump said he made a “fast deal” with China for both countries to back away fromtriple-digit tariffs for 90 daysto “save” Beijing from a “very bad situation”. The US leader said his tariffs of up to 145 percent on Chinese imports had made it “virtually impossible” for China to trade with the US market, resulting in closed factories and “civil unrest” in the country. “China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US. So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!” Trump added. Trump did not specify in his post how China had violated the agreement – made following trade talks in Geneva, Switzerland, in mid-May – or what action he planned to take at their alleged failure to comply with its terms. Asked by reporters about the China deal later on Friday in the Oval Office, Trump said: “I’m sure that I’ll speak to [China’s] President Xi [Jinping], and hopefully we’ll work that out.” Trump’s deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, told reporters that China’s failure to fulfil its obligations “opens up all manner of action for the United States to ensure future compliance”. Miller added that Trump hoped China would open up to American business in a similar manner to the way the US has been open to Chinese business “for a very long time now”. China’s embassy in Washington said Beijing has maintained communication with its US counterparts since the Geneva talks, but said they had concerns about recently imposed US export controls. “China has repeatedly raised concerns with the US regarding its abuse of export control measures in the semiconductor sector and other related practices,” embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said in a statement. “China once again urges the US to immediately correct its erroneous actions, cease discriminatory restrictions against China and jointly uphold the consensus reached at the high-level talks in Geneva,” Liu added. Earlier this week, media reports suggested the Trump administration had ordered US firms offering software used to design semiconductors to stop selling their services to Chinese groups. On Wednesday, a spokesperson for theUS Department ofCommerceconfirmedthat it was reviewing exports of strategic significance to China, and “in some cases … suspended existing export licences or imposed additional licence requirements while the review is pending”. On Friday, shortly after lamenting China’s lack of compliance with the Geneva agreement, President Trump also announced plans to increase tariffs on foreign imports of steel from 25 percent to 50 percent on June 4. The agreement two weeks ago dialling back tariffs for 90 days prompted a massive rally in global stocks, as it effectively lowered the US tariff rate on Chinese goods to the mid-teens from about 25 percent in early April. As part of the deal, China also agreed to lift trade countermeasures restricting exports of critical metals needed for production by US semiconductors, electronics and defence industries. But Trump administration officials have publicly stated that China has been slow to adhere to their Geneva commitments and have so far failed to comply. The Reuters news agency also reported on Friday that global auto executives are sounding the alarm on a looming shortage of rare-earth magnets from China that could force car factories to close within weeks. “Without reliable access to these elements and magnets, automotive suppliers will be unable to produce critical automotive components, including automatic transmissions, throttle bodies, alternators, various motors, sensors, seat belts, speakers, lights, motors, power steering, and cameras,” the Alliance for Automotive Innovation said in a letter to the Trump administration.",

    "title": "‘Unfriendly and meddling’: Cuba reprimands US diplomat amid rising tensions",
    "article_text": "Cuba’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has issued a statement of protest against the head of the United States mission to the island, Michael Hammer. In anews releasepublished on Friday, the Foreign Ministry accused Hammer, a career diplomat, of “unfriendly and meddling behaviour” since hisarrivalin Cuba in late 2024. “By inciting Cuban citizens to commit extremely serious criminal acts, attacking the constitutional order, or encouraging them to act against the authorities or demonstrate in support of the interests and objectives of a hostile foreign power, the diplomat is engaging in provocative and irresponsible conduct,” the Foreign Ministry wrote. “The immunity he enjoys as a representative of his country cannot be used as cover for acts contrary to the sovereignty and internal order of the country to which he is assigned, in this case, Cuba.” The Foreign Ministry said the message was delivered by its director of bilateral affairs with the US, Alejandro Garcia del Toro. Friday’s statement is the latest indication of increasingly rocky relations between Cuba and the US, particularly since President Donald Trump began his second term in January. Diplomatic ties between the two countries, however, have been icy for decades, stretching back to the Cold War in the 1960s. After the Cuban Revolution of 1959, the US government imposed strict trade restrictions on the island and backed efforts to topple the newly established Communist government. But there have been efforts to ease the tensions, notably during the administrations of Democratic presidents like Barack Obama and Joe Biden in the US. In 2016, for instance, Obama sought to normalise relations with Cuba, only to see those efforts rolled back during the first Trump administration, starting in 2017. Likewise, President Biden – who formerly served as Obama’s vice president – removed Cuba from the US’s list of “state sponsors of terrorism” in the waning days of his term in January. But upon taking office for his second time on January 20, Trumpreversed courseonce more, putting Cuba back on the list that very same day. Trump also included in his presidential cabinet several officials who have taken a hardline stance towards Cuba, most notably former Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Born to Cuban immigrants, Rubio is an outspoken supporter of continuing the trade embargo against the island. The Cuban government, meanwhile, has continued to accuse the US of attempting to destabilise its leadership. In Friday’s statement, the Cuban Foreign Ministry accused Hammer of “public and insulting manipulation” for his recent visit to the tomb of a 19th-century national hero, Jose Marti. The US Embassy to Cuba posted avideoof the visit with a voiceover of Marti’s words, “Respect for the freedom and thoughts of others, even of the most unhappy kind, is my passion: If I die or am killed, it will be for that.” Critics have interpreted that citation as an implied endorsement of dissent on the island. In recent months, there have also been signs that Trump plans to once again tighten the screws on the Cuban government, in a return to the “maximum pressure” campaigns that typified foreign policy during his first term. In February, for instance, the Trump administration announced it wouldyank visasfrom anyone who works with Cuba’s medical system, which sends thousands of healthcare workers abroad each year, particularly in the Caribbean region. Critics have criticised the healthcare programme for its low pay and hefty restrictions on its employees. Trump and Rubio, meanwhile, have claimed the medical system amounts to a form of “forced labour” that enriches the Cuban government. But leaders in Havana have denied that allegation. Then, in April, the US government condemned Cuba forre-arresting a group of dissidents, among them prominent figures like Jose Daniel Ferrer and Felix Navarro. Cuba had initially agreed to release Ferrer and Navarro as part of abargain brokered by the Vaticanearlier this year. Cuba was expected to release 553 prisoners, many of whom were swept up in antigovernment protests, and in exchange, the US was supposed to ease its sanctions against the island. The sanctions relief, however, never came. An additional measure was taken against Cuba just this month. The Department of State, under Rubio’s direction, determined that “Cuba did not fully cooperate with US counterterrorism efforts in 2024”. It accused Cuba of harbouring 11 fugitives, some of whom faced terrorism-related charges in the US. “The Cuban regime made clear it was not willing to discuss their return to face justice in our nation,” the State Department wrote in anews release. “The United States will continue to promote international cooperation on counterterrorism issues. We also continue to promote accountability for countries that do not stand against terrorism.” As punishment, Cuba was labelled as a “not fully cooperating country” under the Arms Export Control Act, a designation that limits its ability to buy weaponry and other defence tools from the US. Furthermore, Hammer had recently signalled that new sanctions were on the way for the island. But in the face of Friday’s reprimand, the State Department indicated it was undeterred and would continue to support dissidents against Cuba’s “malign influence”.",

    "title": "Trump says US will lift steel tariffs to 50 percent at Pennsylvania rally",
    "article_text": "United States President Donald Trump has announced his administration is raising tariffs on steel imports from 25 percent to 50 percent. Speaking to steelworkers and supporters at a rally outside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Trump framed his latest tariff increase as a boon to the domestic manufacturing industry. “We’re going to bring it from 25 percent to 50 percent, the tariffs on steel into the United States of America, which will even further secure the steel industry in the United States,” Trump told the crowd. “Nobody’s going to get around that.” How that tariff increase would affect an existing free-trade pact with Canada and Mexico – or a separate trade deal struck earlier this month with the United Kingdom – remains unclear. Also left ambiguous was the nature of a partnership developping between Nippon Steel, the largest steel producer in Japan, and the domestic company US Steel. Still, at the rally, Trump played up the partnership as a “blockbuster agreement”. “ There’s never been a $14bn investment in the history of the steel industry in the United States of America,” Trump said of the deal. Friday’s rally was a return to the site of many election-season campaign events for Trump and his team. In 2024, Trump hinged his pitch for re-election on an appeal to working-class voters, including those in the Rust Belt region, a manufacturing hub that has declined in the face of the shifting industry trends and greater overseas competition. Key swing states like Pennsylvania and Michigan are located in the region, and they leaned Republican on election day, helping to propel Trump to a second term as president. Trump, in turn, has framed his “America First” agenda as a policy platform designed to bolster the domestic manufacturing industry. Tariffs and other protectionist policies have played a prominent part in that agenda. In March, for instance, Trump announced an initial slate of25-percent tariffs on steel and aluminium, causing major trading partners like Canada to respond with retaliatory measures. The following month, he also imposed a blanket 10-percent tariff on nearly all trade partners as well as higher country-specific import taxes. Those were quickly paused amid economic shockwaves and widespread criticism, while the 10-percent tariff remained in place. Trump has argued that the tariffs are a vital negotiating tool to encourage greater investment in the US economy. But economists have warned that attempting a “hard reset” of the global economy – through dramatic tax hikes like tariffs – will likely blow back on US consumers, raising prices. Rachel Ziemba, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, said the latest tariff hike on steel also signals that negotiating trade deals with Trump may result in “limited benefits”, given the sudden shifts in his policies. Further, Friday’s announcement signals that Trump is likely to continue doubling down on tariffs, she said. “The challenge is that hiking the steel tariffs may be good for steel workers, but it is bad for manufacturing and the energy sector, among others. So overall, it is not great for the US economy and adds uncertainty to the macro outlook,” Ziemba explained. Trump’s tariff policies have also faced legal challenges in the US, where businesses, interest groups and states have all filed lawsuits to stop the tax hikes on imports. On Thursday, for instance, a federal court briefly ruled that Trump had illegally exercised emergency powers to impose his sweeping slate of international tariffs, only for an appeals court topause that rulinga few hours later. Before the tariff hike was announced, Friday’s rally in Pittsburgh was expected to focus on Nippon Steel’s proposed acquisition of US Steel, the second largest steel producer in the country. “We’re here today to celebrate a blockbuster agreement that will ensure this storied American company stays an American company,” Trump said at the outset of his speech. But the merger between Nippon Steel and US Steel had been controversial, and it was largely opposed by labour unions. Upon returning to the White House in January, Trump initially said he would block the acquisition, mirroring a similar position taken by his predecessor, former US President Joe Biden. However, he has sincepivotedhis stance and backed the deal. Last week, he announced an agreement that he said would grant Nippon only “partial ownership” over US Steel. Speaking on Friday, Trump said the new deal would include Nippon making a “$14bn commitment to the future” of US Steel, although he did not provide details about how the ownership agreement would play out. “Oh, you’re gonna be happy,” Trump told the crowd of steelworkers. “There’s a lot of money coming your way.” The Republican leader also waxed poetic about the history of steel in the US, describing it as the backbone of the country’s economy. “The city of Pittsburgh used to produce more steel than most entire countries could produce, and it wasn’t even close,” he said, adding: “If you don’t have steel, you don’t have a country.” For its part, US Steel has not publicly communicated any details of a revamped deal to investors. Nippon, meanwhile, issued a statement approving the proposed “partnership”, but it also has not disclosed terms of the arrangement. The acquisition has split union workers, although the national United Steelworkers Union has been one of its leading opponents. In a statement prior to the rally, the union questioned whether the new arrangement makes “any meaningful change” from the initial proposal. “Nippon has maintained consistently that it would only invest in US Steel’s facilities if it owned the company outright,” the union said in a statement, which noted firmer details had not yet been released. “We’ve seen nothing in the reporting over the past few days suggesting that Nippon has walked back from this position.” The rally on Friday comes as Trump has sought to reassure his base of voters following a tumultuous start to his second term. Critics point out that steel prices have risen in the US by roughly 16 percent since Trump took office, and his Republican Party faces potentially punishing congressional elections in 2026.",

    "title": "South Korea’s presidential favourite has plans for new ‘de facto’ capital",
    "article_text": "Sejong, South Korea– By the standards of South Korea’s teeming metropolises, Sejong is not much of a city. With a population of 400,000 people, Sejong, a planned city located about 100km (62 miles) south of Seoul, does not even crack the top 20 urban centres. But if South Korea’s likely next president has his way, Sejong could soon become the country’s “de facto” capital. Lee Jae-myung, the overwhelming favourite in Tuesday’s presidential election, has pledged to relocate the presidential office, legislature and numerous public institutions to Sejong as part of a renewed push to establish a new administrative capital. “I will make Sejong the de facto administrative capital and Daejeon a global science capital,” Lee said in the run-up to the election, referring to the nearby central city. “I will also push for the complete relocation of the National Assembly and presidential office to Sejong through social consensus.” Sejong was conceived of in 2003 by late President Roh Moo-hyun, who believed that moving the capital would achieve the twin aims of reducing congestion in Seoul and encouraging development in South Korea’s central region. Roh’s ambitions for Sejong were dealt a setback the following year when the Constitutional Court ruled that Seoul should remain the capital. While the prime minister’s office and about a dozen ministries have moved to Sejong over the years as part of successive governments’ decentralisation efforts, Seoul has remained not only the official capital but also the centre of political, economic and cultural life. Greater Seoul is home to about 26 million people – half of South Korea’s population – and most of the country’s top companies, universities, hospitals and cultural institutions are clustered in the region. On a recent Friday afternoon, Sejong’s wide streets were mostly quiet, a world away from the bustling alleyways of downtown Seoul. At the city’s express bus station, a number of government workers were waiting on a bus to take them to the capital. Kevin Kim, a 30-year-old civil servant, travels to Seoul for the weekend at least twice a month. “My family, friends and girlfriend are in Seoul,” Kim, who has lived in Sejong for nearly two years, told Al Jazeera. “I have to go to Seoul, as all the big hospitals are there.” Lee Ho-baek, who works for a start-up in Sejong, also visits Seoul several times a month. “There just isn’t enough infrastructure or things to do in the city for us,” he told Al Jazeera, explaining that he is not sure if he will stay much longer despite having moved to Sejong only a year ago. After years of roadblocks to Sejong’s development, including concerns about costs and constitutional legitimacy, candidate Lee’s pledge has stirred tentative signs of growth in the city. In April, real estate transactions increased threefold compared with the same period the previous year. But with Sejong’s fortunes so closely tied to the changing whims of politicians, there are concerns about its long-term sustainability. During discussions about the possible relocation of the presidential office and legislature by Lee Jae-myung’s Democratic Party in 2020, apartment prices jumped by 45 percent – only to decline in the following years. In Sejong’s Nasung-dong, a central neighbourhood surrounded by parks, shopping centres and flashy apartments, the streets were quiet as Friday afternoon turned into evening. M-Bridge, a highly anticipated multifunctional mall designed by global architect Thom Mayne’s firm, was largely empty. According to the Korea Real Estate Board, Sejong has a 25 percent vacancy rate for mid- to large-sized shopping centres, the highest rate in the country. “In our city, the weekdays are busier than the weekends,” Jace Kim, a restaurant owner who came to Sejong in 2015, told Al Jazeera. “Most public workers who work within the city spend their time and money outside of the city limits. Our city is relatively small and newly built, so it’s ideal for mothers and children. But we don’t have any universities or major companies that will attract young people to come here.” Moon Yoon-sang, a research fellow at the Korea Development Institute (KDI), said Washington, DC, could be a model for Sejong’s growth and development. “If the centre of the government moves to Sejong, it’s the hope that conventions and important meetings will happen there instead of in Seoul,” Moon told Al Jazeera. “Today, there are only two major hotels in the city, but people are expecting a monumental effect with the moving of the National Assembly.” Park Jin, a professor at KDI’s School of Public Policy and Management, said he supports Sejong becoming the official capital. After the 2004 Constitutional Court ruling, relocating the capital would require an amendment to the constitution, which would need to be approved by two-thirds of the National Assembly and half of voters in a referendum. In a 2022 survey by Hankook Research, 54.9 percent of respondents said they approved of moving the capital to Sejong, but 51.7 percent disapproved of moving the National Assembly and the president’s office out of Seoul. “As all of the country’s talent pool and key infrastructure are staying within Seoul, the country needs to invest in developing our other major cities,” Park told Al Jazeera. “For Sejong, this means combining with neighbouring Daejeon to become the nation’s centre for administration and research.” Park believes that the country’s five major cities outside the greater Seoul area should have at least 4 million residents to maintain healthy urbanisation. Busan, South Korea’s second-largest city, has 3.26 million people. Last year, the Korea Employment Information Service officially categorised Busan as being at risk of extinction due to record-low birth rates and a declining young workforce. Population declines in regional parts of the country have been further exacerbated by internal migration to Seoul. More than 418,000 people moved to the capital region last year. Sejong has a goal of reaching 800,000 residents by 2040, roughly double its current population. “Today, many people won’t think about moving to Sejong. In an age where it’s expected for both members of married couples to be working, it’s very difficult for both members to find jobs outside of Seoul,” Moon said. “Maybe in the next 10 years, we might see differences in how people view Sejong.” Park said developing a city from scratch is not a short-term project. “But with the relocation of the capital, we can expect some real changes to happen,” he said.",

    "title": "What is Project Esther, the playbook against pro-Palestine movement in US?",
    "article_text": "Washington, DC –When the Heritage Foundation, a prominent right-wing think tank in the United States, released a playbook last year for how to destroy the Palestine solidarity movement, it did not garner much attention. But more than eight months later, the policy document – known asProject Esther– now faces heightened scrutiny from activists and media outlets, in part because President Donald Trump appears to be following its blueprint. The authors of Project Esther have presented their report as a set of recommendations for combating anti-Semitism, but critics say the document’s ultimate aim is to “poison” groups critical of Israel by painting them as Hamas associates. Project Esther was created as a response to growing protests against the US support for Israel’swar on Gaza, which United Nations experts and rights groups have described as a genocide. So, what is Project Esther, and how is it being applied against activists? Here is a look at the document and its ongoing implications for the US. The Heritage Foundation is an influential conservative think tank in Washington, DC, whose stated mission is to “formulate and promote public policies based on the principles of free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional American values, and a strong national defense”. Yet, critics argue that Project Esther calls for government interference to curb individual freedoms, including the rights to free speech and association when it comes to opposing Israeli government policies. According to a New York Times report published earlier this month, the project is overseen by Victoria Coates, a vice president at the Heritage Foundation who served as deputy national security adviser during Trump’s first term. The Heritage Foundation is also behindProject 2025, which critics describe as an authoritarian playbook for the second Trump presidency. Ahead of the elections last year, Democratsrepeatedly invokedProject 2025 to criticise Trump, but the then-candidate distanced himself from the document. The initiative says that it aims to “dismantle the infrastructure that sustains” what it calls the “Hamas Support Network” within 24 months. The authors claim that groups engaged in advocacy for Palestinian rights are members of the Hamas Support Network (HSN). They define the supposed network as “people and organizations that are both directly and indirectly involved in furthering Hamas’s cause in contravention of American values and to the detriment of American citizens and America’s national security interests”. In short, the document alleges that the “pro-Palestinian movement” is “effectively a terrorist support network”. No. There is no such network in the US, which has stern laws against providing material support to groups designated as “terrorist organisations”, including Hamas. Beth Miller – the political director at Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP), a group that the Heritage Foundation names as part of the network – called Project Esther’s allegations “outlandish”. “It exposes the length of lies and of absurdity that they are going through to try to tear down the Palestinian rights movement,” Miller told Al Jazeera. The Heritage Foundation did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment. The document calls for a multi-faceted campaign against supporters of Palestinian rights, targeting them legally, politically and financially. The initiative outlines 19 goals that it labels as “desired effects”. They include denying Palestinian rights supporters who arenot US citizensaccess to universities, ensuring that social media platforms do not allow “anti-Semitic content”, and presenting evidence of “criminal activity” by Palestine advocates to the executive branch. It also calls for refusing to grant permits for protests organised in support of Palestinian rights. Project Esther suggests that Israel’s backers should conduct “legal, private research” into pro-Palestine groups to “uncover criminal wrongdoing” and undermine their credibility. “We must wage lawfare,” it reads, referring to the tactic of using litigation to pressure opponents. It appears to be the case. “The phase we’re in now is starting to execute some of the lines of effort in terms of legislative, legal and financial penalties for what we consider to be material support for terrorism,” Coates told The New York Times. Trump’s crackdown on college protests seems to align with what Project Esther is trying to achieve. For example, the US administration has been revoking the visas of foreign students critical of Israel. This echoes a proposal in Project Esther, which calls for identifying students “in violation of student visa requirements”. The Heritage Foundation also extensively cites Canary Mission – a website dedicated to doxxing and smearing pro-Palestine students – in its footnotes for Project Esther. The Trump administration is also suspected of relying on the website, along with otherpro-Israel groups, to identify students for deportation. In addition, Project Esther singles out the “Middle East/North Africa or Islamic studies” programmes as having professors who are “hostile to Israel”. The Trump administration has been pressuring elite universities to revampacademic departments, including Middle East studies programmes, that it views as biased in favour of Palestinians. Columbia University, for instance, appointed a provost to review its programmes at Trump’s request, “starting immediately with the Middle East” department. The White House did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment. The initiative explicitly identifies several Arab, Muslim and progressive Jewish organisations as well as student groups as part of the so-called Hamas Support Network. The initiative claims that “the network revolves around” American Muslims for Palestine (AMP), an educational and civic advocacy group. Osama Abuirshaid, AMP’s executive director, said Project Esther points the finger at the group because it has “Muslim” in its name, playing onIslamophobic bigotry. “American Muslims for Palestine is an easy target. Given the Islamophobic tendencies, it’s easy to assume guilt of American Muslims, Palestinians. That’s a name that sticks,” Abuirshaid told Al Jazeera. He added that the group is also a target because it is effective and has a “solid constituency”. “If they can cripple and bring down AMP, that will have a chilling effect within the movement. So they think, if they can bring us down, other organisations will stop working on Palestine solidarity,” Abuirshaid said. Tariq Kenney-Shawa, a US policy fellow at Al-Shabaka, a Palestinian think tank, said Project Esther targets universities because Israel is bleeding support among young people in the US. “That’s why there’s such an overwhelming focus on universities and college campuses,” he told Al Jazeera’sThe Takepodcast. Kenney-Shawa explained that support for Israel’s war on Gaza has been trending downwards across US demographics. But on college campuses, the change is more pronounced. “While this change is absolutely across the political spectrum, it’s obviously a lot more acute in the left and among young Americans,” Kenney-Shawa said. A recent poll from the Pew Research Center showed that 53 percent of US respondents had negative views of Israel, a number that rises to 71 percent among Democrats below the age of 50. Advocates say that, in the immediate future, the crackdown on the Palestine solidarity movement threatens the safety and wellbeing of activists, especially foreign students. But it has also sparked a backlash. “The extreme nature of these attacks has also emboldened people to defiantly continue to speak out in the face of these attacks,” JVP’s Miller said. “And it has actually, in many cases, awoken people – who weren’t paying attention before – to the hypocrisy that has so long existed in the willingness to silence and censor Palestinian rights activists.” Earlier in May, several right-wing lawmakers and Trump allies came outin oppositionof a bill that aimed to expand restrictions on boycotts of Israel, citing free speech concerns. Abuirshaid echoed Miller’s comments. He acknowledged that the media attacks, arrests and lawsuits against advocates and student protesters have been “distracting” from the mission of focusing on Palestine. However, he added, “I’m going to be clear: It’s energising us to continue this fight.”",

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 30, 2025 / 11:44 PM EDT/ CBS Minnesota Two people were injured in a shooting on the campus of the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities Friday night, outside the school's hockey arena, officials said.

    "title": "Trump says he's doubling steel tariffs to 50%",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 30, 2025 / 10:36 PM EDT/ CBS News President Trump announced that he would be doubling tariffs on steel to 50% as he visited a U.S. Steel mill in the Pittsburgh suburbs Friday, a week after teasing a \"planned partnership\" between the company and its Japanese competitor Nippon Steel. \"We are going to be imposing a 25% increase. We're going to bring it from 25% to 50% thetariffson steel into the United States of America, which will even further secure the steel industry in the United States,\" he said. Mr. Trump laternotedon his Truth Social platform that the increase would also be applied to aluminum, and would take effect on June 4. The Nippon deal will allow U.S. Steel's headquarters to remain in Pennsylvania, according to Mr. Trump, who characterized the agreement last Sunday as \"an investment\" and \"partial ownership\" that will be \"controlled\" by the United States. The administration, however, has released few details about the deal. \"We're here today to celebrate a blockbuster agreement that will ensure this storied American company stays an American company,\" Mr. Trump said Friday. Mr. Trump's announcement last week was the latest twist in Nippon's yearslong effort to acquire U.S. Steel. Its nearly $15 billion bid to buy U.S. Steel wasblockedby former President Joe Biden in January on national security grounds. Mr. Trump, who opposed the acquisition during the 2024 campaign, has since warmed to a deal between the steel producers, touting a $14 billion investment that the president said would \"create and save over 100,000 American jobs.\" \"You're going to be very happy,\" Mr. Trump said Friday. \"There's a lot of money coming your way.\" Mr. Trump said the deal includes \"vital protections to ensure that all steel workers will keep their jobs and all facilities in the United States will remain open and thriving.\" He added that U.S. Steel would also keep all of its blast furnace facilities at full capacity for at least the next decade and vowed that there would be \"no layoffs and no outsourcing whatsoever.\" Every worker at U.S. Steel would soon be receiving a $5,000 bonus as well, he said. Mr. Trump said he approved a deal after the persistence of Nippon, whose offer kept getting \"better and better\" each time the company made another proposal. Later Friday night, after returning from his visit, Mr. Trump told reporters he has to approve the final deal with Nippon, and that \"we haven't seen that final deal yet.\" Sen. David McCormick, a Pennsylvania Republican, provided more details on the agreement inan interview with CNBCon Tuesday, saying that U.S. Steel would have an American CEO and a majority of its board members will be from the U.S., anarrangementthat was also part of the deal rejected by Biden. McCormick did raise one potential difference in the latest iteration, stating that the U.S. would have a golden share. \"It's a national security agreement that will be signed with the U.S. government,\" McCormick said. \"There'll be a golden share, which will essentially require U.S. government approval of a number of the board members and that will allow the United States to ensure production levels aren't cut.\" McCormick said Nippon will have \"certainly members of the board, and this will be part of their overall corporate structure.\" \"They wanted an opportunity to get access to the U.S. market — this allowed them to do so and get the economic benefit of that,\" McCormick said of Nippon. \"They've negotiated it, it was their proposal.\" It is not yet clear whether the golden share provision involves any U.S. ownership of the merged companies. The United Steelworkers union has opposed a sale, arguing that the Japanese company is making \"flashy promises\" that put American jobs at risk. In a statement Friday, union president David McCall said the group was not included or consulted in the discussions \"so we cannot speculate about the meaning of the 'planned partnership' between USS and Nippon or the 'golden share' that some politicians have claimed will be issued to the federal government.\" \"There is a vast difference between public relations and putting commitments in writing, just as there is a vast difference between allowing shareholders and executives to cash-out and putting workers' interests first,\" he said. \"Any final deal that may emerge from discussions between the merger parties and the federal government must be viewed through that lens, and not the lens of wishful thinking that has been adopted by far too many politicians and others.\" But without an acquisition, U.S. Steel had warned last year that the company would \"largely pivot away\" from its blast furnace facilities, which would put thousands of jobs in jeopardy. The company said the future of its headquarters in Pittsburgh was also uncertain without an agreement. U.S. Steel employs about 22,000 people, with more than 14,000 employees in North America and the rest in Slovakia. Caitlin Yilek is a politics reporter at CBSNews.com, based in Washington, D.C.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 30, 2025 / 10:07 PM EDT/ CBS/AP An appeals court on Friday refused to freezea California judge's orderhalting the Trump administration from downsizing the federal workforce, which means that Department of Government Efficiency-led cuts remain on pause for now. Inthe 2-1 ruling, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denied the White House's request to freeze the injunction. \"The Executive Order at issue here far exceeds the President's supervisory powers under the Constitution,\" the appeals court wrote. \"The President enjoys significant removal power with respect to the appointed officers of federal agencies.\" The administration had sought an emergency stay of an injunction issued by U.S. Judge Susan Illston of San Francisco in a lawsuit brought by labor unions and cities, including San Francisco and Chicago. The judge's order questioned whether President Trump's administration was acting lawfully in trying to pare the federal workforce. Mr. Trump has repeatedly said voters gave him a mandate to remake the federal government, and he tapped billionaire Elon Musk to lead the charge through DOGE. Tens of thousands of federal workershave been fired, have left their jobs via deferred resignation programs or have been placed on leave. There is no official figurefor the job cuts, but at least 75,000 federal employees tookdeferred resignations, and thousands of probationary workers have already been let go. Illston's order directs numerous federal agencies to halt acting on the president's workforce executive order signed in February and a subsequent memo issued by DOGE and the Office of Personnel Management. Illston, who was nominated to the bench by former President Bill Clinton, wrote in her ruling that presidents can make large-scale overhauls of federal agencies, but only with the cooperation of Congress. Lawyers for the government say the executive order and memo calling for large-scale personnel reductions and reorganization plans provided only general principles that agencies should follow in exercising their own decision-making process. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 30, 2025 / 9:22 PM EDT/ CBS News Strasburg, Colorado— When Stephanie Peabody started looking through the security footage taken from her garage camera in Strasburg, Colorado, she was trying to piece together what exactly happened that February night. Eventually, she not only found the answer, but the surprise of a lifetime. It all started when Stephanie and her husband left their 3-year-old son Bridger with his great-grandmother, 78-year-old Sharon Lewis. Bridger and his grandmother were walking into the Peabody home when Lewis tripped and hit her head on a concrete step. She couldn't get up, she was bleeding profusely, and she had left her phone in the car. First, they tried yelling for help from the neighbors, but that did not work. The only solution was for Bridger to return to Lewis' car and get her phone. \"He (Bridger) said, 'GG, they don't hear us,'\" Lewis recounted to CBS News. \"I said, 'I know, so you're going to have to go get my phone.'\" It was nighttime, and the path back to the car wasn't lit. It was in total darkness. \"I was a lot afraid,\" Bridger told CBS News. \"…It's too dark.\" \"The dark is just a frightful thing for a little guy,\" Lewis said. That was when Bridger whispered to himself these three little words caught on security video: \"Don't be afraid.\" Up to that point, Bridger had never even opened a car door, let alone faced such a life-and-death challenge. But he was able to courageously make his way to Lewis' car and open the door. The darkness was defeated. \"I was so proud of him,\" Peabody said of her son. It's been about three months since that accident. Lewis has healed, and new lights were installed in the backyard. But perhaps, the most significant change has been the family's new fearless attitudes. Peabody said the incident has inspired her to pursue a career in special education. \"It's something I've always wanted to do, but now it's like taking the chance to do it: 'Don't be afraid,'\" Peabody said. \"I have it tattooed on my arm.\" It's a reminder for the child inside all of us. Sometimes, true courage is being afraid and charging into the darkness anyway. Steve Hartman is a CBS News correspondent.

    "title": "Loretta Swit, a star of TV's \"M*A*S*H,\" dies at 87",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 30, 2025 / 9:15 PM EDT/ CBS News Loretta Swit, who played Maj. Margaret Houlihan on the TV series \"M*A*S*H,\" has died, a representative for her confirmed to CBS News. She was 87. Swit died at her home in New York City, her rep, B. Harlan Boll, said in a statement to CBS News on Friday. She was believed to have died of natural causes. Swit starred on stage and screen, but she was perhaps best known for her long-running role as the head nurse who was a foil toAlan Alda's Capt. Benjamin Franklin \"Hawkeye\" Pierce on \"M*A*S*H,\" which aired for 11 seasons on CBS, from 1972 to 1983. The show was adapted from Robert Altman's Oscar-winning 1970 film, a landmark celebrated for its freewheeling humor, its satirical approach to war movies, the excess of blood in the operating room and the nudity of its nurses. The TV series, produced by Larry Gelbart and Gene Reynolds, was toned down for television but maintained the movie's anti-establishment ethos. The 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital that was the show's setting allowed for doctors burdened by the grueling work to let off steam by playing pranks, telling jokes while performing \"meatball surgery,\" and tussling with patients and Army ranks over such issues as racism, sexism, infidelity and the effects of PTSD among service members. The large ensemble includedWayne Rogersas Capt. \"Trapper\" John McIntyre, McLean Stevenson as Lt. Col. Henry Blake,Larry Linvilleas Maj. Frank Burns, and William Christopher as Father Francis Mulcahy. One actor from Altman's film, Gary Burghoff, reprised his role as \"Radar\" O'Reilly, the super-efficient corporal who was the glue that held the hospital together. A new character, Cpl. Max Klinger, played by Jamie Farr, was continually trying to get a Section 8 discharge from the Army for cross-dressing. Later seasons would feature Mike Farrell as Capt. B.J. Hunnicutt,Harry Morganas Col. Sherman Potter andDavid Ogden Stiersas Maj. Charles Emerson Winchester. Swit won two Emmys for her performances on \"M*A*S*H\" and was nominated eight other times for her work on the show. She was also nominated for four Golden Globes. As the show developed and incorporated more dramatic plot lines with the comedic ones, Swit wanted to portray Houlihan as more than the \"Hot Lips\" nickname her character was given while having an affair with Linville's Burns. \"Around the second or third year I decided to try to play her as a real person, in an intelligent fashion, even if it meant hurting the jokes,\" Swit told the author of \"The Complete Book of 'M.A.S.H,'\" Suzy Kalter. \"To oversimplify it, I took each traumatic change that happened in her life and kept it. I didn't go into the next episode as if it were a different character in a different play. She was a character in constant flux; she never stopped developing.\" Following the news of her death, Swit was hailed for her work. \"Loretta Swit's portrayal of Margaret 'Hot Lips' Houlihan was groundbreaking – bringing heart, humor, and strength to one of television comedy's most enduring roles,\" Journey Gunderson, executive director of the National Comedy Center in Jamestown, New York, said in a statement. \"Her talent extended well beyond that iconic character, with acclaimed work on both stage and screen that showcased her intelligence, versatility, and passion.\" In 2003, Swit told Yahoo Entertainment that she would have picked a different ending for her character when the series concluded with Houlihan deciding to return to the U.S. instead of a post in another country. \"I think her next move was Vietnam. So I didn't agree with that, but that's what they wanted her to do,\" Swit said. She told the outlet she still received letters from women all over the world who decided to become nurses because of Houlihan. \"To have contributed to someone's life like that is remarkable,\" Swit said.

    "title": "Elon Musk lashes out in Oval Office when asked about report on his ketamine use",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 30, 2025 / 9:13 PM EDT/ CBS News During an Oval Office send-off Friday marking the end of his formal role with the Trump administration, Elon Musk lashed out when asked about aNew York Times reportalleging he was a frequent user of the drug ketamine during the 2024 campaign. \"The New York Times. Is that the same publication that got a Pulitzer Prize for false reporting on the Russiagate?\" Musk asked while standing alongside President Trump, cutting off a question from Fox News reporter Peter Doocy about the Times. \"Let's move on.\" Musk's remarks came on the same day that the Times reported he used ketamine — which can be used bothrecreationally and medically— as often as once a day in 2024. Musk has told people he took ketamine so frequently that it affected his bladder, and he has also used ecstasy and magic mushrooms at times, the paper said, citing unnamed sources. CBS News has reached out to Musk and his spokesperson for comment. Musk hassaid publiclyhe has aprescription for ketamine. But he toldjournalist Don Lemonlast year he uses it infrequently, taking a \"small amount once every other week\" to help him get out of a \"depressive mindstate.\" He told Lemon he doesn't feel he's abused the drug, saying, \"if you use too much ketamine, you can't really get work done…and I have a lot of work.\" Musk also told Lemon that at times, weeks will go by without him using ketamine. The Wall Street Journalreported last yearthat some Musk associates worry his reported drug use could harm his businesses, which include Tesla, SpaceX, social network X and several other firms. The billionaire has brushed off any concerns about the impact on his companies, telling Lemon, \"what matters is execution.\" Musk has said he has atop-secret security clearance, which typically requiresdrug testing. Ahallucinogenic drug, ketamine is approved by the Food and Drug Administration as an anesthetic. The FDA says ithas notauthorized ketamine to treat psychiatric disorders, thoughone of the moleculesthat makes up ketamine can be administered undermedical supervisionto treat depression. It is also sometimes distributed illegally. Ketamine can be \"very dangerous\" when used recreationally, Dr. Angelique Campen, an emergency room doctor in California, haspreviously toldCBS News Los Angeles. The drug drew attention after it was partly blamed for the2023 deathof actor Matthew Perry. The Oval Office back-and-forth came as Musk wrapped up his stint as a \"special government employee\" in the Trump administration, where he oversaw the cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Musk and his team have swept through the government in recent months, slashing federal contracts and cutting staff — drawing applause from Trump allies and condemnation from opponents. Musk had predicted he could cut $1 trillion from the federal budget, but the administration says DOGE has saved about $170 billion so far — though Musk predicted Friday the $1 trillion goal is still possible \"over time.\" Some of the cuts tallied by DOGE havecontained errors, and one analysis estimates DOGEmay end up costingthe government hundreds of billions due to lost productivity and changes to federal workers' status. In recent days, Musk has criticized parts of Mr. Trump's agenda. Hetold CBS Newsearlier this week he has some \"differences of opinion\" with the administration, and feels \"a little stuck in a bind\" when he disagrees. Healso saidhe was \"disappointed\" by the price tag of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a sweeping Trump-backed bill passed by House Republicans last week. But in Friday's Oval Office event, Mr. Trumpwas laudatory of Musk, saying his role \"has been without comparison in modern history.\" Musk said he expects to keep visiting the White House and will serve as a \"friend and adviser\" to the president.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 30, 2025 / 9:03 PM EDT/ CBS/AP The National Weather Service issued tornado warnings for parts of Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia and Virginia on Friday, hours after a harsh storm hit a remote area of central Kentucky, killing one person and injuring at least 14 more, officials said. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshearwroteon social media that one person was killed and at least 14 injured when a \"reported tornado\" struck Washington County. Beshear said that three adults and a child were still hospitalized, while 10 others were treated and released. In an earlier news conference, Washington County Sheriff's officials also said that the area appeared to have been struck by a tornado. Washington County Judge-executive Timothy Graves said two or three houses were destroyed and downed trees temporarily blocked roads. \"We were fortunate this was located in a remote part of the county,\" Graves said. Beshear canceled a visit planned for Friday to Pulaski and Laurel counties, which were hit by a tornado earlier this month.That stormleft 19 dead in the state. \"This level of severe weather was unexpected, with a system still moving through the state,\" Beshear wrote. \"We also expect to see additional storms today with Eastern and Southeastern Kentucky facing a risk of more severe weather. Please be alert this morning and stay safe.\" The National Weather Service's office in Louisville, Kentucky, said a crew surveying damage Friday in Washington County was following a damage path that may enter neighboring Mercer County. By midday, the crew had found \"at least\" EF1 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale tornado damage in southwestern Washington County, the office said in a social media post. Three of the injured people were taken to University of Kentucky Hospital in Lexington. County Emergency Management Director Kevin Devine said the county was not expecting harsh weather Friday morning. In a social media post, the sheriff's office asked people to stay home to allow emergency workers to do their jobs. In Tennessee, multiple people were injured when severe weather hit the Philadelphia area of Loudon County, on Friday morning, the county sheriff's office said in a social media post. The weather service's office in Morristown later preliminarily confirmed in a social media post that an EF0 tornado struck near the border of Loudon and Monroe counties. Also on Friday, National Weather Service surveyors said a Thursday afternoon tornado near Atlanta reached top wind speeds estimated at 135 mph, throwing the son of actor Tray Chaney nearly 300 feet from the second-floor window of his home and leaving him with critical injuries. The storm, rated EF2, damaged about a dozen houses in a subdivision in Locust Grove, about 30 miles southeast of the city. Residents told news outlets they had no advance warning of the twister, which meteorologists said dropped out of a thunderstorm that had showed weak and broad rotation. The tornado was on the ground for 5 minutes, covering 1.8 miles. Along one street, the tornado ripped off siding and shingles, blowing out windows. Damage was worst at the Chaney home, which was destroyed except for one interior closet on the first floor where clothes were still hanging. Malachi Chaney, the son, was found in nearby woods and taken to an Atlanta hospital. Tray Chaney, best known for his role on \"The Wire,\" said his son remained hospitalized in intensive care on Friday, with injuries including broken ribs and fractured bones in his face. Tray Chaney said he suffered a bruise on the head. In a video recorded shortly thereafter, Chaney said he wished he could trade places with his son, who just completed his freshman year at Savannah State University. \"I wish he was the one that was doing the video, and I was still in the ICU,\" Tray Chaney said. It was the third round of tornadoes in northern Georgia this week, with the weather service confirming three weaker twisters northwest of Atlanta on Sunday and three more tornadoes west of the city on Tuesday. In addition to tornado warnings, the National Weather Service issued a tornado watch for parts of North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia until Friday night. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 30, 2025 / 8:55 PM EDT/ CBS News Approximately 250 million bees escaped after a tractor-trailer carrying more than 70,000 pounds of pollinator hives rolled over Friday in northern Washington state, authorities said. The commercial truck hauling the honeybees overturned at about 4 a.m. in Whatcom County, Washington, which borders Canada's British Columbia, the sheriff's office said in asocial media post. It's unclear what caused the truck to roll over. The hives came off the truck shortly after 9 a.m., which freed the bees. The incident happened on Weidkamp Road, which remains closed between Loomis Trail and West Badger roads, the Whatcom County Sheriff's Office said. Authorities said the public should avoid the area and stay at least 600 feet away. \"While there is no general health risk to the public, anyone who is allergic to bee stings or has concerns should check the State Department of Health webpage on bees and wasps,\" the sheriff's office said. Authorities said the road where the truck overturned will be closed for 24 to 48 hours to allow the bees to re-hive and find their queen bee. More than two dozen beekeepers came to assist with the rescue, the sheriff's office said, adding: \"The goal is to save as many of the bees as possible.\" \"At this time, on-scene work is done. Hive boxes from the overturned truck were recovered, restored and returned to use,\" authorities said in an update. \"By morning, most bees should have returned to their hives and those responsible for their delivery will be in charge.\" Kierra Frazier is a news editor for CBS News & Stations. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

Target stores joined a growing list of retailers that sold recalled cucumbers or ready-to-eat products featuring the fruit, and it's warning that purchasers should throw them away. The retailer issueda list of recalled products, including a Greek-style chicken salad from Boar's Head and several types of sushi restaurant staples, such as maki rolls with tempura and California rolls, all sold under the Mai brand. Last week, grocery store chain Walmart was added to the list of retailers urging customers to put the possibly tainted products in the trash, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; its Marketside cucumber slices are a part of the recall. Patients connected to the outbreak have turned up in Alabama, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia, the FDA said on Friday. Of 45 people who have reported illness connected to the outbreak, 16 have been hospitalized, the agency said. No deaths have been reported. While investigators' focus has been on the strain salmonella montevideo, multiple other strains were detected in samples taken from a Pennsylvania distribution center belonging to Florida-based Bedner Growers, believed to be a source, the FDA said in its Friday statement. The FDA said that those different strains so far appear to be unrelated to the spring outbreak, but that it is investigating further alongside scientists from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"CDC is working to determine if additional human illnesses match these additional strains,\" the FDA said. \"Further analysis of the sample is pending.\" All the illnesses so far have been connected to cucumbers produced by Bedner and distributed by Fresh Start Produce Sales, the agency said. The cucumbers and products that contained them were sold from April 29 to May 19, the FDA said. The first retailers noted for selling the potentially tainted cucumbers were three Bedner’s Farm Fresh Market locations in Florida, but the list of public-facing sellers has continued to increase. Other distributors as well as eateries were told they may have also purchased the possibly tainted cucumbers, labeled for wholesale as “supers,” “selects,” or “plains,\" the FDA said. FDA inspectors unearthed tainted cucumbers during an inspection last month of Bedner Growers' facilities, it said. The review was a follow-up to aSalmonella Africana outbreaklinked to the producer last year, according to the agency. Bedner's did not immediately respond to a request for comment late Friday. A spokesperson for Fresh Start Produce Sales said last week that the company \"is committed to protecting public health and helping Bedner Growers with its recall.\" Salmonella is a bacterium that can thrive amid animals and their fecal matter and contaminate nearby produce, which can reach the dinner tableif unwashed, according to the FDA and CDC. Older people, children under 5, and those with compromised immune systems are particularly susceptible to the salmonella's worst symptoms and even death. Patients sickened by it can develop stomach cramps, diarrhea, nausea and the urge to vomit anywhere from six hours to six days after infection, the CDC says. Salmonella is “a leading cause of foodborne illness, hospitalizations, and deaths in the United States and worldwide,\" the CDC states.",

    "title": "6-year-old dead in Florida; mom was trying to 'exorcise demons,' sheriff says",
    "article_text": "A 6-year-old child was found dead in his Florida home Friday, and his mother, who has been criminally charged in the death, believed she was being told to “exorcise demons out of the child’s body,” the St. Lucie County sheriff said. The body of the child, Ra’myl Pierre, was found in his bed in the family’s Fort Pierce home shortly after 10 a.m., after school resource deputies requested a welfare check, Sheriff Richard R. Del Toro Jr. said. His mother, Rhonda Paulynice, 31, was charged Friday with second-degree murder, failure to report a death, and with altering a body, Toro said. “What we did learn in speaking with the mother is she believes she was being told by God to basically exorcise demons out of the child’s body,” he said at a news conference. “And when the child had stopped moving and basically passed away, at that point she felt that the child had been released from those demons.” When the sheriff’s deputy arrived at the home Paulynice met the deputy in the driveway and escorted the officer into the home, where the dead boy was found in a bed in his bedroom, Toro said. The cause and manner of death could not be immediately determined and an autopsy will be performed, Toro said. The sheriff's office has responded to the home before, but nothing involving the mother and child, Toro said. They last responded on a call about a medical issue for the mother on May 17, the day before investigators believe the killing took place, he said. There had been some domestic issues at the home in the past involving the mother and her sister, who no longer lives there, but nothing involving the child, Toro said. The mother was interviewed by sheriff's detectives Friday, Toro said. \"During the course of the interviews, our detectives learned that the mother last spoke to the child on May 18th,\" he said. \"That’s when we believe the homicide occurred, and that she was responsible for child’s death.\" The second-degree murder case did not appear in online court records Friday evening, and it was not immediately clear if Paulynice had an attorney who could speak on her behalf. Toro told reporters at a Friday news conference that he has not spoken to the Paulynice, but he was told that she showed a range of emotions at the scene when speaking with investigators. \"What we do know is that she had a lot of highs and lows during the investigation — from laughing at different times at the scene to crying,\" he said. Investigators believe that the child has been dead in his room since May 18, Toro said, but he said the autopsy should help provide more insight. No one else lived at the home besides Paulynice and the boy, he said.",

    "title": "Alf Clausen, Emmy-winning composer for 'The Simpsons,'  dies at 84",
    "article_text": "LOS ANGELES — Alf Clausen, the Emmy-winning composer whose music provided essential accompaniment for the animated antics of “The Simpsons” for 27 years, has died. His daughter Kaarin Clausen told The Associated Press that Alf Clausen died Thursday at his home in Los Angeles after struggling with Parkinson’s disease for about a decade. He was 84. Clausen, who also scored TV series including “Moonlighting” and “Alf” (“no relation,” he used to joke) was nominated for 30 Emmy Awards, 21 of them for “The Simpsons.” He won twice. Al Jean, an early “Simpsons” writer who was one of the key creative figures on the show in the 1990s, said ina post on XFriday that “Clausen was an incredibly talented man who did so much for The Simpsons.” Danny Elfman wrote the show’s theme song, but Clausen joined the Fox animated series created by Matt Groening in 1990 and provided essentially all of its music until 2017, composing nearly 600 scores and conducting the 35-piece orchestra that played it in the studio His colleagues said his music was a key component of the show’s comedy, but Clausen believed the best way to back up the gags of Homer, Marge Bart and Lisa was by making the music as straight as possible. “This is a dream job for a composer,” Clausen told Variety, which first reported his death, in 1998. “Matt Groening said to me very early on, ‘We’re not a cartoon. We’re a drama where the characters are drawn. I want you to score it like a drama.’ I score the emotions of the characters as opposed to specific action hits on the screen.” Groening, in a 1996 interview, called him “one of the unacknowledged treasures of the show.” Clausen was born in Minneapolis and raised in Jamestown, North Dakota. He graduated from the Berklee College of Music in 1966, and moved to Los Angeles seeking a career in music. In the 1970s he was a musical director on several TV variety shows including “Donny & Marie.” Clausen worked as an orchestrator for composer Lee Holdridge in his scores for 1980s films including “Splash” and “The Beastmaster.” It was Holdridge who first got the composing job on “Moonlighting,” the late-80s ABC rom-com detective series starring Bruce Willis and Cybil Shepherd, but he handed the gig off to Clausen, who would get six Emmy nominations for his music on it. Clausen won his Emmys for “The Simpsons” in 1997 and 1998. He also won five Annie Awards, which honor work in animation in film and television. He was fired from “The Simpsons” in a cost-cutting move in 2017, to the outrage of his collaborators and fans. He sued over his dismissal. Clausen is survived by his wife Sally, children Kaarin, Scott and Kyle, stepchildren Josh and Emily, and 11 grandchildren.",

    "title": "No charges were filed against Smokey Robinson after 2015 sexual assault allegation",
    "article_text": "LOS ANGELES — A sexual assault allegation was made against Motown legend Smokey Robinson in 2015, but no charges were filed because of inasufficient evidence, the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office said. The decade-old allegation, which was presented to the prosecutor’s office by the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, is not connected toa recent civil suit that accuses Robinson of sexual assault, attorneys for the plaintiffs in that matter said. Robinson, 85, has not been charged with any crime and has denied any misconduct.The celebrity news website TMZwas first to report the 2015 investigation Friday. “We discovered that our office was presented with a sexual assault allegation against Mr. Robinson in 2015 by the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department,” the district attorney’s office said in a statement Friday. “In that matter, a declination of charges was made based on insufficient evidence,” the district attorney’s office said. “We are not able to provide further information at this time because of an ongoing law enforcement investigation.” The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department confirmed that it conducted an investigation and that no charges were ever filed. \"Due to the confidential nature of the investigation, we cannot provide more information,\" th sheriff's department said in a statement Friday. Earlier this month, Robinson wassued by four former housekeeperswho have accused the \"You’ve Really Got a Hold on Me\" singer of sexual assault. The suit, which seeks at least $50 million, also names Robinson's wife and accused her of knowing about the allegations. Robinsonhas denied the claims, and this weekcountersued the four women and their attorneys, alleging defamation and seeking at least $500 million. Attorney Christopher Frost, who is representing Robinson and his wife, said his client maintains his innocence. \"One unfortunate aspect of celebrity is that it is not uncommon to be the target of spurious and unsubstantiated allegations,\" Frost said. \"Mr. Robinson looks forward to the conclusion of the current investigation, and has no doubt that a similar determination will be reached here.\" Attorneys for the women suing Robinson said Friday that the declination of the criminal case in 2015 only means there was a lack of evidence. The person who made the allegation in 2015 is not any of the four women who are suing Robinson, according to the attorneys, John Harris and Herbert Hayden. \"The statement released by the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office confirms that charges were not filed against Mr. Robinson due to insufficient evidence — not because the claims lacked merit,\" Harris and Hayden said. \"This underscores the significant challenges victims face when reporting incidents of sexual assault, particularly when the alleged perpetrator is a powerful and well-known figure,\" they said. On May 15,NBC News reported that Robinson is under criminal investigation, citing a law enforcement source that it did not name. Robinson is an iconic American soul singer who has had a star-studded career spanning more than 70 years. The recording, producing and songwriting legend was a pioneer for Motown Records, founding the vocal group the Miracles in the 1950s and later releasing albums as a solo artist and working as a record executive for the label. He was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1987.",

    "title": "As EVs stumble, automakers are bringing back a kind of hybrid that promises long range",
    "article_text": "Major automakers are set to resurrect a type of hybrid vehicle that seemed dead in the U.S. just a few years ago to meet a changing consumer demand landscape. Extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs) are a form of plug-in hybrid that falls midway between traditional hybrids and full EVs. EREV cars and trucks rely on battery powered motors for propulsion (like an EV) but also have a relatively small gas engine to use as a generator to keep the batteries charged up (like a typical hybrid). A key difference between EREVs and other hybrids is the relative size of their batteries and gas engines. Mainstream hybrids and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) like the Toyota Prius still rely on combustion engines as their main means of propulsion. Thus, they have proportionately smaller batteries, but substantial gas engines that are directly connected to their drivetrains to help move the car. EREVs are much more focused on the electric side of the equation, so they tend to have bigger batteries than other hybrids, but comparatively small gas engines that solely function as generators to top off the batteries when needed.Earlier examples of this type of vehicle — the Chevy Volt and Fisker Karma — were introduced to the U.S market in 2011. These were followed by the BMW i3 and Cadillac ELR in 2014. But EREVs (also known as Range Extended Electric Vehicles, or REEVs), never attracted much interest from American consumers. The Volt was the most popular EREV by far, with GM selling 157,000 over nine years, until it ended production in 2019. That may seem impressive, but it’s a blip in the overall U.S. new vehicle market, which saw about 16 million sales each year in that timeframe. The last EREV sold domestically was the i3, which BMW discontinued in 2022. While there are no new EREVs for sale in the U.S., several are in the pipeline. This includes an upcoming version of the Ram 1500 pickup truck, set to come to market in early 2026. A Ram spokesman noted that it will have the longest driving range the company has ever offered in a light-duty truck, up to 690 total miles between its gas engine and battery power. An EREV version of the Jeep Grand Wagoneer is also under development, according to the company. Volkswagen is planning to begin production of an EREVpickup truck and SUVunder the Scout brand name starting in 2027. Hyundai Motors plans to introduce EREV versions of its mid-sized SUVs by the end of 2026, according to a spokesman. The vehicles are expected to have more than 560 miles of range, and be sold under the Hyundai and Genesis brands. In addition, a Nissan spokesman confirmed that the company is considering offering EREV options in its mid-size and larger SUVs. “They do offer advantages versus 100% EVs when it comes to hauling and towing,” he said, “allowing greater driving range without the need for a large capacity battery, as well as faster refueling.” James Martin, the director of consulting services at S&P Global Mobility, says one reason manufacturers are turning to EREVs is lower production costs. EREV use of smaller and less expensive batteries than full EVs allows manufacturers to keep their expenses down. EREVs are also less complex than plug-in hybrids, Martin said. PHEVs have two functioning propulsion systems and sophisticated controls to allow them to communicate with each other. Most EREVs, by contrast, are solely propelled by their electric motors. But one of the biggest advantages of EREVs is range. In China, where EREVs are gaining in popularity, the manufacturer BYD offers mid-sized sedans with more than1,300 miles of claimed range. EREVs also alleviate range anxiety due to the ubiquity of gas stations. Consumers can just fill up with gasoline to charge the battery if a charging port is unavailable. The new EREVs can travel more than 100 miles on batteries alone, then hundreds more using gasoline. “Range anxiety is still a factor when it comes to choosing an electric vehicle over an internal combustion vehicle,” said K. Venkatesh Prasad, senior vice president of research and chief innovation officer at the Center for Automotive Research. “EREVs, allay the range anxiety concern,” he said. These hybrids may especially appeal to consumers who frequently travel long distances, and getting more consumers used to plugging in their vehicles might also appeal to manufacturers. “The actual charging experience of EREVs is very similar to that of BEVs,” Prasad said. “So, the market adoption of EREVs is likely to be seen as a good ramp to future BEV purchase considerations,” he added. Charging infrastructure is still lagging in many areas of the U.S., according to iSeeCars.com executive analyst Karl Brauer, which can make a full EV impractical for consumers. EREVs avoid that issue and may also be attractive to consumers who live in apartments or houses that lack charging stations. Arecent reportfrom McKinsey noted that EREVs could also combat cost concerns among consumers, noting that the smaller batteries can shave off as much as $6,000 in powertrain production costs, compared to BEVs. Another factor, according to McKinsey, is that both domestic and European manufacturers have seen how EREVs have gained sales momentum in China, a sign the technology may help to increase electrification adoption in their own marketplaces. “We expect all levels of hybridization to increase production in North America throughout the decade,” said Eric Anderson, the associate director of Americas light vehicle powertrain forecasting for S&P Global Mobility. Hybrids, including EREVs, are a “relatively affordable way for consumers to move up the electrification ladder without a significant monthly payment increase, he said. While the EV vehicle market continued to grow last year, the pace of growth has slowed considerably. “The BEV market is in the process of shifting from early adopters to a more price-conscious buyer,” Anderson said. Domestic sales of hybrids grew from 1,175,456 in 2023 to 1,609,035 in 2024, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, a 37% increase. Plug-in hybrids grew 10% in the same period — from 293,578 to 321,774. By comparison, fully electric EVs saw 7% growth, from 1,164,638 to 1,247,656. While overall sales of traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles continues to dominate, its market share hasfallen every year since 2015, according to Edmunds. Last year, ICE vehicle sales fell to 80.8% of total U.S. sales, down from 84% in 2023. Another attribute that might make EREVs popular with consumers is resale value. Hybrids — which includes EREVs and more common plug-in hybrids — depreciate less than EVs or traditional gas vehicles. Since depreciation is the most expensive part of car ownership, finding a vehicle that better retains its value can provide consumers with significant savings. By contrast, electric cars and trucks lose value faster than any other vehicle type — dropping by 58.8% after five years, compared to the overall vehicle depreciation average of 45.6% and only 40.7% for hybrids, according to research from iSeeCars. “Electric vehicle sales have been slowing on both the new and used market, with EVs sitting on dealer lots longer despite falling prices,” Brauer said. “Consumers are showing increasing appreciation for hybrid vehicles, creating a friendly environment for automakers to introduce more plug-in hybrids as an intermediate step toward full electric vehicles.” Ram 1500 extended range hybrid pickup, set to come to market in early 2026, will have the longest driving range the company has ever offered in a light-duty truck, up to 690 total miles between its gas engine and battery power.Ram | Stellantis",

    "title": "CDC recommends parents talk to a doctor about getting COVID-19 shots for kids",
    "article_text": "By Pien Huang , Rob Stein The CDC's vaccine schedule recommends COVID vaccines for children through 'shared clinical decision-making.' There is no recommendation for pregnant women.kamon_saejueng/iStockphoto/Getty Imageshide caption The federal government has removed the recommendation that children and pregnant women get routine COVID-19 vaccines. The change, reflected in new vaccine schedules posted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on May 30,results from a directiveannounced on May 27 by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., ina minute-long video posted on X. \"I couldn't be more pleased to announce that as of today the COVID vaccine for healthy children and healthy pregnant women has been removed from the CDC recommended immunization schedule,\" Kennedy said in the video, \"We're now one step closer to realizing President Trump's promise to make America healthy again.\" The reality of the recommendations is more nuanced. Previously, the CDC had urged everyone six months and older to get annual, updated COVID shots as a routine recommendation. Now, the CDC's vaccine schedule recommends COVID vaccines for children throughshared clinical decision-making— that is, if a doctor and a patient decide together that it makes sense. And there'sno recommendationfor pregnant women to get COVID vaccines. \"We are relieved to see today that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated its schedules for child and adolescent immunizations to allow families to maintain the choice to immunize their children against COVID in consultation with their doctor,\"Dr. Susan Kressly,President of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in anemailed statement. \"However, the deeply flawed process to reach the recommendation raises serious concerns about the stability of the nation's immunization infrastructure and commitment by federal leaders to make sure families can access critical immunizations, whether for COVID or other infectious diseases,\" Kressly said. Kennedy's announcement on May 27 blindsided CDC staff, who were not informed of the change to COVID-19 vaccine policy before the decision went public, according to a CDC official who requested anonymity since they were not authorized to speak to the media. Hours afterthe post on X, CDC staffers received a directive from Secretary Kennedy — dated May 19, but sent May 27 — rescinding the department's 2022 acceptance of the CDC's recommendations for the use of COVID shots in children and during pregnancy. The directive, viewed by NPR, ordered the CDC to remove these recommendations from their vaccine schedules. The changes contradict the advice of professional medical groups such as the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American Academy of Pediatrics, who continue to recommend COVID vaccines to children and pregnant women based on scientific evidence that shows they are safe and effective. Their logos appearedon previous versionsof the CDC's vaccine schedules, but are absent from the current versions as their recommendations no longer align. Although children don't tend to get seriously ill from COVID, some do,especially very young children. Pregnant womenremain at high riskfor serious complications from the virus, according to the American Academy of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Public health experts are alarmed by how the changes were made. Typically, \"it's a very transparent public process,\" saysDr. Sean O'Leary, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, who represents the AAP as a liaison to the CDC's vaccine advisory committee. \"The data are shared publicly, the discussion happens publicly and then they come to a decision on how to recommend vaccines.\" The closed-door process upends the public discussions and votes that have been a hallmark of vaccine policymaking for decades. The decision will make it much harder for parents to get their children vaccinated and for pregnant people to get the shots, O'Leary says. For clinicians, \"shared clinical decision-making conversations are really challenging to have in a ten-minute office visit,\" he says, and with a loosening of the recommendations, fewer doctors' offices may choose to keep the vaccines on hand. Some insurance companies may no longer pay for them, saysRichard Hughes, a former executive at the vaccine company Moderna, who now teaches healthcare law and policy at George Washington University. \"Expect variability in coverage, prior authorization and out-of-pocket [costs], all of which will discourage uptake,\" he says. The downgrading of COVID vaccine recommendations comes soon afterthe administration made changes that could dramatically restrictthe availability of the next round of COVID boosters. The government will now require additional testing for the vaccines to be approved for use by anyone other than people who are at high risk from COVID because they are age 65 or older or have risk factors for other health problems.

We've got our general tips right here if you'd like some advice, as well as a hint for today's Wordle if you need someone to help turn those grey boxes into a winning row of greens. It definitely didn't feel like it at the time, but every guess I made today was a good one. Yes, even the one at the top with five grey letters. Every clue pushed me closer to today's answer, every green and yellow letter a huge help. Not the quickest game of the week, but somehow it still felt satisfying. Think of something you do often—so often you might not even realise you're doing it at all. No, there is not a double letter in today's puzzle. A good starting word can be the difference between victory and defeat with the daily puzzle, but once you've got the basics, it's much easier to nail down those Wordle wins. And as there's nothing quite like a small victory to set you up for the rest of the day, here are a few tips to help set you on the right path: There's no racing against the clock with Wordle so you don't need to rush for the answer. Treating the game like a casual newspaper crossword can be a good tactic; that way, you can come back to it later if you're coming up blank.

Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Past Wordle answers can give you some excellent ideas for fun starting words that keep your daily puzzle-solving fresh. They are also a good way to eliminate guesses for today's Wordle, as the answer is unlikely to be repeated. Here are some recent Wordle answers: Wordle gives you six rows of five boxes each day, and you'll need to work out which secret five-letter word is hiding inside them to keep up your winning streak. You shouldstart with a strong wordlike ARISE, or any other word that contains a good mix of common consonants and multiple vowels. You'll also want to avoid starting words with repeating letters, as you're wasting the chance to potentially eliminate or confirm an extra letter. Once you hit Enter, you'll see which ones you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second guess should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. With a bit of luck, you should have some coloured squares to work with and set you on the right path. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it wassold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes. When baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do.

    "title": "NYT claims Musk is addicted to drugs",
    "article_text": "Tech billionaire Elon Musk, a major ally of US President Donald Trump, has been consuming an alarming amount of drugs, the New York Times reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter. The report came out shortly after Musk announced that he would step down from the leadership role in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a task force aimed at cutting wasteful government spending. Although the CEO of SpaceX, Tesla, and X had admitted in the past to taking ketamine prescribed for depression about every two weeks, the Times wrote that he has“developed a far more serious habit”as his drug consumption“went well beyond occasional use.” The Times cited its sources as saying that Musk had been using ketamine“often, sometimes daily,”and mixing it with other drugs, as well as taking Ecstasy and psychedelic mushrooms. The businessman reportedly traveled with a daily medication box that held about 20 pills, including ones marked as Adderall, a stimulant used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). He has also been warned in advance about random drug tests of SpaceX employees, the Times said. In 2018, the Times reported that some board members at Tesla were worried about his use of the sleep drug Ambien. The Wall Street Journal reported last year that senior executives at SpaceX and Tesla were also concerned about Musk’s consumption of drugs, including LSD and cocaine. Musk dodged a reporter’s question about his alleged drug use at a press conference with Trump at the Oval Office on Friday, dismissing the Times as“the same publication that got a Pulitzer Prize for false reporting on Russiagate.”He said in 2024 that“not even trace quantities were found of any drugs or alcohol”in his system over the three years of tests at SpaceX. Musk said that his departure is“not the end of DOGE,”whose team will grow over time.“I will continue to be visiting here and be a friend and adviser to the president,”Musk said at the White House.",

He reiterated that Beijing would always fully support Hong Kong in taking advantage of its uniqueness and deepening cooperation with mainland provinces and cities, which would serve the country’s overall development. “With the strong leadership of the central government and the institutional strengths of the ‘one country, two systems’ governing principle, the cooperation between the two places will surely be able to lead the nation’s high-quality development,” he said at the event. Lau Siu-kai, a consultant to the semi-official Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies think tank, told the Post that Zhou was a very seasoned official. “He should have greater political powers in implementing the central government’s policies in Hong Kong,” he said.

(File photo: Reuters/Aly Song) SHANGHAI: China called on Saturday (May 31) for its automotive industry to halt brutal price wars, as a threat to the sector's health and sustainable development, after key executives jousted over pricing pressure following large discounts offered to buyers. Tension between some top players in the world's largest auto markethas spilt into the open as competition intensifies, with price wars begun in early 2023 showing little sign of abating, despite concern among both government and industry. The industry ministry vowed to step up efforts to correct what it called excessive competition, the official news agency Xinhua said on Saturday. \"There are no winners in a 'price war', let alone a future,\" the agency cited an unidentified ministry official as saying.

    "article_text": "Singapore Singapore Drugs seized from a hotel room at Geylang Lorong 10 and from a condominium at Tampines Street 86 in May 2025. (Photos: CNB) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Nearly 3.6kg of heroin was seized and 139 people arrested during drug raids across Singapore in May, the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) said on Saturday (May 31). Of the 139 arrested, the youngest was a 14-year-old student for suspected drug use. CNB officers conducted raids from May 18 to May 30, covering areas such as Ang Mo Kio, Boon Keng, Bukit Merah, Jurong and Sengkang. During the raids, more than S$626,700 (US$486,000) worth of drugs were seized. Besides the heroin, another 2.7kg of cannabis, 1.3kg of Ice, 155g of Ecstasy, 26g of cocaine and more than 200 Erimin-5 were found. Officers also discovered 49 vape devices suspected to contain tetrahydrocannabinol, a cannabinoid found in cannabis, and 22 LSD stamps. In the early morning of May 23, CNB launched a raid in Tuas South Avenue, acting on information it received. Five foreign nationals – men aged between 23 and 34 – were arrested for suspected drug offences. Two of them struggled to resist arrest, and \"necessary force\" was used to subdue them, said CNB. A 23-year-old man was spotted disposing of substances, including 2g of cannabis. Another man was found with Ice. The officers also arrested a 32-year-old man after 27g of cannabis was found in a room in a \"residential lodging\" in the area. On May 28, CNB officers raided a hotel room in Geylang Lorong 10 and arrested a 46-year-old man for suspected drug trafficking offences. The officers forced their way in because the man had refused to comply with orders to open the door. More than 2.8kg of heroin was found, together with 565g of Ice, 20g of cannabis, 24g of ketamine, four Erimin-5 tablets and over S$500 in cash. The following day, a 29-year-old man was arrested at the car park of a condominium at Tampines Street 86 for suspected drug trafficking offences. He was escorted to his \"hideout in the condominium\", said CNB. Officers found more than 2kg of cannabis, 165g of Ice, 103g of ketamine, 37g of Ecstasy, 26g of cocaine and 22 LSD stamps, as well as Erimin-5 tablets and 49 vapes. Assistant Commissioner Aaron Tang, director CNB's Intelligence Division, said: \"The drugs we seized from the operation would have destroyed countless lives and families in Singapore. \"Our message is clear - those who choose to profit from selling drugs will face the full force of CNB’s actions. We will hunt these drug traffickers down to keep Singapore drug-free for our communities.\" Investigations into the arrested suspects are ongoing. If a person is found guilty of trafficking more than 15g of diamorphine or pure heroin, or 250g of methamphetamine, or more than 500g of cannabis, they may face the mandatory death penalty.

    "title": "Trump plans to double steel, aluminium tariffs to 50%",
    "article_text": "World World US President Donald Trump delivers remarks at US Steel Corporation–Irvin Works in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, May 30, 2025. (Photo: Reuters/Leah Millis) WEST MIFFLIN, Pennsylvania: US President Donald Trump on Friday (May 30) said he planned to increase tariffs on foreign imports of steel and aluminium to 50 per cent from 25 per cent, ratcheting up pressure on global steel producers and deepening his trade war. \"We're going to bring it from 25 per cent to 50 per cent – the tariffs on steel into the United States of America, which will even further secure the steel industry in the United States,\" he said ata rally in Pennsylvania. Trump announced the tariff increase on steel products at a speech given just outside of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he was talking up an agreement between Nippon Steel and US Steel. Trump said the US$14.9 billion deal, like the tariff increase, will help keep jobs for steel workers in the US. He later posted on social media that the increased tariff would also apply to aluminium products and that it would take effect on Wednesday. Shares of steelmaker Cleveland-Cliffs Inc surged 26 per cent after the market close as investors bet the new levies will help its profits. The doubling of steel and aluminium levies intensifies Trump's global trade war and came just hours after he accused China of violating an agreement with the US to mutually roll back tariffs and trade restrictions for critical minerals. Canada's Chamber of Commerce quickly denounced the tariff hike as \"antithetical to North American economic security\". \"Unwinding the efficient, competitive and reliable cross-border supply chains like we have in steel and aluminium comes at a great cost to both countries,\" Candace Laing, president of the chamber, said in a statement. Trump spoke at US Steel's Mon Valley Works, a steel plant that symbolises both the one-time strength and the decline of US manufacturing power as the Rust Belt's steel plants and factories lost business to international rivals. Closely contested Pennsylvania is also a major prize in presidential elections. The US is the world's largest steel importer, excluding the European Union, with a total of 26.2 million tons of imported steel in 2024, according to the Department of Commerce. As a result, the new tariffs will likely increase steel prices across the board, hitting industry and consumers alike. Steel and aluminium tariffs were among the earliest put into effect by Trump when he returned to office in January. The tariffs of 25 per cent on most steel and aluminium imported to the US went into effect in March, and he had briefly threatened a 50 per cent levy on Canadian steel but ultimately backed off. Under the so-called Section 232 national security authority, the import taxes include both raw metals and derivative products as diverse as stainless steel sinks, gas ranges, air conditioner evaporator coils, horseshoes, aluminium frying pans and steel door hinges. The 2024 import value for the 289 product categories came to US$147.3 billion, with nearly two-thirds aluminium and one-third steel, according to Census Bureau data retrieved through the US International Trade Commission's Data Web system. By contrast, Trump's first two rounds of punitive tariffs on Chinese industrial goods in 2018 during his first term totalled US$50 billion in annual import value.

    "article_text": "World World \"The threat China poses is real, and it could be imminent,\" says US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore. US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth speaks at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore on May 31, 2025. (Photo: CNA/Wallace Woon) SINGAPORE: US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth warned on Saturday (May 31) that the threat from China was real and potentially imminent as he pushed allies in the Indo-Pacific to spend more on their own defence needs. Hegseth, speaking for the first time at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, Asia's premier forum for defence leaders, militaries and diplomats, laid out how theIndo-Pacific region was a priority for the Trump administration. \"There's no reason to sugar coat it. The threat China poses is real, and it could be imminent,\" Hegseth said, in some of his strongest comments on China since he took office in January. He added that any attempt by China to conquer Taiwan \"would result in devastating consequences for the Indo-Pacific and the world\", and echoed Trump's comment that China will not invade Taiwan on the president's watch. China views Taiwan as its own territory and has vowed to \"reunify\" with the democratic and separately governed island, by force if necessary. It has stepped up military and political pressure to assert those claims, including increasing the intensity of war games around Taiwan. Taiwan's governmentrejects Beijing's sovereignty claims,saying only the island's people can decide their future. \"It has to be clear to all that Beijing is credibly preparing to potentially use military force to alter the balance of power in the Indo Pacific,\" Hegseth said. But his comments on allies needing to increase spending are likely to cause consternation among partners, even though experts said Hegseth would face a relatively friendly audience in Singapore. China's Defence Minister Dong Jun has decided toskip the major Asian security forumand Beijing has sent only an academic delegation. Hegseth has previously taken aim at allies in Europe for not spending more on their own defence. In February, he warned Europe against treating America like a \"sucker\" while addressing a press conference at NATO headquarters in Brussels. On Friday, while delivering the keynote address at the Shangri-La Dialogue, French President Emmanuel Macron said Hegseth was justified inasking Europe to increase its defence spending. \"It's hard to believe, a little bit, after some trips to Europe that I'm saying this, but thanks to President Trump, Asian allies should look to countries in Europe as a new found example,\" Hegseth said. \"NATO members are pledging to spend 5 per cent of their GDP on defence, even Germany. So it doesn't make sense for countries in Europe to do that while key allies in Asia spend less on defence in the face of an even more formidable threat, not to mention North Korea.\" US Democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth, who is co-leading a bipartisan delegation to the Shangri-La Dialogue, said it was noteworthy that Hegseth emphasised that the United States was committed to the region, but his language on allies was not helpful. \"I thought it was patronising of our friends in the Indo-Pacific in particular,\" Duckworth said. Spending on weapons and research is spiking among some Asian countries as they respond to a darkening security outlook by broadening their outside industrial partnerships while trying to boost their own defence industries, according to a new study by the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, the organisation that runs the Shangri-La Dialogue. The spike comes even as Asian nations spent an average of 1.5 per cent of GDP on defence in 2024, a figure that has remained relatively constant over the last decade, it said. Hegseth suggested during his speech that allies in Europe focus on security on the European continent, so that Washington could focus on the threat posed by China in the Indo Pacific, alongside more participation by allies in Asia. \"We would much prefer that the overwhelming balance of European investment be on that continent, so that as we partner there, which we will continue to do, we're able to use our comparative advantage as an Indo-Pacific nation to support our partners here,\" he said in response to a question after his speech. But some of the Trump administration's early moves in the Indo-Pacific have raised eyebrows. The US moved air defence systems from Asia to the Middle East earlier this year as tensions with Iran spiked - an effort which took 73 C-17 flights. Hegseth, a former Fox TV host who has spent much of his first months in office focused on domestic issues, spoke to the international audience about issues that he has frequently talked about when in the United States, like \"restoring the warrior ethos\". \"We are not here to pressure other countries to embrace or adopt our politics or ideology. We are not here to preach to you about climate change or cultural issues,\" Hegseth said. \"We respect you, your traditions and your militaries. And we want to work with you where our shared interests align.\" Subscribe to CNA’s Morning Brief An automated curation of our top stories to start your day.

(File photo: REUTERS/Jennifer Gauthier) Pop superstar Taylor Swift said on Friday (May 30) that she had purchased the master recordings of her first six albums, giving her control of all of her music after a dispute with her former record label. Swift's masters had been sold in 2019 and the singer said she was not given the opportunity to buy them at the time. She re-recorded four of the albums with the subtitle \"Taylor's Version\". Swift purchased the original recordings from current owner Shamrock Capital in what she called her \"greatest dream come true\". No financial terms were disclosed. \"I've been bursting into tears of joy at random intervals ever since I found out this is really happening,\" she said in a statement on her website. \"I really get to say these words: All of the music I've ever made ... now belongs ... to me.\" The Fortnight singer also said she had re-recorded her 2006 self-titled debut album and parts of 2017 release Reputation. She said she would release them \"when the time is right, if that would be something you guys would be excited about\". Swift has won 14 Grammys, including an unprecedented four trophies for album of the year, and recently completed the highest-grossing concert tour of all time. The 35-year-old singer recorded her first six albums, which included hits such as Shake It Off and You Belong With Me, with Big Machine Label Group before leaving in 2018 for Universal Music Group. Music executive Scooter Braun bought Big Machine in 2019 and Swift publicly accused him of bullying her and refusing to give her a chance to purchase her original recordings. Swift said in 2020 that BMG had sold her music to Shamrock. Media reports at the time said the deal was worth more than US$300 million. Representatives for Braun did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) Swift praised executives at Shamrock, founded by Walt Disney's nephew Roy E Disney, as being \"honest, fair and respectful\". \"My first tattoo might just be a huge shamrock in the middle of my forehead,\" she joked.

    "article_text": "Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., joins ‘Fox News Live’ to reflect on Elon Musk’s legacy and codifying DOGE cuts. U2 frontman and longtime global activist Bono took a swing at the Trump administration disbanding theU.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)) on \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast, blaming the cuts for a staggering 300,000 deaths. And he was swiftly fact-checked by Rogan and Elon Musk in a takedown that lit up social media. \"This will f--- you off,\" Bono warned, claiming tens of thousands of tons of food are \"rotting\" in warehouses from Djibouti to Houston because of recent USAID cuts, and that the people who ran those warehouses have been fired.\"What is that? That’s not America, is it?\"I AM A USAID WHISTLEBLOWER. I'VE GOT TO ADMIT, MUSK IS MOSTLY RIGHT ABOUT AGENCY'S WASTE Joe Rogan, Bono and Elon Musk are shown in this composite image. Bono recently claimed on \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" that 300,000 people have died due to USAID cuts, a statement Rogan questioned and Musk later dismissed on social media.(Getty Images) Rogan wasn’thaving it. \"They’re throwing the baby out with the bathwater,\" he said, acknowledging that while some aid groups do good work, the USAID system has been riddled with corruption.\"For sure, it was a money laundering operation.

Musk, who has championed sharp cuts to what he sees as a bloated foreign aid machine, pushed for major USAID reforms under theDepartment of Government Efficiency(DOGE) before his formal departure this week. His response ignited debate online, with conservatives cheering for overdue accountability. Popular online commentator \"Catturd\" posted that \"I agree 100% withElon Muskthat Bono is an idiot and a liar.\" One commentator also wrote, \"They've made this 300,000 number up and propagandized people with it.\" Another eagle-eyed X user posted, \"Bono starts off by saying, ‘It’s not proven.’ So he’s lying.\" Bono’s 300,000 figure comes not from confirmed deaths, but froma speculative modelbuilt by Brooke Nichols, a mathematical health modeler at Boston University, projecting what could happen as a result of the cuts. Bono poses during \"Bono: Stories Of Surrender\" at the 78th annual Cannes Film Festival in France.(Stephane Cardinale/Corbis via Getty Images) Nichols has said that the number is a projection, not a direct count, due to the absence of real-time tracking in many affected regions. \"The biggest uncertainties in all of these estimates are: 1) the extent to which countries and organizations have pivoted to mitigate this disaster (likely highly variable),\" she wrote inThe Washington Post. \"And 2) which programs are actually still funded with funding actually flowing — and which aren’t.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The State Department did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

    "article_text": "Deputy Consul General of Israel in New York Tsach Saar says the call to \"globalize the Intifada\" isn't just a problem for Jews and Israelis, it's a problem for Americans. Deputy Consul General of Israel in New York, Tsach Saar, is sending a warning to America after the deadly shooting of twoIsraeli Embassystaffers in D.C.: Radicalism isn’t just a problem for Israelis and Jews — it’s a problem for all Americans. \"It’s not an Israeli problem and not a Jewish problem, it's an American problem. These people who incite, who call for violence, who useantisemitic rhetoric, at the end of the day, they are shaking the pillars of American democracy,\" Saar told Fox News Digital. The diplomat also spoke about the phrase \"globalize the Intifada,\" a slogan that has become more common at anti-Israel demonstrations. Saar says the phrase refers to those seeking to export violence beyond the Middle East to places like America, making the D.C. shooting much more than a local tragedy. Image shows Sarah Milgrim and Yaron Lischinsky, who were the latest victims in a long history of attacks on Israeli embassy staff members.(Image of police vehicle: Photo by Tom Brenner For The Washington Post via Getty Images,Image of Sarah and Yaron: Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs) SLAIN ISRAELI EMBASSY WORKERS WERE ON VERGE OF ENGAGEMENT, AMBASSADOR SAYS \"Intifada is a direct call for violence against Jews. So, we have violence on American soil, we have division in American society. It weakens the American democracy and that puts it very, very high on the agenda for Americans themselves. And I have to tell you, people that I speak with, they know exactly what I'm talking about and they understand how severe the problem is. And now it's time for action,\" he said. Elias Rodriguez, the suspect in the fatal shooting of Sarah Milgrim and Yaron Lischinsky outside the Capital Jewish Museum, was heard chanting \"free, free Palestine\" during his arrest. This prompted renewed discussions about the rhetoric used in anti-Israel demonstrations in the wake of the Oct. 7 massacre and resulting war in Gaza. College campuses, which became hotspots for anti-Israel agitators after Oct. 7, have heard this kind of rhetoric, with one of the epicenters being Columbia University in New York. School officials are continuing to negotiate with students to clear an anti-Israel encampment on Columbia University in New York.(Getty Images) ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTERS TORCH DIPLOMAS OUTSIDE COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY ON GRADUATION DAY Saar told Fox News Digital that it’s clear that not just Jewish and Israeli students, but also those who express pro-Israel views feel \"unsafe\" on campuses across the country. While Saar acknowledged that America’s First Amendment \"is sacred,\" he warned that there is a difference between expressing one’s viewpoint and inciting violence. Even as Jews and Israelis feel unsafe, Saar does not think the answer is to hide who they are, but rather to unite and \"resist by all legal means\" those who use lies and hateful rhetoric to incite violence. \"The answer is not hiding our stars [of David], we should be proud of who we are,\" Saar said. He added that he had seen individuals on social media expressing support for the murders of Milgrim and Lischinsky. Protesters marched to New York's historic Grand Central Terminal, where they occupied the station for a period of time on April 7, 2025.(Selcuk Acar/Anadolu via Getty Images) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Antisemitism has been on the risein the U.S. since Hamas carried out its attacks against Israel in October 2023. In April, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) released its annual audit on antisemitism in which it identified 9,354 antisemitic incidents in the U.S. during 2024, marking a 5% increase from 2023. This was the fourth year in a row that the organization noted a record-breaking number of antisemitic incidents across the country.

The governor's budget proposal, written by the California Department of Finance, said the reasons for the increased costs include \"higher overall enrollment, pharmacy costs and higher managed care costs.\" In the last 10 years, he said, Medi-Cal costs have increased by $20.5 billion. NEWSOM PROPOSES FREEZE ON ALLOWING ADULT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS TO JOIN CALIFORNIA MEDICAID PROGRAM Newsomhas also proposed freezing new enrollment for adults in thecountry illegallyas a way to cut Medi-Cal costs. \"Some of the most significant contributing factors to this growth are the COVID-19 continuous coverage requirement and the implementation of major policy changes such as the full elimination of the asset test for older adults and the full-scope expansion to all income-eligible Californians, regardless ofimmigration status,\" the proposal said. . The assets included in the test would be salary, money in a bank account, cash on hand, a second car, home value and retirement funds. Applicants with more than $2,000 in assets would be ineligible for Medi-Cal. California Gov.

The program cost $37.6 billion over the last year, and the cost is expected to increase by $10 billion over the next year without cuts. Along with low-income adults, many seniors and people with disabilities use Medi-Cal benefits that include in-home care services. For decades before 2024, the asset test was required for seniors to prove their eligibility for Medi-Cal, and Newsom’s proposal would reinstate it. The proposal said that the asset test would save $94 million this fiscal year and $791 million by the 2028-29 fiscal year.

    "article_text": "Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Torrents of predawn rain unleashed flooding that killed at least 111 people in a market town where northern Nigerian farmers sell their wares to traders from the south, officials said Friday, predicting the death toll would grow. The Nigerian Hydrological Services Agency did not immediately say how much rain fell after midnight Thursday in the town of Mokwa in the state of Niger, more than 180 miles west of Abuja, the capital of Africa's most populous nation. SOUTHEAST MET WITH DANGEROUS FLOODING WHILE NORTHEAST BRACES FOR SNOWSTORMS Communities in northern Nigeria have been experiencing prolonged dry spells worsened by climate change and excessive rainfall that leads to severe flooding during the brief wet season. In videos and photos on social media, floodwaters covered neighborhoods and homes were submerged, with their roofs barely visible above the brown-colored waters.

Besides the 111 confirmed dead, \"more bodies have just been brought and are yet to be counted,\" Niger state emergency agency spokesman IIbrahim Audu Husseini told The Associated Press by telephone Friday afternoon. Mokwa, nearly 380 kilometers (236 miles) west of Abuja, is a major meeting point where traders from the south buy beans, onions and other food from farmers in the north. Mokwa community leader Aliki Musa told the AP the villagers are not used to such flooding. \"The water is like spiritual water which used to come but it’s seasonal,\" said Musa. \"It can come now (and) it will reach another twenty years before coming again.\" The chairman of the Mokwa local government area, Jibril Muregi, told local news website Premium Times that construction of flood-control works was long overdue.

In September, torrential rains and a dam collapse in the northeastern city of Maiduguri caused severe flooding that left at least 30 people dead and displaced millions, worsening the humanitarian crisis caused by the Boko Haram insurgency.",

WhileNew York Cityis a Democratic stronghold, young conservative movers and shakers are meeting other singles at a new series of events in the Big Apple. Political polarization, particularly thatbetween young men and women,has become an internationally recognized phenomenon in recent years. One example from pop culture erupted earlier this spring when \"Love is Blind\" stars Sara Carton and Ben Mezzenga did not get married during the season finale because Carton had reservations about Mezzenga's religious and political viewpoints, including on the Black Lives Matter movement. As this polarization continues, some young conservatives, particularly those in left-leaning cities, are relying on events geared towards their political persuasion to find love.

    "title": "Iran condemns Austria over report on advanced nuclear weapons program",
    "article_text": "Hudson Institute senior fellow Michael Doran analyzes U.S. foreign relations under the Trump administration on 'Life, Liberty and Levin.' Jerusalem –Iran angrily lashed out at Austria’s government Friday afterFox News Digital reportedon a document asserting that Tehran has developed an advanced nuclear weapons program that can launch long-range missiles. The explosive report from Austria’s version of the FBI—the Directorate State Protection and Intelligence Service—provides a specialized window into the Iranian regime’sillicit atomic weapons programand its espionage activities in the central European country. DELEGATES FROM IRAN, US HOLDING TALKS IN OMAN AMID ONGOING TENSIONS: WHAT TO KNOW Fox News Digital was thefirst news organization to reporton the Iran sections of the report on Wednesday, sparking a major diplomatic row between the Islamic Republic and Austria. \"The Iranian nuclear weapons development program is well advanced, and Iran possesses a growing arsenal of ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear warheads over long distances,\" the Austrian domestic intelligence agency report stated. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei waves to the crowd during a meeting with officials, Islamic countries' ambassador to Iran and a group of people in Tehran, Iran, on Monday, March 31, 2025.(Office of the Iranian Supreme Leader via AP) Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Esmail Baqaei, denounced the Austrian intelligence agency \"for spreading lies,\" and called on the Austrian government to \"provide an official explanation regarding the irresponsible, provocative, and destructive act by one of its official institutions,\" accordingto the Ministry’s website. IRAN FOREIGN MINISTER VOWS NUCLEAR ENRICHMENT WILL CONTINUE 'WITH OR WITHOUT A DEAL' Tehran-based Austrian diplomat Michaela Pacher was summoned to the Iranian foreign ministry, according to the Austrian Federal Ministry for European and International Affairs. \"[Pacher] took this opportunity to reiterate Austria's and the EU's position on the Iranian nuclear program,\" Austrian officials said in a statement. \"This position was most recently expressed to the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency.\" Austria expressed support for an EU statement along with other countries in March. \"Iran already accumulated more than six significant quantities of 60% enriched material [which the Agency defines as the approximate amount of nuclear material for which the possibility of manufacturing a nuclear explosive device cannot be excluded] and is currently producing one significant quantity of highly enriched uranium every month,\"noted the EU statement. The EU statement added that \"All these actions carry very significant proliferation-related risks and raise grave concerns about Iran’s intentions, since they have no credible civilian justification. In this context, the EU remains concerned by statements made by Iranian officials about Iran’s capacity to assemble a nuclear weapon.\" The shocking Austrian intelligence findings contradict the assessment of U.S. intelligence agencies that Iran has yet to begin a weapons program, but has \"undertaken activities that better position it to produce a nuclear device, if it chooses to do so.\" There havelong been conflicting views(between U.S. intelligence agencies and European intelligence services) over Iran’s illegal nuclear weapons program. The U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment on the Austrian report. \"President Trump is committed to Iran never obtaining a nuclear weapon or the capacity to build one,\" a White House official said. The Austrian report coincides with a new International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) report. TheAP reported on Saturdaythat Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, a confidential report by the UN nuclear watchdog said Saturday and called on Tehran to urgently change course and comply with the agency’s probe. The report comes at a sensitive time as Tehran and Washington have been holding several rounds of talks in the past weeks over a possible nuclear deal that U.S. President Donald Trump is trying to reach. IRAN'S KHAMENEI SAYS AMERICANS SHOULD AVOID TALKING 'NONSENSE' IN NUKE TALKS The report by the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency says that as of May 17, Iran has amassed 408.6 kilograms (900.8 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60%. That material is a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. A report in February put the stockpile at 274.8 kilograms (605.8 pounds). The IAEA report raised a stern warning, saying that Iran is now \"the only non-nuclear-weapon state to produce such material\" — something the agency said was of \"serious concern.\" In February, Fox News Digital reported that the IAEA said Iran has sufficient enriched uraniumto manufacture six nuclear weapons. US AND IRAN CLASH OVER URANIUM ENRICHMENT AS NUCLEAR TALKS RESUME IN ROME \"The Islamic Republic is the standard-bearer of deception and stonewalling. Today’s damning IAEA reports confirm how Iran has been in violation of the NPT [Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty] for years, even when the JCPOA [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action] was in effect. It shows the regime cannot be trusted with any diplomatic agreement,\" said Jason Brodsky, the policy director of United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI). The JCPOA is the formal name for the Iran nuclear deal that was concluded between the Obama administration and Iran. PresidentTrump withdrew from the JCPOAin 2018 because, his administration said at the time, the deal did not prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons. \"I think Iran’s regime’s response to Austria’s findings shows its sensitivity over these matters,\" Brodsky said. \"It also wants to bully Austria. Austria should force the Iranian regime to decrease the size of its embassy in Vienna which it has long used as a hub for malign intelligence collection and operations throughout Europe.\" The clerical regime’s foreign minister, Seyed Abbas Araghchi,posted on his X accounta statement in response to the Fox News Digital report. \"Media is speculating about an imminent Iran-U.S. deal. Not sure if we are there yet,\" he wrote. \"Iran is sincere about a diplomatic solution that will serve the interests of all sides. \"But getting there requires an agreement that will fully terminate all sanctions and uphold Iran's nuclear rights—including enrichment. Path to a deal goes through the negotiating table and not the media.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The U.S. talks to dismantle Iran’s illicit atomic weapons program coincides with anationwide truckers’ strike in Iran.

    "title": "Trump-backed candidate seeks to win Polish presidency in vital European election",
    "article_text": "President of Poland Andrzej Duda discusses the impact of illegal immigration in Europe, the relationship between the U.S. and Poland, and his relationship with the former president. President Trump's shadow is cast over this Sunday's presidential election runoff election, with polls showing a tight race between Warsaw’s mayor, Rafał Trzaskowski, and his conservative challenger, Karol Nawrocki. The Associated Press reported that Donald Trump met with Nawrocki at the White House earlier this month and sent DHS Secretary Kristi Noem to a meeting of CPAC in Poland, where she offered an endorsement. Speaking in support of Nawrocki, Noem said he would rule in the style of President Trump. \"I just had the opportunity to meet with Karol and listen. He needs to be the next president of Poland. Do you understand me?\" she said. \"This is arguably the most important Polish presidential election since the end of communism, not only because the contest is so close, but because there is a palpable sense in Warsaw of how dangerous the country’s security situation has become, with the ongoing war in Ukraine and Russian revisionism in full view,\" Andrew Michta, Senior Fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Scowcroft Center, told Fox News Digital. POLISH PARTY LEADERS MAKE FINAL APPEALS TO VOTERS AS CLOSE ELECTION NEARS Trzaskowski, backed by the current prime minister,Donald Tusk, received 31.4% of the vote in the first round. Nawrocki, a historian supported by the right-wing populist Law and Justice party (PiS), performed better than expected and was close behind with 29.5% of the vote. Most experts and observers in the region view the race as a toss-up. Karol Nawrocki, presidential candidate supported by the Law and Justice party, attends a campaign rally on May 29, 2025, in Katowice, Poland. The second round of presidential elections in Poland will take place on June 1st. Nawrocki will compete with Rafal Trzaskowski, the pro-European ruling party's candidate.(Photo by Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via AP) \"Nawrocki has a good chance of winning the election. This would clearly demonstrate the Polish people's desire to counter the current government's liberal politics,\" Stanisław Żaryn, Advisor to Poland's current President Andrzej Duda, told Fox News Digital. The conservativeLaw and Justice partyrecruited Nawrocki, an outsider with no prior political experience, to be its candidate for president to replace outgoing President Duda, a close ally of President Trump. The Law and Justice Party governed Poland from 2015 to 2023, until it lost parliamentary elections led by Donald Tusk’s center-left Civic Platform coalition. Although the Polish president is nominally symbolic, the president does wield the power to veto legislation passed by parliament, which could derail the incumbent government's domestic agenda if the president is of a different party from the prime minister. Matthew Tyrmand, a U.S.-based Polish dual citizen who advises conservative sovereignty-defending political figures and parties across Europe, told Fox News Digital from Europe, \"We in Poland, who saw the previous unchecked PO (Tusk’s party) government from 2010-15, know how this ends if Tusk’s puppet candidate Trzaskowski ends up securing the presidency in the runoff. Poland’s tightened alignment with the EU will come at the expense of previously strong ties with the USA and the previous and now returned Trump administration. This will weaken Poland militarily and economically. Warsaw's Mayor and presidential candidate Rafal Trzaskowski (left) and historian Karol Nawrocki appear on a screen during a presidential debate in Warsaw, Poland, on May 23, 2025.(Photo by Aleksander Kalka/NurPhoto via AP.) \"This runoff is existential for Poland maintaining its multi-party democracy with the existent check and balance of the last 15 years of having, in essence, a two-party duopoly. The right-wing president, Andrzej Duda, has been the one check given his veto power to reject the Tusk government’s agenda since the country’s government turned over in late 2023 toward left-leaning (self-described and so-called by the compromised leftist media as centrist but in reality very left) Eurocentrists. If that veto is lost, Polish sovereignty will be a distant memory as Tusk devolves national competences toward Berlin and Brussels who have been his paymasters for nearly two decades, and he has been their ready, willing and able pliant stooge.\" Duda utilized the veto power against Tusk while in office to strike down bills to restore independence to the judiciary, an issue that put Poland at odds with the European Union under the previous PiS government. Nawrocki as president would likely continue thepolicies of Duda, further sinking Tusk's popularity as many in Poland feel that Tusk has not lived up to his campaign promises. In Warsaw, Poland, on May 25, 2025, Donald Tusk, Prime Minister of Poland, participates in the ''Great Patriotic March'' organized in support of Rafal Trzaskowski, Civic Platform candidate for President of Poland. The march takes place through the streets of the capital.

A victory for Trzaskowski will also be received positively in Brussels as he is seen as pro-European and in line with the EU’s priorities of democratic governance and judicial independence. \"If Nawrocki wins, expect a tough fight between the Tusk government and the President, as they are polar opposites on a number of issues, especially foreign policy,\" Michta of the Atlantic Council said.

Santiago/Getty Images)) ICONIC FORMER POLISH PRESIDENT MESSAGE TO LAWMAKERS ON UKRAINE: 'IF WE DON'T ACT NOW, WE WILL LOSE' The Warsaw mayor favors closer ties with Brussels, Berlin and Paris but will also look to maintain stable relations with the U.S. Nawrocki, who met with President Trump and Republican leaders in Congress, would likely push for even closer relations with the U.S. While there is a rising number of voices that are critical of continuingsupport for Ukraineas the war drags on, no matter who wins, Poland’s foreign and defense policy and its support for Ukraine in its war against Russia is unlikely to change. Poland has been one of Ukraine’s toughest backers in Europe, providing 5 billion euros worth of overall aid, including nearly 4 billion euros in military aid, since the war began.

Poland has been much more welcoming to Ukrainian's fleeing Russian aggression. Poland has taken in more than 1.5 million Ukrainian refugees since Russian launched its invasion in February 2022. Matt Qvortrup, Senior Research Fellow at the Centre for European Studies at the Australian National University, said a Nawrocki win would be a roadblock to further European integration with another leader critical of Europe taking power.

    "title": "Who is Julius Malema, the South African politician behind 'kill the farmer' chant?",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa hold a meeting at the White House. JOHANNESBURG - Julius Malema, the South African politician who PresidentDonald Trumpwants arrested for repeatedly chanting \"kill the farmer,\" is reportedly a Rolex watch-wearing Gucci revolutionary, often seen in snazzy, expensive clothes, who champions the poor from a luxury mansion in what is said to be South Africa’s richest street. He has also called for the further arming of the terror group Hamas and has been accused of stealing millions of dollars from the very pensioners he is trying to get to vote for him. Trump confronted South African President Cyril Ramaphosa with a video of Malema shouting \"Shoot to kill, Kill the Boer (the Afrikaner), kill the farmer,\" when the South African president, a neighbor of Malema’s in Johannesburg, visited the Oval Office earlier this month. SOUTH AFRICA'S PRESIDENT PUSHES BACK ON TRUMP'S DEMAND TO ARREST POLITICIAN WHO CHANTED 'KILL THE FARMER' File: Julius Malema, leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF).(Waldo Swiegers/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Trump has offered Afrikaner farmers, descendants of mostly Dutch settlers, refuge in the U.S., citing controversial and disputed claims that they are facing White genocide and forced land seizures. The self-styled commander in chief of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Party, Malema, a Marxist-Leninist, was the head of the Youth League of South Africa’s biggest party, the African National Congress (ANC), but he was kicked out for bad-mouthing its leadership. Inlast year’s election, votes for the EFF slumped to under 10%, and both of Malema’s sidekicks, party co-founders and men he described as \"brothers,\" left him and joined a competing party. So it did not come as a surprise to many that, allegedly to spite President Trump, Malema just days later jumped up, literally, onto the stage at the very next rally he was due to appear at to yell \"Kill the farmer, I repeat kill the farmer.\" In 2022, South Africa’s Constitutional Court, the equivalent of the U.S. Supreme Court, ruled the chant is not hate speech, declaring it is only the words of a song. Malema sits on the Judicial Services Commission, a body which appoints the Court’s judges. To Malema, critics say, the chant may be more than just song lyrics. At least twice he told reporters here, \"We have not called for the killing of White people – at least for now.\" On another occasion, he demanded, \"We will cut the throat of Whiteness.\" TRUMP, SOUTH AFRICA IN GROWING ROW OVER HOTLY CONTESTED LAND LAW, COUNTRY'S DEALS WITH US FOES South Africans protest in favor of President Donald Trump and against their government.(Getty Images) Some say Malema is running two strategies - one which follows the mantra \"There’s no such thing as bad publicity,\" and the other to act like a small child that makes a lot of noise, hoping to be noticed, but with little real effect. Analyst J. Brooks Spector told Fox News Digital that Malema \"has crafted a political reputation as the ‘bad boy’ of South African politics.\" Spector, a former U.S. diplomat who lives in Johannesburg and is associate editor of the Daily Maverick, continued. \"In a country with a third of its workforce unemployed, and higher among young people, and poverty still a fact of life for many more, his (Malema’s) populism initially drew significant support and enthusiasm among voters. However, his popularity as a political leader has faded somewhat.\" Malema openly supports theterror group Hamas, telling a rally in 2023, shortly after the October 7 attack on Israel, \"when you are oppressed, you only have one option, shoot to kill. There is nothing wrong with what Hamas is doing. The EFF is going to arm Hamas.\" He also shouted he intended to shut down the Israeli Embassy in South Africa. \"We are going to remove this embassy,\" he yelled to loud cheers. A man brandishes a replica toy gun during a pro Palestinian demonstration organised by the South African opposition party Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in front of the Israeli Embassy in Pretoria, on October 23, 2023.(Marco Longari/AFP via Getty Images) Allegations also suggest that Malema and his then right-hand man, Floyd Shivambu, benefitted from \"dodgy\" deals with the South African VBS bank, which subsequently collapsed, leading to people losing their pension savings. \"In 2018, the VBS scandal exposed widespread looting by bank officials and politicians, including senior leaders of the EFF, Floyd Shivambu and Julius Malema,\" the Opposition Democratic Alliance’s (DA) Baxolile Nodadastated last August. On Friday, the DA’s federal executive member and national spokesperson, Willie Aucamp, told Fox News Digital the DA \"isn’t letting the VBS scandal fade into the background. Not when over R2 billion ($111 million) was looted from pensioners, struggling municipalities, and poor communities. The DA has been leading the charge to expose those behind this daylight robbery, including Julius Malema, leader of the EFF.\"He continued, \"The DA laid criminal charges back in 2018, but six years later, not a single charge has been prosecuted by the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA). Justice for the victims of VBS is long overdue. The DA will continue pushing for the arrest and prosecution of every single person involved - Malema included.\" Speaking in Cape Town in July last year, Malema said \"I will never be intimidated by VBS. No leader of the EFF received VBS money.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But now that Malema is on Donald Trump’s radar, the president might push back powerfully on Malema’s links to Hamas and the VBS saga, Max Meizlish, senior research analyst at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Fox News Digital. \"Like the ANC that courts Iran and supports Hamas, Julius Malema would be wise to not provoke Donald Trump. After all, Malema was clearly implicated in the VBS scandal and has openly called to \"arm Hamas.\" Malema could very well find himself the target of Global Magnitsky Act sanctions — a tool which President Trump can wield unilaterally and at a moment’s notice,\" Meizlish said.

    "article_text": "Ret. Maj. Gen. Dana Pittard reacts to Hamas’ response to the U.S.-backed ceasefire proposal on ‘Fox News Live.’ Hamas has agreed to release 10 living hostages and return the bodies of 18 more, but the terms of the proposed deal have been deemed unacceptable by the U.S. and Israel. The group, which has been on the State Department's list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations since 1997, made the announcement in a statement Saturday and said it was being done on the condition that a number of Palestinian prisoners be returned in exchange as part of a means to achieve a permanent ceasefire. Israeli media reported that Hamas added new demands to the proposal from U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, including a permanent ceasefire, complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and unrestricted humanitarian aid flow into the strip. Witkoff's proposal did not include a full withdrawal or a ceasefire, theJerusalem Post reported, and that Hamas added terms of its own. In a statement posted to X on Saturday, Witkoff called Hamas' response to the American proposal \"totally unacceptable\" and warned it \"only takes us backward.\" He urged the group to accept the original framework in order to begin proximity talks as early as next week, which could pave the way for a 60-day ceasefire and the return of both living and deceased hostages.

Of these,Israeli intelligenceassesses that at least 34 are deceased, leaving approximately 24 believed to be alive. More than 250 people were captured during the Hamas terror attacks on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.

U.S. negotiators had not publicized the terms of the proposal. Witkoff’s office reiterated on social media that the proposed deal could allow \"half of the living hostages and half of those who are deceased\" to return to their families if Hamas agrees to enter talks under the current terms. The statement stressed that the window to finalize the deal is narrowing, and that major negotiations could begin \"in good faith\" within days if Hamas accepts. \"As stated by the U.S. President’s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff: Hamas’ response is unacceptable and sets the situation back,\" the Prime Minister’s Office said.

I think they want to get out of it.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Deep differences between Hamas and Israel have stymied previous attempts to restore a ceasefire that broke down in March. Israel has insisted that Hamas disarm completely, be dismantled as a military and governing force and return all hostages still held in Gaza before it agrees to end the war. Hamas has rejected the demand to give up its weapons and says Israel must pull its troops out of Gaza and commit to ending the war. The Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report.

    "article_text": "US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee spoke exclusively to Fox News Digital on the US-Israel relationship, Iran, prospects for a hostage deal, and enlarging the Abraham Accords. (Video: Yoav Dudkevitch/TPS-IL for Fox News Digital.) EXCLUSIVE - The United States will not participate in a conference next month in New York City hosted by France and Saudi Arabia aimed at promoting the recognition of a Palestinian state,U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabeetold Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview in Jerusalem earlier this week. \"It’s incredibly inappropriate in the midst of a war that Israel is dealing with to go out and present something that I think increasingly Israelis are steadfast against. \"Oct. 7 changed a lot of things. If France is really so determined to see a Palestinian state, I have a suggestion for them–carve out a piece of the French Riviera and create a Palestinian state. They are welcome to do that, but they are not welcome to impose that kind of pressure on a sovereign nation. And I find it revolting that they think they have the right to do such a thing. TRUMP’S MIDDLE EAST TRIP HANDED ISRAEL A HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY — IF IT CHOOSES TO ACT, EXPERTS SAY The U.S. ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, holds a note given to him from President Donald Trump to be placed in the cracks of the Western Wall, the holiest site where Jews can pray, in the Old City of Jerusalem, Friday, April 18, 2025.(AP Photo/Leo Correa) \"I hope they will reconsider but the U.S. will not participate. It simply will not be a part of such a ruse,\" he added. Huckabee, commenting on recently reported tensions between the two close allies, notedthere may be disagreementsbetween the Trump administration and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government, but there should be no fear of a rupture in bilateral ties. \"I don’t think pro-Israel Americans need to be concerned that there’s some rift between the United States and Israel. Are there sometimes differences of opinion on the next steps in the war in Gaza, getting the hostages home, or maybe to avoid an all-out war with Iran? Of course, that’s natural,\" he said. \"But as far as the relationship between Israel and the U.S., that is not in any way at risk, nor is it in any way splintered or fractured. It’s solid, it has to be. We don’t have a choice. It’s critically important that the United States maintains its partnership—and I use that word very deliberately—it’s not a friendship, it’s not an alliance, it’s a partnership, which means we are yoked together in our intelligence sharing, military — so many ways in which our nations are linked inseparably.\" President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meet at the White House in Washington, D.C., Feb. 4, 2025.(Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) On talks between Washington and Tehran, the ambassador described the Islamic Republic as \"one of the if not the greatest, threats to world peace,\" warning that it poses a serious andimmediate existential threatnot only to Israel, but also to several Gulf nations and ultimately to the United States. \"The Iranians have said Israel is the ‘Little Satan,’ but America is the ‘Great Satan.’ They’ve always treated Israel as the appetizer and the United States as the entrée,\" he said. \"It’s just important when people tell you over and over for 46 years they plan to kill you, you might want to start taking them seriously.\" Nevertheless, Huckabee expressed hope that ongoing nuclear negotiations between the two nations would be successful and avoid any kind of military conflict.

We don't want that anymore, but let’s hope they do. But if they don’t, the president has been incredibly clear that Iran is not going to have a nuclear weapon.\" On Israel’s ongoing war against Hamas terrorists in the Gaza Strip, he emphasized that the suffering could end immediately—if Hamas chooses to act. \"All of us are hoping and praying that Hamas will finally give up all the hostages and release them, and then they will depart Gaza for good. If they do these two things, this is over,\" he said. \"It could have been over on Oct. 8, 2023; it should have been. What they did was unthinkable, horrific, heinous, uncivilized, savage behavior.\" French President Emmanuel Macron speaks to the media at the end of an EU Summit in the Justus Lipsius building, the EU Council headquarters, on March 22, 2024, in Brussels, Belgium.(Thierry Monasse/Getty Images) He noted that President Donald Trump has repeatedly insisted thatHamas has no futurein Gaza. \"They can’t rule it, they can’t stay,\" said Huckabee. \"Israel has been clear that they are willing to put them on airplanes and fly them out in exile, they have a way out, but they don’t have a way in. They have to go, and all hostages living and dead have to be returned,\" he added. Huckabee expressed hope that this would happen immediately. Speaking to Fox News Digital on Thursday, he said of the hostages, \"This pin that I wear on my lapel—one of the happiest days of my life will be when I can take this pin off and permanently put it away, never to wear it again, because that means all of the hostages have come home,\" he said.

Meanwhile, Trump said on Wednesday that time is limited for Putin to get serious about coming to the negotiating table and engage in peace talks. Otherwise, the U.S. might adopt a different approach, he said. \"We’re going to find out whether or not he’s tapping us along or not, and if he is, we’ll respond a little bit differently, but it will take about a week and a half to two weeks,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Wednesday. Here’s what also happened this week: Trump accused China of violating an initial trade agreement that Washington and Beijing were hashing out in May. Following those negotiations, both countries agreed that the U.S. would cut down its tariffs against Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, and China would reduce its tariffs against U.S. imports from 125% to 10%.

Meanwhile, China pressed the U.S. to reverse course and urged the U.S. to address its own mistakes. \"China once again urges the US to immediately correct its erroneous actions, cease discriminatory restrictions against China and jointly uphold the consensus reached at the high-level talks in Geneva,\" Chinese embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said in a Friday statement.

    "article_text": "FBI Deputy Dir. Dan Bongino joins 'Fox & Friends' to share takeaways from his role, details on the decision to reexamine Biden-era investigations of 'significant public interest,' and the response to James Comey's '8647' post. FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino made headlines this week when he revealed the bureau was \"closing in\" on suspects involved in planting two pipe bombs near the U.S. Capitol onJan. 6, 2021,a sign that the bureau may soon solve the nagging, four-year mystery. \"The second we got in, I put a team on it and I said, ‘I want answers on this,’\"Bongino told \"Fox & Friends.\"\"And I'm pretty confident that we're closing in on some suspects.\" Law enforcement discovered the two pipe bombs near the Republican and Democratic National Committees' headquarters around the same time that thousands of rioters a few blocks away began to descend on the Capitol in protest of the 2020 election results. A faction of PresidentDonald Trump'sbase has since raised questions about the timing of the pipe bomb incident and security failures surrounding it and speculated that the Biden administration was not forthright to the public about the facts of the case. Prior to being sworn in, Bongino was a leading voice perpetuating that notion. FBI 'CLOSING IN' ON SUSPECTS IN CASE OF DC PIPE BOMBS PLACED ON EVE OF JAN 6 Dan Bongino(Reuters) A former Secret Service agent and podcast host, Bongino told listeners of his popular right-wing show that the FBI lied about the pipe bomb incident because the bureau did not want people to know it was an \"inside job.\" Now as deputy director, Bongino is facing pressure from supporters and critics alike to release new details about the case. Video footage released by the FBI shows an unidentified person placing the pipe bombs near the two headquarters more than 16 hours before law enforcement found them. The suspect is seen wearing a gray hoodie, Nike Air Max Speed Turf sneakers, a face mask, glasses, and gloves. FBI REOPENING INVESTIGATION INTO COCAINE FOUND AT BIDEN WHITE HOUSE Prior to the administration change in January, the FBI also unveiled a minor last-minute detail that the suspect's height was about 5-foot-7. A woman who is a Capitol Hill resident alerted a security guard that she spotted the first pipe bomb in an alley behind the RNC headquarters while she was out retrieving her laundry around 1 p.m. Security footage showed her running from the area of the washer and dryer and notifying the guard. That set off a furious search that led officers at the DNC headquarters to discover a second pipe bomb there. ADepartment of Homeland Security (DHS)inspector general report published last year revealed the two explosive devices were \"viable\" and \"could have detonated, causing innocent bystanders to be seriously injured or killed.\" FBI RELEASES VIDEO SHOWING JANUARY 2021 PIPE BOMB SUSPECT PLANTING DEVICE OUTSIDE DNC, RNC OFFICES IN DC Surveillance photos of the pipe bomb suspect in Washington, D.C., in January 2021.(FBI) The bombs included one-hour timers. An FBI official said they did not believe the timers could have detonated the bombs since the time had already elapsed when the bombs were found, according to the DHS report. That report and an investigative report released by House Republicans revealed that then-Vice President-electKamala Harrisand former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi at one point came within feet of the pipe bomb by the DNC. The FBI has said it has received more than 600 tips, and it continues to offer a $500,000 reward for any successful leads. The House Republicans' report noted the FBI initially investigated a person who searched on the internet for \"pipe bomb DC\" and a person who had recently purchased the Nike shoes seen in the surveillance footage. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The report noted, however, that the pace of the FBI's inquiry dropped off after about a month as a result of leads drying up.

    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Three women and two physicians are suing to block aKansas lawthat invalidates a pregnant woman's advance medical directive about end-of-life treatment. The plaintiffs — one of whom is currently pregnant — are challenging the constitutionality of a clause in the state’s Natural Death Act that denies pregnant women the option to make advance directives to accept or refuse healthcare if they become incapacitated or terminally ill. Patient plaintiffs Emma Vernon, Abigail Ottaway and Laura Stratton and physician plaintiffs Michele Bennett and Lynley Holmanfiled the lawsuiton Thursday. It argues that the clause violates the right to personal autonomy, privacy, equal treatment and freedom of speech by ignoring the end-of-life decisions of pregnant women. CDC REMOVES COVID VACCINE RECOMMENDATION FOR HEALTHY CHILDREN, PREGNANT MOTHERS Two physicians and three women are suing to block a Kansas law that invalidates medical decisions pregnant women can make about end-of-life treatment.(iStock) Vernon, the pregnant plaintiff, wrote an advance healthcare directive stating that, if pregnant and diagnosed with a terminal condition, she would only like to receive life-sustaining treatment if \"there is a reasonable medical certainty\" that her child would reach full term and be born \"with a meaningful prospect of sustained life and without significant conditions that would substantially impair its quality of life.\" The lawsuit says her directive has not been \"given the same deference the law affords to others who complete directives because of the Pregnancy Exclusion, and therefore she does not benefit from the same level of certainty that the directive otherwise provides.\" All states have laws allowing people to write advance directives on the medical care they would like to receive if they become unable to make their own health decisions. Nine states, including Kansas, have clauses to invalidate apregnant woman'sadvance directive. The plaintiffs argue that the law violates the right to personal autonomy, privacy, equal treatment and freedom of speech.(iStock) The physicians who joined the lawsuit said the law requires them to provide pregnant patients with alower standard of carethan other patients and opens them up to civil and criminal lawsuits as well as professional penalties. The lawsuit says the doctors \"are deeply committed to the foundational medical principle that patients have a fundamental right to determine what treatment they receive, and that providing treatment without a patient’s informed consent violates both medical ethics and the law.\" NEW MOM FURIOUS AT HUSBAND FOR CHOOSING FRIENDS AND BARBECUE OVER HER AND THEIR NEWBORN The defendants in the lawsuit are Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach (pictured), Kansas State Board of Healing Arts President Richard Bradbury and Douglas County District Attorney Dakota Loomis.(AP Photo/John Hanna) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Yet Kansas law compels them to disregard their patients’ clearly expressed end-of-life decisions, forcing them to provide their pregnant patients with a lower standard of care than any of their other patients receive,\" it continues. \"It demands this diminished care without offering any clarity on what end-of-life treatment they are required to provide—leaving them to guess at what the law expects while exposing them to civil, criminal, and professional consequences for getting it wrong.\" The defendants in the lawsuit are Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach, Kansas State Board of Healing Arts President Richard Bradbury and Douglas County District Attorney Dakota Loomis.",

    "title": "Potential discovery of new dwarf planet adds wrinkle to Planet Nine theory",
    "article_text": "SpaceX launched its Starship for the ninth time Tuesday. (Reuters/SpaceX) A team of scientists at the Institute for Advanced Study School of Natural Sciencesin Princeton, New Jersey,might have found a newdwarf planet, potentially leading to more evidence of a theoretical super-planet. The scientists announced in a news release that they have found a trans-Neptune Object(TNO), code-named 2017OF201, located past the icy and desolate region of the Kuplier Belt. The TNO, which are described as minor planets that orbit the sun at a greater distance than Neptune, were found on the edge of our solar system. While there are plenty of other TNOs in the solar system, what makes 2017OF201 special is its large size and extreme orbit. NASA LOOKING FOR WAYS TO DESTROY ASTEROID THAT COULD STRIKE EARTH, KILL CITY A team of scientists at the Institute for Advanced Study’s School of Natural Sciences in Princeton might have found a new dwarf planet, potentially leading to more evidence of a theoretical super-planet.(NASA/JPL-Caltech; image of 2017 OF201: Sihao Cheng et al.) One of the team leads, Sihao Cheng, along with Jiaxuan Li and Eritas Yang from Princeton University, made the discovery. The team used advanced computational methods to identify the object’s distinctive trajectory pattern in the sky. \"The object’s aphelion — the farthest point on the orbit from the Sun — is more than 1600 times that of the Earth’s orbit,\" Cheng said in the release. \"Meanwhile, its perihelion — the closest point on its orbit to the Sun — is 44.5 times that of the Earth’s orbit, similar to Pluto's orbit.\" 2017OF201 takes about 25,000 years to orbit the sun, making Yang suggest that \"It must have experienced close encounters with a giant planet, causing it to be ejected to a wide orbit.\" NEWLY DISCOVERED ASTEROID TURNS OUT TO BE TESLA ROADSTER LAUNCHED INTO SPACE The solar system is made up of the sun, eight planets, 138 moons and many comets, asteroids and other space rocks.(NASA) Cheng also added that there may have been more than one step in its migration. \"It’s possible that this object was first ejected to the Oort cloud, the most distant region in our solar system, which is home to many comets, and then sent back,\" Cheng said. This discovery has significant implications for the current understanding of the layout of ourouter solar system. According to NASA, California Institute of Technology (Caltech) astronomers Konstantin Batygin and Mike Brown in January 2016 announced research that provided evidence for a planet about 1.5 times the size of Earth in the outer solar system. However, the existence of Planet X or Planet Nine is strictly theoretical as neither astronomer has actually observed such a planet. \"Even though advances in telescopes have enabled us to explore distant parts of the universe, there is still a great deal to discover about our own solar system,\" Cheng said.(Reuters/ESA/Hubble & NASA/Handout via Reuters) The theory puts the planet at around the same sizeas Neptune, far past Pluto somewhere near the Kuiper Belt, where 2017OF201 was located. If it exists, it is theorized to have a mass of up to 10 times as much as Earth’s with a distance of up to 30 times further than Neptune to the Sun. It would take between10,000 and 20,000 Earth yearsto make one full orbit around the Sun. However, the area beyond the Kuiper Belt, where the object is located, had previously been thought to be essentially empty, but the team’s discovery suggests that this is not so. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Cheng said in the release that 2017OF201 only has about 1% of its orbit visible to us. \"Even thoughadvances in telescopeshave enabled us to explore distant parts of the universe, there is still a great deal to discover about our own solar system,\" Cheng said. NASA mentioned that if Planet Nine exists, it could help explain the unique orbits of some smaller objects in the distant Kuiper Belt. As of now, Planet Nine remains all but a theory, but the existence of this far-off world rests on gravitational patterns in the outer solar system. Nick Butler is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

    "title": "Most common causes of cavities in the teeth — and how to prevent them",
    "article_text": "Dr. Ellie Phillips, DDS, of Texas, recommends specific steps for proper oral care Cavities are incredibly common, affecting 90% of adults between the ages of 19 and 64 — but they are often preventable. Also known as \"dental caries,\" cavities are damaged areas in the hard parts of the teeth caused bytooth decay, according to Mayo Clinic. These areas become tiny openings or holes that can lead to toothaches, infections and even tooth loss. When a cavity is just starting, you may not have any symptoms at all. That’s why it’s important to be checked regularly ata dentist, says the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Even if your mouth feels fine, a professional may be able to pick up on smaller signals before the decay grows. IS OZEMPIC RUINING YOUR TEETH? WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT IMPACT ON DENTAL HEALTH Once the decay gets larger, there may be symptoms like toothaches, sharp pains when eating, visible holes in the teeth, staining on the surface of a tooth or pain when biting. Cavities are holes in the teeth through which bacteria can enter.(iStock) Dental plaque forming in the mouth is what leads to tooth decay, the process that creates cavities. Plaque forms whenbacteria in the mouthmixes with \"sugary or starchy food\" like milk, juice, bread and pasta, according to Cleveland Clinic. FLUORIDE EXPOSURE LINKED TO ‘DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS’ ON HEALTH OF PREGNANT WOMEN, INFANTS If those sugars and starches are not removed from the teeth throughhealthy habits, like regular flossing and brushing after meals, bacteria begin feeding on them, the above source states. The acids from bacteria strip away tooth enamel, leaving tiny openings that mark the beginning stages of a cavity. Bacteria and acid can enter through these holes and reach the vulnerable inner parts of the teeth, causing pain and more severe problems. If you don’t clean sugars and starches off your teeth properly, bacteria begin feeding on them and wearing down the hard outer shell of the tooth.(iStock) Fox News Digital previously spoke to Dr. Ricky Marshall about the impact of stomach acid and saliva production on dental health. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"The amount of acid coming up and contacting the teeth will absolutely contribute to increased tooth decay,\" said Marshall, who is the owner of Stratland Dental in Glendale, Arizona, and a dentist at Wolff Family Dentistry & Orthodontics in Queen Creek, Arizona. \"A combination of dry mouth and increasedstomach acidcan be detrimental to teeth,\" he said. BRUSH, FLOSS, MOUTHWASH: DENTISTS REVEAL WHAT THEY BELIEVE IS THE CORRECT ORDER Dry mouth, linked to causes like snoring and potentially certain medications, can increase the risk of tooth decay due to reduced saliva production. \"Your saliva clears away the acid and helps to repair the enamel,\" the CDC states on its website. \"If the repair isn't fast enough, bacteria get inside your tooth andmake cavities.\" Saliva helps clear away bacteria to keep plaque from forming, so it's important to treat dry mouth symptoms when they appear, experts say.(iStock) Cleveland Clinic recommends brushing your teeth with a soft-bristled brush twice a day, and ideally after every meal. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER Experts also recommend cutting back on sugary, starchyfoods and drinks. As mentioned above, these can mix with bacteria and promote the buildup of dental plaque.

For small cavities, your dentist may recommend using fluoride or other products. Large cavities may require fillings or even root canals.

    "article_text": "'Genius Foods' author Max Lugavere discusses Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., taking on big food on 'The Will Cain Show.' Blood and urine tests have been found to detect the amount ofultraprocessed foods(UPFs) a person eats, according to new research. Using machine learning, scientists at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) identified hundreds of metabolites (molecules produced during metabolism) that correlated with processed food intake. The team developed a \"biomarker score\" that predicts ultraprocessed food intake based on metabolite measurements in blood and urine, according to Erikka Loftfield, Ph.D., M.P.H., of the National Cancer Institute in Maryland. PREMATURE DEATH LINKED TO CERTAIN TYPE OF FOOD, STUDY REVEALS The researchers drew baseline data from 718 older adults who provided urine and blood samples and reported their dietary habits over a 12-month period, as detailed in an NIH press release. Next, they conducted a small clinical trial of 20 adults. For two weeks, the group ate a diet high in ultraprocessed foods, and for another two weeks they ate a diet with no UPFs. Scientists at the National Institutes of Health have developed the first test to objectively measure ultraprocessed food intake through blood and urine.(iStock) \"In our study, we found that hundreds of serum and urine metabolites were correlated with percentage energy fromultraprocessed food intake,\" Loftfield told Fox News Digital. The findings were published in the journal PLOS Medicine. THE WORST FOODS TO BUY IN THE SUPERMARKET AND THE BETTER CHOICES INSTEAD Large-scale studies investigating the health risks of ultraprocessed foods often rely on self-reported dietary questionnaires, which can be prone to errors, per the NIH. The new blood and urine test helps to reduce human error by usingobjective biomarkers, a growing area of interest among researchers. Using machine learning, the team identified hundreds of metabolites that correlated with processed food intake.(iStock) Loftfield added, \"It was surprising to find that UPF-correlated metabolites are involved in numerous and diverse biological pathways, underscoring the complex impact of diet on the metabolome.\" Ultraprocessed foods are defined as \"ready-to-eat or ready-to-heat, industrially manufactured products, typically high in calories and low in essential nutrients,\" according to the NIH. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER Chronic diseases, obesity andvarious forms of cancerhave been linked to diets that are heavy in UPFs. Despite promising results, the researchers emphasized that the new method will requirefurther validationbefore broader use. Since the current trial focused mainly on older adults, more research is needed across various age groups and diets, the experts said. Ultraprocessed foods are defined as \"ready-to-eat or ready-to-heat, industrially manufactured products, typically high in calories and low in essential nutrients,\" according to the NIH.(iStock) \"Metabolite scores should be evaluated and improved in populations with different diets and a wide range of UPF intake,\" Loftfield acknowledged. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP This method could potentially be used in future research to link the consumption of processed foods with chronic diseases, according to the researchers. For more Health articles, visitwww.foxnews.com/health \"For individuals concerned about ultraprocessed food intake, one practical recommendation is to use ‘nutrition facts’ labels to avoid foods high in added sugars, saturated fat and sodium, as this can limit UPF intake and align with robust scientific research ondiet and health,\" Loftfield suggested.

    "article_text": "Dr. Devi Nampiaparampil joins 'Fox News Live' to discusses Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s MAHA report on childhood disease. Sperm from a single donor in Europe has reportedly been used toconceive at least 67 pregnancies, although the donor carried a rare cancer-causing mutation. The donor’s mutation has been linked to cancer diagnoses in 10 of these children, according to a report by The Guardian. The case was brought to light after two families separately contacted their fertility clinics after theirchildren's cancer diagnoseswere linked to a rare genetic variant called TP53. PROSTATE CANCER RISK INCREASES BY 45% AMONG MEN WHO SHARE ONE TROUBLING BEHAVIOR A mutation in the TP53 gene causes Li-Fraumeni syndrome, which increases the risk ofdeveloping cancer. Cleveland Clinic states that this disorder comes with a 90% chance of developing some type of cancer by age 60, and a 50% chance by the age of 40. The European Sperm Bank, the sperm supplier, confirmed that this variant was present in some of the donor’s sperm. Researcher Dr. Edwige Kasper (not pictured) advocates for a European limit on the number of births or families for a single donor.(iStock) The Guardian reported that the rare variant was \"not known to be linked to cancer at the time of donation in 2008.\" The genetic variant reportedly would not have been detectable through standard screening, and the donor is said to currently be in good health. \"The identified mutation is one that could not have been detected by the screening methods we use in accordance with regulations.\" Dr Edwige Kasper, a biologist at Rouen University Hospital in France, presented this case at the European Society of Human Genetics’ annual conference in Milan last week, commenting on the need for a European limit on thenumber of birthsor families for a single donor. \"We can’t do whole-genome sequencing for all sperm donors – I’m not arguing for that,\" she told The Guardian. \"But this is the abnormal dissemination of genetic disease. Not every man has 75 children across Europe.\" 4 TROUBLING CANCER TRENDS YOU MUST KNOW ABOUT IN 2025 Kasper analyzed the mutation in her lab, concluding that it was most likely cancer-causing and that children born from this donor should \"receive genetic counseling.\" The research-turned-investigation tracked down 67 children from 46 families in eight European countries. Thechildren were tested, with the variant detected in 23 of them. The 10 who had been diagnosed with cancer reportedly included cases of leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Sixty-seven children from 46 families were identified from the donor in eight European countries.(iStock) In a statement sent to Fox News Digital, the European Sperm Bank stated that donor-assisted reproduction \"generally remains a significantly safer alternative\" than reproduction withoutgenetic screening. The bank added that sperm donors undergo a \"comprehensive health screening,\" which includes an in-depth medical examination, a review of the donor’s family medical history and \"extensive\" testing for genetic andinfectious diseases. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"However, it’s not possible to rule out all risks — and, in this particular case, the identified mutation is one that could not have been detected by the screening methods we use in accordance with regulations and would require specialized genetic testing,\" the group noted. Julie Paulli Budtz, VP. of corporate communications at the European Sperm Bank, expressed to Fox News Digital that they are \"deeply affected by this case.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER \"The donor has been thoroughly tested even beyond the required standards, but preventative genetic screening is reaching its limits here,\" she said. \"Every human being has about 20,000 genes, and it is scientifically simply not possible to detect disease-causing mutations in a person’s gene pool if you don’t know what you are looking for.\" Eggs and sperm are stored in a liquid nitrogen tank at the Fertility Center Berlin.(Jens Kalaene/picture alliance via Getty Images) Budtz noted that the European Sperm Bank welcomes \"continued dialogue\" regarding setting an \"internationally binding family limit,\" which they have advocated for \"on several occasions, also at EU level.\" \"This is also why, in addition to complying with nationalpregnancy limits, we have proactively implemented our own international limit of 75 families per donor,\" she added. In the U.S., there is no official legal limit on how many sperm donations one man can make. However, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) recommends that donors are limited to 25 live births within each population area of 800,000 people. \"Institutions, clinics and sperm banks should maintain sufficient records to allow a limit to be set for thenumber of pregnanciesfor which a given donor is responsible,\" the ASRM states on its website. \"Limiting donor vials is an important part of the process.\" California Cryobank, which has claimed to have the largest selection of sperm and egg donations in the country, states on its website that it closely monitors donors to limit the total number of family units to 20 to 30 worldwide. \"Limiting donor vials is an important part of the process,\" the bank noted. The U.S. Federal Drug Administration requires that all sperm donors undergo a physical exam, complete a questionnaire, provide their medical history, and undergo screenings for infectious diseases at an FDA-approved lab.(iStock) The U.S. Federal Drug Administration (FDA) requires that all sperm donors undergo a physical exam, complete a questionnaire, provide their medical history, and undergo screenings for infectious diseases at an FDA-approved lab.

Nick Wright, Chris Broussard and Kevin Wildes ask whether the Knicks can still win this series. John Mellencamp and Pat McAfeeare officially at war. It all started when Mellencamp took offense to McAfee calling outcelebrity Knicks fansduring Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals between New York and the Indiana Pacers. After calling out Ben Stiller, Spike Lee, and Timothee Chalamet, which prompted boos in Indianapolis, McAfee implored fans to \"turn this s--- up\" and \"send these sons of b------ back to New York with their ears ringing.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM John Mellencamp and Pat McAfee(Getty Images; Imagn) Mellencamp, though, said in a statement that he was \"embarrassed\" that \"somebody\" used \"poor sportsmanship\" - without mentioning McAfee by name.

There might be some negative things said toward the other team. That's kind of how sports work, I think,\"McAfee began. \"We are going to be an agent of only good things at sports stuff happening.

    "article_text": "Minnesota parent Garrett Gross opened up on the frustration of seeing his state allowing a biologically male trans athlete to dominate the girls' softball postseason during an interview on OutKick's \"The Ricky Cobb\" show. (Credit: OutKick) Minnesota's high school softball postseason has been overshadowed by the dominance of atransgender pitcherat Champlin Park High School. The pitcher led Champlin Park to the state tournament with a dominant shutout victory in the sectional final on Thursday. Meanwhile,a lawsuitby three anonymous female players has been filed against the state for allowing the player to compete. The law firm representing the plaintiffs, Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), has provided statements from one of the female players about her experience facing the trans athlete. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM \"Hitting against him is not only a physical challenge but a mental, too. It’s a mental battle knowing that he has an advantage in the sport that I grew up playing, making it hard to even want to hit against him. His ability to get outs and spin the ball is a strong advantage, but like I said it’s also incredibly mentally challenging knowing that you’re competing against someone who has unfair advantages leaving you with little to no confidence,\" the player said. \"This issue has affected me in ways that I never imagined. It’s simply unfair and I hate that nothing is happening to change that. Boys should not be able to take girls spots on teams just because they are capable of doing so. I hope that more girls affected by this issue will stand up against this.\" The anonymous player also called out Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison for aggressively defending trans inclusion in girls' sports in the state. Ellison has filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump and the U.S. Department of Justice over Trump's \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports\" executive order. \"It’s really upsetting to know that [Ellison] isn’t taking rights of girls and women seriously. He is allowing boys to compete with girls, and it is not safe and completely unfair. To know that AG Ellison is in complete support of letting boys and men take advantage of females in sports is absolutely disgusting and wrong,\" the player added. A local Minnesota parent of another player who had to face the athlete spoke out about the situation during an interview on OutKick's\"The Ricky Cobb Show.\" \"It really comes down to cowardice leadership at the local state and federal level,\" said Garret Gross, the father of a local player. HOW TRANSGENDERISM IN SPORTS SHIFTED THE 2024 ELECTION AND IGNITED A NATIONAL COUNTERCULTURE \"Softball is different man, I'm telling you, these girls are strong, these girls are tough, but they're different than boys. At the highest levels, that ball is coming in 70-plus miles an hour from the pitcher's circle, which is only 43 feet away, and it's coming off that bat 80–85 miles an hour, and it's not question of if or when there will be a catastrophic injury or death that occurs because of this imbalance. The only question really is, is how old will the girl be that's killed and what will her name be? \"That's a strong statement, but that's where it's going to get to and that's going to be really the only thing that's going to make the public wake up here, and the question to all the apathetic people on the sidelines, why are you keeping quiet when we know this is going to happen?\" Champlin Park's school district provided a statement to Fox News Digital defending the decision to allow the athlete to compete on the softball team. \"Throughout the entire season, and as the Rebels advance to the state tournament, it is important to note that all of the student athletes participating for the Champlin Park Softball team are eligible to compete in compliance with Minnesota State High School League rules and applicable state law. Due to data privacy laws, the District is not able to provide public comment regarding a specific student athlete,\" a statement from the Anoka-Hennepin School District stated. \"In addition, the District is named in an active lawsuit which limits what information can be shared.\" After Trump signed the \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports\" executive order, the Minnesota State High School Leagueannounced itwould defy federal law by allowing transgender athletes to continue playing in women's sports. Ellison then claimed at a press conference on April 22 that he received notice from the Department of Justice threatening legal action if the state did not follow the executive order, so the AG decided to sue first. The White House later responded to the lawsuit, condemning Ellison for taking legal action to enable trans inclusion.

This is creepy and anti-woman,\" White House spokesperson Harrison Fields told Fox News Digital.

    "article_text": "Kurt 'The CyberGuy' Knutsson discusses Elon Musk's possible priorities as he exits his role with the White House and explains the urgent warning for iPhone users to update devices after a 'massive security gap.' Data breaches are no longer rare events but a persistent problem. We’ve been seeing regular incidents at public-facing companies across various sectors, including healthcare, retail and finance. While bad actors are certainly to blame, these corporations aren’t entirely without fault. They often make it easy for hackers to access user data by failing to protect it properly. A recent example came to light when acybersecurity researcherdiscovered an open database containing over 184 million account credentials. Join The FREE CyberGuy Report: Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals — plus instant access to my free Ultimate Scam Survival Guide when you sign up! Illustration of a hacker at work.(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) Cybersecurity researcher Jeremiah Fowler hasrevealedthe existence of an open database that contains 184,162,718 million account credentials. These include email addresses, passwords, usernames and URLs for platforms such as Google,Microsoft, Apple, Facebook and Snapchat. The information also covers banking services, medical platforms and government accounts. Most shockingly, the entire dataset was left completely unsecured. There was no encryption, no authentication required and no form of access control. It was simply a plain text file sitting online for anyone to find. 19 BILLION PASSWORDS HAVE LEAKED ONLINE: HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF Fowler located the database during routine scanning of publicly exposed assets. What he found was staggering. The file included hundreds of millions of unique records containing user credentials linked to the world’s largest technology and communication platforms. There were also account details for financial services and official portals used by state institutions. The file was not protected in any way. Anyone who discovered the link could open it in a browser and instantly view sensitive personal data. No software exploit was needed. No password was asked for. It was as open as a public document. Illustration of a hacker at work.(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) 200 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA RECORDS LEAKED IN MAJOR X DATA BREACH Fowler believes the data was harvested using an infostealer. These lightweight tools are favored by cybercriminals for their ability to silently extract login credentials and other private information from compromised devices. Once stolen, the data is often sold on dark web forums or used in targeted attacks. After reporting the breach, the hosting provider quickly removed access to the file. However, the owner of the database remains unknown. The provider did not disclose who uploaded it or whether the database was part of a legitimate archive that was accidentally published. Fowler could not determine whether this was the result of negligence or an operation with malicious intent. To verify the data, Fowler contacted some individuals listed in the records. Several confirmed that the information was accurate. This confirmation turns what might seem like abstract statistics into something very real. These were not outdated or irrelevant details. These were live credentials that could allow anyone to hijack personal accounts in seconds. 1.7 BILLION PASSWORDS LEAKED ON DARK WEB AND WHY YOURS IS AT RISK Login on a tablet.(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) HR FIRM CONFIRMS 4M RECORDS EXPOSED IN MAJOR HACK 1. Change your password on every platform:If your login credentials have been exposed, it’s not enough to change the password on just one account. Cybercriminals often try the same combinations across multiple platforms, hoping to gain access through reused credentials. Start by updating your most critical accounts, email, banking, cloud storage and social media, then move on to others. Use a new, unique password for each platform and avoid variations of old passwords, as they can still be predictable. Consider using apassword managerto generate and store complex passwords. Ourtop-rated password managerdelivers powerful protection to help keep your accounts secure. It featuresreal-time data breach monitoringto alert you if your login details have been exposed, plus a built-indata breach scannerthat checks your saved emails, passwords and credit card information against known leak databases. A password health checker also highlights weak, reused or compromised passwords so you can strengthen your online defenses with just a few clicks. Get more details about mybest expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here. 2. Enable two-factor authentication:Two-factor authentication, or 2FA, is a critical security feature that drastically reduces the risk of unauthorized access. Even if someone has your password, they won’t be able to log in without the second verification step, usually a one-time code sent to your phone or an authenticator app. Enable 2FA on all services that support it, especially your email, financial accounts and any service that stores sensitive personal data. 3. Watch for unusual account activity:After a breach, it’s common for compromised accounts to be used for spam, scams, or identity theft. Pay close attention to signs such as login attempts from unfamiliar locations, password reset requests you didn’t initiate or unexpected messages sent from your accounts. Most platforms allow you to review login history and connected devices. If you see something off, take action immediately by changing your password and revoking suspicious sessions. 4. Invest in personal data removal services:You should also consider a data removal service. Given the scale and frequency of breaches like the one described above, relying on personal caution alone is no longer enough. Automated data removal services can provide an essential extra layer of defense by continuously scanning for and helping eliminate your exposed information from data broker sites and other online sources. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.Check out my top picks for data removal services here. Get afree scanto find out if your personal information is already out on the web. 5. Avoid clicking on suspicious links and use strong antivirus software:One of the most common post-breach threats is phishing. Cybercriminals often use information from leaked databases to craft convincing emails that urge you to verify your account or reset your password. Never click on links or download attachments from unknown or suspicious sources. Instead, visit websites by typing the URL directly into your browser. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. 6. Keep your software and devices up to date:Many cyberattacks exploit known vulnerabilities in outdated software. Operating systems, browsers, antivirus programs and even appsneed to be updated regularlyto patch security flaws. Turn on automatic updates wherever possible so you’re protected as soon as fixes are released. Staying current with your software is one of the easiest and most effective ways to block malware, ransomware and spyware from infiltrating your system. HACKERS USING MALWARE TO STEAL DATA FROM USB FLASH DRIVES Security is not only the responsibilityof companies and hosting providers. Users need to adopt better practices, including unique passwords, multifactor authentication and regular reviews of their digital footprint. The careless exposure of over 184 million credentials is not just a mistake. It is an example of how fragile our systems remain when even basic protection is absent. In an era where artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and global connectivity are reshaping technology, it is unacceptable that plain text files containing financial and governmental credentials are still left sitting online.

    "article_text": "ALS patient communicates with the world using only his thoughts. Imagine losing your ability to speak or move, yet still having so much to say. For Brad G. Smith, this became his reality after beingdiagnosed with ALS, a rare and progressive disease that attacks the nerves controlling voluntary muscle movement. But thanks to a groundbreaking Neuralink brain implant, Smith is now able to communicate with the world using only his thoughts. Join The FREE CyberGuy Report: Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals — plus instant access to my free Ultimate Scam Survival Guide when you sign up! ALS patient Brad G. Smith and his family.(Bradford G. Smith/X) Before receiving theNeuralink implant, Smith relied on eye-tracking technology to communicate. While impressive, it came with major limitations. \"It is a miracle of technology, but it is frustrating. It works best in dark rooms, so I was basically Batman. I was stuck in a dark room,\"Smithshared in arecent post on X. Bright environments would disrupt the system, making communication slow and sometimes impossible. Now, Smith says, \"Neuralink lets me go outside and ignore lighting changes.\" PARALYZED MAN WITH ALS IS THIRD TO RECEIVE NEURALINK IMPLANT, CAN TYPE WITH BRAIN ALS patient Brad G. Smith.(Bradford G. Smith/X) AI ENABLES PARALYZED MAN TO CONTROL ROBOTIC ARM WITH BRAIN SIGNALS Smith is the first non-verbal person and only the third individual worldwide to receive the Neuralink Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). The device, about as thick as five stacked coins, sits in his skull and connects to the motor cortex-the part of the brain that controls movement. Tiny wires, thinner than human hair, extend into Smith's brain. These pick up signals from his neurons and transmit them wirelessly to his MacBook Pro. The computer then decodes these signals, allowing Smith to move a cursor on the screen with his thoughts alone. As Smith explains,\"TheNeuralink implantembedded in my brain contains 1024 electrodes that capture neuron firings every 15 milliseconds generating a vast amount of data.Artificial intelligenceprocesses this data on a connected MacBook Pro to decode my intended movements in real time to move the cursor on my screen. Neuralink does not read my deepest thoughts or words I think about. It just reads how I wanna move and moves the cursor where I want.\" WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? Neuralink brain implant.(Bradford G. Smith/X) TEEN GOES FROM 10 NIGHTLY SEIZURES TO ZERO WITH BRAIN IMPLANT Learning to use the system took some trial and error. At first, the team tried mapping Smith's hand movements to the cursor, but it didn't work well. After more research, they discovered that signals related to his tongue were the most effective for cursor movement, and clenching his jaw worked best for clicking. \"I am not actively thinking about my tongue, just like you don't think about your wrist when you move a mouse. I have done a lot of cursor movements in my life. I think my brain has switched over to subconscious control quickly so I just think about moving the cursor,\"Smith said. ALS patient Brad G. Smith with his wife and child.(Bradford G. Smith/X) RICE-SIZED ROBOT COULD MAKE BRAIN SURGERY SAFER AND LESS INVASIVE The Neuralink implant has given Smith new ways to interact with his family and the world. He can now play games like Mario Kart with his children and communicate more quickly than before. The system includes a virtual keyboard and shortcuts for common actions, making tasks like copying, pasting and navigating web pages much easier. Smith also worked with Neuralink engineers to develop a \"parking spot\" feature for the cursor.\"Sometimes you just wanna park the cursor and watch a video. When it is in the parking spot, I can watch a show or take a nap without worrying about the cursor,\"he explained. ALS patient Brad G. Smith and his child.(Bradford G. Smith/X) BEST FATHER’S DAY GIFTS FOR EVERY DAD To speed up communication even more, Smith uses Grok, Elon Musk's AI chatbot. Grok helps him write responses and even suggests witty replies. \"We have created a chat app that uses AI to listen to the conversation and gives me options to say in response. It uses Grok 3 and an AI clone of my old voice to generate options for me to say. It is not perfect, but it keeps me in the conversation and it comes up with some great ideas,\"Smith shared. One example? When a friend needed a gift idea for his girlfriend who loves horses, the AI suggested a bouquet of carrots. ALS patient Brad G. Smith and his family.(Bradford G. Smith/X) Smith's journey has been shaped by more than just technology. He credits his wife, Tiffany, as his \"best caregiver I could ever imagine,\" and recognizes the support of his kids, friends and family. Despite the challenges of ALS, Smith finds meaning and hope in his faith. \"I have not always understood why God afflicted me with ALS but with time I am learning to trust his plan for me. I'm a better man because of ALS. I'm a better disciple of Jesus Christ because of ALS. I'm closer to my amazing wife, literally and figuratively, because of ALS,\" he said. ALS patient Brad G. Smith and his family.(Bradford G. Smith/X) Neuralink's technology is still in its early stages, but Smith's experience is already making waves. The company recently received a \"breakthrough\" designation from the Food and Drug Administration for its brain implant device, which hopes to help people with severe speech impairments caused by ALS, stroke, spinal cord injury and other neurological conditions. Neuro-ethicists are watching closely, as the merging of brain implants and AI raises important questions about privacy, autonomy and the future of human communication. SUBSCRIBE TO KURT’S YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR QUICK VIDEO TIPS ON HOW TO WORK ALL OF YOUR TECH DEVICES ALS patient Brad G. Smith and his family.(Bradford G. Smith/X) Smith's story is about resilience, creativity and the power of technology to restore something as fundamental as the ability to communicate. As Smith puts it,\"Neuralink is giving me freedom, hope and faster communication. Overall, the whole Neuralink experience has been fantastic. It has improved my life so much. I'm so happy to be involved in something big that will help many people.\" While ALS \"really sucks,\" as Smith says, his journey shows how innovation and determination can bring light to even the darkest rooms.

    "article_text": "Secretary Pete Hegseth denied China's assertion that Golden Dome was an effort to turn space into a 'war zone,' arguing it was only for defense of the homeland. U.S. Secretary ofDefense Pete Hegsethissued a stark warning Saturday at the Shangri-La Dialogue security conference in Singapore: China’s military is \"rehearsing for the real deal,\" and a full-scale invasion of Taiwan \"could be imminent.\" \"We are not going to sugarcoat it – the threat China poses is real,\" he added. CHINA LAUNCHES LARGE MILITARY DRILLS AROUND TAIWAN TO ISSUE 'SEVERE WARNING' Beijing swiftly rejected the allegation.Rear Admiral Hu Gangfeng, head of the Chinese delegation and vice president of China’s National Defense University, called the remarks \"groundless accusations,\" stating that \"some of the claims are completely fabricated, some distort facts and some are cases of a thief crying ‘stop thief.’\" Despite such denials, a growing body of evidence suggests China may indeed be preparing for a military move against Taiwan. Taiwan's National Security Council Secretary-General Joseph Wu, Taiwan's President William Lai and Taiwan's Defense Minister Wellington Koo pose for photos with soldiers as they visit the troops during the Rapid Response Exercise at the Songshan military airbase in Taipei on March 21, 2025.(Photo by I-HWA CHENG/AFP via Getty Images) Numerous indicators draw this conclusion. Here are nine: 1. China has intensified itsjoint sea and air exercises surrounding Taiwan, including rehearsals simulating blockades, encirclements, and amphibious assaults. These drills closely mirror operational strategies that would likely be employed in an actual invasion and are widely interpreted by analysts as concrete signals of Beijing’s willingness to use force. 2. The Peoples’ Liberation Army (PLA) has positionedH-6 bombers, capable of delivering nuclear payloads, on outposts such as Woody Island in the South China Sea. These platforms significantly extend China’s strike capability and serve as strategic messaging to both Taipei and Washington. China's President Xi Jinping could be planning an attack on Taiwan.(REUTERS/Adriano Machado) 3. China continues to conduct gray-zone operations akanon-kinetic forms of coercion, including cyberattacks on Taiwan’s infrastructure, disinformation campaigns, andillegal incursions by maritime militia vessels. Though these actions fall below the threshold of open warfare, they are designed to wear down Taiwan’s defenses and destabilize the region. 4. According toU.S. intelligence assessments, Chinese President Xi Jinping has instructed the PLA to be capable of launching an invasion of Taiwan by 2027. While not a confirmed deadline for action, it has catalyzed PLA modernization, emphasizing joint force integration and amphibious readiness. 5. China’s strategic expansion inLatin America– especially through Belt and Road investments and attempts to influence key nodes such as the Panama Canal reflect broader ambitions to project global power and encircle U.S. interests. These moves indirectly support Taiwan-related ambitions by distracting or overextending U.S. response capabilities. 6. Recent PLA exercises have incorporatedcivilian ferriescapable of transporting tanks and personnel—suggestingpreparations for amphibious operationson Taiwan’s shores. The dual-use nature of these assets allows China to mask military buildup under the guise of civilian activity. A China Coast Guard boat passes near the coast of Matsu islands of  Taiwan on Monday, Oct. 14.(Taiwan Coast Guard/AP) 7. Beijing has intensified its political narrative around \"reunification,\" including state media coverage, educational reforms, and speeches by top Chinese officials. These ideological signals often precede military action in authoritarian regimes. 8, China has rapidly expanded itscoastal infrastructure, including new docks, airstrips, and logistics hubs in Fujian Province—directly across the Taiwan Strait. Satellite imagery suggests these assets are optimized for a cross-strait operation. 9. Chinese fighter jets and warships have entered Taiwan’s Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) at unprecedented levels. In early 2025 alone, PLA aircraft breachedTaiwan’s ADIZover 1,200 times, prompting elevated readiness levels in Taipei. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The question of whether China will invade Taiwan is no longer hypothetical but a matter of timing and risk calculus. While Beijing continues to deny aggressive intent, the evidence suggests a sustained and deliberate military buildup with the intent to compel reunification—if not peacefully, then by force. Hegseth’s warning reflects not alarmism, but a sober assessment of escalating realities. These indicators—military drills, strategic deployments, political rhetoric, and infrastructure mobilization—align with historical precedents for pre-invasion posturing. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The international community must take this threat seriously. Strengthening deterrence, improving intelligence sharing, and reinforcing Taiwan’s self-defense capabilities are critical to avoiding a regional catastrophe. For the United States and its allies, readiness is no longer optional—it is a strategic imperative.

    "title": "FMR FDA COMMISSIONER KESSLER: Sorry guys, that beer gut isn't cool. It's killing you",
    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Men can get away with being fat. The beer belly is often joked about as a relatable feature of the typical male body. The reality is it is killing them. Studies have shown that men are less likely than women to see themselves as fat or overweight. They rationalize excess weight by prioritizing functionality and success. The acceptance of the \"dad bod\" reinforces this; it is seen as the hallmark of the \"everyman\" who relates to common struggles. In reality, many men don’t feel good about carrying excess weight. Joking about one’s \"dad bod\" is less an embracing and more of an embarrassed resignation. The passive acceptance of increased body fat — particularly belly fat — is proving deadly.Toxic visceral fatthat accumulates in the abdomen gets into the liver, pancreas and heart. In contrast to the fat that sits just under our skin, deeper visceral fat is less able to hold on to fat molecules and is metabolically active, leaking free fatty acids and other molecules that cause inflammation. It also creates metabolic chaos, elevating insulin levels and laying the groundwork for insulin resistance. SCIENTISTS MAY HAVE DISCOVERED WHY THE POUNDS COME BACK AFTER LOSING WEIGHT Men, especially as they get older, have more of this fat than women, especially compared to women before menopause. About two out of every five men, about40-46%, in the United Statesmeet the classification of obesity. Even men who are not overweight or obese but have increased visceral fat have an increased risk of mortality. The so-called dad bod is not a healthy one for men.(iStock) This toxic fat causescardiovascular and kidney disease,diabetes, certain cancers and likely contributes to neurodegenerative disease. Greater visceral fat is associated with increased mortality from all causes. Even if it does not result in an earlier death, it increases risk of disability from conditions such as diabetes andheart failure.I look around and see too many men suffering from these preventable conditions. And most have no idea how to tackle it. A waist circumference of more than 40 inches is an indicator that a man hastoo much visceral fat.While beer guts and dad bods are obvious signs of unhealthy fat accumulation, health-minded men who spend a good deal of time in the gym are not immune from this issue. HERE'S WHY BELLY FAT IS MORE COMMON AS WE AGE, AND 3 WAYS TO PREVENT IT In the course of researching my book, I attended a seminar on strength training in Los Angeles, where most men in the crowd could deadlift far more than I could. I asked an instructor about the composition of these barrel-shaped guys. \"Many of them are strong, but they still carry too much body fat,\" he confessed. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Even for this group, there is a lot of fat accompanying their large muscles. The key, then, is reducing the excess fat around the waist while maintaining as much muscle as possible. Men die at a younger age than women, on average five years sooner, in part because of this increased visceral fat. It’s important to address the cultural standards reinforcing unhealthy body weight in men. And, while it would also be ideal to change the current food environment, that is unlikely to happen completely or anytime soon. The newanti-obesitymedications provide an important tool for men to reclaim their health, but they are not a cure-all. They cause us to eat less, sometimes much less, which can be risky. These drugs work by their gastrointestinal effects, keeping food in the stomach longer, generating feelings that border on nausea, and sometimes outright distress, which induce feelings of fullness and satiation. OBESITY WILL AFFECT OVER HALF OF ADULTS IN 25 YEARS, STUDY PREDICTS Those feelings are able to counter the rewarding and addictive properties of food, reducing the \"food noise\" that reverberates in heads of people who have a hard time controlling their appetite. One of the gifts of these medications is that people condition themselves to eat less to avoid experiencing the ill effects of food staying in the stomach longer. A waist circumference of more than 40 inches is an indicator that a man has too much visceral fat. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP There are a lot of questions concerning these drugs that still need to be answered, especially around how they should be used in the real world. They are not for everybody, have a real risk of adverse events, and require good medical and dietary care. But they can help people control their appetite and learn to eat in a more healthful way. The American male body is in trouble, and the way to make it healthy again isn’t simple, but it can be done with education and commitment. And it begins with making space for men to discuss their health vulnerabilities without stigma or shame. It is a matter of life and death. David A.

    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. In an age of instant accolades and viral valor,heroesare everywhere. Celebrities tearfully describing a difficult breakup on daytime TV are deemed heroic. You knew the word had lost all meaning when alleged murderer Luigi Mangione became a \"hero\" on social media for taking the life of Brian Thompson, the CEO of United Healthcare. How is it that we have so lost the thread? Just who qualifies as a hero was on my mind as I began researching my book\"Lincoln’s Lady Spymaster\"several years ago.  We were in the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic, our lives upended. I eagerly ditched the commute and worked from home but as the months in isolation slid by, I began to worry. How long could this go on for? The situation was more dire for many of the young women producers I had worked with in our offices in Manhattan. They were lonely and anxious, living alone in tiny New York apartments or at home in their childhood bedrooms. One young woman I knew started having panic attacks. KEVIN COSTNER REVEALS 'TRAGIC' TRUTHS UNCOVERED IN NEW DOCU-SERIES 'THE WEST' I wanted to help these co-workers cope – but what could I do? Look, I reasoned with myself, women in this country have faced far more difficult challenges than atemporary lockdown(it had to be temporary, after all!). American women have survived wars, myriad financial panics and so many challenges. The cover of \"Lincoln’s Lady Spymaster: The Untold Story of the Abolitionist Southern Belle Who Helped Win the Civil War,\" written by Gerri Willis. I decided I would find a subject, a real woman from our nation’s past, someone who lived through challenging times and not only survived but left her mark on the world. I wanted what we all want in a hero – someone acting courageously, not for headlines or money or even public gratitude, but because they felt called to right a wrong regardless of consequences. I first learned ofElizabeth Van Lewthe same way we find out about most new things, from a web search. An academic historian had written about her, and she was sometimes included in lists of the moonlight-and-magnolia-style of female civil war spies, the kind historians don’t take too seriously. I was hooked when I learned she was a spymaster, and strikingly, a Southern belle who chose to stay faithful to the Union and who ran a spy ring for President Abraham Lincoln’s top general,Ulysses S. Grant,while living in Richmond, the capital of the Confederacy. CIVIL WAR TAUGHT HOW TO INFLUENCE NEWS MEDIA. IT NEARLY COST LINCOLN RE-ELECTION When I began, I thought of myself as knowledgeable about the era. I knew the bright lights, Lincoln, Grant, Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. But this woman had left little trace. She was generally missing from much of the Civil War literature. James McPherson mentioned her not at all in his sweeping nearly 900-page history of the conflict, \"Battle Cry of Freedom.\" I learned she had left a diary, where she spilled her fears and hopes during the war. I imagined myself writing a book about a woman whom society underestimates and throws obstacles in her path, a tale of uplift! But my research exposed a secret history – a story Van Lew herself tried to cancel. Unlike other spies, she refused to write a book of her Civil War exploits after the war and conducted few newspaper interviews. I began to discover the real Elizabeth and she surprised me. I found she was complicated and made difficult, morally questionable decisions. She lied to friends and neighbors, brazenly stole secrets from some and bribed others. Although she was a supporter of both the Union and abolitionism, her family owned slaves. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Late in the war, as she became frustrated at the pace of Union advances, she tried to convince Union war planners to abduct Confederate leadership. She was the kind of woman who could as easily inspect the body of a dead soldier at dawn under threat of discovery by the enemy as preside over a tea party, swapping gossip and passing canapes. And, yet she provided invaluable information to the Union and ran what historians have described as the most-effective spy ring on either side of the conflict. As I began writing the book, I recalled the fact that co-workers and friends had labeled me a hero when I went public with my diagnosis of Stage 3 breast cancer. While it felt nice to be called a hero, I never really accepted the idea. My fight with cancer was really an act of self-interest. Elizabeth Van Lew was a Southern belle who ran a spy ring for Union Gen. Ulysses S. Grant. FILE: General Robert Lee surrenders to Grant at Appomattox, April 9, 1865.(Getty Images) ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S POSSESSIONS SELL FOR MILLIONS AS BLOODSTAINED GLOVES TOP AUCTION What I saw in Elizabeth Van Lew was someone whoacted with no self-regard,inviting risk after risk. Hers was not a Daniel Penny kind of courage, the kind of instant reaction to fight a physical threat on behalf of others that we all admire, but a more sustained battle of conscience and will. In this world, we need both kinds of heroes and could welcome more. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP This year marks the 160th anniversary of the Civil War’s end andLincoln’s assassination.As we remember that tragic war, let’s not forget the heroes that emerged, especially those that have remained in the shadows. Elizabeth Van Lew was one of tens of thousands of women who emerged to fight the war in their own way. Hundreds fought on the battlefield following husbands, brothers and fathers into service; women nursed the injured, others ran their family farms and businesses on their own for the first time. Van Lew’s story is a testament to the essence of true heroism: unwavering moral conviction, selfless action and the courage to stand against prevailing tides. In an era when the term \"hero\" is often diluted, her legacy reminds us thatreal heroesare those who, without fanfare, commit themselves to justice and humanity.

    "title": "DAVID MARCUS: Why do elite universities take in students tied to foreign foes? Money, of course",
    "article_text": "Fox News legal editor Kerri Urbahn discusses the legal battle between the Trump administration and Harvard University over foreign student enrollment on ‘America’s Newsroom.’ For centuries, the traditional role of elite universities likeHarvardhas been to train the next generation of leaders in every field of endeavor, to hold before them an open door to power and influence. So why on Earth are we holding that door open tocommunist Chinese nationals? I had a good friend in high school, sharp as a tack, double legacy at Yale, graduated Harvard Law and by 30 she was at the State Department. The joke was, \"Don’t piss off Becca, she can pick up the phone and have you killed.\" HARVARD'S ENDOWMENT HOLDS $7 MILLION PER STUDENT, STILL RECEIVES $550M FROM GOVT ANNUALLY The point here is that, for better or worse, and it's often the latter, graduates of top schools are meant to create a class of people who lead the country, who lead its industries and sciences, who stay at the Princeton Club in midtown, and wear their college ties. A top American degree opens up a world of the powerful that most Americans don’t even know exists, much less ever interact with. Yet thousands and thousands of communist Chinese nationals are invited to this table every year. Why? Donald Trump has targeted Harvard by freezing their federal funding as the administration, and Harvard has sued the Trump administration in response.(Getty Images | iStock) There may have been a time when this influx of foreign students could be seen as exerting informational power around the globe, the idea being these students will go home and spread the gospel of democracy, free markets, and blue jeans. But let’s not kid ourselves, these scions of Chinese Communist Party members who pay their way at Harvard aren’t going home and creating movements for democracy in Beijing, not if they want to make it to grad school alive and well. In fact, we are the decided losers in this informational power exchange, as not just the Chinese, but Qataris, and 10,000 Iranian students for good measure, bring ideas and attitudes that undermine American foreign policy to the doorstep of the very people who will implement it. This brings us back to the question: Why are we doing this? Why are we training our foes and giving them access to the inner corridors of American power, and I’m sure nobody will be shocked that the answer is money. Foreign interests lavish our top universities with gifts like a rich guy who got caught cheating on his wife. In just the last five years, the Harvard Crimsonreports$151 million from foreign governments and over a billion from foreign donors flowed to Cambridge. For hundreds of years, Harvard had educated the nation's great industrialists, financiers, and business magnates who kept the coffers of its endowment, still at a robust $52 billion, overflowing. But the blue-blood spigot is running dry. No, the non-binary womyns studies majors at the Harvard Divinity School are not going to be donating a new football stadium anytime soon. For that, these institutions have learned to rely on foreign money, and we all know that money ain’t free. Harvard alum and hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman is one of many former donors who won't contribute to the school's enormous endowment.(Chris Ratcliffe/Michael Fein/Bloomberg via Getty Images) The money buys influence, it buys some say in how our nation conducts itself. During COVID, with a few notable exceptions, our country’s entire healthcare apparatus just nodded along slavishly to every lie China and its mouthpiece the World Health Organization uttered. Why do you think that happened? It happened because China pays for research. It happened because China infiltrates the highest levels of our society, and sadly, they have become quite expert at it. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is obviously right to insist that wevigorously investigate any studentfrom any nation that is a political or ideological foe of the United States, and frankly, any association with the Chinese Communist Party should be a dealbreaker. The first Harvard graduate to become the president of the United States was John Adams, who once famously wrote of his revolutionary adventures, \"I must study politics and war that my sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION But today, it is our sons and daughters losing opportunities to study mathematics and philosophy to people from countries that hate America, and it is also those countries which stand the most to gain in terms of politics and war. American universities need to be American universities, not cosmopolitan, non-affiliated islands of corrupt foreign influence, and if the Harvards of the world can’t be that, then places like conservative Hillsdale College or the University of Austin may well need to replace them. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP If Harvard and other storied elite universities want to return to serving the mission of helping America to be great, it would be welcome. But in the meantime, we don’t have to give them taxpayer money, and we don’t have to let them invite our enemies into the inner circle of American power.

    "title": "DOUG SCHOEN: I'm a Harvard grad. Here's my take what Trump's doing right and wrong",
    "article_text": "Trump White House Homeland Security advisor Stephen Miller weighs in on a judge halting President Donald Trump's Harvard visa block on 'The Ingraham Angle.' The ongoing fight between the Trump administration andHarvard Universityhas – unfortunately – taken on a life of its own. I say unfortunately, not because I believe the reforms PresidentDonald Trumpis demanding are wholly out of bounds – they are not, by any means. Rather, I say this because, as an alum of both Harvard undergrad and law school – and a longtime donor – the rampant antisemitism on campus, as well as the university’s imperiousness, I cannot fault the White House for acting. STATE DEPARTMENT NOW SCRUTINIZING ALL VISA HOLDERS ASSOCIATED WITH HARVARD Indeed, there is a legitimate argument to be made thatHarvard must be reined in. That being said, there are concerns unique to Harvard that separate it from other universities. These concerns range from its handling of antisemitism, its silencing of voices who do not conform to far-left orthodoxy, as well as who it has hired. Notably, the concerns surrounding Harvard did not originate with its handling of antisemitism in the wake of Hamas’ October 7th attack on Israel. It has long been the epicenter of Diversity, Education, and Inclusion (DEI) efforts in the U.S., to the point where the Supreme Court was forced to strike down its admissions criteria for being unfair to Asian students in June 2023. And yet, within just the past month, two serious incidents underscore how much further Harvard has to go in order to reform andredeem itself. First, the Harvard Law Review awarded a $65,000 grant to Ibraham Bharmal, after the Harvard Law School student was charged with assaulting an Israeli student, an incident caught on video. In effect, Harvard not only tolerated Bharmal’s antisemitism, but rewarded it with a taxpayer-funded grant after he assaulted another student solely because of his nationality and Jewish identity. Second, Harvard recently revoked the tenure of Francesca Gino, a professor of business administration - who ironically is \"well known for studying honesty\" as Pilar Arias noted – after a four-year long fight over Gino’s repeated falsification of data. To be clear, this is not to say that I agree with every action Trump hastaken against Harvard. For example, blanket bans on accepting foreign students is excessive, but vetting their social media is inherently reasonable. Universities routinely do this for American students; thus it stands to reason Harvard should have the same – or even stricter – policy for foreigners. To that end, Harvard professor Steven Pinker recently published a piece in the New York Times which does a tremendous job at capturing the issues Harvard must address and the best ways to do so. Pinker, who makes his frustration towards the school’s handling of antisemitism, free speech, hiring practices, and more very clear, makes one more key point: while Harvard has its \"serious ailments,\" the reaction must also be calibrated. In other words, while Harvard should not have unfettered access to billions of dollars of taxpayer money, there is a real risk that across-the-board cuts harm America’s scientific prowess without producing the – very necessary – reforms Trump is demanding. There is ample opportunity for a more targeted approach that can force Harvard to make thesenecessary changeswithout destroying the school’s leadership in many vital fields. For instance, grants to social sciences can be canceled without touching money that funds medical or scientific research into cancer or other diseases. And while I agree with Pinker on that and other points he makes, perhaps the most important thing he points out is that the only thing thus far that has spurred Harvard to take any steps towards change has been Trump. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION As Pinker puts it, \"The uncomfortable fact is that many of these reforms followed Mr. Trump’s inauguration and overlap with his demands.\" Of course, it should not take the President of the United States to bring American universities inline with their own codes of conduct. Nor should it take the power of the White House to force Harvard to crackdown on the scourge of antisemitism and anti-American extremism that has overrun its campus. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP And yet, this is where we now find ourselves. It is my hope, as an alum, and as an American, that the Trump administration and Harvard come to a solution whereby the university realizes it cannot continue to permit – or reward – students who so blatantly violate the code of conduct, either of the university or of the United States.

    "title": "BROADCAST BIAS: Media coverage of NPR lawsuit against Trump hides what public media really is",
    "article_text": "NPR CEO Katherine Maher assured PBS on Wednesday that her outlet is \"non-partisan\" following President Donald Trump’s latest executive order seeking to defund it. National Public Radio started out its typically partisan week by filing a lawsuit against President Donald Trump over hisattempts to defund NPR and PBS.Their lawyers arrogantly argued that Trump’s actions violated the First Amendment. Somehow, freedom of speech requires conservatives to fund speech they oppose. Trump voters must fund virulently anti-Trump \"journalism.\" Surprisingly, the morning and evening newscasts of ABC, CBS and NBC didn’t report on this. But their streaming channels did. On the streaming CBS \"Daily Report,\" they brought on legal expert Jessica Levinson to buttress the free-speech argument. \"TheFirst Amendmentarguments that NPR brings up here, I think, are quite strong … because what's in the public record is the Trump administration saying, we don't like the content of what NPR is disseminating.\" At least CBS anchor Lindsey Reiser quoted from the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, which clearly states that there should be \"strict adherence to objectivity and balance in all programs or series of programs of a controversial nature.\" That passage has been ignored on a daily basis since 1967. PBS DISPUTES TRUMP’S CLAIMS OF ‘BIAS’ FOLLOWING HIS EXECUTIVE ORDER TARGETING THE NETWORK NPR was mentioned in passing on Wednesday’s \"CBS Mornings.\" Reporter Jarred Hill cited, \"On NPR Tuesday, Harvard`s president said the university has made real progress dealing with antisemitism.\" This was an interview with Harvard President Alan Garber where NPR morning host Steve Inskeep threw anti-Trump softballs, including: \"Is the administration trying to damage, destroy or capture your university?\" NPR and PBS are fighting against Trump cuts to their budgets. FILE: The headquarters for National Public Radio (NPR) is seen in Washington.(AP Photo/Charles Dharapak) If you would like to count ABC’s \"The View\" as a news show – and it's technically a product of ABC News, which is perpetually embarrassing – on Thursday, May 29, they celebrated NPR \"founding mothers\" Susan Stamberg and Nina Totenberg for Jewish American Heritage Month. Over treacly music, Sarah Haines hailed Stamberg as the first female anchor of a national broadcast news program with a \"neutral and relatable tone.\" Then she gushed over Totenberg for winning seven awards from the American Bar Association, as if that group isn’t a gaggle of Democrats. NPR SUES TRUMP WHITE HOUSE OVER EXECUTIVE ORDER TARGETING PUBLIC MEDIA Haines oozed that \"Nina was dubbed theQueen of Leaksby Vanity Fair for her award-winning reports on top secret Supreme Court Watergate deliberations and for breaking the bombshell story of sexual harassment allegations against Clarence Thomas – which he has denied.\" In reality, Totenberg has been a queen of leaks from Democrats seeking to damage Republican Supreme Court picks. She succeeded in ruining Douglas Ginsburg in 1987, failed to get Thomas in 1991, and she relished the unproven claims of Brett Kavanaugh’s accusers in 2018. But she wrote an entire book relating how she and leftist Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg were the best of pals titled \"Dinners with Ruth: A Memoir on the Power of Friendships.\" The \"PBS News Hour\" came to NPR’s defense with a softball interview on May 27 that included more bias-denying absurdity fromNPR CEO Katherine Maher.PBS host Geoff Bennett mentioned that Republicans accuse NPR of a liberal bias, and longtime NPR editor Uri Berliner \"accused the network of having what he called a lack of viewpoint diversity. How do you respond to those critiques?\" Mayer unleashed the chutzpah: \"Well, I first of all, respond by saying we're a nonpartisan news organization. We seek to be able to provide a range of different viewpoints in terms of who we bring on air, the stories that we tell. ... My view is that that is a mischaracterization of our work. We do not seek to favor any political party at all.\" NPR CEO PRESSED ON IMPLICATION THAT ORGANIZATION IS BIASED AFTER TRUMP SIGNS ORDER SLASHING TAXPAYER FUNDS Bennett didn’t note that Berliner investigated NPR news employees who registered to vote in the District of Columbia and found 87 Democrats and zero Republicans. That might make Maher look foolish. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION This was like CBS’s \"Face the Nation\" hosting Maher and PBS CEO Paula Kerger on May 4. [Host Margaret Brennan helpfully suggested that when the president described the networks as \"radical left monsters,\" she could only think of Cookie Monster from \"Sesame Street.\" These networks are just like cute and fuzzy Muppets.] ABC's \"The View\" loves NPR's Nina Totenberg.(Allison Shelley/NPR) Brennan gently asked Maher about complaints about fairness: \"How do you respond to the implication that your news coverage is not?\" Maher typically claimed \"We have an extraordinary Washington desk, and our people report straight down the line, and I think that not only do they do that, they do so with a mission that very few other broadcast organizations have, which is a requirement to serve the entire public..\" PBS, NPR BLAST 'BLATANTLY UNLAWFUL' TRUMP EXECUTIVE ORDER HALTING PUBLIC FUNDING, VOW CHALLENGES Calling NPR \"straight down the line\"makes about as much sense as claiming the Rocky Mountains are a prairie. NPRmediacorrespondent David Folkenflik was ordered to cover this lawsuit in the most one-sided way, both on \"Morning Edition\" and the very inaccurately titled evening newscast \"All Things Considered.\" They didn’t consider offering a conservative critique of the NPR lawsuit.

Folkenflik also appeared on the NPR talk show \"Here & Now,\" where co-host Scott Tong intoned the usual silly corporate language: \"No NPR official or news executive has had any influence on this story.\" And then the entire interview could be summarized as \"So tell us what NPR’s CEO said about this?\" In other words, \"No NPR executive viewed this beforehand\" and ... it would pass with flying colors if they did. The idea that there is any objectivity or balance on this network is easily shattered by listening to it. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM TIM GRAHAM",

This comes as an update toPew’s news influencer reportreleased in November 2024, which did not include Bluesky in its numbers. The report focused on a relatively small group of 500 influencers, all of whom have more than 100,000 followers on at least one major platform and post regularly about current events. For this Bluesky-centric update, Pew looked at those same influencers (as opposed to accounts that may have found a big audience on Bluesky exclusively) and saw that in February/March, 43% of them had an account on Bluesky. Just over half (51%) of those accounts were created after the 2024 presidential election. There’s a big divide between influencers on the right and the left, with 69% of the left-leaning accounts (the ones that explicitly identified as liberals or Democrats and expressed support for Kamala Harris or Joe Biden before the presidential election) making the jump to Bluesky, while only 15% of the conservative ones did the same. This movement wasn’t necessarily at the expense of X (formerly Twitter). While X owner Elon Musk’s alliance with now-President Donald Trump seemed todrive new users to Bluesky, 82% of the influencers tracked by Pew still had an account on X, down only slightly from 85% in summer 2025. In other words, even if left-leaning influencers are dipping their toes into Bluesky, most of them (87%) haven’t abandoned X. Pew also says most influencers continue to post more regularly on X than on Bluesky. However, Bluesky activity does appear to be picking up — the number of influencers on Bluesky who are actually posting grew from 54% in the first week of January to 66% in the last full week of March.

Asreported in NBC News, leaders from the civil rights groupsent a letter Thursdayto the Shelby County Health Department and Memphis Light Gas and Water criticizing the organizations’ “lackadaisical approach to the operation of this dirty data center” and calling on them to “issue an emergency order for xAI to stop operations completely” — or if there’s no order, to at least cite and stop the company from allegedly violating clean air laws. The letter expressed particular concerns around the gas turbines that xAI runs to power Colossus. The company has applied for a permit tocontinue operating 15 gas turbinesat the facility, although the NAACP said authorities have “allowed xAI to operate at least 35 gas turbines without any permitting” over the past year. City officials have previously said xAI did not need permits for the turbines’ first year of use. These turbinesreportedly emit hazardous air pollutants, including formaldehyde, at levels exceeding EPA limits. The NAACP’s letter also pointed to the turbines’ nitrogen-oxide emissions. Noting that the Colossus facility is located near South Memphis’ Boxtown neighborhood, which the letter described as a “historically Black community,” the NAACP said the location perpetuates “the trend of industries adding pollution to communities who do not cause the problem.” “Instead of [the Shelby County Health Department] working to reduce health issues known in the area including that cancer risks are already four times the national average, it has allowed xAI to operate above the law,” the NAACP added. The NAACP’s letter is addressed to Shelby County Health Department Director Michelle Taylor, as well as Memphis Light Gas and Water’s commissioners; Taylor isleaving her rolein Shelby County to become the commissioner of the Baltimore City Health Department.

NPR saysa 2012 agreementbetween Facebook (now Meta) and the Federal Trade Commission requires the company to conduct privacy reviews of its products, evaluating the risks of any potential updates. Until now, those reviews have been largely conducted by human evaluators. Under the new system, Meta reportedly said product teams will be asked to fill out a questionaire about their work, then will usually receive an “instant decision” with AI-identified risks, along with requirements that an update or feature must meet before it launches. This AI-centric approach would allow Meta to update its products more quickly, but one former executive told NPR it also creates “higher risks,” as “negative externalities of product changes are less likely to be prevented before they start causing problems in the world.” In a statement, a Meta spokesperson said the company has “invested over $8 billion in our privacy program” and is committed to “deliver innovative products for people while meeting regulatory obligations.” “As risks evolve and our program matures, we enhance our processes to better identify risks, streamline decision-making, and improve people’s experience,” the spokesperson said. “We leverage technology to add consistency and predictability to low-risk decisions and rely on human expertise for rigorous assessments and oversight of novel or complex issues.” This post has been updated with additional quotes from Meta’s statement.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us From AI to EVs, demand for semiconductors is exploding, but silicon is hitting its limits. Making more efficient chips requiresnew materials, ones far less ubiquitous than sand, but the solution might be out there — literally. Space Forge, a U.K. startup headquartered in Cardiff, Wales, recently raised a £22.6 million (approximately $30 million) Series A to make wafer materials in space, where unique conditions unlock new possibilities. For instance, the Welsh startup earlier won funding for aprojectthrough which BT (formerly British Telecom) is hoping to test how integrating crystal materials grown in space could reduce the power consumption of its 5G towers. Because of weightlessness and other properties, crystals made in space have fewer defects, which can help devices use less energy. Real-world use cases like this help Space Forge convey the message that critical systems could use its technology as an invisible backbone. The whole idea of making chips in orbit may sound like science fiction, but its feasibility has been knownsince the 1970s, CEO Joshua Western told TechCrunch. “We’re stood on the shoulders of about 50 years of research when it comes to not only knowing that this is possible, but also knowing that there is a profound improvement in doing so,” Western said. The improvement in question is obtaining crystals and advanced semiconductor materials with fewer defects and enhanced performance, making them appealing for use in applications such as quantum computing and defense systems. This dual-use potential explains whyNATO Innovation Fundled Space Forge’s Series A, and why major U.S. defense contractor Northrop Grumman isone of its partners. Partners will be key to Space Forge’s trajectory: The company won’t build rockets and is instead relying on existing space providers for the launch part — a “solved problem,” in Western’s words. It’s not just the rockets; from chip manufacturing to space return, Space Forge is tying together technologies that may be described as solved problems, at least on paper. But if you ask Western about its moat, he has a quick retort: “How bloody hard is it to do?!” That’s the price to pay to take advantage of space’s unique environment: It requires adapting to harsh conditions such as extreme temperatures and microgravity, Western said. “Physics has the answers, and engineering is how you actually get there.” Engineering is also needed to bridge the gap between innovation and commercially viable technology. Rather than capsules like Apollo’s, Space Forge returns its materials to Earth as “Mary Poppins from space.” Western explained the nickname: “We deploy something that looks very much like an umbrella, [but] that’s space grade, and that allows us to float back from space down to the ground.” Developing new return technology is a key focus of Space Forge. Besides its heat shield, Pridwen, a nod to the legend of King Arthur, the startup alsodeveloped Fielder, a floating net to catch returning satellites and ensure a soft landing on water. These efforts were supported by the U.K. Space Agency and European Space Agency, of which the U.K. is still a member despite Brexit. Establishing a return infrastructure across Europe is one of Space Forge’s ambitions — and it is underway. This week, the companyopened an office in Portugalon the island of Santa Maria in the Azores, a well-suited location for satellite return in mainland Europe and an important step to convince European partners that this approach can reach industrial scale. The increasing commoditization of both return and launch technologies is what made therise of in-space manufacturing startupspossible in the first place, with applications also including drug discovery and telecom hardware. But their viability is still very dependent on costs coming down, or in finding clients willing to pay that premium. Shifting geopolitics could help Space Forge secure more of these clients. Western and his co-founder and CTO Andrew Bacon previously worked at Thales Alenia Space, a joint venture between Thales and its Italian peer Leonardo. But the trend is broader than just defense, as concerns mount across Europe over reliance on semiconductors from Taiwan. “We urgently need a resilient, homegrown supply of the next-gen supermaterials required for the future of compute. We also need this homegrown chip supply to be produced sustainably,” World Fund general partner Daria Saharova wrote in a statement. Theclimate tech VC firm, which co-ledSpace Forge’s seed roundand participated in its Series A, is buying into Space Forge’s positioning as a “carbon negative technology” thatcould fight climate change. However, the emissions savings have yet to be proven at scale and rely on commercial adoption to truly offset each mission. Space Forge, though, still has to complete its first mission. Its first attempt ended after a grand total of six and a half minutes whenVirgin Orbit’s rocket suffered an anomalyin its launch of Cornwall in 2023, losing its entire payload, including Space Forge’s ForgeStar-0 satellite. With its new funding, the company is now accelerating the development of its latest spacecraft and readying for the launch of its ForgeStar-1 demonstrator later this year, together with Pridwen. And in a nod to the galaxy far, far away, Space Forge announced the mission’s official name — “The Forge Awakens” — on May 4.

CalledGoogle AI Edge Gallery, the app is available for Android and will soon come to iOS. It allows users to find, download, and run compatible models that generate images, answer questions, write and edit code, and more. The models run offline, without needing an internet connection, tapping into supported phones’ processors. AI models running in the cloud are often more powerful than their local counterparts, but they also have their downsides. Some users might be wary of sending personal or sensitive data to a remote data center, or want to have models available without needing to find a Wi-Fi or cellular connection. Google AI Edge Gallery, which Google is calling an “experimental Alpha release,” can be downloaded from GitHub by followingthese instructions. The home screen shows shortcuts to AI tasks and capabilities like “Ask Image” and “AI Chat.” Tapping on a capability pulls up a list of models suited for the task, such as Google’sGemma 3n. Google AI Edge Gallery also provides a “Prompt Lab” users can use to kick off “single-turn” tasks powered by models, like summarizing and rewriting text. The Prompt Lab comes with several task templates and configurable settings to fine-tune the models’ behaviors. Your mileage may vary in terms of performance, Google warns. Modern devices with more powerful hardware will predictably run models faster, but the model size also matters. Larger models will take more time to complete a task — say, answering a question about an image — than smaller models. Google’s inviting members of the developer community to give feedback on the Google AI Edge Gallery experience. The app is under an Apache 2.0 license, meaning it can be used in most contexts — commercial or otherwise — without restriction. Topics AI Editor Think you know AI? Prove it.

    "title": "A guide to using Edits, Meta’s new CapCut rival for short-form video editing",
    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Meta recentlyreleased a new video editing appfor creators called Edits. The new app is designed to rival ByteDance’s CapCut, a popular short-form video-editing app used by many creators. Meta first shared that it was working on Edits back in January after ByteDance-owned CapCut was removed from U.S. app stores when the TikTok ban momentarily went into effect. Although the app has since come back online and is available to download, TikTok’s future in the U.S. remains uncertain, so Meta is ready to capitalize on CapCut’s possible absence in the future with its new Edits app. We’ve created this guide to walk you through the app and the different features it offers, and we provide an overview of how it compares to CapCut. Edits is available to download on bothiOSandAndroid. Once you download the app and open it, you will be asked to log in with your Instagram account. From there you will see five main tabs: Ideas, Inspiration, Projects, Record, and Insights. The Ideas tab offers creators a space to jot down ideas for new videos and save reels to a collection, and the Inspiration tab features a hub for discovering trending audios and other popular reels. The Projects tab is where creators can store and revisit the videos they currently have in progress. This tab is also where creators can upload videos from their phone’s camera roll. The Record tab lets creators start filming video content right within Edits. Lastly, the Insights tab gives creators an overview of how their content is performing by surfacing metrics like views, reach, and follower counts. Green screen:Replace and edit the background of your videos with one tap. Timeline:Precisely arrange and adjust clips. Captions:Add automatic captions to your videos in multiple languages. Audio library:Add music from Instagram’s library to your videos. Cutouts:Isolate specific objects with precision tracking. Animate:Turn static images into videos using AI. Apply all:Apply filters, effects, transitions, and adjustments to all of your clips at once. Timeline frame rate selector:Convert your video to the frame rate you want in order to enhance playback smoothness. Alignment guides:Ensure viewers can see the important parts of your video when posted and accurately position text, emoji, or other elements. Beat markers:Add auto-detected beat markers to help you align clips, text, and overlays with audio when editing. Filters:Choose from 30 different filter options to add a unique look to your videos. Transitions:Choose from 30 different transitions to connect different video clips in a seamless way. While both Edits and CapCut are great options for editing short-form videos, there are some differences between the two services. CapCut offers more robust editing options, including AI features, than Edits does. Of course, this can be expected since Edits is a lot newer than CapCut. Meta will likely continue to build out Edits over the next months and years, so we can expect to see more advanced functionality in the future. It’s also worth noting that CapCut has a more extensive music library compared to Edits. Another difference is the fact that Edits currently doesn’t have a subscription offering (for now), but CapCut does. While CapCut offers a free version, some of its advanced tools are locked behind a paid subscription. Edits is free to use, but this will likely change in the future, as Instagram headAdam Mosserihas statedthat later versions of Edits may include paid features. In addition, while CapCut is available on the web, Edits is mobile-only. However, this could change in the future. Topics Consumer News Reporter Aisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "title": "Will Starmer's military review match the threats we're told we face?",
    "article_text": "Down a discreet road, on the fringes of a quiet home counties commuter town, is a set of grey buildings worth many hundreds of millions of pounds. In one, behind a secure fence, a handful of workers are on shift this weekend, making Storm Shadow missiles by hand. Each one is worth hundreds of thousands, the product of months of work, made of myriad components. Storm Shadows, like mini-aircraft, have been flying in the skies above Ukraine with a range of 250km (155 miles). They're part of the UK's backing of President Volodymyr Zelensky's efforts to keep Russia's Vladimir Putin at bay. The factory is calm and quiet - a world away from the fire and fury of the conflict on the edge of Europe. We've been allowed to see the missiles up close because the government is warming up for a big moment on Monday, when the prime minister will unveil amajor review of the military, the strategic defence review. Sir Keir Starmer has already said we are living in a \"new, dangerous era\", with a malevolent Russia and its friends hungry to disrupt and damage the West - while the White House is less eager to cough up to defend Europe. So will this review meet the risk that politicians tell us we face? We have gone through many years in which defence has been a lower priority for politicians and the public, largely because peace has prevailed in the UK. Since the end of the Cold War, a former minister says, \"we've been going round the world making sure we are reassuring allies, and there have been some very nasty wars in the Middle East\". But at the same time, the proportion of cash spent on defence has shrunk and the ability of the military to fight \"peer-on-peer\" wars has decreased. There are well known worries about stockpiles, a lack of munitions, and weapons being decommissioned that haven't yet been replaced. We now have a smaller armed forces - one that is \"hollowed out\", in the words of the current Defence Secretary John Healey, who we'll talk to on this week'sSunday with Laura Kuenssberg. Yet now, the government certainly confronts a more alarming picture - and there is a concerted focus on trying to address it. With conflict in Ukraine, a former minister says \"if you are going to credibly deter Russia, you need to persuade them, actually, if they mess around with Nato, they lose\". And that's before you consider that Donald Trump is a lot less willing than his predecessor to pay for other countries' defence, andChina's \"imminent\" threat to Taiwanhighlighted by US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth overnight. So what will next week's review suggest for the here and now, as well as the long term future? First, a caveat. The report is not published in full until Monday; it will be important to examine what it recommends. But the broad outline seems pretty clear: expect it to underline the importance of nuclear weapons and the UK's commitment to Nato, the Western defence alliance. There will be an emphasis on modernising the forces, not least becausethe war in Ukraine has demonstrated the importance of dronesand adapting existing kit quickly to lethal effect. We have clues from the announcements ministers have already made about technology and protecting the country from cyber attacks. The review, and ministers' messaging alongside it, will stress a greater need, in their view, for the public to play a part inprotecting the country. A government source says \"it's about making sure we think more about national resilience\", and a \"whole society approach\" towards threats. That is expected to include announcements about British industry creating more defence kit, expanding the cadet forces, and bolstering the number of men and women in the military reserves. There have been suggestions of a new civilian force - a new \"Home Guard\" - to protect infrastructure such as power plants, airports and telecommunications hubs. As another source says, \"there is a lot of talk about resilience, a push across the whole of society, the kind we have only done twice in our history, in World War One and World War Two\". This is \"not telling everyone they need to go out and build an Anderson shelter,\" jokes a former minister, but No 10 does want to usher in a new way of thinking among ordinary people geared towards keeping the country safe. Whether any of these potential recommendations will change much is up for debate, though. While government sources claim it will be \"transformative\" and hail a \"bold new vision\", others are playing down its likely impact. A former Conservative defence minister suggests ministers have \"massively overegged\" what the review will really promise, and \"we'll get a lot of things that sound great, but not many things that actually get moving\". A source involved in discussion around the review explained: \"What will change? Substantively not much - there is a rhetorical change towardsNato and Europe, but it's not a major change in terms of capability - it's all pretty marginal.\" The Ministry of Defence's permanent secretary David Williams has already said in public that it won't be until the autumn that we'll get specific details about exactly what is going to be ordered, spent and when. The PM has already sped up his plans to spend 2.5% of the size of Britain's economy on defence by 2027, rather than the initial timescale of 2029. UK Defence Secretary John Healey said on Saturday there was\"no doubt\" UK defence spending would rise to 3% of GDP by 2034at the latest. All that doesn't make the problems go away. The first is that after inflation and public sector pay rises, insiders question if 2.5% is enough to meet current defence plans - let alone the government's increasing ambition. Existing, expensive plans will remain - such as recapitalising the army, investing in nuclear, carrying on with theAukus submarine dealwith America and Australia, and theglobal combat air programme to build a next-generation fighter jet- which will gobble up billions of pounds now and for years to come. Second, the chancellor doesn't want to change her self imposed rules on borrowing and spending again, so as we talked about last week, money is tight in government. Defence is already a relative winner in thereview of government spendingthat's coming down the tracks. Third, the PM faces a political dilemma  - a pound on defence is a pound that doesn't go on health or welfare, and you won't find huge numbers of Labour MPs who stood for Parliament with the goal of giving more to the military, while trying to reduce benefit payments. Defence has long been one of the PM's big signals to the party and country that he is different to his predecessor Jeremy Corbyn. His version of Labour is comfortable appearing in front of Union Jacks, posing with soldiers or clambering in and out of submarines, though not all of his colleagues are. And fourth, fundamentally there is a political question about whether a promise of big cash coming in the 2030s matches increasinglyurgent rhetoric about the dangers we facewhich other allies are using to speed up defence spending more dramatically. At the end of June, Nato allies will gather for a major summit in The Hague. Nato's secretary general Mark Rutte has already made abundantly clear he wants the UK and its allies to be spending at least 3% on defence as soon as possible. The US, the country with the biggest cheque book, wants countries to aim for as much as 5% and if it's to be less, to stop claiming that pensions, health care for veterans or other costs, can be counted as defence spending. I'm told the summit could set a new target for Nato allies to spend 3.5% on defence either by 2032 or by 2035. If that happens, the UK could seem to be lagging behind. As a senior figure warns, for some Nato members, spending 3.5% of GDP on defence is a already a \"done deal\" - but the UK is still \"hopping around\". Almost before the ink is dry on the defence review, the government's critics may be able to warn it falls short. Perhaps then, the government's approach is as far as it is currently financially or politically possible to go. But with the PM warning defence should be the \"central organising principle\" of government - the first thought in the morning and the last at night - threats to our security might evolve faster than politics.

A government source says the defence secretary has \"full confidence\" in Labour's plans to increase defence spending. The strategic defence review, announced by the government last July, will be published on Monday. As the chancellor prepares to set government budgets for future years, who are likely winners and losers? Defence secretary John Healey has told the BBC the UK will pay its \"fair share\" but wants a say in decisions.",

    "title": "Ncuti Gatwa regenerates into Billie Piper as he leaves Doctor Who",
    "article_text": "Warning: This article contains spoilers. Ncuti Gatwa regenerated into Billie Piper in the series finale of Doctor Who on Saturday night. He left the role after playing the iconic character for two series. Piper, who previously played the Doctor's assistant, Rose Tyler, said the opportunity to \"step back on that Tardis one more time was just something I couldn't refuse\". In a press release, the BBC said: \"Just how and why she [Billie Piper] is back remains to be seen…\" The credit at the end of the programme said: \"Ncuti Gatwa as the Doctor. Jodie Whittaker as the Doctor. And introducing Billie Piper\". In a statement, Piper said she was delighted to be returning to the show, but that fans would have to \"wait and see\" what her character did next. The new doctor has usually been introduced on the show through regeneration, but Piper's statement does not make it clear whether she will be the 16th doctor. If confirmed as the new Doctor, Piper will be the third woman to have played the role, following Whittaker and Jo Martin. Piper added: \"It's no secret how much I love this show, and I have always said I would love to return to the Whoniverse as I have some of my best memories there, so to be given the opportunity to step back on that Tardis one more time was just something I couldn't refuse, but who, how, why and when, you'll just have to wait and see.\" Moments after the series finale aired, Piper shared a series of photos on Instagram, including two selfies of her holding a white rose and two of her playing the character Rose. The caption under the photos read: \"A rose is a rose is a rose !!!\" Doctor Who showrunner and head writer Russell T Davies said: \"Billie once changed the whole of television, back in 2005, and now she's done it again! \"It's an honour and a hoot to welcome her back to the Tardis, but quite how and why and who is a story yet to be told. \"After 62 years, the Doctor's adventures are only just beginning!\" Piper first appeared in the show in 2005 when it returned to TV for the first time since the 1990s, appearing alongside Christopher Eccleston and then David Tennant. Piper, a former pop star who later turned to acting, has enjoyed a successful career on TV and on the stage. After playing Rose Tyler for two full series in 2005 and 2006, she won acclaim for roles including sex worker Belle de Jour in Secret Diary of a Call Girl and the lead character in Sky Atlantic's I Hate Suzie. In 2017 she won a best actress award at the Olivier's, for herperformance in the playYerma. And most recently was nominated for a Bafta for playing TV producer Sam McAlister in Scoop, a drama about Prince Andrew's disastrous interview on Newsnight in 2019. After Peter Capaldi stepped down as the 12th Doctor, Piper told the BBC that while she thought that a woman should take over the role,she was doubtful about playing the part herself. Capaldi went on to be replaced by Whittaker. Gatwa only played the Doctor for 18 months, appearing in two series. It's the shortest time an actor has played the character since Christopher Eccleston left the show after one series in 2005. In a statement, Gatwa said of his departure: \"You know when you get cast, at some point you are going to have to hand back that sonic screwdriver and it is all going to come to an end, but nothing quite prepares you for it.\" He added: \"There are no words to describe what it feels like to be cast as the Doctor, nor are there words to explain what it feels like to be accepted into this iconic role that has existed for over 60 years and is truly loved by so many across the globe.\" Gatwa thanked \"Whoniverse\" fans for \"welcoming me in, and making this such a touching experience. \"I've loved every minute of it, but now is the time to hand over the keys to that beloved blue box and let someone else take control and enjoy it every bit as much as I have. \"I'll truly miss it, and forever be grateful to it, and everyone that has played a part in my journey as the Doctor.\" There is still uncertainty about when the drama will return. Russell T Davies has previously said that no decision would be made on commissioning the next series until this series had been broadcast. The last two series of the show have been co-produced and broadcast internationally by streaming service Disney+, which has given the time travel drama a bigger budget. Discussions about whether the BBC and Disney wish to renew that deal, or whether other options should be explored, are likely to take some time. For a new series to be ready for 2026, production would need to get under way relatively soon. So at the moment a new series or a special starring Billie Piper before 2027 looks unlikely. Scenes from TV shows such as Silo, Grantchester and Prime Target were shot at County Hall. Visit Jersey boss says she is delighted Bergerac will be returning to the island. The Slow Horses actor recently signed up for a Netflix adaptation of Jane Austen's classic novel. The four-part series tells the story of Daniel Brennan, a deaf man on a journey of revenge. It seems the fictional Devon town of Shipton Abbott is becoming a more dangerous place to live.",

    "title": "New-look PSG make history on emotional night for Luis Enrique",
    "article_text": "This video can not be played Five star PSG smash sorry Inter to win Champions League Luis Enrique wept tears of joy and emotion as Paris St-Germain delivered the performance of a lifetime to win the Champions League for the first time on a remarkable night in Munich. And, asPSG outclassed Inter Milan for a historic 5-0 victory, brilliant teenager Desire Doue confirmed his status as one half of a new duo of young superstars - alongside Barcelona's Lamine Yamal - who have the genius to dominate the game for years to come. The poignant human story was PSG coach Luis Enrique, who became only the sixth coach to win this tournament with two different clubs after his triumph with Barcelona in 2015. The sporting story was one of the finest team displays in the history of this tournament, in this and its previous guise of the European Cup, with generational teenage talent Doue as its centrepiece. On the most important night of a career, Doue made the biggest stage in European club football his playground. This was also a win heavy with significance and meaning for 55-year-old Asturian Luis Enrique, beyond the glory of the brutal beauty of this PSG triumph that finally brought the giant Champions League trophy to The City Of Light. The man who has transformed PSG has spoken about how he helped his daughter Xana plant a Barcelona flag in the centre circle after that 2015 triumph over Juventus in Berlin. He said he hoped he might make the same gesture here in her memory after she died from a rare form of bone cancer aged nine in 2019. In the afterglow of victory, he pulled on a t-shirt bearing an image of himself and his daughter planting a PSG flag. And then, in a moment of raw emotion, PSG's \"Ultras\" unfurled their own tribute - a giant flag emblazoned with an image of father and daughter, in the French club's shirt, planting a flag. It was a wonderful gesture on a joyful night for PSG in Munich, when all their agonies as they chased the Champions League were washed away in one of the greatest displays any team has produced in a European final. \"I'm very happy. It was very emotional at the end with the banner from the fans for my family. But I always think about my daughter,\" said Luis Enrique. \"Since day one, I said I wanted to win important trophies, and Paris had never won the Champions League. We did it for the first time. It's a great feeling to make many people happy.\" Is Champions League defeat end of an era for Inter? It suited PSG, but was new Champions League format a success? 'Footballing architect' - how Luis Enrique led PSG to Champions League glory PSG's fans unveiled a flag in tribute to coach Luis Enrique and daughter Xana - who died aged nine in 2019 - after the Champions League win And the inspiration was 19-year-old Doue, now a fully-fledged superstar, a far cry from the vulnerable youngster who only lasted 64 minutes before being replaced in the 2-0 loss at Arsenal in October. It was after 63 minutes here on this humid night in Munich that Doue applied another flourish to a magical performance, steering home his second goal and PSG's third after making the first for Achraf Hakimi in the 12th minute then adding the second eight minutes later. When he was taken off moments after scoring his second, football had watched a generational talent who will grace the game for years to come. He is only the third teenager to score in a Champions League final after Patrick Kluivert for Ajax in 1995 and Carlos Alberto for Porto nine years later. The forward was also the first player to be involved in three goals in a Champions League final, with an assist and two himself. And, at 19 years and 362 days, Doue became the youngest player to score two goals in a European Cup or Champions League final, overtaking EusÃ©bio who was 20 years and 97 days old when he did the same for Benfica against Real Madrid in 1962. He was part of a complete PSG performance, their incremental improvement throughout the Champions League, when they took a swathe to the Premier League's elite by beating Manchester City then knocking out Liverpool, Aston Villa and Arsenal in the knockout stage, climaxed in the most stunning, emphatic fashion. If Inter Milan had a plan, PSG gave them no opportunity to implement it. Doue smiled broadly as he lifted the trophy, a career in its infancy but with golden years ahead. And even though 17-year-old Yamal was stopped at the Champions League semi-final stage by Inter, it does not take a leap of the imagination to see the young Barcelona forward and Doue as the shining lights contesting the game's major prizes in years to come. This video can not be played 'Coming of age' - Doue announces himself to the world As they have done throughout this Champions League campaign, PSG's \"Ultras\" unfurled a giant tifo with a message for the players they hoped would finally put them at the pinnacle of European football. It read: \"Ensemble, Nous Sommes Invincibles\" â Together, We Are Invincible. And they were here, the notion that the youngest team in the Champions League might falter against the oldest was exploded from the first whistle. This was football played at another level, pace and intensity matched by the highest quality. PSG looked younger and faster as the game went on while this experienced Inter side grew older before the very eyes. The statistics built a monument to just how good PSG were. The five-goal victory margin was the biggest in any European Cup or Champions League final. Even after Doue went off, the relentless punishment continued as Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and 19-year-old substitute Senny Mayulu added further goals. PSG were the best team in the Champions League. The competition got fitting winners, but rarely have winners played like this, sweeping aside supposedly formidable opposition in a manner that will live forever in the memory of all who witnessed it. The final scoreline almost did a kindness to a bedraggled Inter, such was PSG's dominance and the sheer number of chances they created. This was thrilling, progressive football that will set the standard for every side in Europe who have designs on the Champions League. This video can not be played How PSG's 'perfect' gameplan blew Inter away All done after a switch of strategy away from the \"bling bling\" days of France forward Kylian Mbappe, Brazil's Neymar and Argentina's Lionel Messi. What must Mbappe have felt watching this? Luis Enrique seized his chance, convinced club president Nasser al-Khelaifi and football advisor Luis Campos that he could build a better PSG side in the post-Mbappe era, and there could be no more compelling proof than this. \"This season is best season ever and we are so proud,\" Al-Khelaifi told CBS. \"We are building the team for the future. Whatever the outcome was today, we are not going to change. The real work starts today. We need to be humble and down to earth. \"I am so proud, for the fans, for France. I think it is amazing for France, not just for Paris, because France deserves better. We have a good league, good historic clubs and we are sure it is going to be getting better. \"It has been hard. We have been criticised a lot. We have been trying to work for French football and people were criticising what we were doing. It really hurts of course, but for me I was focused on our goal. \"This year was not planned as the year. Today, thanks God that the team proved we have the best manager in the world, the best coach in the world, the best players and amazing fans.\" Luis Enrique joins his wife Elena Cullell and children after PSG's Champions League win against Inter Milan in Munich It was, quite simply, one of the all-time great performances in a European final. Chris Sutton, in Munich, told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"Luis Enrique was the final piece in the jigsaw to get them here. In terms of top European managers of all time, he has to be in that category. \"The age profile of the team, we mentioned Doue, Vitinha, Joao Neves, Willian Pacho and Hakimi. It's where they go from here. \"This is a team that are just at the start of their evolution. The main thing for me is the work ethic. This is a team who are prepared to run and they put the graft in and that's why they were successful.\" And former Premier League defender Nedum Onuoha told BBC Sport: \"It's the best performance I can remember in a Champions League final, or pretty much in any final.\" Watch How to Win the Champions League on BBC iPlayer Latest Champions League table Champions League scores & fixtures Follow the latest Champions League news Listen to the latest Football Daily podcast Get football news sent straight to your phone Watch highlights of every Champions League game from 22:00 on Wednesday on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app. There will also be a Champions League Match of the Day on BBC One on Wednesday, from 22:40 to 00:00.

    "title": "Disposable vape ban begins but will teens quit?",
    "article_text": "The ban on the sale of single-use disposable vapes will come into force on Sunday across the UK, aimed at protecting children's health and the environment. It means shops and supermarkets will no longer be able to stock them -  but they can still sell rechargeable or refillable devices. Disposable vapes have been cited as a key driver in the rise in youth vaping, while every week five million vapes are thrown away. Ministers predict it will have a significant impact but health experts say further regulation is needed to tackle youth vaping. Retailers in England and Wales breaching the ban face a £200 fine for the first offence with potentially unlimited fines or jail for those who repeatedly re-offend. The ban was first announced for England and Wales by the previous Conservative government but the law was not enacted before last summer's general election. Labour then pushed ahead with it. Scotland and Northern Ireland have introduced their own bans, timed to coincide with the one in England and Wales. Vape use has risen rapidly over the last decade with 9% of the British public now buying and using e-cigarettes. Latest figures suggest about one in four vapers use the disposable versions,  although that proportion has fallen since the ban was announced. And while it is illegal to sell vapes to anyone under 18, disposable vapes, often sold in smaller, more colourful packaging than refillable ones, have been cited as an important factor in the rise of youth vaping. Currently one in seven 18 to 24-year-olds vape but have never smoked. Vaping is substantially less harmful than smoking but it has not been around for long enough for its long-term risks to be known, according to the NHS. The environmental impact is considerable. Single-use vapes are difficult to recycle and typically end up in landfill where their batteries can leak harmful chemicals like battery acid, lithium, and mercury into the environment, the government said. Batteries thrown into household waste also cause hundreds offires in bin lorries and waste-processing centres every year. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs estimates almost five million single-use vapes were either littered or thrown into general waste each week last year. Environment minister Mary Creagh said: \"For too long, single-use vapes have blighted our streets as litter and hooked our children on nicotine. That ends today. \"The government calls time on these nasty devices.\" But Action on Smoking and Health chief executive Hazel Cheeseman questioned what impact the ban would have, pointing out new refillable vape kits were coming on to the market that look and cost similar to the single-use ones. She said it would not be until the Tobacco and Vapes Bill, which includes powers to regulate marketing, branding and advertising, came into power that the issue of youth vaping could be truly tackled. \"Their appeal is driven by bright colours, wide availability and cheap prices,\" she said. \"The new regulations will hopefully help to address the environmental impact, but government will need further regulations to address the appeal of products to teenagers.\" She said this was very much a balancing act as vapes were an important tool to help people quit. \"Vaping is very much less harmful than smoking and is the most popular aid to quitting in the UK,\" she added. John Dunne, of the UK Vaping Industry Association, said bans were \"not the answer\". He said he was concerned that a black market in single-use vapes could develop and some people may be tempted to return to smoking cigarettes. \"Disposables have played a huge role in reducing smoking levels amongst adults to record low levels. It's why we are seeing stockpiling in the lead up to the ban,\" he added. Scott Butler, executive director of Material Focus, an independent not-for-profit organisation, said that he was still concerned that vapes are still difficult to recycle and reuse. He said customers and businesses should demand sustainable options. \"Given the rampant binning and littering that we already see, will we see any behaviour change? Only if producers, importers and retailers step up and meet their long existing legal obligations to provide and pay for takeback and recycling,\" he said. The comedian says he hopes to destigmatise mental health issues by being open about his own experiences. Migraines are one of the most complex neurological disorders. What is the science behind the latest hack? The business hopes to add to the £400,000 that has already been collected. Seed oils like canola and sunflower oil have attracted controversial claims about harmful effects in recent times. Is there any truth to them? A ban on the sale of disposable vapes aims to curb littering and cut down youth vaping.",

    "title": "Silent acts of resistance and fear under Russian occupation in Ukraine",
    "article_text": "A fifth of Ukrainian territory is now under Russian control, and for Ukrainians living under occupation there seems little chance that any future deal to end the war will change that. Three Ukrainians in different Russian-controlled cities have told the BBC of the pressures they face, from being forced to accept a Russian passport to the risks of carrying out small acts of resistance. We are not using their real names for their own safety, and will call them Mavka, Pavlo and Iryna. The potential dangers are the same, whether in Mariupol or Melitopol, seized by Russia in the full-scale invasion in 2022, or in Crimea which was annexed eight years before. Mavka chose to stay in Melitopol when the Russians invaded her city on 25 February 2022, \"because it is unfair that someone can just come to my home and take it out\". She has lived there since birth, midway between the Crimean peninsula and the regional capital Zaporizhzhia. In recent months she has noticed a ramping up of not only a strict policy of \"Russification\" in the city, but of an increased militarisation of all spheres of life, including in schools. She has shared pictures of a billboard promoting conscription to young locals, a school notebook with Putin's portrait on it, and photos and a video of pupils wearing Russian military uniforms instead of the school outfits - boys and girls - and performing military education tasks. Some 200km (125 miles) along the coast of the sea of Azov, and much closer to the Russian border, the city of Mariupol feels as if it has been \"cut off\" from the outside world, according to Pavlo. This key port and hub of Ukraine's steel industry was captured after a devastating siege and bombardment that lasted almost three months in 2022. Russian citizenship is now obligatory if you want to work or study or have an urgent medical help, Pavlo says. \"If someone's child, let's say, refuses to sing the Russian anthem at school in the morning, the FSB [Russia's security service] will visit their parents, they will be 'pencilled in' and then anything can happen.\" Pavlo survived the siege despite being shot six times, including to his head. Now that he has recuperated, he feels he cannot leave because of elderly relatives. \"Most of those who stayed in Mariupol or returned, did so to help their elderly parents or their sick grandparents, or because of their flat,\" he tells me over the phone after midnight so no-one will overhear. The biggest preoccupation in Mariupol is holding on to your home, as most of the property damaged in the Russian bombardment has been demolished, and the cost of living and unemployment has surged. \"I'd say 95% of all talk in the city is about property: how to claim it back, how to sell it. You'll hear people talk about it while queuing to buy some bread, on your way to a chemist, in the food market, everywhere,\" he says. Crimea has been under occupation since Vladimir Putin annexed the peninsula in 2014, when Russia's war in Ukraine began. Iryna decided to remain, also to care for an elderly relative but also because she did not want to leave \"her beautiful home\". All signs of Ukrainian identity have been banned in public, and Iryna says she cannot speak Ukrainian in public any more, \"as you never know who can tell the authorities on you\". Children at nursery school in Crimea are told to sing the Russian anthem every morning, even the very youngest. All the teachers are Russian, most of them wives of soldiers who have moved in from Russia. Iryna occasionally puts on her traditional, embroideredvyshyvankatop when she has video calls with friends elsewhere on the peninsula. \"It helps us to keep our spirits high, reminding us about our happy life before the occupation\". But the risks are high, even for wearing a vyshyvanka. \"They might not shoot you straight away, but you can simply disappear afterwards, silently,\" she declares. She speaks of a Ukrainian friend being questioned by police because Russian neighbours, who came to Crimea in 2014, told police he had illegal weapons. \"Of course he didn't. Luckily they let him go in the end, but it's so frightening.\" Iryna complains that she cannot go out on her own even for coffee \"because solders can put a gun at you and say something abusive or order you to please them\". Resistance in Ukraine's occupied cities is dangerous, and it often comes in small acts of defiance aimed at reminding residents that they are not alone. In Melitopol, Mavka talks of being part of a secret female resistance movement calledZla Mavka(Angry Mavka) \"to let people know that Ukrainians don't agree with the occupation, we didn't call for it, and we will never tolerate it\". The network is made up of women and girls in \"pretty much all occupied cities\", according to Iryna, although she cannot reveal its size or scale because of the potential dangers for its members. Mavka describes her role in running the network's social media accounts, which document life under occupation and acts like placing Ukrainian symbols or leaflets in public places \"to remind other Ukrainians that they are not alone\", or even riskier practices. \"Sometimes we also put a laxative in alcohol and baked goods for the Russian soldiers, as a 'welcome pack',\" she says. Punishment for that kind of act, which the BBC is unable to verify, would be severe. Russia's occupation authorities treat the Ukrainian language or anything related to Ukraine as extremist, says Mavka. Ukrainians are well aware of what happened to journalist Viktoriia Roshchyna, 27, whodisappeared while investigating allegations of torture prisonsin eastern Ukraine in 2023. Russian authorities told her family she had died in custody in September 2024. Her body was returned earlier this month, with several organs removed and clear signs of torture. Silent disappearance is what Mavka fears most: \"When suddenly nobody can find out where you are or what's happened to you.\" Her network has developed a set of tasks for new joiners to pass to avoid infiltration, and so far they have managed to avoid cyber attacks. For now they are waiting and watching: \"We cannot take up arms and fight back against the occupier right now, but we want at least to show that pro-Ukrainian population is here, and it will also be here\". She and others in Melitopol are following closely what is happening in Kyiv, \"because it is important for us to know whether Kyiv is ready to fight for us. Even small steps matter\". \"We have a rollercoaster of moods here. Many are worried documents might get signed that, God forbid, leave us under Russian occupation for even longer. Because we know what Russia will do here.\" The worry for Mavka and people close to her is that if Kyiv does agree a ceasefire it could mean Russia pursuing the same policy as in Crimea, erasing Ukrainian identity and repressing the population. \"They've been already replacing locals with their people. But people here are still hopeful, we will continue our resistance, we'll just have to be more creative\". Unlike Mavka, Pavlo believes the war must end, even if it means losing his ability to return to Ukraine. \"Human life is of the greatest value… but there are certain conditions for a ceasefire and not everyone might agree with them as it raises a question, why have all those people died then during the past three years? Would they feel abandoned and betrayed?\" Pavlo is wary of talking, even via an encrypted line, but adds: \"I don't envy anyone involved in this decision-making process. It won't be simple, black and white. Iryna fears for Crimea's next generation who have grown up in an atmosphere of violence and, she says, copy their fathers who have returned from Russia's war against Ukraine. She shows me her bandaged cat, and says a child on her street shot it with a rubber bullet. \"For them it was fun. These kids are not taught to build peace, they are taught to fight. It breaks my heart.\" Another 30 people are reportedly injured after the train derailed following the bridge collapse. Data shows that Russian fossil fuel revenues are three times higher than aid allocated to Ukraine. A Russian distributor orders booksellers to pull works by well-known authors, in an apparent act of censorship. The US president's remarks on Wednesday come as Russia intensifies its attacks on Ukraine. A brand new statue of the Soviet dictator Josef Stalin has been unveiled at a Metro station in Moscow.",

    "title": "The fallout from Trump's war on Harvard will long outlast his presidency",
    "article_text": "Donald Trump has had a busy seven days. On Monday, he threatened to redirect $3bn in Harvard research funding to vocational schools. On Tuesday, the White House sent a letter to federal agencies, instructing them to review the approximately $100m in contracts the government has awarded Harvard and \"find alternative vendors\" where possible. On Wednesday, he had more to say on the matter still. \"Harvard's got to behave themselves,\" he told reporters gathered in the Oval Office. \"Harvard is treating our country with great disrespect, and all they're doing is getting in deeper and deeper and deeper.\" When combined with other administration attempts – freezing more than $3bn in research grants and suspending foreign students from enrolling in Harvard – Trump's directives represent a frontal attack on one of America's most prestigious, and wealthy, institutions of higher education. Even if court challenges overrule some of these actions – some have already been put on hold – the impact is being felt across the landscape of American higher education. \"They're doing multiple things every single day, some of those things are sneaking through,\" says Greg Wolfson, president of the American Association of University Professors. \"But more importantly, they're changing the culture. They're changing people.\" At Harvard's commencement ceremonies on Thursday, students said there was a \"palpable concern\" on campus. \"People sort of knew Trump was trying some of these moves but [they were] shocked when it happens,\" admits one graduate, a British national who requested anonymity because he was concerned public comments could threaten his US work visa. \"It feels like the nuclear option.\" \"If this can happen to Harvard it can happen to any university in the country,\" he adds. But the repercussions of this apparent Harvard-Trump fight run far deeper than the management of a single Ivy League university. Could the measures Trump is taking mark, as some suggest, the latest, albeit most ambitious, step by conservatives to erode some of the traditional pillars of support for the Democratic Party? If that is the case, the campus has become a pivotal battle in shaping America's cultural and political landscape. Trump and his administration have offered various explanations for their actions, including a perceived lack of conservatives among the ranks of Harvard's professors, along with suggestions of admitting too many foreign students and financial links to China. But according to the White House, the most immediate cause has been the university's apparent failure to address antisemitism on campus, in the wake of anti-Israel protests at universities across the US since the start of the Gaza war. In December 2023, three prominent university presidents - including the then-president of Harvard, Claudine Gay - struggled to answer whether calling for the \"genocide of Jews\" violated their student conduct codes on bullying and harassment, sparking a firestorm of criticism. Dr Gay, who was asked the question at a congressional hearing about antisemitism on US college campuses, answered that it depended on the context. She later apologised, telling the student newspaper: \"When words amplify distress and pain, I don't know how you could feel anything but regret.\" On the campaign trail last year, Trump promised to cut off federal funding and government accreditation for colleges that he said were engaging in \"antisemitic propaganda\". Once Trump returned to the White House in January, he began following through on this. Several universities - including Columbia, which saw some of the most high profile protests - agreed to sweeping changes in campus security rules and closer supervision of its Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies departments. In April, Harvard released the results of a university task force review (commissioned before Trump's election) of antisemitism and anti-Muslim prejudice on its own campus. It found that many Jewish and Muslim students faced bias, exclusion and alienation from the university curriculum and its community. However, the administration's demands go well beyond calls to address antisemitism. In a letter to the university, its \"Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism\" laid out a laundry list of changes that Harvard must make, including terminating diversity programmes, reforming admissions and hiring, screening foreign students for views hostile to \"American values\", and expanding and protecting \"viewpoint diversity\" among students and faculty. Trump's shock-and-awe strategy of rapid and aggressive pressure has stunned many in higher education, who never imagined the scope of the demands or the force behind them. \"It's not about higher education,\" argues Mr Wolfson. \"Higher education is one of the levers they see as critical to transforming our society.\" But the potential for a long-term transformation could largely depend on whether the majority of American universities choose to accommodate the administration's demands - or whether it stands and fights, as Harvard is trying to do. While Harvard has been the most prominent target of the administration's ire, and the most visible in its resistance, it is just one of many high-profile American universities that has received funding cuts or been subject of investigations. Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania have reported that the administration has suspended hundreds of millions of dollars in their research grants. The Department of Education has launched investigations of 10 universities for alleged antisemitism - and warned dozens of others that they could face similar inquiries. It is also investigating 52 universities for illegal race-based programmes. To some, this all amounts to an across-the-board war on elite higher education by the Trump administration in an effort to reshape universities in a more conservative-friendly image. To others, this is no bad thing. \"Universities are not about the pursuit of knowledge, they're about the forceful pushing of a left-wing world view,\" Charlie Kirk, founder of the conservative group Turning Point USA, said in a Fox News interview last month. \"We're here to shake it up.\" Many on the right have long viewed American college campuses as hotbeds of liberal indoctrination, whether it has taken the form of left-wing anti-war radicalism in the 1960s, \"political correctness\" of the 1990s, Occupy Wall Street anti-capitalism of the 2000s or the Black Lives Matter movement and anti-Israel demonstrations in recent years. Polling has illustrated a certain divide in beliefs between those who have and haven't attended college. In a recent survey by the polling company Civiqs, non-college graduates were split on the job Trump is doing in office, with 49% disapproving and 47% approving. College graduates, on the other hand, had a significantly different view, as 58% disapproved of Trump's performance in office versus only 38% who approved. \"I think a lot of this blowback is from the sense that they have become the universities of blue [Democratic] America, and that this is the consequence,\" says Rick Hess, senior fellow and director of education policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. In recent years, according to Mr Hess, American higher education has become more closely tied to the government and more reliant on government funding. He says that the new Trump team has simply adopted levers of control over higher education employed by recent Democratic administrations – including civil rights investigations, federal anti-discrimination laws and control over funding. \"In classic Trump form,\" he added, \"it's absolutely the case that these levers have been turned up to 11.\" And there are fewer procedural and legal safeguards than there were under the Joe Biden and Barack Obama presidencies. \"It's both an evolution and a revolution,\" says Mr Hess. But it is one, he argues, that universities have brought on themselves by being overtly political during Trump's first term and making elite school the face of American higher education. \"The price for collecting billions a year in tax dollars is that institutions should both honour the promises they make, such as enforcing civil rights law, and hew to a mission in which they explicitly serve the whole nation,\" says Mr Hess. Withholding federal funding from universities may be a new challenge for higher education, but to some this is just the latest in a long effort by conservatives to undercut key traditional pillars of liberal power. Through a combination of legislation and court rules, the influence of labour unions – which had provided the Democratic Party with volunteer personnel and funds – had diminished long before Trump succeeded in winning over white working-class voters in his three presidential runs. State-level lawsuit reforms have also curtailed the vast sums that trial lawyers could contribute to Democratic coffers. And ongoing efforts to shrink the government workforce – which reached a peak with Elon Musk's Doge reductions – have eroded another traditionally Democratic bloc. However, Mr Wolfson fears that something greater could be lost if some of the Trump administration's measures are enforced. \"The fact that we have multiracial, multicultural, multinational universities is a boon to our universities,\" he says. \"It creates really diverse communities, really diverse intellectual thought.\" Harvard - perhaps best known for its renowned law school - has turned the courts into its principle tool to resist Trump's pressure. On Thursday, a federal judge indefinitely suspended the administration's attempts to prohibit foreign students from receiving visas to attend the university. The university has also sued to prevent the Trump administration from terminating more than $2.2bn in federal grants, although that case is pending. \"The trade-off put to Harvard and other universities is clear,\" Harvard wrote in its complaint filed with a Massachusetts federal court. \"Allow the government to micromanage your academic institution or jeopardise the institution's ability to pursue medical breakthroughs, scientific discoveries, and innovative solutions.\" Harvard's president, Alan Garber, has also defended his university, saying that Harvard would be \"firm\" in its commitments to education and truth, during an interview with NPR. \"Harvard is a very old institution, much older than the country,\" he continued. \"As long as there has been a United States of America, Harvard has thought that its role is to serve the nation.\" Trump, meanwhile, has shared strong words of his own. \"Harvard wants to fight,\" he said on Wednesday. \"They want to show how smart they are, and they're getting their ass kicked.\" Opinion polls show that Trump's political base supports his efforts, and the underlying message. Yet those same polls suggest a majority of the general population support American universities and don't approve of his proposed funding cuts. And opinion aside, the practicality of achieving such a fundamental reordering of America's system of higher education, even with all the tools at the federal government's disposal, is a daunting task. According to Mr Wolfson, however, repairing what he says is the damage being done to academic independence will be equally challenging. A growing number of members of the American Association of University Professors fear the consequences of expressing political views or conducting disfavoured research. \"The destruction is real,\" argues Mr Wolfson. \"Even if the courts step in, there will still be a massive undermining of the higher education project in this country due to Trump's reckless, reckless moves.\" Mr Hess, who has pushed for conservative education reform for years, is less concerned. He believes that Trump's chaotic, scattershot approach - including last week's comments - could end up less effective than a more methodical restructuring of American universities. \"This is all an ambitious experiment,\" Mr Hess said. \"Whether it's a strategy that's going to work is very much an open question.\" One thing seems clear, however. Even if American universities resist - or outlast - Trump's efforts, they are no longer insulated from the scorched-earth warfare of American politics. The walls of the ivory tower have been breached, regardless of whether one believes it is the barbarians - or liberators - at the gate.

    "title": "Bakery tourism: 'There's no limit on how far we'll travel for pastries'",
    "article_text": "Jessica Morgan-Helliwell admits she would rather meet her mates for a pastry than a pint. The 26-year-old is part of a growing number of people flocking to craft or artisan bakeries in pursuit of a flaky croissant. \"I do find myself these days more inclined to go for a coffee and a nice walk than going out and feeling a bit hungover the next day. I could be a pastry pilgrim,\" she said. Jessica and her mum, Louise, from Swansea, think nothing of travelling across the UK and beyond in pursuit of delicious bakes, photos and videos of which they then share online with their followers. Data suggests they are not alone in their passion for patisserie. The UK's bakery market is one of the largest in the food industry, worth £5.74bn, according to the Federation of Bakers. Open University research suggests the number ofsmall bakeries across the UK is on the rise, with nearly one in five founded since 2020. The mother and daughter's love of socialising over pastries and breads runs in the family. \"Both my great-grandpa and my great-great-grandpa had their own Italian cafes. My great-great-grandpa's cafe was in Llanelli and was called Sartori's,\" said Louise, 48. The pair admitted there was \"no limit\" on how far they would travel to sample a delicacy. Jess said she recently drove more than an hour to one bakery just to buy a sandwich. \"We're going to Marrakesh [in Morocco] in a couple of weeks and the first thing that I've looked at is the eateries,\" she added. At Pettigrew Bakery in Cardiff, David Le Masurier's team bakes and sells \"thousands of pastries a day\" to consumers like Jessica and Louise. David said he had \"absolutely\" seen bakery tourism positively impact his business, with international travellers building food spots into their trips, influenced by online trends and viral dishes. \"They have done their research. They've gone onto social media, they've seen images. They've read reviews. They're getting tips off TikTok,\" he said. \"People are literally walking in with their phones, particularly if English isn't their first language, and they're holding up pictures or showing us reels and saying: 'I want this'.\" Customers pay anything from £3.20 for a plain croissant to £4.50 for \"limited edition\" bakes - prices which David accepts are outside of the bracket of \"everyday products\". But he said between the ingredients, paying for his \"quality\" staff and making a profit, margins were \"very small\". \"Wages have increased quite dramatically just recently and that does translate straight to the prices that we have to pass on to the customer,\" he said. \"Running a food business is incredibly challenging.\" So what is it about flaky baked goods that makes people part with their hard-earned cash? Food and travel writer Ross Clarke said he believed that even in a cost-of-living crisis, people were inclined to splurge on small luxury items. It is a concept known as the lipstick effect, which suggests that people are more likely to spend on small luxury goods - like lipstick - during economic downturns. \"I think people are more inclined to maybe shell out £4.50 for a pain au chocolat if it's something special, because it's that little treat,\" he said. Ross said food tourism was a global phenomenon, referring to Iceland's famous ice cream tours, known as ísbíltúr. \"Gastro-tourism is booming, also eno-tourism, so wine,\" he said. \"People [are] going places purely for the food or the drink. \"What a lovely thing that you can go and support local businesses, hopefully, and eat in the great restaurants and try all of these amazing things. \"Wales is probably right up there with places that should push this as a big thing.\" French-born baker Astrid Roussel, who has lived in Newport, south Wales, for 17 years, said the local food scene had \"changed massively\" with people willing to pay for \"craft\" and \"quality\". \"People love to take pictures of pretty flaky pastries,\" she said. \"Yes, £4 for a croissant is good money to pay but it's an affordable luxury.\" Ms Roussel said when she first moved to Wales, finding good pastry was difficult. \"The quality of pastry I can get here now is better than in France,\" she said. Astrid said she was surprised by the number of people who travelled to south Wales for her baking workshops, which range from croissant-making to traditional French baguette classes. \"I had one woman come to my course from Canada. She was coming to Cardiff anyway but purposely picked when I had availability. I was like 'wow'!\" Migraines are one of the most complex neurological disorders. What is the science behind the latest hack? Seed oils like canola and sunflower oil have attracted controversial claims about harmful effects in recent times. Is there any truth to them? The social media chef tells the BBC the event was the \"best two days of the year\" for business. Cardiff centre Rory Jennings signs a new deal to stay at the Arms Park. The six boys all went to school in Newport with Max Turton, who took his life last year, aged 16.",

    "title": "Is Champions League defeat end of an era for Inter?",
    "article_text": "This video can not be played Five star PSG smash sorry Inter to win Champions League The end of an era for Inter Milan? AsParis St-Germain dismantled Inter 5-0to win their first Champions League - in the biggest final victory ever - it may have given the Nerazzuri a sense their own rebuild is needed this summer, albeit on a tighter budget. PSG's starting XI at Allianz Arena cost about Â£403m to assemble, compared to the roughly Â£137m Inter shelled out for their starting line-up. Inter boss Simone Inzaghi - whose own future is uncertain - put out the third oldest side in Champions League final history. Seven of the same starting XI that lost to Manchester City two years ago in Istanbul started again here. \"The players deserve great credit. They gave it their best shot. I wouldn't change these players for anything else,\" said Inzaghi after the game - while failing to guarantee he would still be in charge for next month's Fifa Club World Cup. But they just could not cope with the youth of PSG, as what had the potential of being a treble-winning season just weeks ago ends up as nothing. In Francesco Acerbi, Yann Sommer and Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Inter were the first side to start three players aged 36 or older in a European Cup or Champions League final. \"As the game progressed and the scoreline was progressing as well, they did look like one of the oldest teams in the competition,\" said BBC Match of the Day pundit Nedum Onuoha. So what now - and what could they learn from PSG? New-look PSG make history on emotional night for Luis Enrique It suited PSG, but was new Champions League format a success? 'Footballing architect' - how Luis Enrique led PSG to Champions League glory This video can not be played 'Last chance saloon' for Inzaghi and Inter Before this final, Inter president Giuseppe Marotta said owners Oaktree, who took over the club last year, wanted to go down a model of \"investments in slightly younger profiles who represent a real asset\". If they even had a sliver of doubt before the Munich showdown against PSG they will be even surer now. Inzaghi said: \"The club is strong. The club supports us. We've signed two players for next season.\" He was referring to Dinamo Zagreb and Croatia midfielder Petar Sucic, 21, and presumably Marseille's Brazilian winger Luis Henrique, 23 - who has been strongly linked. The boss continued: \"We know we have to sign more. The club supports us all the way.\" On Saturday, they just could not cope with PSG's pace, energy, movement and invention. Left-back Federico Dimarco was questionable for the opening two goals, although he had been hauled off long before PSG started notching up record numbers. And that was despite resting several of their starters for the final day of the Serie A season, even though the title was up for grabs. Inter did win their game that day, but Napoli took the title. \"Tonight we were more tired than PSG. We didn't play well. We weren't fresh,\" said Inzaghi. \"They were always there on the second balls. We played our league until Friday. They won their league a couple of months in advance.\" But they will have to find new clubs for some of their players if they do decide a refresh is in order. None of their starting XI in Munich is out of contract in the summer. With an average age of 30 years and 242 days, it was the third oldest starting XI in a Champions League final. PSG's players were, on average, five years and 146 days younger. But who will be doing the rebuild? Inzaghi, who led Inter to last season's Serie A title and two Italian Cups, is considered a highly talented coach, and would have probably have been seen as one of the elite had his side won this. He has been heavily linked to Saudi club Al-Hilal. In Friday's pre-match news conference inside Allianz Arena he did nothing to play down suggestions this could be his last game in charge. And after the game he did not commit either. \"It's not the right time to talk about my future,\" he said. \"We're extremely disappointed. It's awkward to talk about my future now. \"We'll be talking about the fact we won no silverware this year.\" When asked if he would be in charge for the Club World Cup, which starts next month, he said: \"I cannot answer this question now. I came here out of respect for you [media]. I'm hurting from a sporting point of view. \"Defeats make you stronger. We've been through this before. We lost in Istanbul and the following year we won the league.\" \"This is going to feel much worse for the Inter Milan players than their defeat to Manchester City in the 2023 final,\" said ex-City defender Onuoha. \"They played well in that game, but tonight they offered nothing. \"I think when you as a professional walk off the field like that, in a game where you haven't lost a player, I think it is a real cause for concern.\" Italian football journalist James Horncastle, speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, added: \"Inter felt that this was the only thing they were missing. \"Once again, they have to watch another team celebrating and jumping around and partying. \"They have won a lot but they have lost a lot. But that's just part of sport.\" Speaking about the defeat two years ago against City, Inzaghi added: \"We know defeats can make you stronger. Tonight's defeat hurts a lot just like the loss in Istanbul. They were two very different matches. \"We've been through this. We can get going again all together.\" Opponents PSG have just completed an overhaul of their own - although it was about egos and not ages. Kylian Mbappe, Lionel Messi and Neymar - a front three of players who all thought they were the star - have gone out the door in recent years. But Inter will not have the resources of PSGâs Qatari owners.

    "title": "Norrie beats Fearnley after firework disruption",
    "article_text": "Cameron Norrie has reached the French Open fourth round for the first time in his career Cameron Norrie maintained his focus to beat British rival Jacob Fearnley in a French Open third-round match disrupted by loud fireworks outside Paris St-Germain's stadium. Norrie, 29, was replaced by 23-year-old Fearnley as the British number two earlier this year, but laid down his authority in a 6-3 7-6 (7-1) 6-2 win. His reward is a meeting with former world number one Novak Djokovic in the last 16. Bangs were heard throughout the majority of the all-British match as PSG fans geared up for their football team's Champions League final against Inter Milan in Munich. \"It was hard managing the fireworks next door - that was the toughest part for both of us,\" said Norrie, who is ranked 81st in the world. \"I was putting my bag down and the umpire said, 'There's just a couple of fireworks. We'll just play on'. \"I was thinking it was just going to be a few in the warm-up, but it was at the most random times.\" Norrie - playing at his best level for a while after a couple of difficult seasons - used his experience to take control against his fellow Scot. The former world number eight managed to subdue French Open debutant Fearnley, who described the noise as \"brutal\". On the distractions, 55th-ranked Fearnley added: \"It's far from ideal but that's life. I understand PSG playing is probably a bit more important than this match. \"It's definitely not a reason why I lost the match.\" Fearnley produced a double fault on match point as Norrie reached the fourth round of the clay-court Grand Slam for the first time. After British number one Jack Draperoutclassed Brazilian teenager Joao Fonseca,there will be two British men in the French Open last 16 for the first time since the Open era was introduced in 1968. Sinner drops only three games as Djokovic sets up Norrie test Draper outclasses rising star Fonseca at French Open Scheduling pleas 'like hitting head against wall' Norrie and Fearnley may have never previously met on the ATP Tour, but they are well aware of each other, having trodden a similar path into the professional ranks. The pair both played United States college tennis at Texas Christian University, with the older Norrie often going back to offer wisdom to the younger cohorts. Norrie has been a shining example to them by maximising his abilities to forge an impressive career - reaching the Wimbledon semi-finals in 2022 on his way into the world's top 10. Fearnley did not make his ATP debut until last year, turning professional shortly after completing his kinesiology degree. At that point, he was still unranked but has sincemade one of the sharpest rises in ATP history. Fearnley had not played on clay professionally until last month and Norrie - who beat former world number one Daniil Medvedev in the first round - produced another confident display to win. \"I was really able to play consistent kind of vintage Norrie tennis,\" said the British number three. \"Just playing seven out of 10 for three and a half hours - or as long as I needed to do that. I did it again so I was really happy with the way I performed.\" Norrie shared a warm embrace with Fearnley at the net after a three-hour contest played in bizarre circumstances. Almost 50,000 football supporters were arriving at the Parc des Princes - over the road from Roland Garros - to watch the Champions League final on big screens. Norrie had to abort his serve when he led 4-1 in the second-set tie-break, but refocused to secure a commanding lead. As well as the fireworks, the players could also hear car horns tooting and police sirens during the opening two sets. The noise subsided in the third set - as the football match's kick-off time approached - and Norrie cruised to victory.

    "title": "Hamilton says new front wing rule 'waste of money'",
    "article_text": "The Spanish Grand Prix starts at 14:00 BST on Sunday Lewis Hamilton says the introduction of a new rule clamping down on front wing flexibility at the Spanish Grand Prix was \"a waste of money\". Governing body the FIA imposed a stiffer load test on front wings to try to limit the amount teams could exploit their movement on track for aerodynamic advantage. But Hamilton said: \"Just wasted everyone's money. It's literally changed nothing. \"Everyone's wings still bend, it's just half the bending, and everyone's had to make new wings and spend more money to make these. It just doesn't make sense.\" The Ferrari driver added that he \"wasn't expecting\" anything of the change before coming to Spain. \"I drove it on the simulator, and it's pretty much exactly the same,\" Hamilton said. \"A little bit more oversteer in the high speed. Could have given it all to charity, you know?\" A new front wing in F1 costs about Â£100,000, in addition to research and development resources. The FIA delayed the introduction of the rule until this race, the ninth of the season, because it expected that the vast majority of teams would be introducing new front wings in Spain anyway as part of their normal development programmes. A spokesperson for the FIA declined to comment specifically on Hamilton's remarks. Piastri beats Norris to pole position in Spain How to follow Spanish Grand Prix on the BBC The move is widely perceived within F1 to have come after pressure from Red Bull on the FIA over McLaren's use of flexi-wings, which were being exploited by all the top teams and most of the others. Red Bull have been raising questions with the FIA in recent months about a number of aspects of the McLaren car on the grounds of legality but no issue has been found with its design and no action has been taken. McLaren team principal Andrea Stella said: \"We always thought that the impact would have been relatively negligible because when we saw the numbers associated to this change of aero-elastic effect, they were small numbers in terms of downforce and in terms of variation of downforce with speed. \"When we tested this wing in Imola [two races ago], if we hadn't told Lando that it was a different wing, he wouldn't have spotted it, and when we simulated it, it was almost zero. \"So we were not expecting a change of the pecking order as a function of the technical directive that was released for this race. \"In terms of wasting the money or not, this is not a point of view that we actually reflected on, because the technical directive has been there for a long time, so this was long-planned and we could find efficiency as well in terms of how you planned to introduce this modification.\" Stella added that the \"economics\" behind the rule changes \"must have been slightly inefficient\", but he said: \"I don't think this is a major factor.\" Red Bull had been hoping the rule change would peg McLaren back, but in fact their lap-time deficit in qualifying was their fourth biggest out of nine races this year. Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris locked out the front row in Barcelona ahead of Max Verstappen Flexible front wings are employed by teams because they allow them to gain straight-line speed for the same cornering performance, or improve cornering while not sacrificing speed on the straights. The idea is for the flaps of the front wing to bend downwards under load at speed, reducing drag, before moving back up to increase downforce for corners. Under the current generation of cars, teams have also found that flexi-wings improve their balance across a range of cornering speeds. The cars, which produce most of their downforce from shaped underbodies known as venturis, are prone to oversteer (too little rear grip compared to front) in high-speed corners, and low-speed understeer (not enough front grip). The flexi wings allow teams to improve the low-speed performance while not making the cars too nervous in high speed. While Lewis Hamilton has yet to make the main podium this season, he did win the sprint race in China two months ago Hamilton, who starts fifth in Barcelona, said his target was to \"try and get to the podium. I haven't been on a podium for a long time\". His last podium was in Las Vegas last November, when he was driving for Mercedes. He referred to former team-mate George Russell taking the lead from fourth on the grid in Spain last year. \"Long way down to turn one. We saw the start George got last year,\" Hamilton said. \"So, I will be trying my best to try and get a good start. And then otherwise, after that, it's just about managing the tyres here, which is challenging.\" Piastri said he was wary about \"the long run to turn one, so I've got to make sure we try and get a good start\". He added: \"It will be an interesting race still and it's not as simple as take the lead at the start and cruise from there. It's going to be a challenge to manage the tyres, timing your stops right. There's going to be a lot going on.\" Verstappen said: \"It's time to shine in turn one, yeah. Make it three [cars] wide for the pictures. Why not? \"My long run [in Friday practice] wasn't bad, but if you look at the difference today, it will be tough to put up a really, really good fight. But that doesn't mean that we're not going try. \"Like Oscar said, it's not all about the start and turn one. You need to be good on tyres. It's a long race. A lot can happen. So, I'll just try to maximise what I got.\" Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "Yates set for Giro title after stunning penultimate stage",
    "article_text": "Simon Yates' first Grand Tour win came seven years ago at the Vuelta a Espana British rider Simon Yates produced a stunning performance on the penultimate stage of the Giro d'Italia to snatch the pink jersey from Isaac del Toro and effectively ensure his second Grand Tour title. Del Toro came into the 20th and final competitive stage of the race with a43-second lead over Richard Carapaz,with Yates trailing by one minute and 21 seconds in third. Mexico's Del Toro, 21, would have clinched victory in his maiden Giro by successfully negotiating the Colle delle Finestre, the highest point of this year's race and where Yates' hopes of winning evaporated in 2018. But Yates, 32, exorcised those ghosts as he attacked on the brutal ascent to leave Del Toro, who hadheld the race lead since stage nine,and Carapaz in his wake. He not only wiped out Del Toro's advantage but was one minute 41 seconds clear of his general classification rivals when he crested. His Visma-Lease a Bike team had pulled off a masterstroke as team-mate Wout van Aert was in the breakaway group and allowed Yates to catch him on the descent, helping him build a comprehensive lead over the final 20km. Jayco-Alula's Australian rider Chris Harper, who was the first over the Colle delle Finestre summit, claimed the first individual Grand Tour stage win of his career, with Yates crossing one minute 57 seconds later, third on the day. Yates was in tears as he hugged team staff at the finish, surrounded by media, with Del Toro of UAE Team Emirates crossing the line five minutes after him. It means the Briton leads Del Toro by three minutes 56 seconds, with Carapaz in third, heading in to Sunday's processional stage in Rome. \"I'm not really an emotional person but I couldn't hold back the tears,\" said Yates. \"It's something I've worked towards year after year and I've had a lot of setbacks but I've finally managed to pull if off.\" Yates lost 30 seconds to Del Toro during Friday's stage but recovered to ensure he will become just the third British rider to win the Giro, after Chris Froome (2018) and Tao Geoghegan Hart (2020). Froome memorably snatched the pink jersey on the penultimate mountain stage in 2018, asYates cracked and ultimately lost more than 38 minutes. Once this year's route was announced, with the same climb late in the 205km stage from Verres to Sestriere, Yates said he \"always had in the back of my mind to try to do something here and close the chapter, let's say\". \"I'm still a bit speechless that I was able to do it,\" added Yates, who bounced back from the 2018 Giro towin that year's Vuelta a Espana. The 18.5km Finestre climb has an average gradient of 9.2% and started 43km from the finish. Within a kilometre of the climb, Carapaz's EF Education team attacked, but Del Toro was alert to the danger and soon closed the gap to Carapaz, with the rest of the peloton dropping back. Yet Yates then came from nowhere to join his general classification rivals and made a series of attacks before ultimately breaking clear. When Yates hit the gravel section, he extended his lead, while Del Toro and Carapaz - the 2019 Giro winner - continued to trade blows. But by the time they also reached the summit - some 2,178m above sea level - they knew the race was gone and Yates would be wearing the pink jersey for the first time since Froome took it from him in 2018. \"It's incredible,\" said Van Aert. \"It was such a brave effort from Simon to go all in from so far.

    "title": "Women and girls ‘not safe anywhere’ as Darfur suffers surge in sexual violence",
    "article_text": "As Sudan’s Darfur region has been overrun by militias, women are facing the constant threat of sexual violence,Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has reported. The medical charity said in the SouthDarfurregion alone its workers treated 659 sexual violence survivors between January and March this year, more than two-thirds of whom had been raped. “Women and girls do not feel safe anywhere. They are attacked in their own homes, when fleeing violence, getting food, collecting firewood, working in the fields. They tell us they feel trapped,” said Claire San Filippo, MSF emergency coordinator, who called on the warring parties to hold their fighters to account. “These attacks are heinous and cruel, often involving multiple perpetrators. This must stop.Sexual violenceis not a natural or inevitable consequence of war, it can constitute a war crime, a form of torture, and a crime against humanity.” Several women who gave testimonies to MSF described raids where fighters killed all the boys and men in a place before raping women and girls. A 27-year-old nurse said she was raped last year by fighters who accused her of treating Sudanese army soldiers. “I want protection now; I don’t want to be raped again … I was too afraid to go to the hospital. My family told me, “Don’t tell anybody”. I don’t have any more pain. But I have nightmares about it,” she said. MSF said that 56% of the sexual violence they documented was perpetrated by non-civilians. Women and girls having to walk long distances to gather food and water put them in particular danger, the report said. A third of women and girls were attacked while travelling to or working in fields. Since April 2023, Darfur has witnessed asurge in human rights abusesas it has been taken over by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary and allied militias as they fight for control against the government’s Sudanese armed forces. The fighting has recently been concentrated around the city of El Fasher, where conditions have deteriorated rapidly for civilians. The RSF’s seizure of the nearbyZamzam displacement campled to further reports of increased sexual violence. The Strategic Initiative for Women in the Horn of Africa (Siha),a coalition of women’s rights groups, said it has verified 14 cases of rape but had received reports of many more,during the Zamzam attackand in the weeks since, as well as dozens of reports of women disappearing or being abducted by RSF fighters. “Sexual violence has become an everyday reality for women and girls in Darfur, along with the rise in sexually transmitted diseases,” said Siha’s head, Hala al-Karib, who said the international community had abandoned women in Darfur. Karib said the violence had been escalating since before the current conflict because of the withdrawa of a UN and African Union peacekeeping mission in Darfur that had provided some protection to local communities. “The peacekeeping mission primarily contributed to the safety and security of women by patrolling roads and enabling them to access their farmlands, while also securing displaced camps,” said Karib. “The level of neglect toward women in Darfur is staggering. This region is experiencing active genocidal acts, horrific war crimes, and famine due to a siege on livelihoods by all actors. There is no dedicated support for women survivors … this crisis is unfolding amid complete silence and utter neglect from international actors.”",

    "title": "Doubts raised over Chinese paraglider’s claim of accidental 8,000-metre flight",
    "article_text": "A Chinese paraglider’s story of being accidentally propelled more than 8,000 metres high by an updraft has been thrown into doubt after it emerged that parts of a video of the flight appear to have been AI-generated. Peng Yujiang, who has been banned from the activity for six months, said he began from an elevation of about 3,000 metres in the Qilian mountain range in northernChina, where he intended to test some secondhand equipment he bought without making a proper flight, according to an investigative report by the Gansu Provincial Aviation Sports Association. The bureaureportwas based on an interview with Peng, the association said. Subsequent findings that some video was AI-generated have called into question his story. Peng told the investigators thatabout 20 minutes into his practice hewas caught in a strong updraft, which sent him soaring more than 5,000 metres higher, in line with flight paths and nearly the height of Mount Everest. In a video filmed on the ground, Peng said: “My hands were frozen outside. I kept trying to talk on the radio.” Video purported to be from Peng’s mounted camera went viral, but has since been challenged over its veracity. At least some parts of it are believed to have been AI generated. NBC News said the first five seconds of the footage provided by China’s state broadcaster CCTV, and distributed by Reuters, had been determined to be AI-generated. Authorities praised Peng’s survival, conceding it was an accident. A “normal person cannot be exposed at 8,000 metres without oxygen [so] this is not something that can be done voluntarily” said a sports bureau official, according toSixth Tone. But Peng, who has about five years’ experience paragliding, never intended to leave ground level and so had not registered any flight plans, meaning his ordeal was “not subject to relevant approvals”, the report said. In response, he was banned from flying for six months. The bureaureport, based on an interview with Peng, said he was in the air for more than an hour, and had stayed in radio contact with his friend, Gu Zhimin, who was still on the ground. The report said he had attempted to descend but his efforts were “ineffective”, and as he flew higher he became confused and briefly lost consciousness. Peng said hewas eventually able to land about 30km from the launch site, where he was met by Gu and another friend. Gu later posted a composite video to Douyin, China’s domestic version of TikTok, where it soon went viral. The video drew the ire of authorities. “Gu Zhimin posted a flight video without permission, which had a bad impact,” the report said. “He was grounded for six months and asked to write a report to deeply reflect on the negative impact of his behaviour.” The bureau said any record broken by Peng’s flight would not be officially counted because his flight was not registered. If Peng did fly to the reported height, there is precedent for survival, including the world record of 9,946m set by German paraglider Ewa Wiśnierska in 2007, whenshe was caught in a similar updraftwhile paragliding in Australia. Wiśnierska was unconscious for about 40 minutes, only learning how high she had flown after safely landing and checking her flight data. Additional research by Lillian Yang. This article was amended on 31 May 2025 after it emerged that some of the video of the flight appears to have been AI generated. A video that accompanied the earlier version of the article, and which included the since-disputed content, has also been removed.",

    "article_text": "A domestic tourist climbed over a fence and jumped into a section of the world-famous display of China’s terracotta army, damaging two ancient clay warriors, authorities said on Saturday. The 30-year-old was visiting the museum housing the terracotta army in the city of Xi’an on Friday when he “climbed over the guardrail and the protective net and jumped”, public security officials said in a statement. The man was found to “suffer from mental illness” and the case is under investigation. He “pushed and pulled” the clay warriors and two were “damaged to varying degrees”, the statement said. He was “controlled” by security personnel. The pit he jumped into is up to 5.4 metres (18ft) deep, according to the museum’s website. Built around 209 BC to stand guard over the tomb of the first emperor, the 8,000-strong terracotta army is one of China’s most important archaeological discoveries and considered a symbol of ancient Chinese artistic and military sophistication. A major tourist attraction in Xi’an, capital of the northern province of Shaanxi, it has been a Unesco world heritage site since 1987. A worker at the museum told AFP on Saturday that the display was open as usual.",

    "title": "Cauchi’s mass murders put harsh spotlight on failings of mental health and police systems",
    "article_text": "Joel Cauchi’s mother didn’t appear before the coronial inquest examining her son’s life and the day her son murdered six people at a popular Bondi Junction shopping centre. But her presence was often felt, taking shape in the form of notes she hadwritten to his doctoror in aconversation with a police officer. One of the most striking moments of the inquest was when Michele Cauchi, now in her mid-70s, was filmed via body-worn video camera on a police officer. She was standing outside her tidy home next to blooming hydrangeas, explaining how her son – who spoke multiple languages and had a university degree – had been deteriorating since he stopped taking medication. “I don’t know how we’re going to get him treatment unless he does something drastic,” she says. These moments painted a picture of a mother engaging in a Sisyphean struggle to get her son – then living with untreated schizophrenia – help. But she could keep pushing only so far. Person after person who gave painful evidence at the five-week inquest told a similar story of doing their best in a “fallible system”. It crystallised into a key takeaway: the system is letting down people in a crisis, like Cauchi. Cauchi’s attack and the severity of it was a rare occurrence. But the system’s failure to pick up on his slide after he stopped taking his medication for treatment-resistant schizophrenia is sadly a familiar story. Psychiatrists who appeared as experts before the inquest said the vision when mental health asylums in Australia were dismantled in the 1970s was for community services to instead support those people in need. But Queensland psychiatrist Prof Edward Heffernan told the inquiry the planned funding for community services “never really followed” the shift. Psychiatrists also told the inquest that services hadn’t kept pace with population growth. Meanwhile, psychological distress was increasing across the population, and patterns of substance abuse and other modern stressors had made things worse. Ian Korbel, a psychiatrist not part of the inquest, tells Guardian Australia he once worked in a mental health outreach team that would respond to people in crisis. But that program stopped running in the mid-2000s. Korbel says the team that worked in Sydney’s eastern suburbs used to check the beaches for people experiencing homelessness. Cauchi was reportedly sleeping rough there before the attack. Korbel says the faltering of services has resulted in the buck passing to police and the justice system. “They’re in the punishment business,” he says. “They shouldn’t respond to this, but the health system isn’t resourced to respond to it.” Police are increasingly responding to such crises. The inquest heard that inNew South Wales, police responded to 40% more mental health incidents in 2022 compared with four years earlier. Sen Sgt Tracey Morris told the inquiry: “We will always look at [those incidents] from a policing lens. That may lead to charges and them going through the court system when [it’s] effectively because of the mental illness.” Morris works as the mental health intervention coordinator in the Queensland police district where Cauchi’s parents live, in Darling Downs. The day Cauchi’s mother spoke to police, they referred Joel to her role – which helps people link in with health services – for a follow-up check. But the officer acting in her role while she was on leave missed the email. This moment to get Cauchi help was described by a psychiatrist at the inquest as a “missed opportunity”. Fighting back tears, Morris told the court this was no reflection on that officer’s capability, but a direct consequence of under-resourcing. At least four people should be doing her job in that particular police district, she said. One of the cruelest ironies of that under-resourcing issue came during the inquest in a blink-and-you-might-have-missed it-moment, where Morris said no one was covering her role while she was at the inquest for the week. She couldn’t find anyone to backfill it. Matthew Morgan, an expert in policing mental health responses who lectures at the Australian Catholic University, says: “The only people really to blame here is the government. If they’re not going to invest in a proactive and responsive mental health system that can provide the community around-the-clock care … then the buck stops with them.” A recent report Morgan co-authored analysed Queensland coronial inquests into people fatally shot by police while experiencing a mental illness. Twenty-four people have been fatally shot in the state since 2008. There is a clear patten, he says. “The state has really just failed them. “There’s just lots of patterns of sporadic treatment, lack of follow-up care, and then the police get blamed for their criminalising and sometimes lethal response to such situations.” The inquest heard there had been multiple improvements in crisis response since police spoke to Cauchi and his mother in January 2023. Police can connect with health professionals to get advice on incidents, and there are co-response models where healthcare workers respond to call-outs alongside police. Those changes – as Peggy Dwyer, counsel assisting the coroner, pointed out in the inquest – have come after multiple inquiries, internal police and government reports and coronial inquests. All make a similar recommendation: health professionals should respond to mental health crises, not police – at least not alone. Joining calls for this change are families whoseloved ones have been shot deadby police while they were suffering a psychosis. One of the loudest recent voices has been Judy Deacon, the mother of Jesse,who police shot dead in Glebein 2023 after reports he was self-harming. But co-responder models have not been rolled out nationwide, despite recommendations to do so. The leading model in NSW, known as Pacer, operates in just 20 of NSW’s 57 police commands. During the inquest, Dwyer asked Dr Brendan Flynn, the executive director of the mental health branch of NSW Health: “Why has there not been an expanded Pacer across NSW where sufficient demand is demonstrated, when this report came out almost four years ago?” Flynn responded: “It’s a resourcing issue. It would require new funds, and that’s a matter primarily for government.” Later Dwyer asked: “Is there a risk that we just then get stuck here for another four years where there’s no rollout of more supports?” Flynn replied: “I hope very much that’s not the case.” Even if a version of Pacer were rolled out across NSW, Korbel says, more work needs to be done. “Nowhere in Australia do we fund mental health as we should,” he says. “NSW is the worst. It gives 5% of its health budget to mental health.” Korbel says that figure “would need to be doubled at least” to match similar programs in countries such as England and Canada. Investment in health services can save money in the long term. Prof Olav Nielssen, a Sydney-based psychiatrist who appeared before the inquest, spoke about a supported housing charity he works at. It supports people revolving between hospital, prison and the homeless sector. He estimated the cost of having people in supported housing was a tenth of what it would otherwise cost having them bouncing around a network of hospitals, prisons and other institutions. He said NSW had “plans” to have 70 of these beds but that there should be 1,000 to meet the need. Elizabeth Young, the mother of Jade Young, a victim of thestabbings, appeared before the inquest and described her 47-year-old daughter’s murder as the “stuff of nightmares”. She also described it as the result of “years of neglect” within the mental health system. “It seems to me that my daughter and five others were killed by the cumulative failures of numbers of people within a whole series of fallible systems.” In Australia, the crisis support serviceLifelineis 13 11 14.

    "article_text": "At least 81 people have been arrested after violent clashes in Paris after huge crowds of fans gathered to watchPSG’s victory over Inter Milan in the Champions League final. The club’s Parc des Princes stadium was transformed into a fan zone for the night to screen the match, which took place in Munich, with about 48,000 attending. Footage on social media appears to show police armed with batons clashing with people, close to where thousands of fans had congregated. Several fires were ignited near the stadium in the French capital and fire brigades were dispatched to multiple locations to tackle the blazes. Local media said the police detained at least 81 people. France’s interior minister, Bruno Retailleau, wrote on social media: “True PSG fans are getting excited about their team’s magnificent performance. Meanwhile, barbarians have taken to the streets of Paris to commit crimes and provoke law enforcement. “I have asked the internal security forces to react vigorously to these abuses. I offer my support to the police prefect and all the police officers who are ensuring everyone’s safety this evening. “It is unbearable that it is not possible to party without fearing the savagery of a minority of thugs who respect nothing.” About 5,400 police were deployed across the city for the post-match celebrations, with officers on the Champs-Élysées using teargas and pepper spray to maintain order. A police spokesperson said a car was set alight near the Parc des Princes and several dozen arrests had been made by the time the match ended, Reuters reported. Traffic around the Arc de Triomphe was blocked from midday with the Champs-Élysées boulevard and nearby streets also closed on Saturday evening. Earlier, in Munich, PSG and Inter Milan supporters threw stones at each other at Fröttmaning station while travelling to the Allianz arena for the final, Bild reported. They also caused travel disruption by making their way on to train tracks, according to reports. PSG’s win over Arsenal in the semi-final on 7 May sparked unrest inParis, with 47 people arrested and three others injured after being hit by a car.",

    "article_text": "The body of a British hiker missing in the Dolomites in northernItalysince New Year’s Day has been found, local rescuers said on Saturday. Aziz Ziriat, 36, from London, was discovered buried in snow by rescuers from the Trentino Alpine and speleological rescue team, the organisation said. He had been hiking with his friend Sam Harris, 35, whosebody was found buried under snow on the same mountainabout 1km (0.6 miles) away, at the base of the southern face of Carè Alto, soon after they were reported missing. The team, which had been airlifted to the area on Saturday morning, began searching near where Harris’s body had been found. A rescue dog, from a unit provided by the Italian financial police’s Alpine rescue branch, detected his body “in a rocky crevice, hidden beneath layers of snow”, at the foot of the southern face of Carè Alto, the rescue team said in a statement. Ziriat’s remains were found “at the base of the cliffs, almost 1,000 metres away from Harris’s initial location and 400 metres lower in altitude”. The body was airlifted to the nearby Spiazzo Rendena sports field. The rescue team said his family have been informed of the discovery. The pair’s last known location had been a mountain hut called Casina Dosson, close to the town of Tione Di Trento, near Riva Del Garda on Lake Garda on 1 January. The alarm was raised when the pair missed their return flight on 6 January. Firefighters and a volunteer group had also been involved in the search operation. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said: “We are supporting the family of a British national who died in northern Italy and are in contact with the local authorities.”",

    "title": "Israel’s ‘violations’ in Gaza make world more dangerous, Norway warns",
    "article_text": "Israel is setting a dangerous precedent for international human rights law violations in Gaza that is making the whole world more dangerous, Norway’s international development minister has warned. Norway has played a historical role in the region, including by facilitating the Oslo peace accords between Israel and the Palestinians that led to a celebrated breakthrough deal in 1993. Last year itrecognised the Palestinian state, one of a minority of European countries to do so. “For the last one and a half years we have seen very low respect for international law in the war inGazaand in recent months it is worse than ever before,” Åsmund Aukrust said. “So for the Norwegian government it is very important to protest against this, to condemn this very clear violation.” In addition to contributing to the worsening humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, he said Israel’s actions posed a global threat to other and future conflicts. “We are very concerned that there will be a new international standard where food is used as a weapon, where the UN is denied entrance to the war and conflict zone, and other NGOs are denied entrance,” he said. “And Israel is building up something they call Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which is to militarise humanitarian aid.” GHF, the controversial Israeli and US-backed logistical group, started distributing food in Gaza this week. Amidchaotic scenes, Israeli forces said they fired “warning shots” at a distribution centre. Gaza health officials said at least one civilian had been killed and 48 injured. A UN-backed assessment earlier this month found that the entire population of the Gaza Strip, approximately 2.1 million people, were at critical risk of famine, with half a million people categorised as in catastrophe. Aukrust said: “We are afraid and very concerned that this might be a new standard in international law and this will make the world a lot more dangerous to all of us.” However, he said it was not up to politicians to decide whether the term genocide applied to Gaza, saying that was a decision for the international court of justice. “Genocide is the worst crime a country can do and the worst crime that politicians can do and this should not be polarised,” he said. However, he said Oslo would be keeping an “open line” to all parties – including Hamas – for dialogue and promised that Norway would be “there for the long run” to rebuild Gaza. “We have no limitation of who we are talking to. I would say the opposite. We would be happy to, and we want to, talk with those who are responsible, whether it is Israel, Hamas or others,” he said. “Dialogue is the most important word when it comes to peacemaking and we want to have an open line with all countries, all groups that might have an influence here.” The Norwegian oil fund, the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund that operates under rules set by parliament, has so far blacklisted 11 companies for assisting Israel’s occupation. Next week, the Norwegian parliament is expected to reject calls to stop the fund from investing in companies that sell products and services in the occupiedPalestinian territories. Aukrust said decisions about the wealth fund were made by the bank, not politicians. “The bank decides where they want to invest. What the politicians do is to decide the rules,” he said. The rules, he added, were “very clear” that the fund should not invest in anything that contributed to a violation of international law. Norway’s decision to recognise the state of Palestine in May 2024 was “to send out a message of hope,” said Aukrust. He urged people acrossEuropeto “continue to protest” and to keep their faith in politics. “As long as the war is going on, from the Norwegian government side we will all the time look into what more can we do. What new initiative can we take. How can we send an even clearer message to those who are responsible for this.”",

    "title": "Hamas denies rejecting US-led Gaza deal as Israel confirms it killed Mohammed Sinwar – as it happened",
    "article_text": "Militant group calls for changes to US proposal as IDF confirms it killed Hamas leader on 13 May Hamas said it has submitted its response on a ceasefire proposal presented byDonald Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, to mediators. The Palestinian group said in a statement that under the deal, it will release 10 living hostages and 18 bodies in return for Israel’s release of a number of Palestinian prisoners. Hamas said it has not rejected a ceasefire proposal presented by US president Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, a senior Hamas official, Basem Naim, told Reuters. Naim said Israel’s response to Witkoff’s proposal was incompatible with what the group agreed on, adding that the US envoy’s position towards the group was “unfair” and showed “complete bias” towards Israel. Witkoff said Hamas’s response to the US’s ceasefire proposal is “totally unacceptable and only takes us backward”. Hamas said it had submitted its response on a ceasefire proposal presented by Witkoffto mediators. The Palestinian group said in a statement that under the deal, it will release 10 living hostages and 18 bodies in return for Israel’s release of a number of Palestinian prisoners. Israel’s military has confirmed it killed Hamas’s military leader, Mohammed Sinwar, on 13 May, Reuters reports. The IDF said the airstrike that killed Sinwar also killed Mohammad Sabaneh, the commander of Hamas’s Rafah brigade, and Mahdi Quara, the commander of Hamas’s South Khan Younis battalion. The Israeli army said they were “operating in an underground command and control centre, under the European hospital in Khan Younis, deliberately endangering the civilian population in and around the hospital”. Palestinians in the Gaza Strip blocked and off-loaded dozens of food trucks, the UN World Food Programme (WFP) said on Saturday, as desperation mounts after Israel’s months-long blockade.The WFP said that 77 trucks carrying aid, mostly flour, were stopped by hungry people who took the food before the trucks were able to reach their destination. The WFP said the fear of starvation in Gaza is high despite the food aid that is entering now. Israel has said Hamas must accept a hostage deal in Gaza or “be annihilated”, as Donald Trump announced that a ceasefire agreement was “very close”.On Friday, the Israeli defence minister, Israel Katz, said Hamas must agree to a ceasefire proposal presented by the US envoy, Steve Witkoff, or be destroyed, after the group said the deal failed to satisfy its demands. Hamas said it was still considering the text. Gaza is “the hungriest place on earth”, according to the UN, which has warned that the Palestinian territory’s entire population is at risk of famine.Jens Laerke, a spokesperson for the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha), also said the mission to deliver aid was “in an operational straitjacket that makes it one of the most obstructed aid operations not only in the world today, but in recent history”. Israel is setting a dangerous precedent for international human rights law violations in Gaza that ismaking the whole world more dangerous, Norway’s international development minister has warned.“For the last one and a half years we have seen very low respect for international law in the war in Gaza and in recent months it is worse than ever before,” Åsmund Aukrust said. “So for the Norwegian government it is very important to protest against this, to condemn this very clear violation.” The foreign ministers of five Arab countries who had planned to visit the occupied West Bank this weekend on Saturday condemned Israel’s decision to block their plans.Ministers from Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates had been expected to take part alongside Turkey and the secretary-general of the Arab League. Israel had announced late on Friday that it would not cooperate, effectively blocking the visit as it controls the territory’s borders and airspace. The Gaza health ministry said on Saturday that at least 60 people were killed by Israeli strikes in the last 24 hours.It said three people were shot by Israeli gunfire early on Saturday morning in the southern city of Rafah. Three other people were killed, parents and a child, when their car was struck in Gaza City, it added. A convoy of tractors that set out from kibbutzim across Israel arrived at Hostages Square in Tel Aviv on Saturday, calling for the return of hostages held in Gaza.The protest was organised by the Kibbutz Movement and the Hostages Families Forum. Israeli airstrikes have struck western Syria, the Israeli military and Syrian state media have said, and reportedly one civilian has been killed,in the first such attack on the country in nearly a month.“A strike from Israeli occupation aircraft targeted sites close to the village of Zama in the Jableh countryside south of Latakia,” state television said. Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, a confidential report by the UN nuclear watchdog said on Saturdayand called on Tehran to urgently change course and comply with the agency’s investigation. The report by the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which was seen by the Associated Press (AP), says that as of 17 May, Iran had amassed 408.6kg of uranium enriched up to 60%. Israel said Saturday’s IAEA report was a clear warning sign that Iran is “totally determined to complete its nuclear weapons programme”,according to a statement from the office of the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. After Israel’s military confirmed it had killed Hamas’s Gaza chief Mohammed Sinwar earlier this month, its defence minister,IsraelKatz, wrote on X: “Israel’s long arm will reach all those responsible for the murders and atrocities of October 7th, wherever they may be, near or far, until their complete elimination.” Katz also issued a warning to one of Sinwar’s potential successors as Hamas’s Gaza chief. “Azz al-Din al-Haddad inGazaand Khalil al-Hayya abroad – and all their partners in crime – you’re next in line,” he added. The Israeli foreign minister, Gideon Saar, said that Hamas was responsible for the continuation of the war in Gaza by refusing to release hostages and disarm. Earlier,Hamassaid it had submitted its response containing some amendments to a proposal presented by Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, to mediators. Hamas said it has not rejected a ceasefire proposal presented by US president Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, a seniorHamasofficial, Basem Naim, told Reuters. Naim said Israel’s response to Witkoff’s proposal was incompatible with what the group agreed on, adding that the US envoy’s position towards the group was “unfair” and showed “complete bias” towardsIsrael. The Israeli prime minister’s office said: “WhileIsraelhas agreed to the updated Witkoff outline for the release of our hostages, Hamas continues to adhere to its refusal … Israel will continue its action for the return of our hostages and the defeat of Hamas.” Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, said Hamas’s response to the US’s ceasefire proposal is “totally unacceptable and only takes us backward”. The IDF said the airstrike that killed Mohammed Sinwar, head of Hamas’s military wing, on 13 May also killed Mohammad Sabaneh, commander of Hamas’s Rafah brigade, and Mahdi Quara, commander of Hamas’s South Khan Younis battalion. The Israeli army said they were “operating in an underground command and control centre, under the European hospital in Khan Younis, deliberately endangering the civilian population in and around the hospital”. Mohammad Sinwar was the target of an Israeli strike on a hospital in southern Gaza earlier this month. Benjamin Netanyahusaid on Wednesday that he had been killed. Hamas has neither confirmed nor denied his death. He was the younger brother ofYahya Sinwar, the Palestinian militant group’s deceased headand leader of the October 2023 attack on Israel. Israel’s military has confirmed it killed Hamas’s military leader, Mohammed Sinwar, on 13 May, Reuters reports. A Palestinian official familiar with the talks told Reuters that among the amendmentsHamasis seeking is the release of the hostages in three phases over the 60-day truce and more aid distribution in different areas. Hamas also wants guarantees the deal will lead to a permanent ceasefire, the official said. Earlier, the Palestinian ministry of health inGazasaid 60 people had died and a further 284 had been injured in the past 24 hours. That does not include numbers from hospitals located in the North Gaza Strip governorate because of the difficulty of accessing the area, it added. That brings the death toll to 54,381 since the beginning of the war on 7 October 2023. A further 124,054 have been injured.",

    "title": "Hamas suggests changes in response to Gaza ceasefire proposal",
    "article_text": "Hamas said on Saturday that it had submitted its response containing some amendments to a proposal presented by Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, to mediators, the most concrete sign of progress towards a ceasefire since March. The Palestinian group said in a statement that under the deal, it will release 10 living hostages and 18 bodies in return for Israel’s release of Palestinian prisoners – a change to the US’s latest proposal that will make it more difficult forIsraelto resume fighting if talks on a permanent ceasefire are not completed by the end of the truce. The updated proposal includes a demand for an end to the war, which had previously been a red line for Israel, and envisions the release of the Israelis held captive inGazabeing spread out more throughout the 60-day truce, rather than in two batches on the first and seventh day as the US offer suggested. Witkoff responded on Saturday evening by saying the Hamas response was “totally unacceptable and only takes us backward”. “Hamas should accept the framework proposal we put forward as the basis for proximity talks, which we can begin immediately this coming week,” he said. “That is the only way we can close a 60-day ceasefire deal in the coming days in which half of the living hostages and half of those who are deceased will come home to their families and in which we can have at the proximity talks substantive negotiations in good faith to try to reach a permanent ceasefire.” The Israeli prime minister’s office said: “While Israel has agreed to the updated Witkoff outline for the release of our hostages, Hamas continues to adhere to its refusal … Israel will continue its action for the return of our hostages and the defeat of Hamas.” A senior Hamas official responded that the group “did not reject” the hostage release proposal, and that Witkoff’s response to their answer was “unfair” and showed “complete bias” in favour of Israel. Several rallies were held on Saturday evening across Israel demanding a ceasefire and the release of the hostages. Speaking at the Hostage Square in Tel Aviv, Sharon Aloni Cunio,a freed hostagewhose husband, David Cunio, remains in captivity, said: “Now is the time to make a deal. Return the fathers to our children. Don’t make them orphans.” A statement from the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said: “We call upon the prime minister from here. The time has come for a deal. For the sake of our children’s future. One comprehensive deal to bring them all home. Right now.” Earlier on Saturday the Israeli military confirmed that it killed Mohammed Sinwar, Hamas’s Gaza chief, on May 13. Sinwar was the target of an Israeli strike on a hospital in southern Gaza earlier this month. Netanyahu said on Wednesday that he had been killed. He was the younger brother of Yahya Sinwar, the Palestinian militant group’s deceased leader and mastermind of the October 2023 attack on Israel. Hamas has not confirmed his death. The Hamas response to the US proposal appears close to a previously reported version of the deal, which specified that the group would release 10 hostages, as well as a number of hostages’ remains, during the ceasefire in exchange for 1,100 Palestinian prisoners. The Hamas statement said: “This proposal aims to achieve a permanent ceasefire, a comprehensive withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, and ensure the flow of aid to our people and our families in the Gaza Strip.” It said its response came “after conducting a round of national consultations”. “There are some notes and amendments to some points, especially on the US guarantees, the timing of hostage release, the delivery of aid and the withdrawal of Israeli forces,” a senior official with the group told the Associated Press. The US ceasefire proposal reportedly involves a 60-day pause in fighting and a redoubling of efforts towards long-term peace, as well as guarantees from Israel that it will not resume its offensive after Hamas releases hostages, which the country did in March. Israeli negotiators accepted the deal, but Hamas’s initial reaction to the proposal was lukewarm. On Friday, the militant group said it was holding consultations with other factions operating under its rule in Gaza including Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Hamas’s response came after two days in which the militant group had indicated that the US proposal was more biased in favour of Israel than previous ones. A leading Hamas official, Basem Naim, said on Thursday that the US proposal “does not respond to any of our people’s demands”, including lifting the humanitarian blockade on the Gaza Strip that has led tofamine-likeconditions among the population of 2 million. The group’s reaction provoked the ire of their Israeli counterparts. Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, threatened the group on Friday with “annihilation” if it did not accept. “The Hamas murderers will now be forced to choose: accept the terms of the ‘Witkoff deal’ for the release of the hostages – or be annihilated,” said Katz. Israel has not yet officially responded to Hamas’s response, but an officialtold Israeli reporterson condition of anonymity that Jerusalem was treating Hamas’s changes as an “effective rejection”. Deep differences between Hamas and Israel have stymied previous attempts to restore a ceasefire that broke down in March after only two months. Israel has insisted that Hamas disarm completely and be dismantled as a military and governing force, and that all 58 hostages still held in Gaza be returned before it will agree to end the war. The Israeli government fears that a lasting ceasefire and withdrawal would leave Hamas with significant influence in Gaza, even if it surrenders formal power. With time, the Israelis worry Hamas might be able to rebuild its military and launch more 7 October-style attacks. On the other hand, Hamas fears that Israel could break the ceasefire – as it did last March – and resume the war, which the Israeli government would be permitted to do after 60 days under the terms of the deal. Aprevious ceasefire collapsedin mid-March after Israel refused to move to a planned second phase that could have led to a permanent end to the war, and instead restarted its offensive in the Gaza Strip. Negotiators have met in the months since in an attempt to reach a ceasefire, with little progress to show for it. More than 54,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its war on the besieged Palestinian territory on 7 October 2023. The Israeli offensive was in retaliation for a Hamas attack on the same day, which saw the group kill about 1,200 people and take 250 hostages. About 20 hostages are believed to still be alive and their return is a key demand of ceasefire negotiations. As negotiations over a ceasefire continued, Israel’s offensive in Gaza has ramped up. At least 60 people have been killed by Israeli strikes in Gaza over the last 24 hours, health officials said, while 72 people were killed on Thursday. Israel stopped allowing almost all humanitarian aid into Gaza when it resumed hostilities in the Palestinian territory. The nearly three-month Israeli blockade on Gaza has pushed the population of more than 2 million to the brink of famine. While pressure has slightly eased in recent days as Israel allowed some aid to enter, aid organisations say far from enough food is getting in. “After nearly 80 days of a total blockade, communities are starving – and they are no longer willing to watch food pass them by,” the World Food Programme said on Saturday. The UN aid agency had been allowed to bring 77 trucks loaded with flour into Gaza overnight, but the trucks were stopped en route by crowds of hungry people.",

    "title": "UK plans to build six weapons factories to bolster military readiness",
    "article_text": "The UK will spend £1.5bn on building six munitions and energetics factories to “better deter our adversaries” as part of its long-awaitedstrategic defence review. John Healey, the defence secretary, said the funds formed part of plans for an “always-on” weapons pipeline and would support the procurement of up to 7,000 UK-built long-range weapons. The 130-page strategic defence review willset out the threats Britain faces, including the “immediate and pressing” danger posed by Russia, and the capabilities needed to meet them. Due to be unveiled by Keir Starmer on Monday, it will draw heavily on lessons learned from the war inUkraine. Plans to step up munitions production are a response to the review’s call for an “always on” capacity that can be scaled up quickly if needed. Healey said: “The hard-fought lessons from Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine show a military is only as strong as the industry that stands behind them. We are strengthening the UK’s industrial base to better deter our adversaries and make the UK secure at home and strong abroad.” He said theUK defence industrywould become “an engine for economic growth” and boost skilled jobs. The new £1.5bn funding will see spending on UK munitions hit £6bn during this parliament and support 1,800 jobs across the UK, according to the Ministry of Defence. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, said that “a strong economy needs a strong national defence, and investing in weaponry and munitions and backing nearly 2,000 jobs across Britain in doing so is proof the two go hand-in-hand”. As part of the review, the Ministry of Defence will be urged to lay the industrial foundations for an uplift in munitions stockpiles to meet the demand of“high-tempo” warfare. Ministers have also announced more than £1.5bn to improvethe condition of military homesby carrying out urgent repairs such as fixing boilers and roofs and tackling damp. “Our forces make extraordinary sacrifices to keep us safe and to serve this country and yet for years, we’ve forced their families to live in substandard homes,” Healey said on a visit to military accommodation in Cambridgeshire. Starmer launched the strategic defence reviewshortly after entering office last yearand said it would help prepare the UK for “a more dangerous and volatile world”. Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion The document will paint a picture of the most heightened military and security threat since the end of the cold war, though it falls short of saying that the intensity ofMoscow’s cyber and sabotage activitiesmeans the UK has already drifted into a war with Russia. It will also set out an assessment ofthe current state of the UK’s armed forces. Figures out this week show that the size of the army has dropped below the target to the lowest level since the Napoleonic era and earlier, with the number of full-time trained soldiers at 70,860 on 1 April, down 2.3% over the preceding year. The review is not expected to set out fresh commitments for defence spending, but will instead reiterate a commitment made by Starmer in February to increase the defence budget to 2.5% of GDP by 2027 and to 3% in the next parliament. It was written by former Nato secretary-general George Robertson, former US presidential adviser Fiona Hill and former joint force commander Richard Barrons.",

    "article_text": "A murder investigation has been launched after a woman was stabbed to death in south London. Officers were called to Frith Road in Croydon, at 9.07am on Saturday, the Metropolitan police said. The London ambulance service and London’s air ambulance treated two injured people. The woman, who is in her 20s, died at the scene, despite the efforts of a teenage boy to help her, police said. A man in his 30s was taken to hospital with minor injuries. He has since been arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in hospital, Scotland Yard said. Initial inquiries suggest the incident started at a nearby address, before escalating on to Frith Road, the force added. Supt Mitch Carr said: “This is a tragic incident where a young woman has lost her life and our thoughts are with her loved ones. “I especially want to thank the members of the public, including a teenage boy, who bravely tried to help the victim. “We believe that this was an isolated incident, but understand that this news will shock the local community. Officers will remain in the area over the coming days and we would ask anyone who has concerns to speak with them.”",

    "article_text": "The UK’s trade secretary,Jonathan Reynolds, will meet his US counterpart next week to thrash out a timeline for exempting the UK from US steel and aluminium tariffs after Donald Trump announced he would double them. British officials are seeking clarity on the implications of Trump’s announcement on Friday night that heplanned to double the tariffsfrom 25% to 50% from Wedneday 4 June, piling further pressure on global steel trade. Reynolds is expected to meet his US counterpart, Jamieson Greer , at the OECD meeting in Paris next week. He will seek to agree a timeline for implementing the deal agreed to lower steel, aluminium, auto and other product tariffs. A UK government spokesperson said: “The UK was the first country to secure a trade deal with the US earlier this month and we remain committed to protecting British business and jobs across key sectors, including steel.” “We are engaging with the US on the implications of the latest tariff announcement and to provide clarity for industry.” The Guardian reported thatBritish officials were intensifying trade talks with the US and hope to see the deal implemented within weeks. A government source said: “Some countries are viewing the court ruling as an indication that they were right not to negotiate over tariffs. We’re taking the opposite view, and trying to get this deal implemented as soon as possible.” Trump and Keir Starmerannounced a US-UK trade deal earlier this monthunder which on British steel and aluminium will be reduced to zero, and tariffs on up to 100,000 British cars a year will be reduced from 25% to 10%. The deal did not cover Trump’s blanket 10% tariffs on all foreign imports, which afederal court overturned last week, arguing that the US president had overstepped his powers. Anappeals court paused the rulingand said Trump’s tariffs could continue while it examines the arguments. The European Commission said on Saturday that it “strongly” regretted Trump’s decision to double steel and aluminium tariffs, and warned that the EU was prepared to retaliate. “This decision adds further uncertainty to the global economy and increases costs for consumers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic,” a spokesperson for the commission said, adding that “the tariff increase also undermines ongoing efforts to reach a negotiated solution”. “The EU is prepared to impose countermeasures, including in response to the latest U.S. tariff increase.” “The European Commission is currently finalising consultations on expanded countermeasures. If no mutually acceptable solution is reached, both existing and additional EU measures will automatically take effect on 14 July – or earlier, if circumstances require.”",

About 250 million honeybees flew free of the truck around 4am a few miles south of Canada. The truck that was transporting around 70,000lbs of hives and honeybees rolled over on a road in north-westernWashington state. Local sheriff deputies and bee experts swarmed to the scene, where they removed the box hives to help recover and rescue as many bees as possible. The driver of the truck was not injured. Hours later, officials could not bee-lieve that the bees began to swarm and sting the deputies. Some sheriff deputies took refuge in their patrol cars to avoid the stinging swarm. According to a sheriff’s spokesperson, the driver was neither drunk nor buzzed; rather, the driver likely did not navigate a sharp turn well enough, causing the trailer to roll.

    "article_text": "An undocumented man who was accused by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) secretary,Kristi Noem, last week of threatening to assassinateDonald Trumpin a letter may have been framed by someone accused of previously attacking the man, according to news reports. Investigators are said to be looking into whether the letter was an attempt to get the man deported, to prevent him from testifying against his alleged attacker. The extremely public accusation against the 54-year-old father of three, Ramon Morales-Reyes, led to his arrest and detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officials. News reports fromCNN,ABCand theAssociated Pressdetail Morales-Reyes’ case and how Noem’s highly publicized accusation against him appears to have unraveled. Prior to Noem accusing Morales-Reyes of threatening to kill the president, local investigators in Milwaukee were already reportedly investigating whether the letter was a setup. Morales-Reyes was allegedly assaulted by a man in September 2023, who slashed him with a box cutter before stealing his bike. As the case prepared to go to trial, Ice this month received the letter threatening to assassinate Trump. “I will self deport myself back to Mexico but not before I use my 30 yard 6 to shoot your precious president,” the handwritten letter says, which was completely written in English and signed with Morales-Reyes’ name. Morales-Reyes was arrested and detained. But local investigators compared Morales-Reyes’ handwriting with the letter and found they did not match. Meanwhile, activists and attorneys began working on his case. Local Wisconsin immigration advocates and attorneys, with Morales-Reyes’ family, said during a press release on Friday that Morales-Reyes did not write the letter. “A family member called our organizers, letting us know that this was impossible, as her father had very little formal education and could not read or write in Spanish – let alone perfect English,” said Christine Neumann-Ortiz, the executive director of Voces de la Frontera, an immigrant advocacy organization. Citing police documents it had obtained, CNN reported that Milwaukee officials on Monday began reviewing jailhouse calls from the individual accused of having assaulted Morales-Reyes and discovered he discussed sending letters to Ice in order to frame his alleged victim. He reportedly wanted to have Morales-Reyes deported to prevent him from testifying in the robbery trial. “He outta there,” the person said in a phone call earlier in May, according to the CNN report, and described how Trump’s return to office was increasing deportations. On Wednesday, Noem began sharing the accusation against Morales-Reyes, along with his photo and an image of the letter, which were posted in a press release on the DHS website. The accusation quickly spread on social media and rightwing, Trump-allied sites.

After the 2023 assault, Morales-Reyes applied for a U-visa – a special visa provided to undocumented victims of crime that may lead to a pathway to legal residency. The process to obtain a U-visa is lengthy and complicated. It is unclear whether Noem will issue a correction on the matter, if Morales-Reyes will be able to testify against the alleged perpetrator or how his U-visa application process may be affected by him being placed in Ice detention.",

    "article_text": "US immigrationauthorities are collecting and uploading the DNA information of migrants, including children, to a national criminal database, according to government documents released earlier this month. The database includes the DNA of people who were either arrested or convicted of a crime, which law enforcement uses when seeking a match for DNA collected at a crime scene. However, most of the people whose DNA has been collected by Customs and Border Patrol (CBP), the agency that published the documents, were not listed as having been accused of any felonies. Regardless, CBP is now creating a detailed DNA profile on migrants that will be permanently searchable by law enforcement, which amounts to a “massive expansion of geneticsurveillance”, one expert said. The DNA information is stored in a database managed by theFBIcalled the Combined DNA Index System (Codis), which is used across the country by local, state and federal law enforcement to identify suspects of crimes using their DNA data. Wired firstreportedthe practice and the existence of these documents, and estimates there are more than 133,000 migrant teens and children whose DNA has been collected and uploaded to Codis. One of them was just four years old. “In order to secure our borders, CBP is devoting every resource available to identify who is entering our country. We are not letting human smugglers, child sex traffickers and other criminals enter American communities,” Hilton Beckham, the assistant commissioner of public affairs at CBP, told Wired in a statement. “Toward this end, CBP collects DNA samples for submission to the FBI’s Combined DNA Index System … from persons in CBP custody who are arrested on federal criminal charges, and from aliens detained under CBP’s authority who are subject to fingerprinting and not otherwise exempt from the collection requirement.” Experts at Georgetown University and the Center on Privacy and Technology published areportlast week that found that CBP was collecting the DNA of almost every migrant detained, regardless of how long they were detained. The agency has added more than 1.5m DNA profiles to Codis since 2020, a 5,000% increase in just three years, according to the report. It’s a “massive expansion of genetic surveillance and an unjustified invasion of privacy,” according to one of the authors of the report, Emerald Tse. “The program reinforces harmful narratives about immigrants and intensifies existing policing practices that target immigrant communities and communities of color, making us all less safe,” Tse said in a statement. The documents CBP published, which detail each individual whose DNA was swabbed, their age and country of origin, where they were transferred to, and what they were charged with, date back to as early as 2020. The latest document published is from the first quarter of 2025. There are hundreds of thousands of entries of people whose DNA has been collected by CBP between 2020 and 2024. Of the more than 130,000 individuals who were children or teens, nearly 230 were children under the age of 13 and more than 30,000 were between 14 and 17 years old, according to Wired. CBP first launched apilot programto begin collecting detainees’ DNA data in 2020, in accordance with a Department of Justice rule that gave the agency three years to comply with a new requirement to collect genetic samples and upload it to Codis. At the time, CBP wrote that it was collecting DNA data from non-US citizens who had been detained between the ages of 14 and 79. The Department of Homeland Security and CBP policy generally states that children under 14 are not obliged to have their DNA information collected, though there is some discretion afforded to field officers. However, this pace of genetic data collection would not have been possible in a criminal legal context, according to the Center onPrivacyand Technology and Georgetown report. “Until 2020, almost all the DNA profiles in Codis’s ‘offender’ database were added by state and local police and other criminal law enforcement agencies,” the report reads. “In the criminal context, there are some limitations on when, how and from whom criminal law enforcement agencies can take DNA which make the process of amassing samples cumbersome and resource-intensive.” Sign up toTechScape A weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives after newsletter promotion The expansion was possible partly because there are fewer limitations on DNA collection within the context of immigration. “In the immigration context, the only limitation on DNA collection is that a person must be ‘detained’. But the meaning of the term ‘detained’ in the immigration context is notoriously broad, vague and ever shifting,” the report reads. According to the CBP website, the agency sends the DNA data directly to the FBI and does not store or maintain the DNA data itself. That genetic information is stored by the FBI indefinitely, according to the Center on Privacy and Technology and Georgetown report. “How would it change your behavior to know that the government had a drop of your blood – or saliva – containing your ‘entire genetic code, which will be kept indefinitely in a government-controlled refrigerator in a warehouse in Northern Virginia’?” the report reads, quoting CBP’s documents. “Would you feel free to seek out the medical or reproductive care you needed? To attend protests and voice dissent? To gather together with the people of your choosing?”",

    "title": "Idaho murder case runs into problems but suspect set for August trial",
    "article_text": "Bryan Kohberger, the suspect accused of killing four young University ofIdahostudents in 2022, is set to go to trial in August in a case that could see him sentenced to death. He is charged with the murders of Madison Mogen, Kaylee Goncalves, Xana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin – who were together in the same house when someone broke in at night and stabbed them to death. But the case is running into problems, not least a failure by prosecutors to ascribe a motive for the killings, which terrified a region and shocked the US amid a media frenzy around the crime. Last week, Kohberger’s attorneys requested a trial delay, citing in part intense publicity around the case generated in part by a recent NBC Dateline special they claim was prejudicial to their client because it contained apparent prosecution leaks in violation of a non-dissemination order. The leaks included information that the phone belonging to Kohberger connected 23 times in four months to a cellphone tower near the rented home where the four students were killed. And also that he searched the internet for information about serial killer Ted Bundy as well as for pornography with the keywords “drugged”, “sleeping” and “passed out”. The defense is arguing it now requires more time to prepare for trial because of the publicity around that information. Further problems may arise in July with the pre-trial publication of TheIdahoFour, by the crime writer James Patterson and the journalist Vicky Ward, who ran afoul of a judge in South Carolina after obtaining crime-scene photos and documents in a civil claim related to that state’s notorious Alex Murdaugh double murder case. Kohberger’s attorneys have said the blurb for the book “suggests that the apparent Dateline leak was not the only violation of this court’s non-dissemination order” and a delay might mitigate the “prejudicial effects of such inflammatory pretrial publicity”. Idaho judge Steven Hippler has said he is open to appointing a special prosecutor to question people under oath to determine the origin of the leaks. But whether or not a delay is granted, a number of recent court rulings have been going against Kohberger, who has pleaded not guilty. His defense team has tried to keep considerable evidence, including a 911 call alerting police to the crime; the description of a man with “bushy eyebrows” at the house around the time of the murders; and his Amazon shopping history, including the purchase of a knife similar to the one the alleged assailant was said to have used, out of the trial. Amazon records show that an account under Kohberger’s name and email address bought a Ka-Bar knife, sheath and sharpener in March 2022, eight months before the murders, and had them shipped to his parents’ home in Pennsylvania, where he was later arrested. A brown leather Ka-Bar knife sheath was found, police said, next to one victim’s body and DNA on the clasp matched to Kohberger. Kohberger’s defense team claims his Amazon purchase history was “out of context, incomplete and unfairly prejudicial”, but Hippler ruled it was “highly relevant” and “establishes significant connection between the defendant and Ka-Bar knife and sheath”. In another ruling against the defence, Hippler turned down a request to exclude the criminology student’s 12-page master’s essay from being presented as evidence in the trial. In it, Kohberger assessed how to handle a crime scene where a woman has been found stabbed to death. Other rulings going against the suspect involve evidence about his white Hyundai Elantra – a similar make and model of car that prosecutors say the killer drove and which was captured on security video near the home before the murders and leaving soon after. Nor has the judge allowed defense requests that the death penalty option be dropped because their client was once diagnosed with autism. Hippler instead ruled that the defense can only introduce the diagnosis if Kohberger testifies in his own defense or as a mitigating factor is he is convicted. But Hippler has also ruled that Kohberger’s defense was permitted to keep a court filing ‘in support of … alternate perpetrators” sealed from public view. It is not yet clear if defense claims of another perpetrator, or perpetrators, claimed to be in the documents will be permitted at trial. Absent from the prosecutors’ filings to date are any attempts to ascribe a motive for Kohberger’s alleged actions. Forensic psychiatrist Carole Lieberman hassaidshe believes Kohberger’s decision to study psychology and then criminology was because he was “trying to calm the demons inside of him” and simultaneously “trying to learn how to commit the perfect crime”. To the Guardian last week she went further, arguing that the bloody crime scene and use of a knife was evidence that Kohberger harbored rage against young women. Kohberger, she claimed, had held this rage since at least middle school, when he had a crush on a cheerleader – said to have looked like Kaylee Goncalves – only for her to reject him. “I think that’s why he stalked and killed them,” she said. According to some reports, Kohhberg followed Mogen and Goncalves on Instagram. The defence denies the claim and argues there is no motive to find because Kohberger did not commit the crime. Louis Schlesinger, a professor of psychology at John Jay College, said it should be noted that Kohberger’s alleged crime was a targeted mass killing, not a serial killing, because there were two others in the home at the time, including a surviving roommate, who reported seeing an intruder with “bushy eyebrows”, and were not attacked. “This seems to be situationally based, so you can rule out psychosis or impulsivity,” Schlesinger said, “and it doesn’t appear to be sexually motivated. It could be jealousy or a feeling of rejection or humiliation. But we really don’t know the motive was.” But that doesn’t mean a jury would not want prosecutors to at least imply a motive. “Jurors want to hear a motive before they send someone to the execution chamber,” he said. “They will want to know why he did it.”",

    "title": "South Korea’s snap presidential election 2025: All you need to know",
    "article_text": "Voters in South Korea are choosing a new president to replace Yoon Suk-yeol who was impeached andremoved from officeover his brief and ill-fatedmartial law bidin December. The snap election on June 3 is pivotal, with implications for South Korea’s democratic future, as well as its ties with China, the United States and its nuclear armed neighbour, North Korea. The winner – who will serve a single term of five-years – faces the task of addressing the fallout from the martial law decree, which lasted six hours but unleashed political chaos, including mass protests, a riot at a court and three caretaker leaders in six months. The new president will also have to tackle a deepening economic downturn and manage tariff negotiations with the US, which has imposed a 25 percent levy on key exports such as steel, aluminium and automobiles. Here’s what you need to know about the June 3 poll: There are six candidates on the ballot, but the main contenders areLee Jae-myungof the opposition Democratic Party of Korea (DP), andKim Moon-sooof the governing conservative People Power Party (PPP). Lee, 61, a human rights lawyer-turned-politician, is the clear frontrunner. A Gallup Korea poll on May 28 showed 49 percent of respondents favoured the liberal candidate, while 36 percent said they would vote for Kim, 73, a staunch conservative who served as labour minister in Yoon’s government. Trailing in third place is Lee Jun-seok of the conservative New Reform Party, at 9 percent. Yoon’s botched martial law bid has cast a shadow over the race. It put Lee, who lost the last election to Yoon in 2022, back on track for the presidency. The leader of the opposition was instrumental in foiling the president’s plan. On December 3, when Yoon declared martial law – in a bid to quash the Democratic Party-dominated parliament, which he portrayed as “anti-state” and a “den of criminals” – Lee rushed to the National Assembly and climbed the walls of the building to avoid the hundreds of armed troops deployed there. He livestreamed his exploit, urging supporters to come to the parliament and prevent the arrest of legislators. Despite the troop blockades, enough legislators managed to make it to the parliament and vote to end martial law. The assembly went on to impeach Yoon on December 14. “This election would not have happened if not for the declaration of martial law by Yoon Suk-yeol and his impeachment,” said Youngshik Bong, research fellow at Yonsei University in Seoul. “These issues have sucked in all others like a vortex. Everything else is marginal.” On the campaign trail, Lee has pledged to bring to justice anyone involved in Yoon’s failed bid and has also promised to introduce tighter controls on the president’s ability to declare martial law. Lee, the opposition leader, has also proposed constitutional changes to introduce a four-year, two-term presidency – at the moment, South Korean presidents are only allowed a single term of five years. Lee has also argued for a run-off system for presidential elections, whereby if no candidate secures 50 percent of the popular vote, the top two candidates take on each other in a second round. “A four-year, two-term presidency would allow for a midterm evaluation of the administration, reinforcing responsibility,” he wrote on Facebook, calling for a constitutional amendment to enable the change. “Meanwhile, adopting a run-off election system would enhance the legitimacy of democratic governance and help reduce unnecessary social conflict.” The PPP’s Kim has accepted Lee’s proposals for a constitutional amendment to allow a two-term presidency, but has suggested shortening each term to three years. Yoon’s martial law bid, however, has left the PPP in crisis anddisarray. Infighting plagued the embattled party as it tried to choose the impeached president’s successor. Although Kim won the party primary, its leaders tried to replace him with former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo. On the eve of the party’s campaign launch, they cancelled Kim’s candidacy, only to reinstate him after party members opposed the move. Bong, at Yonsei University, said the infighting as well as divisions in the conservative camp over Yoon’s decree has cost it support. “Kim Moon-soo has not set his position clearly on the martial law declaration,” Bong said. “He has not distanced himself from the legacy of Yoon, but at the same time, he has not made it clear whether he believes the declaration of martial law was a violation of the constitution. So the PPP has not really had enough energy to mobilise its support bases.” Still, Kim appears to have eroded what was a more than 20 percent point gap with Lee at the start of the campaign. But he has failed to convince the third placed contender – Lee Jun-seok – to abandon his bid and back the PPP to improve its chances. The New Reform Party’s Lee, who is 40 years old, said on Tuesday there would be “no candidate merger” with “those responsible for the emergency martial law”. Although policy debates have taken a backseat, the outcome of the election could reorient South Korea’s approach towards North Korea. The two neighbours are technically in a state of war as the Korean War of 1950-1953 ended in an armistice rather than a peace treaty, and ties between them are at a new low. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has called for rewriting his country’s constitution to scrap the longstanding goal of unifying the war-divided nations and described Seoul as an “invariable principal enemy”. Pyongyang has also severed communication lines, and the two countries have clashed over balloons and drones carrying rubbish and propaganda. Lee of the Democratic Party has promised to ease tensions if elected, including by restoring a military hotline, and committed to maintaining the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons from the Korean Peninsula. Kim, however, has backed Yoon’s hardline approach, promising to secure “pre-emptive deterrence” through tools such as ballistic missiles and the redeployment of US tactical nuclear weapons. He has said he would also seek a path for the country to pursue nuclear armament by securing the right to reprocess nuclear fuel, a key step towards building atomic weapons. The two candidates also differ in their approach to the US, the country’s most important security ally, and to China, its biggest trading partner. Lee, who espouses what he calls a pragmatic foreign policy, has said it is crucial to maintain South Korea’s alliance with the US and pursue security cooperation with Japan. However, he has pledged to prioritise “national interests” and said there’s “no need to unnecessarily antagonise China or Russia”. Kim, meanwhile, has questioned Lee’s commitment to the US-South Korea alliance, and has promised to hold an immediate summit meeting with US President Donald Trump if elected to discuss tariffs. “I have a very friendly and trusting relationship,” with the US leader, Kim has said. He has also indicated a willingness to discuss sharing more of the cost of stationing US troops in the country, something Trump has demanded for years. Lee Sung-yoon, board member of the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea, described the policy differences between the rival camps as “immutable” and referred to earlier comments by the Democratic Party’s Lee, because of which some view him as being soft on China and Russia. “In the past, Lee has said South Korea should not get involved in China’s posture towards Taiwan, and just say thank you to both Beijing and Taiwan and stay out of the conflict. He has said of the trilateral defensive drills among US, Japan and South Korea as ‘a defence disaster’ and an ‘extremely pro-Japanese act’. And more than once he has said that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy incited Russia to invade because he was a political novice who said unfortunate things.” The analyst said Lee has – over the course of the election campaign – tried to walk back some of his statements in a bid to appeal to more moderate voters. However, “I would venture to guess that people sitting in the councils of power in Washington, DC, or Tokyo or in Kyiv, Ukraine, are not overly jubilant at the prospect of a Lee administration,” he said. Koreans overseas have already cast their ballots, and early voting took place on Thursday and Friday. Large numbers of people turned out for the early vote, including the two frontrunners. According to the National Election Commission, some 44.4 million people in the country of 52 million are eligible to vote. On election day, which is a public holiday, polling stations will open at 6am (22:00 GMT) and close at 8pm (20:00 GMT). Counting will begin immediately and the winner will be known that evening or in the early hours of the following day. The candidate who receives the most votes will be deemed the winner, even if they don’t win 50 percent of the votes.",

    "title": "Hamas says ceasefire proposal offers ‘no guarantees’ for end to Gaza war",
    "article_text": "The Palestinian group Hamas has submitted its response to a United States-backed ceasefire proposal, but a leading official from the group said the proposed deal offered “no guarantees to end the war”. Speaking to Al Jazeera on Saturday, Basem Naim said that Hamas had still “responded positively” to the latest proposal relayed to it by US special envoy Steve Witkoff, despite the Palestinian group saying that the proposal was different to one it had agreed upon with Witkoff a week earlier. “One week ago, we agreed with Mr Witkoff on one proposal, and we said, ‘This is acceptable, we can consider this a negotiating paper,'” Naim said. “He went to the other party, to the Israelis, to get their response. Instead of having a response to our proposal, he brought us a new proposal … which had nothing to do with what we agreed upon.” In a statement released earlier on Saturday, Hamas had said that it had submitted a response to Witkoff, and that the proposal “aims to achieve a permanent ceasefire, a comprehensive withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, and ensure the flow of aid” to Palestinians in Gaza. Hamas added that 10 living Israeli captives would be released as part of the agreement, as well as the bodies of 18 dead Israelis, in exchange for an “agreed-upon number of Palestinian prisoners”. Witkoff called Hamas’s response “totally unacceptable”. “Hamas should accept the framework proposal we put forward as the basis for proximity talks, which we can begin immediately this coming week,” the envoy said in a post on social media. “That is the only way we can close a 60-day ceasefire deal in the coming days in which half of the living hostages and half of those who are deceased will come home to their families, and in which we can have at the proximity talks substantive negotiations in good-faith to try to reach a permanent ceasefire.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu slammed Hamas’s response, “As Witkoff said, Hamas’s response is unacceptable and sets the situation back. Israel will continue its action for the return of our hostages and the defeat of Hamas.” Israel has now killed more than 54,000 Palestinians since October 2023, with starvation looming across Gaza after weeks of Israeli blockade, and only a small flow of aid since Israel allowed it to resume in mid-May. With hopes for a permanent truce seemingly fading once again, the level of hunger and desperation inside Gaza grows, with Israel allowing only a trickle of humanitarian aid into the Strip after it had imposed a total blockade for more than two months. The UN warned on Friday that all of the 2.3 million population of Gaza is now at risk of famine. That came after it said in mid-May that one in every five Palestinians there is experiencing starvation. The World Food Programme (WFP), which has enough food ready near Gaza’s borders to feed the besieged territory’s entire population for two months, renewed its call for an immediate ceasefire as the only way to get the food to starving Palestinians. The UN’s food agency said in a statement that it brought 77 trucks loaded with flour into Gaza overnight and early on Friday, but they were stopped by people trying to feed their starving families. The US- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) is continuing with its owncontroversial aid distribution, which other aid groups say could violate humanitarian principles and militarise the delivery of desperately needed food. The Gaza Government Media Office said this week that at least 10 Palestinians had been killed by Israeli forces while trying to get aid. “We went to this new area and we came out empty-handed,” resident Layla al-Masri said of a new GHF distribution point. “What they are saying about their will to feed the people of Gaza are lies. They neither feed people nor give them anything to drink.” Another displaced Palestinian, Abdel Qader Rabie, said people across the besieged territory have nothing left to feed their families. “There’s no flour, no food, no bread. We have nothing at home,” he said. Rabie said that every time he tries to get a box of aid at the GHF, he is swarmed by hundreds of other people trying to get it. “If you are strong, you get aid. If you are not, you leave empty-handed,” Rabie added. There are also other risks. Families have reported that people have gone missing after reaching GHF distribution points. “One of these cases is a man from the al-Mughari family – The family is appealing to the ICRC, OCHA, the civil defence teams, to go and search for him in that area – very close to the Netzarim Corridor [in central Gaza],” said Hind Khoudary, reporting from Deir el-Balah, central Gaza. Israeli authorities rejected the accusation, Khoudary added. The Israeli army is continuing its attacks on Gaza, with the spokesperson of the territory’s civil defence saying that approximately 60 homes had been bombed in the last 48 hours in Gaza City and northern Gaza. On Saturday, there were also reports from across Gaza of the Israeli bombing killing at least 20 Palestinians. More than 3,900 Palestinians have been killed since Israel unilaterally broke a ceasefire in March and resumed its devastation of Gaza, despite growing international condemnation. Since Friday’s early hours, the Israeli army has also ordered “all residents” of southern Khan Younis, Bani Suheila, and Abasan to evacuate immediately after it said rockets were earlier fired. “The [army] will aggressively attack any area used as a launching pad for terrorist activity,” military spokesperson Avichay Adraee said in a statement. The area of southern Gaza “has been warned several times in the past and has been designated a dangerous combat zone”, he added. According to the UN, nearly 200,000 people have been displaced in the past two weeks alone, with displacement orders now covering the entirety of Gaza’s northernmost and southernmost governorates, as well as the eastern parts of each of the three governorates in between.",

    "title": "PSG beat Inter Milan 5-0 with Doue double to win Champions League",
    "article_text": "Paris Saint-Germain are the champions of Europe after beating Inter Milan bya record 5-0 score linein the Champions League final. At long last, the club that was transformed by Qatari billions, and bought and sold a succession of the world’s greatest players in an extravagant bid to get to the top, has its hands on the big one. It was not only PSG’s first triumph in the final of European club football’s grandest prize, but the winning margin in the match in Munich is also a record for the competition’s final. The trophy that not even Lionel Messi, Neymar or Kylian Mbappe could deliver to the French club was finally claimed by Luis Enrique, the Spanish coach who has overseen PSG’s shift from the era of galactico signings to one of genuine team-building. Fitting then, that Desire Doue, the 19-year-old French forward emblematic of the club’s new generation, was the chief inspiration on a balmy night. He became the third teenager to score in a Champions League final, following Patrick Kluivert and Carlos Alberto. Doue scored twice and set up another goal in little more than an hour on the field, before being substituted in the second half. Achraf Hakimi, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and substitute Senny Mayulu, the fourth teenager to score in a final added to Doue’s double as PSG recorded the biggest win in a final in the Champions League’s 69-year history. Now PSG can truly sit alongside the royalty of European football. Not by virtue of turnover or merchandising, but on the merits of its achievements on the field. The Champions League is the ultimate barometer of the continent’s elite clubs, and up until now, PSG has been a flashy contender that always came up short. That all changed at Allianz Arena, the home of Bayern Munich, one of the titans of Europe, and a fitting stage for PSG’s crowning moment. Not least because it was against Bayern that it lost its only other Champions League final in 2020, leaving Neymar in tears in an empty stadium in Lisbon where fans were locked out because of the pandemic. On this occasion, thousands of PSG supporters were there to revel in the moment, waving flags, lighting flares and drowning out their rivals from Inter, many of whose supporters left the stadium long before the final whistle. They’d been partying in the streets of Munich throughout the day, but that was nothing compared to the scenes of joy when Marquinhos held the trophy aloft in front of teammates, with fireworks and golden confetti exploding behind them. PSG truly delivered when it mattered after so many setbacks in this competition. If there were any nerves from Luis Enrique’s players, it did not show as they dominated Inter from the start. It took just 12 minutes for the French champions to go ahead with a move of speed and precision when Vitinha’s threaded pass into the box found the feet of Doue. The forward could have shot, but instead slid in Hakimi to tap into an open net. Former Inter player Hakimi’s celebrations were muted, but PSG’s fans erupted. Eight minutes later and the lead was doubled, although this time it relied more on luck than precision, as Doue’s shot from the right of the box deflected off Federico Dimarco and past Inter goalkeeper Yann Sommer. He got his second in the 63rd, sliding the ball into the bottom corner when through on goal. Kvaratskhelia added a fourth 10 minutes later, and Mayulu then found the back of the net in the 86th, just two minutes after coming on, adding his name to the list of teenage scorers in a final.",

    "article_text": "Russian drone and missile attacks on Ukraine have killed at least two people, according to officials, as Ukraine ordered the evacuation of 11 more villages in its Sumy region bordering Russia. Russian troops launched an estimated 109 drones and five missiles across Ukraine on Friday and overnight, the Ukrainian air force said on Saturday, adding that three of the missiles and 42 drones were destroyed and another 30 drones failed to reach their targets without causing damage. The attacks came amid uncertainty over whether Kyiv will take part ina new round of peace talksearly next week in Istanbul. In the Russian attacks on Saturday, a child was killed in a strike on the front-line village of Dolynka in the Zaporizhia region, and another was injured, Zaporizhia’s Governor Ivan Fedorov said. “One house was destroyed. The shockwave from the blast also damaged several other houses, cars, and outbuildings,” Fedorov wrote on Telegram. A man was also killed by Russian shelling in Ukraine’s Kherson region, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin wrote on Telegram. Moscow did not comment on either attack. Meanwhile, authorities in Ukraine’s Sumy region said they were evacuating 11 villages within a roughly 30-kilometre (19-mile) range from the Russian border. “The decision was made in view of the constant threat to civilian life as a result of shelling of border communities,” the regional administration said on social media. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said some 50,000 Russian troops have amassed in the area with the intention of launching an offensive to carve out a buffer zone inside Ukrainian territory. Ukraine’s top army chief, Oleksandr Syrskii, said on Saturday that Russian forces were focusing their main offensive efforts on Pokrovsk, Torets and Lyman in the Donetsk region, as well as the Sumy border area. Syrskii added that Ukrainian forces are still holding territory in Russia’s Kursk region – a statement Moscow has repeatedly denied. The evacuations and attacks came just two days before a possible meeting between Kyiv and Moscow in Istanbul, as Washington called on both countries to end the three-year war. Russia has confirmed it will send a delegation, but Kyiv hasnot yet accepted the proposal, warning the talks would not yield results unless the Kremlin provided its peace terms in advance. Zelenskyy said Saturday it was still not clear what Moscow was planning to achieve at the meeting and that so far, it did not “look very serious”.",

    "title": "Saudi Arabia says it will jointly fund Syria state salaries with Qatar",
    "article_text": "Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud has said that the kingdom and Qatar will offer joint financial support to state employees in Syria. His statements came on Saturday during a joint press conference with his Syrian counterpart Asaad al-Shibani in Damascus. The two Gulf nations have been among the most important regional supporters of Syria’s new authorities, who ousted longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in December after nearly 14 years of war. Saturday’s statement did not provide details on the exact amount of the support for Syria’s public sector. However, it comes after Syrian Finance Minister Mohammed Yosr Bernieh said earlier in May that Qatar was going to provide Syria with $29m per month for an initial three months to pay civilian public sector worker salaries. The Reuters news agency had also reported that the United States had given its blessing to the Qatari initiative, which came a few days before President Donald Trump announced thatsanctions on Syria imposed during the al-Assad regime would be lifted. The European Union has since also lifted sanctions on Syria. Further evidence of Saudi Arabian and Qatari support came in mid-May, when it was announced that the two countries hadpaid off Syria’s debt to the World Bank, a sum of roughly $15m. Syria’s new government, led by interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa, has sought to rebuild the country’s diplomatic ties and convince wary Western states that he has turned his back on past ties with groups such as al-Qaeda. The Syrian leader has repeatedly disavowed extremism and expressed support for minorities, but incidents of violence that has led to hundreds of deaths continue to cause international trepidation – even as the government and al-Sharaa denounce the killings. Syria’s new government has also made a concerted effort to solidify ties to Gulf Arab states who have begun to play a pivotal role in financing the reconstruction of Syria’s war-ravaged infrastructure and reviving its economy. On Tuesday, the European Unionannouncedit had adopted legal acts lifting all economic restrictive measures on Syria except those based on security grounds. It also removed 24 entities from the EU list of those subject to the freesing of funds and economic resources, including the Central Bank of Syria. And after Saudi Arabia and Qatar cleared Syria’s debt to the World Bank, the US-based financial institution said that it would restart operations in the country following a 14-year pause. The World Bank has begun to prepare its first project in Syria, which will focus on improving electricity access – a key pillar for revitalising essential services like healthcare, education, and water supply. It also marked the start of expanded support to stabilise Syria and boostlong-term growth. Syria’s gradual re-integration into the global economy is in large part due to Trump’s dramatic shift in Washington’s policies towards the country. After announcing the lifting of US sanctions on May 13, Trump also became the first US president in 25 years to meet with a Syrian counterpart. The US had already removed a $10m reward for the capture of al-Sharaa, and the Syrian president has been able to travel internationally and meet world leaders, including in Saudi Arabia and France. Still, there is a lot to be done. A February report by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) estimated that at current growth rates, Syria would need more than 50 years to return to the economic level it had before the war, and it called for massive investment to accelerate the process. The UNDP study said nine out of 10 Syrians now live in poverty, one-quarter are jobless and Syria’s gross domestic product “has shrunk to less than half of its value” in 2011, the year the war began.",

    "title": "India top general admits aerial ‘losses’ in recent conflict with Pakistan",
    "article_text": "India’s chief of defence staff says the country suffered initial losses in the air during a recent military conflict with neighbouring Pakistan, but declined to give details. “What was important is, why did these losses occur, and what we will do after that,” General Anil Chauhan told the Reuters news agency on Saturday on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue security forum in Singapore. India and Pakistan were engaged in afour-day conflictthis month, their worst standoff since 1999, before a ceasefire was agreed on May 10. More than 70 people were killed in missile, drone and artillery fire on both sides, but there are competing claims on the casualties. India says more than 100 “terrorists” were killed in its “precision strikes” on several “terror camps” across Pakistan, which rejects the claim, saying more than 30 Pakistani civilians were killed in the Indian attacks. New Delhi, meanwhile, says nearly two dozen civilians were killed on the Indian side, most of them in Indian-administered Kashmir, along the disputed border. The fighting between the two nuclear powers was triggered by anattack on touristsin Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir on April 22 that killed 26 people, almost all of them tourists. New Delhi blamed Pakistan for supporting the armed group behind the attack, an allegation Islamabad denied. During their conflict, Pakistan had also claimed to have downed at least fiveIndian military jets, including at least three Rafale fighters. But Chauhan on Saturday dismissed it as “absolutely incorrect”, confirming his country had lost at least one aircraft. “I think what is important is that, not the jet being down, but why they were being down,” he told Bloomberg TV in a separate interview in Singapore. On May 11, a day after the ceasefire, India’s Air Marshal AK Bharti told reporters in New Delhi that “all our pilots are back home”, adding that “we are in a combat scenario, and that losses are a part of combat”. Chauhan said on Saturday India switched tactics after suffering losses in the air on the first day of conflict and established a decisive advantage. “So we rectified tactics and then went back on the [May] 7th, 8th and 10th in large numbers to hit airbases deep inside Pakistan, penetrated all their air defences with impunity, carried out precision strikes,” he said. Islamabad has denied it suffered any losses of planes but has acknowledged its airbases suffered some hits, although losses were minimal. Chauhan said while the fighting had ceased, the Indian government had made it clear that it would respond “precisely and decisively should there be any further terror attacks emanating from Pakistan”. “So that has its own dynamics as far [as] the armed forces are concerned. It will require us to be prepared 24/7,” he said. Chauhan also said that although Pakistan is closely allied with China, which borders India in the north and the northeast, there was no sign of any actual help from Beijing during the conflict. “While this was unfolding from [April] 22nd onwards, we didn’t find any unusual activity in the operational or tactical depth of our northern borders, and things were generally all right,” he told Reuters. Asked whether China may have provided any satellite imagery or other real-time intelligence to Pakistan during the conflict, Chauhan said such imagery was commercially available and could have been procured from China as well as other sources.",

    "title": "Enlightened Americans should stay and fight, not leave",
    "article_text": "For all his faults and hubris, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy possesses one unmistakable quality: courage. That became apparent during a memorable moment more than three years ago when Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine. A foreboding, endless column of Russian tanks and other armoured vehicles had breached the border in a pincer pattern. In the halting face of such an intimidating display of overwhelming force, defeat seemed close by. Kyiv looked bound to fall. Zelenskyy and company would be arrested or killed as a lethal exclamation point while Russian President Vladimir Putin installed a puppet regime to bow and obey. The comedian turned unlikely wartime leader did not flinch. He stood his ground – on the sacred soil of Ukraine. To reassure fretful Ukrainians, Zelenskyy posted a shortvideoon social media featuring himself surrounded by several solemn-looking officials and cabinet ministers. “The president is here,” he said. “We are all here … defend[ing] our independence.” I was reminded of that remarkable scene while I read accounts over the past few months from a disparate group of Americans, including artists and academics, departing their beloved homeland in the distressing wake of President Donald Trump’s jarring return to the Oval Office. Before I continue, I am obliged to make two instructive points. First, by invoking Zelenskyy’s vow to remain in Ukraine despite the ominous risks, I do not mean to imply that enlightened Americans opting to forgo living and working in the United States, lack courage. Far from it. Each of us has confronted or will confront in due course a defining dilemma: to stay or to go. Answering the prickly question can stir doubt and anxiety. Making a choice, regardless of the direction, is a bold act. It takes resolve to exchange the familiar for the unknown. Second, I have avoided the word “flee” to describe why some Americans choose to emigrate due to Trump’s egregious modus operandi. “Flee” evokes impulsive panic or self-preservation, rather than thoughtful, deliberate decision-making. Still, Zelenskyy offers a compelling example of why it is necessary to stay instead of escaping to Canada or Europe when a bully threatens the values and principles that you hold dear – fairness, truth, empathy, tolerance, justice, diversity, and intelligence. So, enlightened Americans, I urge you to insist like Zelenskyy: We are all here. Your presence in America to fight for its promise is a duty and responsibility. Together, you can fashion a formidable, immovable buttress against the wretched aspects of Trumpism – its assault on facts, erosion of democratic norms, embrace of authoritarianism, and corrosive pursuit of division and fear. This contest cannot be won remotely – far from the epicentre of the urgent battle. It has to be fought face-to-face with an uncompromising adversary and hand-in-hand with other enlightened Americans, thin on the privileges and resources that have enabled your exit. Trumpism thrives when opposition retreats. Absence creates space for extremism to entrench itself even more deeply and widely into America’s already frayed and discordant fabric. Withdrawal only comforts the Trumpists determined to quash dissent and erase resistance through edicts, threats, and coercion. Leaving can also be seen as an admission of defeat – a concession that an angry, ruptured country is beyond redemption or salvation. Dynamic governance is not self-sustaining; it requires citizens to keep up the struggle, particularly when it is trying. By forsaking the arena, some enlightened Americans forfeit their ability to shape the present and the future. In contrast, standing with and by enlightened Americans remaining behind, confirms that America belongs to all its people, not just the cartoonish characters shouting the loudest or demanding the most attention. Trump welcomes the idea of disheartened Americans building new lives in new places because he is president. It is, I suspect, a point of pride since it suggests his vindictive agenda is working. For Trump, the exodus of “liberal elites” or “out-of-touch” entertainers is proof that the old establishment, never subscribers to his jejune notion of America’s “greatness”, is being replaced by “authentic” patriots. This response is, of course, symptomatic of Trump’s broader political strategy – drawing a Berlin-Wall-like line between “real” Americans – his supporters – and everyone else. By celebrating the phenomenon of Americans parting in protest, he promotes the insidious attitude that protest is not an essential ingredient of a mature, confident nation, but a form of disloyalty. Trump is not interested in unity or persuasion. As such, he frames his presidency as a litmus test of fidelity. If you don’t worship him, you’re encouraged to join the despondent diaspora – and, in his jaundiced view, good riddance. Despite theirargumentsand reservations about resettling to avoid the depressing capitulation of major law firms, universities, and corporate media, Americans face an uncomfortable truth: walking out won’t help drive change. Scholars and intellectuals with the mettle and means to challenge obstinate power should rejoin the fight where it counts: in classrooms, on airwaves, in town halls. Declarations from abroad, however poignant, are not substitutes for showing up, time and again, in person to remind America that kindness, resiliency, and decency matter. Trumpism thrives on spectacle, and few understand the potency of spectacle better than celebrities. Manybidding America adieu did so defiantly, wielding a righteous pulpit from foreign shores. Even so, symbolism without substance is hollow. Returning means tackling – head-on – the mess, the contradictions, the tarnished ideals of a battered nation still worth the imagination and effort. Public figures ought to leverage their popular platforms not just to condemn, but to galvanise, to convey resistance not as elitist scorn but as shared obligation. That would impress more than a pointed opinion column in the New York Times or a thread of disparaging tweets ever could. Zelenskyy knows that hard work is always done on the ground. This is where returnees can make a tangible difference – not as saviours parachuting in, but instead as allies to like-minded collaborators who do that hard work without notice or applause. Trumpism may be ascendant, but it is not invincible. What it fears most is solidarity that bridges class, race, and background – solidarity that declares that America is not Donald Trump’s to disfigure or define. The bruised and disillusioned exiles can reclaim their rightful place in that grave fray – if they come home.

    "title": "Iran rejects IAEA report alleging increased enriched uranium stockpile",
    "article_text": "Iran has rejected a report from the United Nations nuclear watchdog that alleges Tehran has increased its stockpile of highly enriched, near weapons-grade uranium by 50 percent in the last three months. Iran said on Saturday that the accusation from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was “politically motivated and repeates baseless accusations”. It all comes as nuclear deal negotiations are under way between the United States and Iran, with the Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi saying that his country would respond to “elements of a US proposal” his Omani counterpart, Badr Al-Busaidi, had presented during a short visit to Tehran on Saturday. Araghchi said that the proposal would be “responded to in line with the principles, national interests and rights of the people of Iran”. Tehran insists that itsnuclear programmeis for peaceful purposes only. The IAEA said that as of May 17, Iran had amassed 408.6kg (900.8 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60 percent – the only non-nuclear weapon state to do so, according to the UN agency – and had increased its stockpile by almost 50 percent to 133.8kg since its last report in February. The wide-ranging, confidential report seen by several news agencies said Iran carried out secret nuclear activities with material not declared to the IAEA at three locations that have long been under investigation, calling it a “serious concern” and warning Tehran to change its course. The Iranian Foreign Ministry slammed the report, saying the agency had used “forged documents provided by the Zionist regime [Israel]” and reiterated “previous biased and baseless accusations”. Iran refutes allegations of undeclared nuclear sites or activities, stressing that it has instead cooperated with the agency in providing all necessary access to the alleged sites, it said. “The Islamic Republic of Iran, while expressing regret over the publication of this report, which was prepared for political purposes through pressure on the agency, expresses its clear objection to its content,” the statement added. Araghchi reaffirmed the country’s longstanding position, saying Tehran deems nuclear weapons “unacceptable”. “If the issue is nuclear weapons, yes, we too consider this type of weapon unacceptable,” Araghchi, Iran’s lead negotiator in thenuclear talkswith the US, said in a televised speech. “We agree with them on this issue.” But the report, which was requested by the IAEA’s 35-nation board of governors in November, will allow for a push by the US, Britain, France and Germany to declare Iran in violation of its non-proliferation obligations. On Friday, US President Donald Trump said Iran “cannot have a nuclear weapon”. “They don’t want to be blown up. They would rather make a deal,” Trump said, adding: “That would be a great thing that we could have a deal without bombs being dropped all over the Middle East.” In 2015, Iran reached a deal with the United Kingdom, US, Germany, France, Russia, China and the European Union, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. It involved the lifting of some sanctions on Tehran in return for limits on its nuclear development programme. But in 2018, then US President Trump unilaterally quit the agreement and reimposed harsh sanctions. Tehran then rebuilt its stockpiles of enriched uranium. In December last year, the IAEA said Iran was rapidly enriching uranium to 60 percent purity, moving closer to the 90 percent threshold needed for weapons-grade material. Western nations say such intensive enrichment should not be part of a civilian nuclear programme, but Iran insists it is not developing weapons. Hamed Mousavi, professor of political science at Tehran University, told Al Jazeera the IAEA findings could indicate a possible negotiation tool for Iran during its ongoing nuclear talks with the US. “I think both sides are trying to build leverage against the other side. From the Iranian perspective, an advancement in the nuclear programme is going to bring them leverage at the negotiation table with the Americans,” he said. On the other side, he said, the US could threaten more sanctions and may also refer the Iranian case to the UN Security Council for its breach of the 2006 non-proliferation agreement. However, he added that Iran has not made the “political decision” to build a possible bomb. “Enriching up to 60 percent [of uranium] – from the Iranian perspective – is a sort of leverage against the Americans to lift sanctions,” Mousavi said.",

    "title": "‘We lost everything’: 151 dead in Nigeria floods, thousands displaced",
    "article_text": "More than 150 people have been killed and thousands displaced after floods devastated parts of central Nigeria, local authorities said, as rescue teams continue to recover bodies and search for the missing. Theflooding struckthe rural town of Mokwa in Niger State following torrential rains that began late on Wednesday and continued into Thursday. The death toll has risen to 151 after more bodies were recovered nearly 10km (6 miles) from Mokwa, said Ibrahim Audu Husseini, a spokesman for the Niger State Emergency Management Agency (NSEMA) on Saturday. The death toll is in reality likely to be higher, said Al Jazeera’s Ahmed Idris, reporting from Mokwa. “The usual thing is when an official tells you 151 are dead or missing, you are likely to multiply that by two, three or four,” said Idris. At least 3,018 people have been displaced, while 265 houses were “completely destroyed” in the floods, he said, adding that many victims were believed to have been swept down the Niger River, warning that the toll could still rise. President Bola Tinubu extended his condolences overnight and said search-and-rescue operations were ongoing with the support of Nigeria’s security forces. “Relief materials and temporary shelter assistance are being deployed without delay,” he wrote in a post on social media. “We lost everything, the families. We don’t have anywhere else to go, the property has gone,” Mohammed Tanko, a local, told Al Jazeera. “We lost at least 15 from this house.” Another survivor said: “I escaped with only my nightdress. Right now, I can’t even identify where our home used to be.” “The grim task of recovering bodies and what little the residents and victims of this disaster can is what’s been going on since we arrived here in the early afternoon,” said Idris, standing in front of a dilapidated house as children and adults alike dig for belongings and bodies. “When we arrived here, we were told by locals that when the floodwaters started coming in Mokwa, more bodies were flowing in from more villages upstream and so this used to be where homes were. Several homes, over 300 of them, were washed away or completely destroyed by the flood waters,” said Idris, as clothes and residents’ other belongings lied scattered in piles across the ground. Residents believe that the floods may have been caused by “a bigger problem upstream, maybe a dam burst, but up to now officials are not confirming that”, said Idris. “But the amount of water that came into this community is so much that nobody had any time to prepare to evacuate.” Meteorologists warn that more rain is expected in the coming days, raising fears of further flooding across the region. Flooding is a regular threat during Nigeria’s six-month rainy season, but experts say the frequency and severity of these disasters are increasing due toclimate change, unregulated construction, and poor drainage infrastructure. “Flooding has become an annual event, between the months of April and October,” Ugonna Nkwunonwo, a flood risk analyst at the University of Nigeria, told Al Jazeera. He warned that while flood risks have long been identified, “there has not been much political power to implement this change”. “This flooding is a result of climate change, which is affecting the frequency and intensity of rainfall,” he said. “The amount of rain you expect in a year could probably come in one or two months, and people are not prepared for that kind of rainfall.” Last year, more than 1,200 people died and up to two million were displaced by similar disasters across Nigeria. “This tragic incident serves as a timely reminder of the dangers associated with building on waterways and the critical importance of keeping drainage channels and river paths clear,” the National Emergency Management Agency said in a statement.",

Only a handful of countries – including China – have agreed to host Taliban government ambassadors since their return to power in 2021, with no country yet formally recognising the administration. Pakistan is the fourth country to designate an ambassador to Kabul, after China, the United Arab Emirates and Uzbekistan. Russia last month said it would also accredit a Taliban government ambassador, days after removing the group’s “terrorist” designation. For the past few months, relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan have been rocky over security concerns and a campaign by Islamabad to expel tens of thousands ofAfghan refugees. Islamabad says armed groups which launch attacks inside Pakistan use Afghan soil. Kabul denies the allegation, saying such violence is Pakistan’s domestic problem to handle. However, Foreign Minister Dar on Friday said relations between the two nations have improved since he visited Kabul last month. Last week, he also met Muttaqi and their Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, during atrilateral meetingin Beijing. Following that meeting, China said it will “continue to assist with improving Afghanistan-Pakistan ties”.",

    "title": "Arab ministers condemn Israel’s ‘ban’ on planned West Bank visit",
    "article_text": "The foreign ministers of five Arab countries who had planned to visit theoccupied West Bankthis weekend have condemned Israel’s decision to block their plans. The ministers condemned “Israel’s decision to ban the delegation’s visit to Ramallah [on Sunday] to meet with the president of the State of Palestine, Mahmud Abbas”, the Jordanian foreign ministry said in a statement on Saturday. Ministers from Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were expected to take part in the meeting alongside Turkiye. Israel late on Friday said it will not allow the meeting of Arab foreign ministers, who would have required Israeli consent to travel to the occupied West Bank from Jordan because Israel controls the Palestinian territory’s borders and airspace. “The Palestinian Authority – which to this day refuses to condemn the October 7 massacre – intended to host in Ramallah a provocative meeting of foreign ministers from Arab countries to discuss the promotion of the establishment of a Palestinian state,” the Israeli official said late on Friday. “Israel will not cooperate with such moves aimed at harming it and its security.” In a post on X, Hussein Al Sheikh, the deputy chair of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), said Israel’s decision is a “dangerous escalation that reflects arrogant, provocative, and unprecedented behavior”. “We are examining, along with our Arab brothers, how to respond to this decision,” he wrote. The Israeli move came ahead of an international conference, co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, due to be held in New York on June 17-20 to discuss the issue of Palestinian statehood. Israel has come under increasing pressure from the United Nations and European countries which favour a two-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, under which an independent Palestinian state would exist alongside Israel. French President Emmanuel Macron said on Friday that recognising a Palestinian state was not only a “moral duty but a political necessity”. Last week,Israeli forces opened firenear a diplomatic convoy near Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, triggering an international outcry. The convoy included diplomats from the European Union, the United Kingdom, Russia and China. The Israeli military claimed its soldiers fired “warning shots” after the group deviated from an agreed-upon route. Israel has also allowed the expansion ofillegal settlementsin the occupied Palestinian territory, with the government announcing plans to establish 22 new settlements, including retroactively legalising a number of unauthorised outposts. The move has been condemned by Palestinian officials and global human rights groups. The International Court of Justice declared last July that Israel’s longstanding occupation of Palestinian territories is illegal, and called for the evacuation of all settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Since the start of the Israeli war on Gaza on October 7, 2023, at least 972 Palestinians have been killed and more than 7,000 injured in attacks by the Israeli army and settlers across the occupied West Bank, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. An estimated 1,139 people were killed in Israel during the Hamas-led attacks on October 7 and more than 200 were taken captive. Since then, at least 54,381 Palestinians have been killed in the Gaza Strip and 124,054 wounded, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. The Strip’s Government Media Office has updated the death toll to more than 61,700, saying thousands of people missing under the rubble are presumed dead.",

    "title": "Gaza ‘hungriest place on Earth’, all its people at risk of famine, UN warns",
    "article_text": "Gaza is the “hungriest place on Earth” and its entire population is at risk of famine, warns the United Nations, as desperate Palestinians are shot at, starved, and forced from their homes by the Israeli forces. Calling on Israel to stop its campaign ofdeliberate starvationand allow food into the besieged enclave, the UN on Friday said its mission to help Gaza’s Palestinians is the “most obstructed in recent history”. “The aid operation that we have ready to roll is being put in an operational straitjacket that makes it one of the most obstructed aid operations, not only in the world today, but in recent history,” the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) spokesperson, Jens Laerke, said. He said out of 900 aid trucks that were approved to enter from the Israeli side of the Karem Abu Salem crossing, known as Kerem Shalom in Israel, fewer than 600 have been offloaded in Gaza, adding that alower amount of aidhad been picked up for distribution. “I have no flour, no oil, no sugar, no food. I collect mouldy bread and feed it to my children. I want to get a bag of flour for my children. I want to eat. I’m hungry,” a Palestinian told Al Jazeera. Reporting from Gaza City, Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud said the northern part of the Strip, which includes Gaza City, “has not seen a drop of aid coming in that has been allowed in the past few days”. “People in the central area, in the [southern] city of Khan Younis and Rafah are also struggling on a daily basis to find food supplies, particularly when it comes to flour and other basic necessities to help them survive these difficult conditions,” he added. After a nearly three-month blockade, Israel, under pressure from Western governments and international humanitarian organisations, allowed limited aid to enter the enclave and the resumption of limited UN operations. However, Israel also pushed for the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a shadowy United States-backed private aid distributor, to provide essential food aid to starving Palestinians. The UN and other aid groups have refused to work with GHF, saying itlacks neutralityand its distribution model forces the displacement of Palestinians. Still, UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters on Friday that while any aid that gets to those who need it is “good”, aid deliveries are having “very, very little impact”. “The catastrophic situation in Gaza is the worst since the war began,” he said. With only three of the four distribution points set up to receive aid from the GHF, people like Layla al-Masri, a displaced Palestinian, are leaving empty-handed. “What they are saying about their will to feed the people of Gaza is all lies. They neither feed people nor give them anything to drink,” she said. Abdel Qader Rabie, another displaced Palestinian, said his family hasnothing to eat. “No flour, no food, no bread, we have nothing at home,” he said. “Every time I go to get aid, I hold a box and hundreds of people crowd over me. Earlier, UNRWA [UN agency for Palestinian refugees] used to send me a message, [and] I would go and get aid. Now there’s nothing. If you are strong, you get aid. If you are not, you leave empty-handed,” Qader Rabie said. Eri Kaneko, UN humanitarian affairs spokesperson, also criticised the type of aid that UN agencies are being allowed to bring into Gaza. “Israeli authorities have not allowed us to bring in a single ready-to-eat meal. The only food permitted has been flour for bakeries. Even if allowed in unlimited quantities, which it hasn’t been, it wouldn’t amount to a complete diet for anyone,” Kaneko said. Palestinians who received GHF aid said their packages included rice, flour, canned beans, pasta, olive oil, biscuits, and sugar. Meanwhile, the UN special rapporteur on the right to food, Michael Fakhri, described the GHF as a “bait to corral people” which “violates every principle of international law”. “This is aid being used … to push people out from the north into militarised zones … and it’s about humiliating people, and it’s about controlling the population. This has nothing to do with stopping starvation,” he said. Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary, reporting from Deir el-Balah in Gaza, said not much food is coming into the enclave as the number of trucks entering and the aid they are carrying is very limited “Despite the trucks’ entry over the past few days, Palestinians say they have not really received any food because there have not been any normal distribution points,” she said, adding that many are going back with their pots empty. “Some parents say they are giving their children water just to make them feel full. People say they are willing to do anything for one bag of flour or one food parcel. They are very desperate.”",

    "article_text": "Singapore– Of the many military officials darting across the lobby of Singapore’s Shangri-La Hotel this weekend, there has been one significant absence. China’s Defence Minister Dong Jun skipped the annual Shangri-La Dialogue, Asia’s premier security forum, with Beijing sending a delegation of lower-ranking representatives instead. It was the first time since 2019 that China has not dispatched its defence minister to the high-level dialogue on regional defence, except when the event was cancelled in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Beijing’s decision raised eyebrows in Singapore, coming at atime of heightened tensionsbetween China and the United States – the world’s two biggest superpowers. Dong’s absence meant there was no face-to-face meeting with his US counterpart, Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth, who had the floor to himself on Saturday when he told the defence forum that the military threat posed by China was potentially imminent. “It has to be clear to all that Beijing is credibly preparing to potentially use military force to alter the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific,” Hegseth told delegates in Singapore. Pointing to China’s regular military drills around Taiwan as well as increasingly frequent skirmishes in the South China Sea, Hegseth said Beijing was proactively harassing its neighbours. “There’s no reason to sugar-coat it. The threat China poses is real, and it could be imminent,” Hegseth said. He also pointed toChina’s growing military assertivenessas a reason for Asian nations to boost their defence spending, pointing to Germany, which has pledged to move towards spending 5 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) on defence. “It doesn’t make sense for countries in Europe to do that while key allies in Asia spend less on defence in the face of an even more formidable threat,” Hegseth said. The defence chief also looked to reassure Asian allies that Washington was committed to Asia Pacific security despite strained ties in recent months as US President Donald Trump targeted some close allies with hefty trade tariffs. “America is proud to be back in the Indo-Pacific, and we’re here to stay,” he said, opening his speech. Some analysts were quick to play down the severity of Hegseth’s warnings about China. “Short of a very few countries, not many in this part of the world see China as an imminent threat and would up their [defence] spending,” said Dylan Loh, assistant professor in the public policy and global affairs programme at Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University. In previous years, the Shangri-La Dialogue had provided a rare platform for meetings between Chinese and US officials in the more informal surroundings that the summit could offer. The structure of the schedule also allowed Beijing’s military chiefs to directly respond to the keynote speech from the US defence secretary and to present their narrative to other members of the Asia Pacific. Beijing has remained tight-lipped on the reason for Defence Minister Dong’s absence from the forum, fuelling an information void that has been filled by speculation. One theory is that China did not want to send a high-profile delegate to the event at such a sensitive time asBeijing navigates the tariff warwith the Trump administration. “Any sort of faux pas or comments that may go off script can be picked up and picked apart or misconstrued,” said Loh, of Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University. “So the question is why take the risk when US-China relations are at a very delicate point at this moment,” Loh told Al Jazeera. The Shangri-La Dialogue weekend has not always been the easiest occasion for Chinese defence ministers. In recent years, they have faced difficult questions from their counterparts in other countries, who are unhappy with Beijing’s increasing assertiveness in the Asia Pacific region. Loh said this could be another factor in Dong’s absence from the high-profile event. “Any Chinese defence minister coming to Singapore now will be exposing himself and the country to political risk,” he said. “Themes like the South China Sea and possibly Taiwan will emerge, which makes China a convenient target,” Loh added. Dong was appointed as China’s defence minister in late 2023, after his predecessor, Li Shangfu, was removed from office. Less than a year into the job, there was speculation surrounding Dong’s new position following media reports that he was under investigation as part of a wider investigation into corruption in the Chinese military. Beijing denied the reports, with the minister continuing to maintain a public profile despite the allegations. There has also been intense scrutiny of China’s military, following reports of an apparent purge of top-level officials by President Xi Jinping. One of Beijing’s most senior generals, He Weidong, was missing from a high-profile political meeting in April, adding to rumours surrounding a possible restructuring in the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). Ian Chong, a nonresident scholar at the Carnegie China research centre, said such speculation could be a factor in Dong’s no-show in Singapore. “Because of the domestic turmoil with China’s senior military, they perhaps don’t want to, or the PLA itself feels that it’s not in a position to send somebody senior,” Chong told Al Jazeera. Announcing Dong’s absence at a news conference before the summit, Chinese military spokesperson Senior Colonel Zhang Xiaogang maintained that communication channels were still open between defence officials in Washington and Beijing. “China places great importance on US-China military ties, and is open to communication at different levels,” Zhang said.",

    "title": "Truck accident unleashes 250 million honeybees in northwestern US",
    "article_text": "A truck carrying millions of honeybees has overturned in the northwestern United States, prompting emergency warnings from local authorities. The truck, carrying approximately 31,751kg (70,000 pounds) of active beehives, overturned on Friday in Washington state’s Whatcom County – a rural area near the Canadian border, about 48km (30 miles) south of Vancouver. “250 million bees are now loose,” the Whatcom County Sheriff’s Office (WCSO) announced on its official social media page. “Avoid the area due to the potential of bee escaping and swarming.” Authorities sealed off parts of the area and urged the public to keep a safe distance of at least 200 yards (182 metres) as officials and bee experts helped recover, restore and reset the hives, according to the sheriff’s office. The goal, officials said, is to safely re-hive the bees and help them locate their queens, a process that could take up to 48 hours. While some beekeepers focus solely on honey production, many others lease their hives to farmers who rely on bees to pollinate their crops. The loss of millions of bees, even temporarily, could threaten the productivity of nearby farms during the growing season. “While there is no general health risk to the public, anyone who is allergic to bee stings or has concerns should check the State Department of Health webpage on bees and wasps,” WCSO said. Honeybees are crucial to the food supply, pollinating more than 100 crops including nuts, vegetables, berries, citrus and melons. Bees and other pollinators have been declining for years, and experts blame insecticides, parasites, disease, climate change and lack of a diverse food supply. In 2018, the United Nations General Assembly sponsored the first “World Bee Day” on May 20 to bring attention to the bees’ plight. Beekeepers often transport millions of bees from one location to another because leaving them in one location for too long can deplete resources for other pollinators, The Seattle Times newspaper reported. In 2015, 14 million bees escaped a truck north of Seattle on Interstate 5 and started stinging people, the newspaper reported at the time.",

    "title": "Divided Israel faces internal unrest amid escalating Gaza conflict",
    "article_text": "As Israel’s devastating war on Gaza grinds on, pushed forward by a prime minister insistent that a goal of total military victory be met, the divisions within Israeli society are growing increasingly deeper. In the last few weeks, as Israeli peace activists and antiwar groups have stepped up their campaign against the conflict, supporters of the war have also increased their pressure to continue, whatever its humanitarian, political or diplomatic cost. Members of the military have published open letters protesting the political motivations for continuing the war on Gaza, or claiming that the latest offensive, which is systematically razing Gaza, risks the remaining Israeli captives held in the Palestinian territory. Another open letter has come from within Israel’s universities and colleges, with its signatories doing a rare thing within Israel since the war began in October 2023:focusing on Palestinian suffering. Elsewhere, campaigns of protest andrefusal of military service have spread– a result of a mixture of pro-peace sentiment and more prevalent anger at the government’s handling of the war – posing a risk to Israel’s war effort, which is reliant upon the active participation of the country’s youth. The war’s critics say that the man they oppose, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has become reliant upon the extreme right to maintain his coalition, and an opposition too cowardly to confront him in the face of mounting international accusations of genocide. It is important not to confuse the growing domestic criticism of the Israeli government’s handling of the war with any mass sympathy for the Palestinian people. Arecent pollreported that 82 percent of Jewish Israeli respondents would still like to see Gaza cleared of its Palestinian population, with almost 50 percent also backing what they said was the “mass killing” of civilians in enemy cities occupied by the Israeli army. And on Monday, thousands of Israelis led by the country’s far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir,rampaged through occupied East Jerusalem’s Old City, chanting “death to Arabs” and attacking anyone perceived to be either Palestinian or defending them. Also addressing the crowd at the “Jerusalem Day” march was the country’s ultranationalist finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, who has been vocal in his push for the annexation of the occupied West Bank, and the displacement of Palestinians from Gaza. Smotrich asked the crowd: “Are we afraid of victory?”; “Are we afraid of the word ‘occupation?’” The crowd – described as “revellers” within parts of Israeli media – responded with a resounding “no”. “There’s a cohort of the extreme right who feel vindicated by a year and a half of war,” the former Israeli diplomat Alon Pinkas told Al Jazeera. “They think their message that, if you blink you lose; if you pause, you lose; if you waver, you lose, has been borne out.” Alongside the intensifying of Israel’s onslaught on Gaza, which has now killed more than 54,000 Palestinians, voices of dissent have grown louder. In April, more than 1,000 serving and retired pilots issued an open letter protesting a war they said served“political and personal interests”rather than security ones. Further letters, as well as anorganised campaign encouragingyoung Israelis to refuse to show up for military service, have followed. Perhaps sensing the direction the wind was blowing, the leader of Israel’s left-wing Democrats Party, Yair Golan – who initially supported the war and took a hardline position on allowing humanitarian aid into Gaza – launched astark broadside against the conflictearlier this month, claiming that Israel risked becoming a “pariah state” that killed “babies as a hobby” while giving itself the aim of “expelling populations”. While welcomed by some, the comments of the former army major-general were rounded upon by others. Speaking at a conference in southern Israel alongside noted antiwar lawmaker Ofer Cassif, Golan was heckled and called a traitor by far-right members of the audience, before he had to be escorted off the premises by security. Cassif, who refers to himself as an anti-Zionist, has long attracted the outrage of mainstream Israeli society for his loud denunciation of the way Israel treats Palestinians. “There have always been threats against me,” Cassif, who has been alone among Israeli lawmakers in opposing the war from its onset, told Al Jazeera. “I can’t walk down my own street. I was attacked twice before October 7 and it’s gotten much worse since. “But it’s not just me. All the peace activists risk being physically attacked or threatened, even the families of the hostages are at risk of attack by these bigots,” he said. “Many people are coming to realise that this government and even the mainstream opposition aren’t fighting a war for security reasons, or even to recover the hostages, but are carrying out the kind of genocidal mission advocated by Smotrich and the other messianic bigots,” Cassif said of the finance minister and his supporters. “This has been allowed by people like [Benny] Gantz, [Yair] Lapid and [Yoav] Gallant,” he said, citing prominent politicians opposed to the prime minister, “who didn’t dare criticise it [the war] and Netanyahu, who has manipulated it for his own ends.” Cassif’s comments were echoed by one of the signatories to the academics’ open letter criticising the war, Ayelet Ben-Yishai, an associate professor at the University of Haifa. “The opposition has nothing,” she told Al Jazeera. “I get that it’s hard to argue for a complicated future, but they do and say nothing. All they’ve left us with is a choice between managing the war and the occupation and Smotrich and his followers. That’s it. What kind of future is that?” Many members of the government and opposition have previously served in senior roles within the army, either engaging in or overseeing combat operations against Palestinians, and maintaining the illegal occupation of Palestinian land. Democrats Party head Golan was even previouslycriticised by the army in 2007 for repeatedlyusing Palestinian civilians as human shields. “What we’re seeing right now is a struggle between two Zionist elites over who is the greater fascist in different forms,” Yehouda Shenhav-Shahrabani, a professor at Tel Aviv University, said of the political struggles at play within Israel. “On the one hand, there are the Ashkenazi Jews, who settled Israel, imposed the occupation and have killed thousands,” he said of Israel’s traditional military and governing elites, many of whom might describe themselves as liberal and democratic, and were originally from central and Eastern Europe. “Or [you have] the current religious Zionists, like Smotrich and Ben-Gvir, who [the old Ashkenazi elite] now accuse of being fascists. “You can’t reduce this to left and right. I don’t buy into that,” Shenhav-Shahrabani said. “It goes deeper. Both sides are oblivious to the genocide in Gaza.” While resistance against the war has grown both at home and abroad, so too has the intensity of the attacks being protested against. Since Israel unilaterally broke aceasefire in March,almost 4,000 Palestinianshave been killed, hundreds of them children. In addition, a siege, imposed upon the decimatedenclave on March 2,has pushed what remains of its pre-war population of more than two million to the point of famine, international agencies, including the United Nations, have warned. At the same time as Israel’s war on Gaza has intensified, so too have its actions in the West Bank. Under the guise of another military operation, the Israeli army has occupied and levelled large parts of the occupied territorydisplacing a reported 40,000of its inhabitants as it establishes its own military network there. On Thursday, Israel’s Defence Minister Israel Katz, alongside Smotrich, who as finance minister enjoys significant control over the West Bank, announced the establishment of a further 22 Israeli settlements, all in defiance of international law. Smotrich’s announcement came as a surprise to few. The far-right minister – himself a settler on Palestinian land – has previously been clear about his intention to see the West Bank annexed,even ordering preparations to do so in advance of US President Donald Trump’s inauguration, who he expected to support the idea. He has also said Gaza will be “totally destroyed” and its population expelled to a tiny strip of land along the Egyptian border. For Shenhav-Shahrabani, little of it was surprising. “I went with some others to South Africa in 1994. I met a justice of the Supreme Court, a Jew, who’d been injured by an Afrikaner bomb [during the struggle against apartheid],” Shenhav-Shahrabani said. “He told me that nothing will change for Palestinians until Israelis are ready to go to jail for them. We’re not there yet.”",

    "title": "China’s navy conducts combat patrols near disputed South China Sea shoal",
    "article_text": "China’s navy has conducted “combat readiness patrols” near the disputed Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea, while South Korean officials separately announced the discovery of more Chinese buoys in contested waters in the Yellow Sea. The Southern Theatre Command of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) conducted the drills in the “territorial waters and airspace of China’s Huangyan Island and surrounding areas”, state-run news outlet Xinhua reported on Saturday, using China’s name for the Scarborough Shoal. The report said the PLA had been conducting drills in the area throughout May to “further strengthen the control of relevant sea and air areas, resolutely defend national sovereignty and security, and resolutely maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea”. The Scarborough Shoal is a rocky islet claimed by The Philippines, located 220km (119 miles) west of Luzon, the nearest landmass. Beijing blockaded and seized the territory, a traditional fishing ground, from Manila in 2012. The Chinese navy regularly carries out provocative military drills in the area as part of its claims of sovereignty over almost all of the South China Sea, despite a 2016 international tribunal ruling that Beijing’s claims had no legal basis under international law. In late April,Manila accused Beijingof carrying out “dangerous manoeuvres and obstruction” after a Chinese naval ship damaged a Philippine coastguard ship with a water cannon near the shoal. Also on Saturday, South Korean officials announced they had recorded three new Chinese buoys installed near overlapping waters with South Korea, bringing the total number of such devices installed by China in the Yellow Sea to 13. “[We] are closely monitoring activities within the provisional maritime zone [PMZ], including China’s unauthorised installation of structures, and will closely [cooperate] with relevant agencies to protect our maritime sovereignty,” a Ministry of Defence official said, according to South Korea’s official Yonhap news agency. Two of the Chinese buoys – first detected in May 2023, but only announced this week – have been installed near the zone, according to Yonhap. The third buoy is located inside the maritime zone, a contested area where the exclusive economic zones (EEZ) claims of South Korea and China overlap, Yonhap added. China asserts its maritime boundary is based on a 1962 agreement signed with North Korea which cuts into waters South Korea considers part of its economic zone. The Yellow Sea PMZ allows joint management of marine resources and prohibits activities beyond navigation and fishing. However, tensions have grown between Beijing and Seoul as China has repeatedly erected installations in the waters, including 10 three-metre-wide and six-metre-tall observation buoys since 2018 and a fixed steel structure in 2022. Last week, China declared three no-sail zones within the zone, in a move “believed to be for military training purposes”, according to the Korea Joongang Daily newspaper. The no-sail declarations caused concern in Seoul over a potential uptick in Chinese military activity in the area.",

    "title": "Guatemala jails ex-paramilitaries for 40 years over rapes during civil war",
    "article_text": "A top Guatemalan court has sentenced three former paramilitaries to 40 years each in prison after they were found guilty of raping six Indigenous women between 1981 and 1983, one of the bloodiest periods of the Central Americannation’s civil war. The conviction and sentencing on Friday mark another significant step towards attaining justice for the Maya Achi Indigenous women, who were sexually abused by pro-government armed groups, during a period of extreme bloodshed between the military and left-wing rebels that left as many as 200,000 dead or missing. Former Civil Self-Defence Patrol members Pedro Sanchez, Simeon Enriquez and Felix Tum were found guilty of crimes against humanity for sexually assaulting six members of the Maya Achi group, Judge Maria Eugenia Castellanos said. “The women recognised the perpetrators, they recognised the places where the events took place. They were victims of crimes against humanity,” she said, praising the women’s bravery in coming to court to testify on repeated occasions. “They are crimes of solitude that stigmatise the woman. It is not easy to speak of them,” the judge said. Indigenous lawyer Haydee Valey, who represented the women, said the sentence was “historic” because it finally recognised the struggle of civil war survivors who haddemanded justice for decades. Several Maya Achi women in the courtroom applauded at the end of the trial, where some dressed in traditional attire and others listened to the verdict through an interpreter. One of the victims, a 62-year-old woman, told the AFP news agency she was “very happy” with the verdict. Pedro Sanchez, one of the three men convicted, told the court before the sentencing, “I am innocent of what they are accusing me of.” But Judge Marling Mayela Gonzalez Arrivillaga, another member of the all-women, three-panel court, said there was no doubt about the women’s testimony against the suspects. The convictions were second in the Maya Achi women’s case against former military personnel and paramilitaries. The first trial, which took place in January 2022, saw five former paramilitaries sentenced to 30 years in prison. Advocacy group Impunity Watch said the case “highlights how the Guatemalan army used sexual violence as a weapon of war against Indigenous women” during thecivil conflict. In 2016, a Guatemalan court sentenced two former military officers for holding 15 women from the Q’eqchi community, who are also of Maya origin, as sex slaves. Both officers were sentenced to a combined 360 years in prison.",

    "title": "India’s latest coffee hub? Beans and brews offer new hope to Nagaland",
    "article_text": "Dimapur, Mokokchung, Wokha, Chumoukedima and Kohima, India —With its high ceilings, soft lighting and brown and turquoise blue cushioned chairs, Juro Coffee House has the appearance of a chic European cafe. Sitting right off India’s National Highway-2, which connects the northeastern states of Assam, Nagaland and Manipur, the cafe hosts a live roastery unit that was set up in January by the Nagaland state government.  Here, green coffee beans from 12 districts in Nagaland are roasted live, ground and served, from farm to cup. On a typical day, the cafe gets about a hundred customers, sipping on coffee, with smoke breaks in between. Those numbers aren’t big – but they’re a start. For decades, an armed rebellion seeking the secession of Nagaland from India dominated the state’s political and economic landscape. Thousands have been killed in clashes between security forces and armed rebels in Nagaland since India’s independence, soon after which Naga separatists held aplebiscitein which nearly all votes were cast in favour of separating from the Indian union. India has never accepted that vote. The state’s economy has depended on agriculture, with paddy, fruits like bananas and oranges and green leafy vegetables like mustard leaves, the main crops grown traditionally. Now, a growing band of cafes, roasteries and farms across the state are looking to give Nagaland a new identity by promoting locally grown Arabica and Robusta coffee. Juro Coffee House is among them. While coffee was first introduced to the state in 1981 by the Coffee Board of India, a body set up by the Indian government to promote coffee production, it only began to take off after 2014. Helped by government policy changes and pushed by a set of young entrepreneurs, Nagaland today has almost 250 coffee farms spread across 10,700 hectares (26,400 acres) of land in 11 districts. About 9,500 farmers are engaged in coffee cultivation, according to the state government. The small state bordering Myanmar today boasts of eight roastery units, besides homegrown cafes mushrooming in major cities like Dimapur and Kohima, and interior districts like Mokokchung and Mon. For Searon Yanthan, the founder of Juro Coffee House, the journey began with COVID-19, when the pandemic forced Naga youth studying or working in other parts of India or abroad to return home. But this became a blessing in disguise since they brought back value to the state, says Yanthan. “My father used to say, those were the days when we used to export people,” he told Al Jazeera. “Now it’s time to export our products and ideas, not the people.” Like many kids his age, Yanthan left Nagaland for higher studies in 2010, first landing up in the southern city of Chennai for high school and then the northern state of Punjab for his undergraduate studies, before dropping out to study in Bangalore. “I studied commerce but the only subject I was good in was entrepreneurship,” said the 30-year-old founder, dressed in a pair of smart formal cotton pants and a baby pink polo neck shirt. The pandemic hit just as he was about to graduate, and Yanthan left with no degree in hand. One day, he sneaked into a government vehicle from Dimapur during the COVID-19 lockdown – when only essential services like medical and government workers were allowed to move around – to return to his family farm estate, 112km (70 miles) from state capital Kohima, where his dad first started growing coffee in 2015. He ended up spending seven months at the farm during lockdown and realised that coffee farmers didn’t know much about the quality of beans, which wasn’t surprising considering coffee is not a household beverage among Nagas and other ethnic communities in India’s northeast. Yanthan, who launched Lithanro Coffee, the parent company behind Juro, in 2021, started visiting other farms, working with farmers on improving coffee quality and maintaining plantations. Once his own processing unit was set up, he began hosting other coffee farmers, offering them a manually brewed cup of their own produce. Gradually, he built a relationship with 200 farmers from whom he sources beans today, besides the coffee grown on his farm. Yanthan sees coffee as an opportunity for Nagaland’s youth to dream of economic prospects beyond jobs in the government — the only aspiration for millions of Naga families in a state where private-sector employment has historically been uncertain. “Every village you go to, parents are working day and night in the farms to make his son or daughter get a government job,” Yanthan told Al Jazeera. Coffee, to him, could also serve as a vehicle to bring people together. “In this industry, it’s not only one person who can do this work, it has to be a community,” he said. So what changed in 2015? Coffee buyers and roasters are unanimous in crediting the state government’s decision to hand over charge of coffee development to Nagaland’s Land Resources Department (LRD) that year. The state department implements schemes sponsored by the federal government and the state government, including those promoting coffee. Unlike in the past, when Nagaland – part of a region that has historically had poor physical connectivity with the rest of India – also had no internet, coffee roasters, buyers and farmers could now build online links with the outside world. “[The] market was not like what it is today,” said Albert Ngullie, the director of the LRD. The LRD builds nurseries and provides free saplings to farmers, besides supporting farm maintenance. Unlike before, the government is also investing in the post-harvest process by supplying coffee pulpers to farmers, setting up washing stations and curing units in a few districts and recently, supporting entrepreneurs with roastery units. Among those to benefit is Lichan Humtsoe. He set up his company Ete (which means “ours” in the Lotha Naga dialect) in 2016 after quitting his pen-pushing job in the LRD and was the first in the state to source, serve and supply Naga specialty coffee. Today, Ete runs its own cafes, roasteries and a coffee laboratory, researching the chemical properties of indigenous fruits as flavour notes. Ete also has a coffee school in Nagaland (and a campus in the neighbouring state of Manipur) with a dedicated curriculum and training facilities to foster the next generation of coffee professionals. Humtsoe said the past decade has shown that the private sector and government in Nagaland have complemented each other in promoting coffee. Nagaland’s growing coffee story also coincides with an overall increase in India’s exports of coffee beans. In 2024, India’s coffee exports surpassed $1bn for the first time, with production doubling compared with 2020-21. While more than 70 percent of India’s coffee comes from the southern state of Karnataka, the Coffee Board has been trying to expand cultivation in the Northeast. Building a coffee culture in Nagaland is no easy feat, given that decades of unrest left the state in want of infrastructure and almost completely reliant on federal funding. Growing up in the 1990s, when military operations against alleged armed groups were frequent and security forces would often barge into homes, day or night, Humtsoe wanted nothing to do with India. At one point, he stopped speaking Nagamese – a bridge dialect among the state’s 16 tribes and a creole version of the Indian language, Assamese. But he grew disillusioned with thepolitical solutionrooted in separatism that armed groups were seeking. And the irony of the state’s dependence on funds from New Delhi hit the now 39-year-old. Coffee became his own path to self-determination. “From 2016 onwards, I was more of, ‘How can I inspire India?’” Ngullie of the LRD insists that the coffee revolution brewing in Nagaland is also helping the state preserve its forests. “We don’t do land clearing,” he said, in essence suggesting that coffee was helping the state’s agriculture transition from the traditional slash-and-burn techniques to agroforestry. The LRD buys seed varieties from the Coffee Board for farmers, and growers make more money than before. Limakumzak Walling, a 40-year-old farmer, recalled how his late father was one of the first to grow Arabica coffee in 1981 on a two-acre farm on their ancestral land in Mokokchung district’s Khar village. “During my father’s time, they used to cultivate it, but people didn’t find the market,” he said. “It was more of a burden than a bonus.” Before the Nagaland government took charge of coffee development, the Coffee Board would buy produce from farmers and sell it to buyers or auction it in their headquarters in Bengaluru, Karnataka. But the payments, said Walling, would be made in instalments over a year, sometimes two. Since he took over the farm, and the state department became the nodal agency, payments are not only higher but paid upfront with buyers directly procuring from the farmers. Still, profits aren’t huge. Walling makes less than 200,000 rupees per annum (roughly $2,300) and like most farmers, is still engaged in jhum cultivation, the traditional slash-and-burn method of farming practised by Indigenous tribes in northeastern hills. With erratic weather patterns and decreasing soil fertility in recent decades, intensified land use in jhum cultivation has been known to lead to further environmental degradation and greenhouse gas emissions, exacerbating climate change. “Trees are drying up and so is the mountain spring water,” Walling told Al Jazeera, pointing at the evergreen woods where spring leaves were already wilting in March, well before the formal arrival of summer. “Infestation is also a major issue and we don’t use even organic fertilisers because we are scared of spoiling our land,” he added. And though the state government has set up some washing stations and curing units, many more are needed for these facilities to be accessible to all farmers, said Walling, for them to sustain coffee as a viable crop and secure better prices. “Right now we don’t know the quality. We just harvest it,” he said. Dipanjali Kemprai, a liaison officer who leads the Coffee Board of India operations in Nagaland, told Al Jazeera that the agency encourages farmers to grow coffee alongside horticultural crops like black pepper to supplement their income. “But intercropping still hasn’t fully taken off,” said Kemprai. Meanwhile, despite the state’s efforts to promote sustainable agriculture, recent satellite data suggests that shifting cultivation, or jhum, may be rising again. Though it is the seventh-largest producer of coffee, India is far behind export-heavy countries like Brazil, Vietnam, Colombia and Italy. And while the Nagaland government maintains that exports have been steadily growing, entrepreneurs tell a different story. Vivito Yeptho, who co-owns Nagaland Coffee and became the state’s first certified barista in 2018, said that their last export of 15 metric tonnes (MT) was in 2019, to South Africa. Still, there are other wins to boast of. In 2024, the state registered its highest-ever production at 48 MT, per state department officials. Yeptho said Nagaland Coffee alone supplies 40 cafes across India, of which 12 are in the Northeast region. And Naga coffee is already making waves internationally, winning silver at the Aurora International Taste Challenge in South Africa in 2022 and then gold in 2023. “To aim for export, we need to be at least producing 80-100 MT every year,” Yeptho told Al Jazeera. But before aiming for mass production, entrepreneurs said they still have a long way to go in improving the quality of beans and their post-harvest processing. With a washing mill and a curing unit in his farm, where he grows both Arabica and Robusta varieties, Yanthan’s Lithanro brand is the only farm-to-cup institution in the state. He believes farmers need to focus on better maintenance of their plantations, to begin with. “Even today, the attitude is that the plants don’t need to be tended to during the summers and monsoon season before harvest (which starts by November),” Yanthan told Al Jazeera. “But the trees need to be constantly pruned to keep them within a certain height, weeding has to be done and the stems need to be maintained as well.” Even as these challenges ground Naga farmers and entrepreneurs in reality, their dreams are soaring. Humtsoe hopes for speciality coffee from Nagaland to soon beGI tagged, like varieties from Coorg, Chikmagalur, Araku Valley and Wayanad in southern India. He wants good coffee from India to be associated with Nagas, not just Nagaland, he said. “People of the land must become the brand”.",

    "title": "SpaceX rockets keep exploding. Is that normal?",
    "article_text": "Can a move-fast-and-break-things approach create the next-gen rocket? byGeorgina Torbet Can a move-fast-and-break-things approach create the next-gen rocket? byGeorgina Torbet With yetanother failed Starship testthis week, in which the ambitious heavy rocket exploded once again, you might reasonably suspect that luck has finally run out for SpaceX. But this degree of failure during a development process isn’t actually unusual, according to Wendy Whitman Cobb, a space policy expert with the School of Advanced Air and Space Studies, especially when you’re testing new space technology as complex as a large rocket. However, the Starship tests are meaningfully different from the slow, steady pace of development that we’ve come to expect from the space sector. “The reason a lot of people perceive this to be unusual is that this is not the typical way that we have historically tested rockets,” Whitman Cobb says. Historically speaking, space agencies like NASA or legacy aerospace companies like United Launch Alliance (ULA) have taken their time with rocket development and have not tested until they were confident in a successful outcome. That’s still the case today with major NASA projects like the development of the Space Launch System (SLS), which has now dragged on for over a decade. “They will take as long as they need to to make sure that the rocket is going to work and that a launch is going to be successful,” Whitman Cobb says. “This is not the typical way that we have historically tested rockets.” SpaceX has chosen a different path, in which it tests, fails, and iterates frequently. That process has been at the heart of its success, allowing the company to make developments like the reusable Falcon 9 rocket at a rapid pace. However, it also means frequent and very public failures, which have generated complaints aboutenvironmental damagein the local area around the launch site and have caused the company to butt heads withregulatory agencies. There are also significant concerns about the political ties of CEO Elon Musk to the Trump administration and hisundemocratic influenceover federal regulation of SpaceX’s work. Even within the context of SpaceX’s move-fast-and-break-things approach, though, the development of the Starship has appeared chaotic. Compared to the development of the Falcon 9 rocket, which had plenty of failures but a generally clear forward path from failing often to failing less and less as time went on, Starship has a much more spotty record. Previous development was more incremental, first demonstrating that the rocket was sound before moving onto more complex issues like reusability of the booster or first stage. The company didn’t even attempt to save the booster of a Falcon 9 and reuse it until several years into testing. Starship isn’t like that. “They are trying to do everything at once with Starship,” Whitman Cobb says, as the company is trying to debut an entirely new rocket with new engines and make it reusable all at once. “It really is a very difficult engineering challenge.” “They are trying to do everything at once with Starship.” The Raptor engines that power the Starship are a particularly tough engineering nut to crack, as there are a lot of them — 33 per Starship, all clustered together — and they need to be able to perform the tricky feat of reigniting in space. The relighting of engines has been successful on some of the previous Starship test flights, but it has also been a point of failure. Why, then, is SpaceX pushing for so much, so fast? It’s because Musk is laser-focused on getting to Mars. And while it would theoretically be possible to send a mission to Mars using existing rockets like the Falcon 9, the sheer volume of equipment, supplies, and people needed for a Mars mission has a very large mass. To make Mars missions even remotely affordable, you need to be able to move a lot of mass in one launch — hence the need for a much larger rocket like the Starship or NASA’s SLS. NASA has previously been hedging its bets by developing its own heavy launch rocket as well as supporting the development of Starship. But with recent funding cuts, it’s looking more and more likely that the SLS will get axed — leaving SpaceX as the only player in town to facilitate NASA’s Mars plans. But there’s still an awful lot of work to do to get Starship to a place where serious plans for crewed missions can even be made. “There’s no way that they’re putting people on that right now.” Will a Starship test to Mars happen by 2026, with a crewed test to follow as soon as 2028, as Musk said this week he’s aiming for? “I think it’s completely delusional,” Whitman Cobb says, pointing out that SpaceX has not appeared to be seriously considering issues like adding life support to the Starship or making concrete plans for Mars habitats, launch and landing pads, or infrastructure. “I don’t see SpaceX as putting its money where its mouth is,” Whitman Cobb says. “If they do make the launch window next year, it’s going to be uncrewed. There’s no way that they’re putting people on that right now. And I seriously doubt whether they will make it.” That doesn’t mean Starship will never make it to Mars, of course. “I believe SpaceX will engineer their way out of it. I believe their engineering is good enough that they will make Starship work,” Whitman Cobb says. But getting an uncrewed rocket to Mars within the next decade is a lot more realistic than next year. Putting people on the rocket, though, is another matter entirely. “If they’re looking to build a large-scale human settlement? That’s decades,” Whitman Cobb says. “I don’t know that I will live to see that.” A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. ©2025Vox Media, LLC.

The temporary price cut on the pro-style gamepad is the unsung highlight of Days of Play. bySheena VasaniandBrandon Widder If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. Sony might have just recently introduced a new low price on thePlayStation 5 Prowith its latestDays of Play sale, but that’s not the only deal worth your attention. Sony is also offering a range of accessories at a discount, including the high-endDualSense Edge. Regularly $199.99, the customizable controller is available fromAmazon,Best Buy, andSonyfor an all-time low of $169 through June 11th. Sony’s pro-style controller, the DualSense Edge, might suffer from shorter battery life than the standard DualSense model, but it features great software integration with the PlayStation 5 and plenty of customizable components. If you’re looking for a highly customizable controller, the Edge is a great option that offers excellent software integration with the PS5. The premium gamepad lets you effortlessly switch between up to four personalized profiles, each of which lets you customize things like stick sensitivity and rear button controls. It’s just as easy to swap out stick modules, too, allowing you to quickly replace the stick tops should they ever wear out. What’s more, the rear triggers feature adjustable stops, so you can control how far they can be pressed and fine-tune your response time in shooters and other competitive games. Additionally, the Edge offers the same haptics and adaptive triggers found on Sony’s standard DualSense controller, along with two styles of rear paddles, each suited to a different grip preference. Its charging cable also features a handy locking mechanism to ensure it won’t get yanked out while gaming; however, the Edge is limited to approximately eight hours of battery life when used wirelessly, meaning it doesn’t last quite as long as the OG DualSense. I guess that’s the price you pay for souped-up components and software, at least with Sony. Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.

    "title": "The Switch 2&#8217;s promising start hides an uncertain future",
    "article_text": "Tariffs, cheaper alternatives, and a relative lack of innovation are all factors that could slow the console down. byAsh Parrish Tariffs, cheaper alternatives, and a relative lack of innovation are all factors that could slow the console down. byAsh Parrish With the Switch 2 launch days away, analysts and consumers are watching to see how well Nintendo can follow-up the best selling home console in its history. Judging fromthe pain of trying to secure a Switch 2 pre-order, it seems like Nintendo has nothing to worry about – at least at launch. Down the line, however, concerns about tariffs, a steadily rising cost of living, and a saturated market might cast a shadow on the Switch 2.The Vergetalked to analysts, journalists, and normal video game playing people to put the Switch 2 launch in perspective. The key takeaway? While the console will assuredly have another blockbuster debut, its future looks much less certain. The Wii U gets brought up a lot in the conversation surrounding the Switch 2, as it’s the most famous example of a Nintendo failure. “The Wii U, with its confusing controller-screen gimmick, sluggish user interface, and lack of a greatCustom Robogame, was one of Nintendo’s worst flops,”GameFileauthor Stephen Totilo explained in an email toThe Verge. It sold less than 14 million units, a dramatic drop from the Wii, which sold over 100 million. And while Nintendo expects to sell one million more Switch 2 units in its first year than the Wii U sold in its life, that’s not necessarily indicative of long-term success. “The Wii U nevertheless sold out at launch back in November 2012,” Totilo said, “pulling in sales thatreportedlytopped the US launch sales of the Xbox 360 and PS3.” When looking at launch sales projections and predictions, Mat Piscatella, video game analyst for Circana, warned that what a console does during its launch period is no indication of what it’ll do overall. “Sales around the launch period are more reflection of available supply than anything,” Piscatella said. Another, more important factor for a console launch is the audience. “With anything regarding gaming right now, we have to separate the enthusiast market from the mass market, because they’re behaving very differently,” Piscatella added. According to Piscatella, it’s the enthusiasts driving most of the Switch 2 hype we’re seeing, particularly since the last major console launches – the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S – happened five years ago. “We haven’t had new hardware designed for the masses in a long time,” he said. “So we have a big pent up demand just for something new.” We’re seeing part of that demand satisfied by the Switch 2 pre-order frenzy. Theday pre-orders opened in the US(aftera few weeks’ delaybecause of President Donald Trump’s tariff chicanery) they sold out within hours. GameStop held in-store pre order events that saw peoplelining up outside storefrontsfor hours to secure one. But what will really determine the success of the console is how the bigger, mass market reacts, the same one that made devices like the Wii and original Switch such hits. Piscatella says this group is biding its time right now, “leaning into free-to-play and the content they already have.” It’s a tricky time for the industry. New blockbuster titles are getting ever more expensive to make. Consumers, in turn, are buying fewer of them in favor of spending their time and money in established games, all while persistent layoffs three years running are making it harder for new games to come out on time. Add that to 2025’s unique and volatile US tariff situation and the associated price increases, and now is onehellof a time to launch a video game console. “A games console is for a lot of people [...] an unaffordable luxury, especially for families,” saidKeza MacDonald, video game editor atThe Guardianand author of a forthcoming book about Nintendo’s history. MacDonald believes that most people who want a Switch 2 will have already pre-ordered one and that Nintendo’s real work will be to convince everyone else they want one too – a job the company doesn’t seem to be doing that well. Silvie Krekow, a gamer who works at Vox Media as a creative director, says she knows “almost nothing” about the Switch 2. She doesn’t frequent gaming websites or consume gaming media, but she noted it was odd that “a 33-year-old gamer with disposable income who owns a Switch, PS4, and Xbox One” didn’t casually come across at leastsomeSwitch 2 information. Other colleagues and self-described “gaming casuals” I spoke to expressed similar sentiments. According to MacDonald, Nintendo is handling this launch period very conservatively. “It’s like, ‘We know everyone’s going to buy this anyway. We don’t have to sell you on it,’” she said. “But I’m not sure if that’s true.” At the Switch 2 Direct in April, Nintendo showed off a console with someslight quality-of-life and performance upgrades. That may work for the enthusiasts –they get more of what they already liked about the original. But without something more to entice consumers beyond the diehards, the Switch 2 may struggle to find its audience. “As for the [Switch 2 features] I’m not particularly excited,” said Kushal Raval, an operations manager at Vox Media. “The rolling controller sounds interesting, but the voice chat feature seems a bit pointless.” Kushal owns a Switch, which he said didn’t run games likeFortniteas well as he wanted. And while the Switch 2’s technical upgrades will likely improve this, Kushal said, “With a $450–$500 price tag, I’m leaning much more toward getting a Steam Deck.” The Switch 2 also has to compete against people content with its predecessor. “I have a Switch Lite that I bought during the pandemic,” said Jackie Noack, a video producer at Vox Media. “My husband has the Switch 1, and I don’t think we use them quite enough to justify replacing them.” For Noack, the console’s price is also a major factor. “$500 does seem steep to me!” The Switch 2 will not be a dud like the Wii U, but it likely will not reach the heights of the original Switch. The price and lack of defining new features are two reasons, but perhaps the biggest is that the circumstances that fostered the OG Switch’s success were incredibly unique. “The Switch really picked upduring the pandemic withAnimal Crossing. That was an enormous hit,” MacDonald said. “And obviously that was such a unique combination of circumstances, I’m not sure that could happen again.” Piscatella agrees: “The Switch is an outlier success. I think [the Switch 2] is unlikely to do Switch numbers in the long term.” The lead up to the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 has been filled with so much built-up pressure from the anticipation of hungry gamers eager for any news, which was exacerbated by prolific leaks and Nintendo’s typical propensity for silence. With the console’s official reveal and the enthusiastic response from dedicated fans, that pressure could not be higher – and with launch coming next week, the release valve is finally about to open. “Simply because of the logo on the box, it’s safe to say that the Switch 2 is too Nintendo to fail,” said Totilo. “At least in the early going.” A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. ©2025Vox Media, LLC.

    "title": "Slate Truck FAQ: answering all your questions about the barebones electric pickup",
    "article_text": "Wondering about data privacy, preconditioning, or even 3D-printing? We’ve got answers. Wondering about data privacy, preconditioning, or even 3D-printing? We’ve got answers. byTim Stevens Alright, we get it. Y’all are excited about Slate. We thought the littleSlate Truckwas cool, but based on the number of clicks and comments on our Slate Auto articles so far, you’d like to know more. Many of you wrote in with questions and more than a few people raised some doubts. So, we wanted to address as many of those as we could. Here’s your one-stop shop for Slate answers based on your questions — plus a few of our own. The Slate is clearly a vehicle built for everyday utility, and while it’ll make for a handy machine for hauling a lot of things, big towing and heavy cargo were clearly not a top priority. Here are the key specs, compared against the four-wheel drive hybrid Ford Maverick with the 2.5-liter engine and a Ford F-150 4x2 with a 2.7-liter EcoBoost V6. It’s worth noting that these Ford numbers vary widely based on configuration. For example, you can get a “4K Tow Package” on the Maverick that boosts towing to 4,000 lbs, and the F-150 has hundreds of variations depending on need. Max towing on an F-150 is 13,500 lbs. The numbers above represent the figures quoted by Ford for a base, option-free vehicle. And one final note: towing substantially reduces the efficiency of the tow vehicle, due to the weight of the trailer and its additional aerodynamic drag. For an electric vehicle like the Slate, that will surely result in reduced range, perhaps by as much as half depending on the trailer. Slate has confirmed manufacturing will take place in a former catalog printing facility in Warsaw, Indiana, which closed in 2023. Slate hopes to renovate the facility and eventually employ 2,000 workers, with an annual production volume of 150,000 vehicles. And the company isseeking tax abatements on the factory sitefrom the county government to begin construction.Full details on that here. That domestic production should mean that vehicles produced by Slate are eligible for the full $7,500 federal rebate — if the creditstill existslate next year when the Truck enters production. No, the Slate Truck does not have built-in cellular connectivity. LTE is an increasingly common feature in new cars, enabling auto manufacturers to do all sorts of stuff, including good things like software updates and some perhaps not so good things likeselling your driving data. For the former, o-the-air updates will still be possible via the Slate smartphone app. Updates will be downloaded to the phone and then pushed to the Slate Truck via USB cable. As for the latter, that leads us to our next question. Not your driving data, no, but you can upload data about the health of your vehicle. Jeff Jablansky, Slate Auto’s head of public relations and communications, gave us this example: “A ‘check engine’ light comes on: if the driver has their phone plugged in and has opted in to data movement, the company will send a notification to the Slate app so they can be aware of potential service needs.” Jablansky confirmed that no data will be sold to third parties. One of the joys of owning a modern EV is easy preconditioning. Regardless of where your car is parked, you can get the interior warmed up or cooled down from just a few taps on your smartphone, all without having to worry about filling your garage with carbon monoxide. Can you do that in the Slate Truck? Maybe. The lack of cellular connection means you won’t be able to wirelessly connect to your Truck from anywhere, but Jablansky didn’t rule it out entirely, saying, “This is something we are working on through the app.” Ready to download some STL/3MF files today and start designing your ultimate cupholder? Us, too, but we’ll need to be patient for a little bit. “The Maker community is incredibly important to Slate, and we are on track toward delivering on this commitment closer to launch,” Jablansky says. So stay tuned on that front. Jablansky says this will also include details on third-party accessory providers and licensing. The DIN slot, also known as theISO 7736or Deutsches Institut für Normung 75490 slot, has long been the standard for in-dash audio. Why, then, are there no DIN slots on the Slate Truck? Slate says it was to offer greater flexibility. “We wanted to allow the customer to pick and choose their accessories without forcing combinations of options together in packages. This comes to life in our audio strategy to allow customers to choose to install anything from a Bluetooth speaker to a full audio system,” Jablansky says. So the bad news is if you want to use a standard DIN receiver, then you’ll need to DIY an enclosure for it. The good news is if you just want to mount a Bluetooth sound bar, then you won’t have to worry about filling any gaping rectangular holes in the dashboard. No. “Consistent with our broader approach, we focused our engineering to make a Slate a great truck to drive,” Jablansky says. Keep those hands on the wheel, folks. Cost and simplicity, it turns out. Jablansky says that “a two-door form factor meant less material, less complexity, lower cost.” He adds that the lockable frunk means there’s sedan-like secure storage for your stuff, with the added benefit of a big bed out back. And, of course, you can add on the SUV kit if you need more seating or more covered storage. Per Jablansky, special tools are not expected to be required. It’s a dynamic world and dynamic industry out there right now, but Slate isn’t backing down. “We are committed to our expected price point of $20,000 after federal incentives,” Jablansky says, which implies an MSRP of roughly $27,500. “If incentives go away, Slate will remain well-positioned in the U.S. with a strong proposition of value, safety, and customization.” Will those attributes be enough to woo people away from a Ford Maverick, which starts at just over $28,000? We’ll have to wait and see. Jablansky says that Slate is also committed to US manufacturing, which should fend off most of the tariff fears, and that the company is still on track to start manufacturing in 2026.

    "title": "Playdate’s second season is off to a great (and very weird) start",
    "article_text": "The little handheld’s seasonal format is back for another go. The little handheld’s seasonal format is back for another go. byAndrew Webster A lot of games have been released forthe Playdate since it launched in 2022, as a quick browse ofitch.ioorthe Catalog shopwill attest. But still, there’s something unique about the handheld’s seasonal format, which just kicked off its second iteration. When it first launched, the Playdate came with 24 games from notable indie developers that were steadily released on a weekly cadence, making a perfect introduction to the little yellow device and its crank. Now, a few years later, we finally have season 2, and it’s off to a solid start — and it even includes a bizarre mystery. The new season runs for the next six weeks and totals a dozen games, two of which will drop each week.The entire collection will run you $39. To start, we have a pair of very different games.Fulcrum Defender, fromFTL: Faster Than Lightdeveloper Subset Games, is sort of like a modern take onAsteroids. You control a little ship in the middle and fire guns at little squares flying toward you. The twist is that you use the crank to rotate the ship around and aim your shots. There’s also something of a roguelike element, where you steadily unlock random upgrades like new weapons or a larger spread for your bullets. The goal is to last for 10 straight minutes. It’s a pretty challenging game — so far, I’ve only really had success on easy mode — but it’s also surprisingly chill, eliciting that sort of zen state that the best shooters and puzzle games can create. This is helped by its lo-fi soundtrack that pretty much demands you play with headphones on. It’s an absorbing game. On the other end of the spectrum isDig Dig Dino!, developed by Dom2D and Fáyer, who brag that the game “is perfect to play while watching TV! No time pressure, no quick reflexes needed!” It’s a puzzle game where you travel to different dig sites to uncover dinosaur bones, artifacts, and trash. You only have a limited amount of moves per dig, but you can upgrade your capacity over time — while also getting new tools to smash rocks or dig deeper — letting you dig both more and for longer. It’s sort of like a really cute take onMinesweeper, one clearly designed for short play sessions. It’s not exactly difficult, but there’s still something satisfying about uncovering a large dinosaur bone when you’re just about to run out of moves. These two games do a good job of showing the breadth of games possible on the Playdate; one is meant for quick bursts, the other for longer, more focused sessions. But the launch week package is rounded out by something a whole lot weirder. It’s calledBlippo Plusand, well, it’s a series of TV channels you can flip between using the crank. Some are nothing but static, while others have giant FMV videos of strange TV shows or commercials. One show, calledTantric Computing,is nothing but closeup shots of someone using a computer mouse. Another,Werf’s Tavern, is some kind of musical talk show. There’s also a messaging tool and some kind of fax service. What’s most interesting aboutBlippo Plus, though, isn’t just that it’s odd. It’s also a mystery that seems like it will evolve over the course of the season. Playdate maker Panic says that “Playdate season 2 owners should tune in weekly and make sure they are connected to WiFi when season 2 updates at 10 AM PT on Thursdays.” There are lots of other promising games planned for season 2, including the point-and-click adventureShadowgate PDand whatever the heckLong PuppyandTiny Turnipare. But an FMV mystery that unfolds over the course of weeks is something that’s pretty unique to this format — and further evidence that the Playdate exists in its own parallel universe.

The platform is also launching an open beta of higher-quality streams. byJay Peters Twitch is announcing a bunch of updates at TwitchCon Europe, including the ability to host a vertical livestream and an open beta test that lets creators stream at a higher quality. The rollout of vertical streams should make livestreams easier to watch in portrait mode on your phone. Down the line, streamers won’t be forced to pick between vertical or horizontal streams; instead, Twitch will let streamers offer their streams in a dual format. “This allows us to better optimize the viewing experience for a device and how a viewer is using that device,” Twitch saysin a blog post. “Viewers watching on desktop will still see landscape Viewers on mobile will see your vertical layout if they hold the phone vertically, or landscape if they rotate their phone horizontally.” The company will start testing the feature with a small amount of channels this summer and expand it later this year. Twitch is also rolling out an open beta of “2k streaming” (which lets creators stream at 1440p) that will be available to all Twitch partners and affiliates. “Upgrading to 2k (1440p) streaming offers a noticeable step up from 1080p streaming, with richer detail, improved clarity, and better performance – whether you’re gaming, making art, or just chatting,” according toa Twitch support page. Before now, the feature had been available in a more limited beta. If you’re a streamer that wants to try it out, you can put your nameon the waitlist. The platform is introducing a way to rewind streams, too. This could be really handy if you miss something while a streamer is live or just want to go back and rewatch something. Twitch will test the feature first with a small number of viewers this summer. Twitch’sblog postincludes details about other features coming to the service, including a “combos” feature for viewers to support a streamer, the ability for streamers to run their own gift sub promotions, some improvements to clips for streamers and viewers, and that reaching affiliate status is now “more achievable.” Twitch CEO Dan Clancy teased the vertical streams and many other updates coming to the platform in 2025 ina letterpublishedin February.

    "title": "Patti LuPone apologizes after Broadway community's open letter on her behavior",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 31, 2025 / 7:08 PM EDT/ CBS News Patti LuPonehas issued an apology after hundreds of Broadway performers spoke out against the three-time Tony Awards winner over what they say is a pattern of \"inappropriate and unacceptable public comments,\" specifically against Broadway star Kecia Lewis, in an open letter. \"For as long as I have worked in the theatre, I have spoken my mind and never apologized. That is changing today.\" LuPone said in her apologypostedSaturday on social media. Lupone issued the apology in response to aletter, dated May 30  and addressed to the American Theatre Wing, the national trade association for the Broadway theatre industry, calling on decision makers to \"hold people accountable for violent, disrespectful, or harmful behavior.\" More than 500 Broadway performers — includingJames Monroe Iglehart, Kalen Allen andTatianna Córdoba— signed the open letter, which was first published inPlaybill. It comes after theNew Yorkerpublished an interview last week with 76-year-old LuPone, a White performer, in which she said of Lewis, who is a Black actress said: \"Don't call yourself a vet, bitch,\" apparently referring to Lewis' November 2024 videoposted to her Instagramin which she spoke about LuPone's behavior. \"This language is not only degrading and misogynistic-it is a blatant act of racialized disrespect. It constitutes bullying. It constitutes harassment. It is emblematic of the microaggressions and abuse that people in this industry have endured for far too long, too often without consequence,\" said the open letter. LuPone's issue with Lewis appeared to have began last fall when she starred in\"The Roommate,\" a two-woman show with Mia Farrowthat was next door to\"Hell's Kitchen,\"a musical inspired by Alicia Key's life and music in which Lewis performed and won Tony for Best Featured Actress in a Musical. According to Lewis' video, LuPone had made complaints about the noise from the musical, which led to changes to the sound design that \"negatively impacted\" the show and its performers. Lewis also brought up a video of LuPone refusing to sign a fan's \"Hell's Kitchen\" playbill because the musical is \"too loud.\" \"I wanted to address this because, Ms. LuPone, these actions, in my opinion, are bullying,\" Lewis said in the video. \"They're offensive, they are racially microaggressive, they're rude, they're rooted in privilege. And these actions also lack a sense of community and leadership for someone as yourself, who has been in the business as long as you have.\" Lewis then asked LuPone, from one Broadway veteran to another, to apologize. When asked, LuPone addressed the situation in the New Yorker article, saying, \"This is not unusual on Broadway. This happens all the time when walls are shared.\" \"She calls herself a veteran? Let's find out how many Broadway shows Kecia Lewis has done, because she doesn't know what the f--- she's talking about,\" LuPone told the New Yorker. CBS News has reached out to LuPone and Lewis for comment. When the New Yorker asked aboutAudra McDonald, who appeared to support Lewis' video, LuPone said: \"That's typical of Audra. She's not a friend.\" She added that the two had issues in the past, but didn't go into details. In her apology on Saturday, LuPone said she regrets her \"flippant and emotional responses during this interview, which were inappropriate, and I am devastated that my behavior has offended others and has run counter to what we hold dear in this community.\" \"I hope to have the chance to speak to Audra and Kecia personally to offer my sincere apologies,\" LuPone added. \"I wholeheartedly agree with everything that was written in the open letter shared yesterday. From middle school drama clubs to professional stages, theatre has always been about lifting each other up and welcoming those who feel they don't belong anywhere else. I made a mistake, I take full responsibility for it, and I am committed to making this right. Our entire theatre community deserves better.\" McDonald, the most nominated and awarded performer in Tony Award history, told CBS News' Gayle King in an interview set to air Tuesday on\"CBS Mornings\"that she had not seen LuPone in 11 years. \"If there's a rift between us, I don't know what it is. That's something you'd have to ask Patti about,\" McDonald said. Next week on June 8, theTony Awardsare set to broadcast on CBS and stream on Paramount+. McDonald could add snatch her seventh Tony win thanks to the revival of \"Gypsy.\" Kiki Intarasuwan is a news editor for CBS News & Stations. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "title": "Moderna's new COVID-19 vaccine mNexspike approved by FDA",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 31, 2025 / 4:41 PM EDT/ CBS/AP The U.S. approved a newCOVID-19 vaccinemade by Moderna late Friday but with limits on who can use it — not a replacement for the company's existing shot, but a second option. The new vaccine, mNexspike, is a step toward next-generation coronavirus vaccines. It's made in a way that allows for a lower dose - a fifth of the dose of its current COVID-19 vaccine, Spikevax - by refining its immune target. The approval \"adds an important new tool to help protect people at high risk of severe disease from COVID-19,\" Stephane Bancel, Moderna's CEO, said in a statement Saturday. TheFood and Drug Administrationapproved the new vaccine for use in all adults 65 and older, and for people age 12 to 64 who have a least one health condition that puts them at increased risk from the coronavirus. That's the same limit that the FDA set in licensing another COVID-19 vaccine option from competitor Novavax. Those restrictions are a departure from how the U.S. has handled COVID-19 vaccines until now, reflecting skepticism about vaccines fromHealth Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.and other Trump officials. Moderna's existing vaccine doesn't face those limits and has long been used for anyone ages 6 months and older. The company said it expected to offer both options this fall. The FDA's approval was based on a study of 11,400 people age 12 and older that compared the new low-dose vaccine with Moderna's existing vaccine. It found the new vaccine was safe and was at least as effective - and more by some measures - than the original shot, the company said. The news came just days after the Trump administrationcanceled funding for Modernato develop a vaccine against potential pandemic flu viruses, including the H5N1 bird flu, despite promising early study results. It also comes as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changes its recommendation to children for COVID-19 vaccine under Kennedy's directive. The agency on Thursdaydropped its recommendationfor all children to get the vaccinated but still broadly recommends COVID-19 vaccines for moderately or severely immunocompromised children, in addition to most adults for now. Kennedy's directive cited \"a review of the recommendations\" of the Food and Drug Administration and National Institutes of Health, saying that the risks of the COVID-19 vaccine for healthy children \"do not outweigh the purported benefits of the vaccine.\" The directive also cited \"the lack of high-quality data demonstrating safety of the mRNA vaccines during pregnancy combined with the uncertainty of the benefits\" for pregnant moms and their baby. \"Truly the death of expertise. This would be like the secretary of transportation directing that all planes must fly 5,000 feet higher than current. It's vibe-based decision making,\" one federal health official said of the directive. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 31, 2025 / 12:58 PM EDT/ CBS News Olympic gold-medalist AlgerianImane Khelifwill be banned from all World Boxing competitions until the boxer undergoes newly mandated genetic sex testing, World Boxing said. The organizationannounced Fridaythat it will introduce mandatory sex testing to determine the eligibility of male and female boxers who want to take part in their competitions. World Boxing said Khelif would be subject to sex testing after concerns arose from her potential participation in the upcoming Eindhoven Box Cup in June. The organization said it contacted the Algerian Boxing Federation to let it know Khelif will not be allowed to participate in the female category at any World Boxing event until undergoing sex testing. \"Imane Khelif may not participate in the female category at the Eindhoven Box Cup, 5-10 June 2025 and any World Boxing event until Imane Khelif undergoes genetic sex screening in accordance with World Boxing's rules and testing procedures,\" a letter from World Boxing to the Algerian Boxing Federation states. The decision to mandate testing came in part due to the controversy surroundingKhelifafter she won a gold medal at theParis Olympics. Khelif came under intense scrutiny over misconceptions about gender, fueled by claims from the International Boxing Association, which has been permanently banned from the Olympics, that both Khelif and another boxer failed unspecified eligibility tests for the women's competition at last year's world championships. Khelif boxed for years on the international stage without any gender issues or questions until the year before the Olympics, when she was disqualified from the IBA's world championships. World Boxing said athletes need to take a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genetic test to determine their sex at birth and their eligibility to compete, the organization said. The test, which can be conducted by nasal/mouth swab, saliva or blood, reveals the presence of the Y chromosome. The results will determine the biological sex. Studies have shown the PCR test to determine sex is highly accurate. A2023 studypublished in Genes found sex assessment achieved an accuracy of 72% on non-adults and 97% on adults. \"World Boxing respects the dignity of all individuals and its overriding priority is to ensure safety and competitive fairness to all athletes,\" the organization said in the statement. CBS News reached out to the Algerian Boxing Federation for comment. Mandatory testing procedures will begin July 1, 2025. Cara Tabachnick is a news editor at CBSNews.com.

    "title": "Teen's family fights for change after sextortion scam leads to death",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 31, 2025 / 9:23 AM EDT/ CBS News Elijah Heacock was a vibrant teen who made people smile. He \"wasn't depressed, he wasn't sad, he wasn't angry,\" father John Burnett told CBS Saturday Morning. But when Elijah received a threatening text with an A.I.-generated nude photo of himself demanding he pay $3,000 to keep it from being sent to friends and family, everything changed. He died by suicide shortly after receiving the message,CBS affiliate KFDA reported. Burnett and Elijah's mother, Shannon Heacock, didn't know what had happened until they found the messages on his phone. Elijah was the victim of asextortion scam, where bad actors target young people online and threaten to release explicit images of them. Scammers often ask for money or coerce their victims into performing harmful acts. Elijah's parents said they had never even heard of the term until the investigation into his death. \"The people that are after our children are well organized,\" Burnett said. \"They are well financed, and they are relentless.They don't need the photos to be real, they can generate whatever they want, and then they use it to blackmail the child.\" Reports of the scheme have skyrocketed: The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children said it received more than 500,000 reports of sextortion scams targeting minors in just the last year. At least 20 young people have taken their own lives because of sextortion scams since 2021, the Federal Bureau of Investigationestimates. Teen boys have been specifically targeted, theNCMEC said in 2023, and with the rise ingenerative A.I.services, the images don't even need to be real. More than 100,000 reports filed with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children this year involved generative A.I., the organization said. \"You don't actually need any technical skills at this point to create this kind of illegal and harmful material,\" Dr. Rebecca Portnoff, the head of data science at Thorn, a non-profit focused on preventing child exploitation online, said. Just looking up how to make a nude image of someone will bring up search results for apps, websites and other resources, Portnoff said. The crisis may seem overwhelming. But there are solutions, Portnoff said. Thorn has its owninitiative, \"Safety By Design,\" which outlines barriers A.I. companies should set when developing their technology. Those barriers are designed to help reduce sextortion, Thorn said. A handful of major A.I. companies have agreed to the campaign principles, Thornsays. \"There are real, tangible solutions that do exist that are being deployed today that can help to prevent this kind of misuse,\" Portnoff said. Government entities are also working to fight sextortion. The recently-passed\"Take It Down\" Act, championed by Melania Trump and signed into law by President Trump, makes it a federal crime to post real and fake sexually explicit images of someone online without their consent. The law also requires social media companies and other websites to remove such images within 48 hours of a victim's request. Elijah's parents said they never want other families to suffer like they have. They have fought for change,CBS affiliate WLKY reported. They said they hope the\"Take It Down\" Actwill make a difference. \"It's kind of like a bullet in a war. It's not going to win the war,\" Burnett said. \"No war is ever won by one bullet. You got to win battles. You got to win fights. And we're in it.\" Nicole Valdes is a correspondent based in Nashville. Valdes was most recently a weather correspondent with FOX Weather.

    "title": "Trump pardons drive a big, burgeoning business for lobbyists",
    "article_text": "Seeking a pardon from President Donald Trump has become big business for lobbying and consulting firms close to the administration, with wealthy hopefuls willing to spend millions of dollars for help getting their case in front of the right people. “From a lobbying perspective, pardons have gotten profitable,” said one lobbyist whose firm has received such calls. There’s no set rate for pardon help. But two people directly familiar with proposals to lobbying firms said they knew of a client’s offer of $5 million to help get a case to Trump. These people, like others, were granted anonymity to speak candidly. And while such high numbers do not seem to be standard, they speak to a burgeoning pardon economy. A $5 million figure is higher than numbersThe New York Times reportedTrump allies receiving for pardon help in his first term. In 2021, the outlet reported that Brett Tolman, a former federal prosecutor who advised the White House on pardons, was receiving five-figure amounts for the work, according to filings and a client. The Times also reported that John Kiriakou, a former CIA officer convicted of disclosing classified information, was told that former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a Trump ally, could help secure him a pardon for $2 million; Giuliani disputed that account. Cozying up to a president’s allies or hiring lobbyists to gain access to clemency isn’t new. But along with the price spike, what’s different now is that Trump is issuing pardons on a rolling basis — rather than most coming at the end of the administration. “It’s like the Wild West,” a Trump ally and lobbyist said. “You can basically charge whatever you want.” The increased use of the pardon power has some familiar with the process concerned about the appearance of financial and political favoritism that can erode confidence in the clemency process. “This is very destructive to our justice system. It delegitimizes the pardon power,” said Elizabeth Oyer, who served as pardon attorney for the Department of Justice during President Joe Biden’s administration. “It entrenches a two-tier system of justice in which wealth really can be a get-out-of-jail-free card.” “All pardon and commutation decisions are solely made by President Trump, who is always willing to give well-deserving Americans a second chance — especially those who have been unfairly targeted by a corrupt justice system,” White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said. Since Trump took office in January, he has pardoned or granted executive clemency tomore than 1,500 people, most related to the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. It’s a significant uptick from a similar time frame during his first term in office. Even without the Jan. 6 defendants, Trump has pardoned 58 people; in his previous administration, Trump had pardoned just one person in his first year. In the past week alone, Trump has pardoned or commuted the sentences of 27 people. Many clemency recipients have been people with the means to elevate their case — allies, donors,celebritiesand former politicians. There is a process for vetting pardon applications through the Justice Department’s Office of the Pardon Attorney, but presidents have not always followed it. Some of the pardons Trump is granting, involving people currently incarcerated, would not be able to make it through the typical process. Unless the Justice Department grants a waiver, the regulations say that petitioners need to wait until five years after either the conviction or the end of their sentence, and they place a premium on acceptance of responsibility. As of this week, there are 6,394 applications for commutations and 1,529 applications for pardons. Not every Trump-aligned lobbyist is eager to take pardon work; some who have turned down offers said they have passed them along to a small handful of Trump supporters who then help the pardon-seeker get on the president’s radar. In some cases, referral fees are paid to the lobbying firms even if they are not directly engaged to do the work, according to three people familiar with the process. “There are others, like us, who have turned down a bunch of that work, but generally the way that works is that they get referred to others who are helping,” said a Washington-based lobbyist whose firm has been approached by people seeking a pardon. The person said that roughly half their client inquiries in recent months have been for pardon help. In the past, it was roughly 1 in 50 client solicitations. The Trump ally who is also a lobbyist said their firm is not taking pardon clients out of concern that they could face blowback when the political winds inevitably change. Another lobbyist said they turn down pardon work because it feels “sketchy.” In a case that drew significant attention this week, Trumppardoned reality-TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who were convicted in 2022 on fraud and tax evasion-related charges. The two built a national following through their reality show “Chrisley Knows Best.” The pardons came after a public pressure campaign led by their daughter Savannah, a prominent Trump supporter with nearly 3 million followers on Instagram. Key to reaching Trump is pushing a message that will appeal to the president, particularly one around a politicization of justice by Democrats or overzealous prosecutors. “Weaponization is real,”said Tolman, who is now a Fox News contributor and the executive director of the conservative-leaning criminal justice reform group Right on Crime. “If you are in power and you are willing to use the power of the prosecution to go after your political adversaries, how do we fix it?” His comments came during a 2024panelat the Conservative Political Action Conference focused on the “weaponization” of the justice system. The panel also included now-Attorney General Pam Bondi and Savannah Chrisley, who used the platform to talk about her parents’ case. Tolman has become one of the go-tos for help when people are seeking Trump pardons. Hehelped the Chrisleys, as well as Charles Kushner, the father of Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. At the end of Trump’s first term, he alsolobbied Trump to pardon Ross Ulbricht, who in 2015 was sentenced to life in prison on narcotics and money-laundering charges related to his dark web marketplace Silk Road. Getting Ulbricht out of prison became a cause célèbre to many on the political right who thought he was unjustly targeted by the justice system. During the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump promised to pardon Ulbricht, and he did so as one of his first acts after taking office. Tolman did not respond to a request seeking comment. Other Trump allies who have played influential roles in the pardon process over the past few weeks include Washington attorney Adam Katz, who previously represented Giuliani and helped securea sentence commutationfor a California businesswoman in Trump’s first term. Katz did not return a request seeking comment, but lobbyists interviewed by NBC News named him, along with Tolman, as two of the people to whom they refer pardon work. Corcoran Partners, a Florida-based lobbying firm whose managing partner includes Matt Blair, the brother of Trump deputy chief of staff James Blair, has alsoregisteredto lobby on federal pardon issues for the first time. In March, Matt Blair’s firm registered to lobby on “pardon” issues for Juno Empire Inc., a Miami-based company that is identified in federal lobbying records as a “medical billing advocate.” It’s not clear what this company does or what its issue is, and there was no contact information available for Juno. Corcoran Partners did not return a request for comment. Longtime Trump confidant Roger Stone alsoregisteredin February to lobby for Roger Ver, who is nicknamed “Bitcoin Jesus” and, if extradited from Spain, faces up to 109 years in prison for, among other things, allegations that he tried to evade nearly $50 million in tax payments. It’s the first time Stone’s firm, Drake Ventures, formally registered to lobby on pardon issues, records show. An attorney for Ver did not return a request for comment. Some lawyers also see new hope for their clients in Trump’s willingness to issue pardons. Tim Parlatore, a former member of Trump’s legal team, represented Adm. Robert Burke, who wasconvicted in May of bribery. Parlatore told NBC News that he had unsuccessfully attempted to get Justice Department leadership to reconsider the Burke case before it went to trial, and that he’d try to secure a pardon now that Burke has been convicted. “I think I have a great appeal for Burke, but will I go and ask for a pardon? Absolutely! You’d be crazy not to,” he said. “The way that that case was investigated and presented, I believe, was fundamentally unfair.” Parlatore said he wanted to “pursue all possible remedies” for his client. “I’ll go to call people and try to figure this thing out, whether it’s Ed Martin, Alice Johnson,” he said, referring to Trump’s pardon attorney and his more informal “pardon czar.” “I just want to make sure that that gets in front of the right people to make a decision.” The president’s pardon power, a vestige of the British monarchy, is largely unchecked. Trumpisn’t the first personto face criticism for controversial pardons. But the perception that Trump is leaning into rewarding supporters was boosted last week when Martin, Trump’s current pardon attorney, openly signaled the political motivations forthe pardongiven to Scott Jenkins. The former Virginia sheriff was facing 10 years in prison after a federal jury found him guilty of taking $75,000 in return for doling out law enforcement authority to local businessmen, as well as two undercover FBI special agents. “No MAGA left behind,” Martinpostedon X after the pardon was announced. One staffer familiar with the pardon process said Martin and the administration were trying to “undo the damage from weaponization,” often choosing to pardon people they felt were unfairly targeted. “You have a president who’s going to exercise his presidential powers that he has from the Constitution, whether or not there’s some guidebook,” they said. “He does it on trade, he does it on immigration, and he does it everywhere.” That staffer and other Trump allies argue that it was Biden’s use of the power that has set the precedent under which they are currently operating. Biden pardoned or commuted the sentences of more than 8,000 people, including to his sonHunter, who was set to be sentenced on federal gun charges just weeks before the pardon was issued. On the way out of office,he also issued pre-emptive pardonsfor some members of his family, worried Trump would try to prosecute them. An administration official called Biden’s pardon decisions an “absolutely earth-shattering departure from presidential norms.” Trump supporters argue the potential hit to a president’s reputation that previously existed for the perception of politicizing the clemency process is no longer there. “It’s become easier after Hunter’s pardon. Long gone are the days of an eleventh-hour pardon. It has become more transactional,” the Trump ally and lobbyist said. Beyond increased payments to lobbying firms to help secure pardons, family members of those seeking pardons have also found it useful to amplify their platform by going on conservative media outlets that Trump is known to watch or appear in MAGA-friendly spaces. Savannah Chrisley, for example, spoke at the Republican National Convention and suggestedher parents were targeted for being conservative. During a press conference Friday, she said it was a “misconception” that she “either paid for a pardon or slept for a pardon” for her parents. She said she simply went to Washington and made sure she was in “the right room at the right time” and “begged for meetings.” “Many people have come on my OAN program to make their case for pardons,” former Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, who became a news anchor for One America News Network after Trump unsuccessfully tried to install him as attorney general, told NBC News. “Some have not. Some might get granted in the future. I trust President Trump’s judgment.” Gaetz says he himself has not officially focused on pardon work but said his show, like others, can help amplify a pardon-seeker’s case. “I’ve covered pardons as a journalist,” he said. “One way people get on the pardon radar is coming on my show and making their case on other media President Trump is known to watch.”",

    "title": "Japanese village that built California's fishing industry could become container storage",
    "article_text": "From the turn of the 20th century to the early 1940s, a human-made island in San Pedro Bay held a flourishing Japanese American fishing village that helped develop Southern California’s mighty seafood industry. On Terminal Island, more than 3,000 first- and second-generation immigrant fishermen from Japan, the issei and nisei, pioneered innovative techniques, like 6-foot bamboo poles and live bait, to catch albacore tuna and sardines. Their wives cleaned and packaged their bounties in the canneries. Then, during World War II, the entire community was uprooted and the village razed. The only remnants of the enclave are a pair of vacant buildings on Tuna Street, now dwarfed by colorful stacks of shipping containers and large green cranes that cover the island. The buildings are now under threat of demolition to make room for more containers, leading surviving Terminal Islanders and their descendants — now well past retirement age — to come together to try to save the last tangible connection to a largely forgotten legacy. “These buildings are an integral part of American history that should never be forgotten,” said Paul Boyea, a board member of the Terminal Islanders Association, a group of about 200 former residents and their kin. In the past few months, advocates have made significant progress in saving the structures. In February, Councilmember Tim McOsker introduced a motion to designate the buildings as historic-cultural monuments, a status that would provide additional safeguards against demolition. In June, L.A.’s Cultural Heritage Commission will review the motion and decide whether to advance it for a vote before the City Council. This month, the National Trust for Historic Preservation put the buildings on its annual list of the 11 most endangered historic sites in America. Former Terminal Islanders recall scenes of families praying at a Shinto shrine and Buddhist temple, shopping at grocery stores, and watching movies and attending dances at Fisherman’s Hall. Children practiced judo and played baseball. Boyea, 69, was born after the war and never lived on Terminal Island. But he said he’s always felt a strong connection to the place where his mother was born, in 1919. His grandfather was a fishing fleet captain and president of the Japanese fishermen’s association. The two buildings on Tuna Street, the commercial corridor of the Japanese village, housed the grocery A. Nakamura Co. and the dry goods store Nanka Shoten, both established more than a century ago. Efforts to preserve the buildings began two decades ago but gained momentum last May, when the Port of L.A., which owns a majority of the island, recommended demolishing them to create more storage space. Phillip Sanfield, the port’s communications director, said that the department is working with Terminal Island advocates to hash out plans for the buildings and that no decision has yet been made. Terry Hara, president of the Terminal Islanders Association, described Tuna Street as the “Broadway” of the Japanese fishing community. Hara’s grandfather worked as a superintendent at a cannery, while his father and two uncles all became commercial fishermen. Terminal Island residents observed Japanese traditions, he said, holding mochi pounding celebrations on New Year’s and dancing in kimonos at Girls’ Day festivals. “It was one big happy family,” said Hara, 67. “Nobody locked their doors and families provided for one another when the need arose.” Geraldine Knatz, a maritime expert and co-author of “Terminal Island: Lost Communities on America’s Edge,” said Japanese residents made up roughly two-thirds of Terminal Island’s population in the 1930s. The island, known in the early 20th century as “L.A.’s Playground,” was also home to sizable numbers of artists, writers and lumber workers. “It was a big, diverse community,” Knatz said. That all changed on Dec. 7, 1941, when Japanese planes bombed Pearl Harbor. The government quickly arrested hundreds of Japanese fishermen on suspicion that they were usingfishing boats to spyfor the Japanese military. They were sent to a federal prison; many didn’t see their families for months. The following February, the remaining residents, mostly women and children, were given 48 hours to vacate the island. Around 800 Terminal Islanders were incarcerated in Manzanar concentration camp, and when they returned, almost the entire village had been bulldozed. With nowhere to live, many former residents resettled in Long Beach and the South Bay. “The nisei didn’t talk about incarceration because of the trauma,” Boyea said. In the 1970s, a group of survivors and descendants formed the Terminal Islanders Association to stay in touch through social events like annual picnics and New Year’s celebrations. Later, members became involved in preservation and education efforts, partnering with the L..A Conservancy to set up a memorial in 2002 and now advocating for the restoration of the Tuna Street buildings. Preservationists and descendants of Terminal Island residents have suggested converting the buildings into a museum or an education center, or a general goods store for port workers on the island. “These buildings could serve some kind of community function while still communicating their history in some way,” said Adam Scott Fine, chief executive of L.A. Conservancy. The number of surviving Terminal Island residents is dwindling. Less than two dozen are still alive, Hara said, including his mother, who is 100. As a descendent, he feels it’s his obligation to honor the legacy they created. “This is an American story, good or bad,” Hara said. “We need to pass on the experience that took place to our children and grandchildren.”",

At the time, Trump said that \"Jared will drive NASA’s mission of discovery and inspiration.\" White House spokesperson Liz Huston said earlier Saturday that “it’s essential that the next leader of NASA is in complete alignment with President Trump’s America First agenda.” Isaacman has been to space twice, on commercial missions that he funded himself. The news outlet Semafor first reportedSaturday that the White House was expected to pull Isaacman’s nomination. The move comes as Isaacman was approaching a possible confirmation vote. A cloture motion on his nomination, which ends debate, is eligible for a vote on Monday, according to the congressional calendar. Isaacman, who founded the payment processing company Shift4 and serves as its CEO,on X responded to the withdrawalof his nomination with thanks, writing, \"I am incredibly grateful to President Trump\" and the Senate. \"The President, NASA and the American people deserve the very best--an Administrator ready to reorganize, rebuild and rally the best and brightest minds to deliver the world-changing headlines NASA was built to create,\" he wrote in the post on X Saturday night.",

    "title": "Judge blocks Trump administration from revoking protected status for thousands of Venezuelans",
    "article_text": "A federal judge on Friday blocked the Trump administration from revoking the temporary protected status of roughly 5,000  Venezuelans who are in the U.S., despite Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s Februarydecisionto terminate a Biden-era extension of the program. U.S. District Judge Edward E. Chen in San Francisco ruled Friday that thousands of Venezuelans who received paperwork extending their protected status during a brief period earlier this year could keep it. That period began when then-Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas extended protected status for Venezuelans in January and ended when Noem terminated it in February. Chen wrote that if their paperwork has their protected status ending in October 2026, those Venezuelans should not be eligible for deportation while the case is ongoing. The National TPS Alliance and the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to NBC News’ request for comment on Friday’s order. It’s the latest decision in a legal sagathat could affect around 350,000Venezuelans who in 2023 were granted the right to temporarily live and work in the U.S. The National TPS Alliance and seven Venezuelan TPS holders sued the Department of Homeland Security after Noem and the Trump administration stripped Venezuelans of their protected status shortly after the new president was inaugurated. In the lawsuit, the plaintiffs in the caseallegedthat Noem’s decision was racially discriminatory and violated legal procedures. They also cited Mayorkas’ decision in the waning days of the Biden administration to extend temporary protected status for Venezuelans through October 2026. After a federal judge overseeing the case blocked President Donald Trump and his administration from terminating protected status for Venezuelans while the court case played out, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to intervene. And earlier this month, in a two-paragraph order, the United States’ highest courtallowed the Trump administration to revoke TPSfor Venezuelans despite the ongoing case. The Trump administration’s move to terminate legal status for Venezuelans under TPS comes amid a broader push for mass deportations. Since the start of the second Trump administration in January, the governmenthas detained and deportedtens of thousands of undocumented immigrants. And other deportation attempts have also drawn legal challenges, like the case ofKilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man whom the administration admitted was mistakenly deported to El Salvador.",

    "title": "New Orleans holds burial of repatriated African Americans whose skulls were used in racist research",
    "article_text": "NEW ORLEANS — New Orleans celebrated the return and burial of the remains of 19 African American people whose skulls had been sent to Germany for racist research practices in the 19th century. On Saturday, a multifaith memorial service including a jazz funeral, one of the city's most distinct traditions, paid tribute to the humanity of those coming home to their final resting place at the Hurricane Katrina Memorial. \"We ironically know these 19 because of the horrific thing that happened to them after their death, the desecration of their bodies,\" said Monique Guillory, president of Dillard University, a historically Black private liberal arts college, which spearheaded the receipt of the remains on behalf of the city. \"This is actually an opportunity for us to recognize and commemorate the humanity of all of these individuals who would have been denied, you know, such a respectful send-off and final burial.\" The 19 people are all believed to have passed away from natural causes between 1871 and 1872 at Charity Hospital, which served people of all races and classes in New Orleans during the height of white supremacist oppression in the 1800s. The hospital shuttered following Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The remains sat in 19 wooden boxes in the university's chapel during a service Saturday that also included music from the Kumbuka African Drum and Dance Collective. A New Orleans physician provided the skulls of the 19 people to a German researcher engaged phrenological studies — the debunked belief that a person's skull could determine innate racial characteristics. \"All kinds of experiments were done on Black bodies living and dead,\" said Eva Baham, a historian who led Dillard University's efforts to repatriate the individuals' remains. \"People who had no agency over themselves.\" In 2023, the University of Leipzig in Germany reached out to the City of New Orleans to find a way to return the remains, Guillory said. The University of Leipzig did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \"It is a demonstration of our own morality here in New Orleans and in Leipzig with the professors there who wanted to do something to restore the dignity of these people,\" Baham said. Dillard University researchers say more digging remains to be done, including to try and track down possible descendants. They believe it is likely that some of the people had been recently freed from slavery. \"These were really poor, indigent people in the end of the 19th century, but ... they had names, they had addresses, they walked the streets of the city that we love,\" Guillory said. \"We all deserve a recognition of our humanity and the value of our lives.\"",

    "title": "Long hair and hot dogs: Meet the Japanese baseball stars making their mark on the Cubs",
    "article_text": "CHICAGO — Last year, Chicago Cubs pitcher Shota Imanaga wowed fans when he took the mound at Wrigley Field for Chicago’s home opener before going on to have a stellar season — Imanaga’s first in the majors. The pitcher, also known as the “Throwing Philosopher,” went 15-3 for the Cubs in 2024, racking up 174 strikeouts to go along with a 2.91 ERA. The 31-year-old had previously played professionally in Japan from 2016 to 2023. In the States, Imanaga soon became a fan favorite not only for how well he pitched, but also for his charisma, sense of humor, and his long, flowing hair. Watch “NBC Nightly News” tonight at 6:30 p.m. ET/5:30 p.m. CT. “You’re saying I have the best hair?” a laughing Imanaga told NBC News through a translator when asked about his free-flowing locks. “My teammates, if I’m drying my hair, if I’m combing my hair, they compliment me, telling me I have beautiful hair,” Imanaga said. “But my mom and my friends are like, it’s probably time to cut your hair.” It’s not only the hair that’s helped Imanaga endear himself to the Wrigley faithful. During his rookie year, the pitcher decided on “Chelsea Dagger” as his walk-up song, a tune more famously known in Chicago as the goal song for the NHL’s Blackhawks, dating back well over a decade to the hockey team’s heyday. “When I first got to the Cubs, I think a lot of the fans were, ‘Who is this pitcher?’” Imanaga said. “And so for me, it was really important to get acclimated with the team, with the fans. What was important was to pick something that all the Chicago fans love.” Imanaga’s countryman, outfielder Seiya Suzuki, employs a similar ethos when asked about his favorite ballpark food, saying he would have to go with hot dogs, “especially” considering the team he plays for. Suzuki joined the Cubs in 2022 after a nine-year career in Japan, and he and Imanaga have since played key roles in helping turn around the team’s fortunes. After back-to-back losing seasons, Chicago posted two winning records in each of the last two years. Suzuki and Imanaga have become global stars in the process and are part of agrowing Japanese presence in Major League Baseball.In April, the Cubs opened the season in Tokyo against the Los Angeles Dodgers, who feature three Japanese-born players in Shohei Ohtani, Yoshinobu Yamamoto and Roki Sasaki. “When I was younger, I watched baseball in the U.S., and I thought it was really cool,” Suzuki said. “So if when I’m playing and the fans in Japan, even if it’s one extra person gets to watch, and they want to come to the U.S. to enjoy baseball or something like that, I think that’d be great.” While both Suzuki and Imanaga have pushed the right buttons with their home fans, Chicago’s current objective is to get Imanaga back on the mound. He hasn’t started a game since May 4, when he left a start against the Brewers with a hamstring injury. The Cubs placed Imanaga, whose jersey is the team's most popular this season, on the 15-day injured list the next day. He’s currently progressing toward a return in early June, ramping up his rehab with some bullpen work. Chicago is currently first in the NL Central.",

    "article_text": "Taylor Swift is enjoying her “Reputation” era again after breaking the news that she now owns her master recordings. Swift announced in a May 30 letter on her website that after re-recording four of her albums —dubbed “Taylor’s Version”— shebought back all of her masters, including her 2006 self-titled debut and 2017’s “Reputation.” Swift’s longtime friend and producer, Jack Antonoff, shared a video of the duo onXthe night of May 30 as they enjoyed a “guilt free” listen of “Reputation” to celebrate the news. In the clip, Swift and Antonoff sang the album’s ninth track, “Getaway Car” and re-created a viral moment from her 2020 documentary “Miss Americana” where they wrote the song together. Swift was initially carryingher cat Meredithat the start of the video before placing the feline down to finish the tune with Antonoff, who screamed as the clip ended. “rep forever guilt free listening!” Antonoff captioned the post. After re-recording four of her albums, including “Fearless,” “Speak Now,” “Red” and “1989,” Swift addressed in her May 30 letter to fans whether she would be re-releasing the rest of her first six albums to complete the project. “What about Rep TV? Full transparency: I haven’t even re-recorded a quarter of it,” Swift wrote on herwebsite. “The Reputation album was so specific to that time in my life, and I kept hitting a stopping point when I tried to remake it…To be perfectly honest, it’s the one album in those first 6 that I thought couldn’t be improved upon by redoing it. Not the music, or the photos, or the videos. So I kept putting it off.” However, Swift shared, “I’ve already completely re-recorded my entire debut album, and I really love how it sounds now.” Whether fans will get to hear “Taylor’s Version” of those two albums — or even just the vault tracks — remains unknown, with the singer writing, “But if it happens, it won’t be from a place of sadness and longing for what I wish I could have. It will just be a celebration now.” After working with Swift on several tracks from 2014’s “1989,” Antonoff and Swift kicked off a long partnership of co-writing and producing her subsequent albums, including “Reputation,” “Lover,” “Folklore,” “Evermore,” “Midnights” and several songs on her most recent record, “The Tortured Poets Department.” During an October 2023 appearance on“Sunday Sitdown with Willie Geist,”Antonoff opened up about his friendship and working relationship with Swift over the decades, including why he thinks they work so well together. “That relationship has gone on and on and on and I think we’ve just pushed each other endlessly,” Antonoff explained. “I could quantify our relationship in very reductive ways about the things we agree on, the sounds we like, but the truth is, we’ve just grown together. She’s put an amazing amount of belief in me.”",

    "title": "Patti LuPone apologizes after she's  denounced for 'degrading' comments on Kecia Lewis, Audra McDonald",
    "article_text": "Broadway legend Patti LuPone has apologized for “flippant and emotional” remarks she made about fellow marquee actors in aNew Yorkermagazine interview. The mea culpa came via LuPone’s social media accounts Saturday after more than 600 members of the Broadway community signed an open letter condemning the three-time Tony winner’s controversial comments about Kecia Lewis and Audra McDonald. The letter, addressed to the American Theatre Wing and the Broadway League, criticized LuPone for calling Lewis a “b----” and saying McDonald is “not a friend” in the New Yorker profile. “This language is not only degrading and misogynistic — it is a blatant act of racialized disrespect. It constitutes bullying. It constitutes harassment,” the letter says. Theater publicationPlaybill reportedsignatories to the letter include Tony winnersJames Monroe Iglehart,Maleah Joi MoonandWendell Pierce. In her apology Saturday, LuPone said she, too, signs on to the document, at least in spirit. “​I wholeheartedly agree with everything that was written in the open letter.” She apologized for using words, particularly toward Lewis, that were “demeaning and disrespectful.” “I am deeply sorry,” she said. LuPone added, “I regret my flippant and emotional responses during this interview, which were inappropriate, and I am devastated that my behavior has offended others and has run counter to what we hold dear in this community. I hope to have the chance to speak to Audra and Kecia personally to offer my sincere apologies.” Lewis stars in “Hell’s Kitchen” on Broadway, for which she won a 2024 Tony Award. McDonald won the 2014 Tony Award for best actress in a play (her sixth) and is the first performer to win the award in all performance categories. She is nominated for the 11th time this year for her lead performance in the musical “Gypsy.” As of Saturday, the letter had garnered 682 signatures, according to adocumentthat allows people to request the addition of their names. “Individuals, including Patti Lupone, who use their platform to publicly demean, harass, or disparage fellow artists — particularly with racial, gendered, or otherwise violent language — should not be welcomed at industry events, including the Tony Awards, fundraisers, and public programs,” the letter said. The American Theatre Wing and The Broadway League — which present the Tony Awards, set to be held June 8 — did not immediately respond to requests for comment. LuPone also did not immediately respond. In the New Yorker interview, LuPone was asked about a controversy that circulated during her time co-starring in “The Roommate” with Mia Farrow last fall. The play, which has since closed, shared a wall with the Tony-winning musical “Hell’s Kitchen,” featuring Lewis. LuPone reportedly asked for the sound design of “Hell’s Kitchen” to be adjusted because the music would bleed through the shared walls, and sent the sound and stage management team flowers and a thank-you note once it was fixed. Lewis posted avideo on Instagramin November in response, calling LuPone’s actions “racially microaggressive” and “rooted in privilege.” Producers of “The Roommate”posted a statementthe following day thanking the “Hell’s Kitchen” staff for the fix, saying, “These kinds of sound accommodations from one show to another are not unusual and are always deeply appreciated.” LuPone said of the back-and-forth in the New Yorker interview: “Let’s find out how many Broadway shows Kecia Lewis has done, because she doesn’t know what the f--- she’s talking about. ... She’s done seven. I’ve done 31. Don’t call yourself a vet, b----.” The New Yorker noted that Lewis has actually done 10 shows and LuPone 28. Michael Schulman, the interviewer, mentioned to LuPone that McDonald — who holds the record as the Broadway performer with the most Tony Awards and nominations — gave the video “supportive emojis.” The 76-year-old actor responded: “And I thought, ‘You should know better.’ That’s typical of Audra. She’s not a friend.” McDonald was asked about LuPone’s comments in a “CBS Mornings” interview with Gayle King to discuss her latest Tony-nominated role as Mama Rose in “Gypsy.” “If there’s a rift between us, I don’t know what it is,” McDonald said in a clip CBSshared on social mediaahead of the full interview, which airs next week. “That’s something that you’d have to ask Patti about.” The open letter said LuPone’s attempt to “discredit” McDonald’s legacy was not only a personal offense, but “a public affront to the values of collaboration, equity, and mutual respect that our theater community claims to uphold.” In her apology on Saturday, LuPone acknowledged those values and said she had let them down. “From middle school drama clubs to professional stages, theatre has always been about lifting each other up and welcoming those who feel they don’t belong anywhere else,” she said. “I made a mistake, I take full responsibility for it, and I am committed to making this right. Our entire theatre community deserves better.”",

    "article_text": "PARIS — The French Open isn't the only sports event in Europe drawing attention from tennis players:The Champions League finalwill decide the continent's best soccer club, and one of the two teams involved Saturday night isParis Saint-Germain, whose stadium is a couple of blocks from Roland-Garros. Count Novak Djokovic among those rooting for PSG against Italy's Inter Milan, and he hoped to be able to tune in on TV to watch the big clash that'll be held in Munich, Germany. So Djokovic made that preference known to the people in charge of arranging the program at the clay-court Grand Slam tournament he's won three times — a common practice, especially among the sport's elite. They often ask to be scheduled at a certain time. Or to avoid a certain time. \"I will definitely watch it if I'm not playing (in the) night session. Yeah, that will be nice,\" Djokovic said with a big smile. \"FYI, Roland-Garros schedule.\" Hint, hint. Except his plea went unheeded: When Saturday's order of play was released Friday, 24-time major champion Djokovic's third-round match against Filip Misolic was the one picked for under the lights at Court Philippe-Chatrier due to begin at 8:15 p.m. local time, 45 minutes before Inter Milan vs. PSG starts. Others who begged off from competing at that hour got their wish. Although one, Arthur Fils, the 14th-seeded Frenchman who grew up near Paris and is a big PSG fan, wound up pulling out of the tournament because of a stress fracture in his back after being placed in an afternoon match against No. 17 Andrey Rublev. \"We have many requests from players\" every day, tournament director Amélie Mauresmo said. \"There's no fixed rule. We try to accommodate everyone as much as possible. That includes requests from players, broadcasters and spectators. ... It's a real puzzle, I won't lie.\" Coco Gauff said she doesn't often ask for a certain time slot, but when she does, it's usually related to competing in singles and doubles on the same day (the American won the French Open doubles title last year but isn't playing doubles this time). The 2023 U.S. Open champion, who is currently No. 2 in singles, has noticed that events tend to listen more to elite players than others. \"If you're ranked a little bit higher, they'll hear more of your input, for sure,\" Gauff said. \"To be honest, I think it's rightfully deserved. I feel like if you do well on tour, win so many tournaments, you should have a little bit more priority when it comes to that.\" Except even the very best of the best don't always have success with these sorts of things. Madison Keys, who was the U.S. Open runner-up in 2017 and won the Australian Open in January, knows what it's like to be ignored. \"Sometimes the request goes (in), they write it down, and they say, 'OK,'\" but then don't do anything about it, Keys said. \"I really think that it's just kind of up to what the tournament wants, what TV wants, things like that,\" she added. \"Sometimes you kind of get what you ask for. And other times, you get the complete opposite.\" Just ask Djokovic. \"Whatever they schedule me, I have to accept,\" he said earlier this season. \"I think I earned my right to ... (communicate) with the tournament management, where I can express what I would like, depending on a given day, depending on the opponent.\"",

    "article_text": "INDIANAPOLIS — The Indiana Pacers will try to take advantage of a second chance to eliminate theNew York Knicksin the Eastern Conference finals at home on Saturday night. Indiana is looking to make the second NBA Finals appearance in franchise history and the first in 25 years. The Pacers lead the series 3-2 after losing Game 5 to the Knicks 111-94 on Thursday. Tip is scheduled for 8 p.m. Eastern and will be televised on TNT, and a Pacers win would mark the final chapter in the network's long history of broadcasting NBA games. TNT will not carry games next season. A Knicks winwould send the series back to New York on Monday night for Game 7. The series winner will open the the finals on Thursday at Oklahoma City. Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton is 11-2 all-time in playoff home games. He had a historic stat line in his most recent contest at Gainbridge Fieldhouse, finishing with 32 points, 15 assists, 12 rebounds, four steals and no turnovers Tuesday. The two-time All-Star became the first player to record at least 30 points, 15 assists, 10 rebounds and have no turnovers in a playoff game since turnovers were first tracked in 1977-78. And he did it in front of his father, John, who had an eight-game ban lifted following his on-court confrontation with Milwaukee star Giannis Antetokounmpo when his son's last-second layup eliminated the Bucks in their first-round series. New York lost the first two games of this series at home but has rebounded to win two of the last three since inserting Mitchell Robinson into the starting lineup. Coach Tom Thibodeau expanded New York's rotation and All-Star center Karl-Anthony Towns started driving to the basket more frequently. Anthony-Towns has averaged 24 points and 13.3 rebounds in the last three games while All-Star guard Jalen Brunson has averaged 28.7 points over that span. Brunson also has topped the 30-point mark in each of the last two to extend the Knicks' postseason record for most 30-point games in franchise history with 21. New York is trying to become the 14th team in league history to rally from a 3-1 deficit to win a series. It hasn't reached the finals since 1999 and hasn't won a title since 1973. The road team won each of the first three games in this series while the home team has prevailed in each of the last two.",

Various heat alerts remain in effect for 14 million people across California on Saturday afternoon, including in Sacramento, Redding and Bakersfield. Temperatures will be 10 to 25 degrees above average, with highs maxing out between 95 and 110 degrees. Las Vegas and Reno, Nevada, face possible record highs on Saturday afternoon. On Friday, a record-high temperature of 96 was set in downtown Los Angeles — beating the record of 95 set in 1972, according to theNational Weather Servicefield office in the city. These unseasonably hot conditions will also fuel fire concerns across the region. Alerts are currently in place for parts of Nevada and California, including Reno, through Sunday. Gusty 50 mph winds, above-average temperatures and low humidity will create prime conditions for fire growth. A strong cold front will continue to drag smoke from ongoing wildfires in parts of Canada’s Manitoba and Saskatchewan provinces into the U.S. this weekend. Currently, air quality alerts are in place for more than 20 million people across the Midwest. Minnesota and Michigan, including the cities of Minneapolis, Duluth and Grand Rapids, are in the risk zone. Smoke and hazy skies from these fires may be visible as far south as the Gulf Coast. Air quality conditions are expected to improve across the Upper Midwest by the middle of the workweek.",

    "title": "Army estimates Trump's military parade could cost $16 million in damage to D.C.",
    "article_text": "The cost to repair Washington, D.C., streets after the upcoming military parade celebrating the Army’s 250th anniversary could cost as much as $16 million, according to U.S. military officials. That’s part of an estimated $45 million total cost forthe June 14 military parade, which coincides with President Donald Trump’s 79th birthday. The cost estimates have fluctuated as planning continues. In an interview with NBC News’ “Meet the Press” earlier this month, the presidentdefended the cost of the parade, calling it “peanuts compared to the value of doing it.” “We have the greatest missiles in the world. We have the greatest submarines in the world. We have the greatest army tanks in the world. We have the greatest weapons in the world. And we’re going to celebrate it,” Trump added. The parade will be part of a massive celebration in downtown Washington that includes a number of events, historical displays and a demonstration by the Army’s famous parachute team, the Golden Knights. The parade itself will include about 130 vehicles, including 28 M1A1 tanks, 28 Bradley Fighting Vehicles, 28 Stryker armored fighting vehicles and a number of vehicles towing artillery launchers. More than 50 helicopters will also participate in an “extensive flyover” in the nation’s capital. The event will also bring more than 9,000 soldiers from around the country to Washington, about 7,000 of whom will march in the parade itself. The event will also include at least eight Army bands, and some troops will ride on the nearly three dozen horses and two mules expected to march as part of a historical section of the parade. The soldiers visiting Washington for the parade will be housed in government buildings, including the Department of Agriculture building and a General Services Administration building. A few thousand others will bunk at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland. The troops are expected to eat military rations called meals ready to eat, or MREs, during their stay. Trump had long wanted a military parade during his first term. But it was canceled over concerns about cost and the optics of a military parade in the nation’s capital that could be seen as akin to the kind commonly seen in Moscow, Beijing or Pyongyang, North Korea. The inclusion of tanks in a potential parade also drew concerns about what their tracks might do to the streets of Washington. The Army is preparing for the potential harm to Washington streets with several measures it hopes will avert damage. These include using 1-inch-thick steel plates, some as long as 20 feet, at places along the parade route where the tanks must turn and where those turns could cause the most damage to the streets. The addition of the steel plates is expected to cost the Army about $3 million, officials said. The tanks are also being outfitted with new track pads to create separation between the metal track and the ground, the officials said. Army officials said they believe these measures will keep the damage to a minimum and bring the cost of repairing any damage down significantly. “We are targeting those areas that we have concerns, which primarily are areas where the tracked vehicles are going to have to turn sharply,” said Col. Jesse Curry, the executive officer for the Army Corps of Engineers. “We are not particularly concerned that this staging area and the routes have been selected to really minimize the risk from weight and damage. But really, those areas where tanks have to turn, particularly the areas where the surface of the pavement, we typically receive an exaggerated level of stress.” The parade route itself will follow Constitution Avenue along the National Mall from 23rd Street to around 15th Street. The roughly 50 aircraft will include Black Hawk and Chinook helicopters, including several special operations variants. Also planned to fly are several historic aircraft, including World War II-era B-25s, P-51s and Vietnam-era helicopters. The parade is expected to last roughly 90 minutes and will be broken into eras: the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, World War I, WWII, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Gulf War, the Global War on Terror, the modern Army and the future. The Army’s Golden Knights will jump during the presentation about the Army’s future and plan to deliver an American flag to Trump. In the early-May “Meet the Press” interview, Trump defended himself against claims that the military parade was for his birthday, reiterating that the Army’s 250th birthday and Flag Day are also on June 14. “My birthday happens to be on Flag Day,” he said. “I view it for Flag Day, not necessarily my birthday. Somebody put it together. But no, I think we’re going to do something on June 14, maybe, or somewhere around there. But I think June 14. It’s a very important day.”",

    "title": "Skulls once subject to racist study in Germany are laid to rest in New Orleans",
    "article_text": "Alina Selyukh Skulls of 19 Black Americans have returned to New Orleans after more than a century in Germany, where they were sent for racial research.Jacob Cochran/Dillard Universityhide caption Marie Louise was a lifelong New Orleanian who died of malnutrition. Hiram Malone came to Louisiana from Alabama, hospitalized at 21 with a fatal case of pneumonia. Samuel Prince was a 40-year-old cook, who succumbed to tuberculosis. They were among 19 Black patients who died at one New Orleans hospital in the 1870s, and whose heads were removed by a doctor to be sent to Germany. There, the crania werestudied as \"specimens\"in what was then a proliferatingpseudoscience of phrenology. It purported connections between someone's intellect or morality and the size or shape of their skull, with some doctors theorizing superiority of one race over another. The skulls of those 19 patients have now been repatriated to Louisiana after more than a century abroad. On Saturday, they were honored in a multi-faith memorial and laid to rest in a jazz funeral rooted in New Orleans tradition. \"We can't be sure exactly where they came from. And so here, we have them. And what are we to make of what happened to them?\" Eva Baham, a historian from Dillard University who led the cultural repatriation committee, saidduring Saturday's service. \"You can be angry. You could be upset, rightly so. But we can't stay there.\" The remainswere returned bythe University of Leipzig, which in 2023 contacted the city archeologist in New Orleans,acknowledgingthe skulls had been acquired in a \"colonial context and unethically.\" The two-year return process involved city, state and academic institutions. It culminated in a notable international restitution, a return of African American remains from Europe — with many remains still lingering in archival collections across the U.S. and abroad,at museumsand universities. Researchers presume many of the 19 people had been enslaved, later moved freely after the Civil War, and eventually fell ill or were institutionalized in asylums before landing at Charity Hospital in New Orleans. It was one of the nation's oldest hospitals, serving the city's poor for centuries;it closed due to damagefrom Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Hospital death records helped Baham's team reconstructsome biographical momentsof the 13 men and four women. Two people are unidentified. At Saturday's memorial, a group of Dillard students read from those biographies, ending with their return journey: \"Another voyage across the Atlantic, passing bones of enslaved Africans on the ocean floor,\" the students' account went. \"From Africa, to the Caribbean, to the United Sates of America; from New Orleans, Louisiana, to Leipzig, Germany; from Leipzig, Germany to New Orleans, Louisiana — justice carries 19 men and women home. May they walk freely in the city of God, in dignity and in honor.\" Saturday's ceremony included prayers from ten religious leaders of different faiths, with an African drum and dance performance leading the attendees out of the chapel. Handlers in white gloves carried memorial vessels containing the skulls for interment. And a jazz band accompanied the procession. \"These people's lives had meaning,\" Baham said during the memorial, later adding: \"History is not to wallow in, or wind about. It is to build on. It is to move forward. And when we keep our past hidden, we're starting over every day.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "What's it like to anchor NPR live special coverage?",
    "article_text": "By Noah Caldwell , Scott Detrow , Ari Shapiro What's it like to anchor NPR live special coverage? Two seasoned NPR hosts discuss. SCOTT DETROW, HOST:It is time now for our weekly Reporter's Notebook segment, and for reasons that will become clear in just a moment, I am going to hand over the hosting duties here and bring in ALL THINGS CONSIDERED host Ari Shapiro.ARI SHAPIRO, BYLINE: Ta-da. How the tables have turned.DETROW: I guess this means you're asking me questions.SHAPIRO: I am. You just got back from Rome. And I love this because you and I often hang out in each other's offices. Hosts talk to each other about what goes on behind the scenes. Now we get to actually share that with other people out in the world.So take us to that moment. You're there covering the new Pope's selection, the conclave. What was it like in the moment that you saw the white smoke coming out of the chimney? Where were you?DETROW: This was interesting. I had thought so much about what this would be like, to wait and just stare at this chimney on the Sistine Chapel, which is one of the most famous, beautiful places in the world. And for the first 3 or 4 hours or so of staring at the chimney, it was really exciting, and I was on the edge of my seat and just waiting. And then it was just kind of waiting, you know?SHAPIRO: Yeah. There was a seagull.DETROW: There was a seagull, a lot of seagulls, a lot of waiting. And we kind of figured out the rhythms of when smoke would appear, black smoke, and when it was safe to wander away.SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: And there was a point on that Thursday where I thought, OK, if this ballot had happened, it would have happened by now and we would have seen the black smoke. I'll be back in a few minutes.SHAPIRO: Oh, so you left.DETROW: So I left. I left our broadcast area, which - it's important for later - was a fenced-in area. There was, like, a maybe 4-foot-high fence surrounding the area. And I walked about - if St. Peter's Square is a clock, our broadcast booth was at 6 o'clock. The basilica is at 12 o'clock. So I walked over to about 3 o'clock, where my favorite thing in all of the square was. It was this marble water fountain of papal tiaras. It was three papal tiaras with a little spout coming out of it. And I just loved the papal tiara water fountain. I'm like, I'm going to go refill my water bottle in the papal tiara water fountain.SHAPIRO: So it was at an actual drinking fountain.DETROW: Yes.SHAPIRO: Was it holy water?DETROW: I'd like to think so.SHAPIRO: (Laughter).DETROW: So I went there with Tyler Bartlam, my producer, and I walk over to get water, and we're just chitchatting. And we just hear this scream, and a scream turns into a roar that spreads out throughout the entire square. And you see..SHAPIRO: 'Cause there are thousands of people there.DETROW: Yeah, just waiting for this moment, and we see white smoke, and we both look at each other, and we yell, pope.SHAPIRO: (Laughter).DETROW: And we ran as fast as we could because the goal was to get on the air as soon as there was white smoke.SHAPIRO: Of course, live special rolling coverage. Yeah.DETROW: So I ran as fast as I could, and I...SHAPIRO: I'm imagining you shoving spectators aside, body slamming people.DETROW: I didn't have to throw an elbow, but I was ready. We're getting back as quickly as possible, and we come up, and there's a security checkpoint for the broadcasting area where you have to go - you have to show a code. They have to scan you. It takes a moment. And our editor, Courtney Dorning, just says, jump, just jump. And I truly don't actually have memory of this, but I apparently, without stopping, did a running jump, vaulted over, pushed my hand down, jumped over the fence, sat down, said OK, put on my headphones, and we were on the air, like, 30 seconds later.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: You're listening to live Special Coverage from NPR News. I'm Scott Detrow coming to you from the edge of St. Peter's Square. The bells are tolling at St. Peter's. White smoke has billowed out of the Sistine Chapel's chimney, and that means the Catholic Church has a new pope. This election comes on the second day of the papal conclave.SHAPIRO: So first, you have to fill time until you find out who the pope was.DETROW: Yes.SHAPIRO: And then you find out who it is. Already, this is going to be huge news, whoever the new pope is. And then you find out that he's an American from Chicago. I heard that moment in your voice on the air.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: Oh, my goodness. The pope is from Chicago. Robert Francis Prevost has been selected as the next pope of the Roman Catholic Church, a 69-year-old...To have the name be announced as American, this suddenly becomes this monumental historical moment for Americans. Never in the history of the church has the Pope been American. And as a Catholic growing up, I was taught it's just never going to happen...SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: ...Because they wouldn't elect an American because America has so much power in the world already. But yeah, it was an exciting moment, and listening back, you could hear that I was excited...SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: ...Because we're in this amazing space at this cool breaking news moment, and I don't know. I was excited to be there.SHAPIRO: I think there's something about live coverage that allows you to get caught up in the moment in a way that is journalistically appropriate, whether you're talking about an inauguration or a new pope or the emotion of a tragedy, if you're covering a war or a natural disaster.DETROW: Yeah.SHAPIRO: Being an unbiased, nonpartisan - use whatever word you want to use - journalist doesn't mean you can't feel the electricity in the room.DETROW: Right.SHAPIRO: And you could really hear that in your voice.DETROW: Yeah. Thank you. And I think that's something that - you and I both feel that way, and I don't know necessarily if people in our positions 20 or 30 years ago felt that way. But I think, like, it's OK to sound human, right? And I think about the fact that last summer, I was in the host chair when the Trump assassination attempt took place. And...SHAPIRO: Right...DETROW: ...The first conversation we had on the line was our colleague Danielle Kurtzleben, who had been in the middle...SHAPIRO: At the rally.DETROW: ...At the rally, ducking under a table, terrified. And the first thing I'm doing is talking to Danielle, and I just like - are you OK?(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: ...Wondering about, like, what might happen next.DETROW: You're in a safe position right now, just to ask that?KURTZLEBEN: Yes, they - people are streaming by. Most in the crowd have already left. The leaving started pretty immediately.DETROW: Then we were doing interviews with people who had been in the crowd with their children. I think just, like, letting your humanity show through and being empathetic is important.SHAPIRO: Do you remember the first time you ever did live special coverage?DETROW: Yes, and it was totally terrifying. It's something of a...SHAPIRO: I often find it totally terrifying.DETROW: I've always been attracted to it. Of all the things that broadcast news (ph), Special Coverage has been the most exciting to me. I actually remember listening to you do it for Arab Spring at one point. You were, like, filling in...SHAPIRO: Oh, wow.DETROW: ...On Talk Of The Nation, and I had a long car drive.SHAPIRO: Talk Of The Nation - that's a throwback. Yeah.DETROW: And you were doing it...SHAPIRO: Years ago.DETROW: ...For hours. And it just - you know, it was always cool as a listener for me to think about those moments. And the first time I got a chance to, I was actually pretty new at NPR. We were going to simulcast a PBS presidential debate, and all I had to do was talk for a minute because it was - you know, it started at, like,10:01.SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: Right? And the mic opened...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...At 10 o'clock. And I still remember the feeling of just, like, my throat going down to my toes and...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...Back up.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: From NPR News, this is special coverage of the PBS NewsHour Democratic primary debate. I'm Scott Detrow. In a moment, we expect former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Senator Bernie...And I don't think I sound as bad as I think I sounded, but just, like, you're listening to live Special Coverage  - just because, like, the - there - usually, there's no script at all, you know?SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: And over time, I've gotten more comfortable with that, and I kind of enjoy the adrenaline rush of that.SHAPIRO: You said it's your favorite thing. Why?DETROW: You know, I've always wanted to be a reporter. I think I've always wanted to be a broadcast journalist. I actually come from a family of broadcast journalists. My dad was a longtime radio news anchor. My uncle was a longtime DJ in San Diego. So, like, just, like, talking into microphones is a big part of my family.And I think, like, growing up as I first started to get interested in it, like, those big moments where the TV anchors are bringing you through an election or a big breaking story was always exciting to me. As I got older, I would - I'll admit to being a nerd and, like, pulling up YouTube clips of kind of, like, live special coverage through the years of...SHAPIRO: Wow.DETROW: ...Big breaking stories and just kind of, like, watching it to see - especially as I started doing it - to see, like, how the anchors or hosts handle one moment or the other, like, the idea that you don't have a safety net, and you don't have a script in front of you, and it's kind of up to you to think on your feet and kind of bring the audience along with you.I like putting myself in the audience's shoes and asking - sometimes just stopping a reporter and asking a really, really basic question because I'm thinking of, like, what does the person totally fresh to the story need to know? And I think just, like, not being afraid to ask a really basic question. I think sometimes we want to, like, try and impress the people who are listening or who we're interviewing. And I think, like, usually with Special Coverage, the most basic question is, what's happening? Why is that happening? Who is this person? Rinse and repeat.SHAPIRO: What are you seeing? Yeah.DETROW: Yeah, what are you seeing? Tell us what's in front of your eyes, especially for something like that. Like, what are you seeing? And then we go to Ruth Sherlock in the crowd. Like, people are overjoyed and waving American flags and crying in the middle of St. Peter's Square, and it's an exciting moment, you know? Like, that's the story right there.SHAPIRO: My favorite moment from listening to your live Special Coverage in Rome was when you thanked your Latin teacher at the end.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: I want to thank my high school Latin teacher, Father Robert Cregan (ph), for this moment where we were translating Latin on the radio. Thank you so much for listening. Again, a lot more coverage of this enormous story - I'm Scott Detrow. We will talk to you...Father Cregan - he was my teacher of freshman year Latin. He is no longer with us, but it just jumped into my head. I was like, you know, never before and probably never again is translating Latin something I'm going to be using as part of my job, so I'm just going to take this moment to thank him.SHAPIRO: It was a great moment. Scott, thank you for letting us flip the tables and answering my questions for a change.DETROW: Well, I appreciate it. Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

As I got older, I would - I'll admit to being a nerd and, like, pulling up YouTube clips of kind of, like, live special coverage through the years of...SHAPIRO: Wow.DETROW: ...Big breaking stories and just kind of, like, watching it to see - especially as I started doing it - to see, like, how the anchors or hosts handle one moment or the other, like, the idea that you don't have a safety net, and you don't have a script in front of you, and it's kind of up to you to think on your feet and kind of bring the audience along with you.I like putting myself in the audience's shoes and asking - sometimes just stopping a reporter and asking a really, really basic question because I'm thinking of, like, what does the person totally fresh to the story need to know? And I think just, like, not being afraid to ask a really basic question. I think sometimes we want to, like, try and impress the people who are listening or who we're interviewing. And I think, like, usually with Special Coverage, the most basic question is, what's happening? Why is that happening? Who is this person? Rinse and repeat.SHAPIRO: What are you seeing? Yeah.DETROW: Yeah, what are you seeing? Tell us what's in front of your eyes, especially for something like that. Like, what are you seeing? And then we go to Ruth Sherlock in the crowd. Like, people are overjoyed and waving American flags and crying in the middle of St. Peter's Square, and it's an exciting moment, you know? Like, that's the story right there.SHAPIRO: My favorite moment from listening to your live Special Coverage in Rome was when you thanked your Latin teacher at the end.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: I want to thank my high school Latin teacher, Father Robert Cregan (ph), for this moment where we were translating Latin on the radio. Thank you so much for listening. Again, a lot more coverage of this enormous story - I'm Scott Detrow. We will talk to you...Father Cregan - he was my teacher of freshman year Latin. He is no longer with us, but it just jumped into my head. I was like, you know, never before and probably never again is translating Latin something I'm going to be using as part of my job, so I'm just going to take this moment to thank him.SHAPIRO: It was a great moment. Scott, thank you for letting us flip the tables and answering my questions for a change.DETROW: Well, I appreciate it. Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The authoritative record of NPR’s programming is the audio record. It is time now for our weekly Reporter's Notebook segment, and for reasons that will become clear in just a moment, I am going to hand over the hosting duties here and bring in ALL THINGS CONSIDERED host Ari Shapiro.ARI SHAPIRO, BYLINE: Ta-da. How the tables have turned.DETROW: I guess this means you're asking me questions.SHAPIRO: I am. You just got back from Rome. And I love this because you and I often hang out in each other's offices. Hosts talk to each other about what goes on behind the scenes. Now we get to actually share that with other people out in the world.So take us to that moment. You're there covering the new Pope's selection, the conclave. What was it like in the moment that you saw the white smoke coming out of the chimney? Where were you?DETROW: This was interesting. I had thought so much about what this would be like, to wait and just stare at this chimney on the Sistine Chapel, which is one of the most famous, beautiful places in the world. And for the first 3 or 4 hours or so of staring at the chimney, it was really exciting, and I was on the edge of my seat and just waiting. And then it was just kind of waiting, you know?SHAPIRO: Yeah. There was a seagull.DETROW: There was a seagull, a lot of seagulls, a lot of waiting. And we kind of figured out the rhythms of when smoke would appear, black smoke, and when it was safe to wander away.SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: And there was a point on that Thursday where I thought, OK, if this ballot had happened, it would have happened by now and we would have seen the black smoke. I'll be back in a few minutes.SHAPIRO: Oh, so you left.DETROW: So I left. I left our broadcast area, which - it's important for later - was a fenced-in area. There was, like, a maybe 4-foot-high fence surrounding the area. And I walked about - if St. Peter's Square is a clock, our broadcast booth was at 6 o'clock. The basilica is at 12 o'clock. So I walked over to about 3 o'clock, where my favorite thing in all of the square was. It was this marble water fountain of papal tiaras. It was three papal tiaras with a little spout coming out of it. And I just loved the papal tiara water fountain. I'm like, I'm going to go refill my water bottle in the papal tiara water fountain.SHAPIRO: So it was at an actual drinking fountain.DETROW: Yes.SHAPIRO: Was it holy water?DETROW: I'd like to think so.SHAPIRO: (Laughter).DETROW: So I went there with Tyler Bartlam, my producer, and I walk over to get water, and we're just chitchatting. And we just hear this scream, and a scream turns into a roar that spreads out throughout the entire square. And you see..SHAPIRO: 'Cause there are thousands of people there.DETROW: Yeah, just waiting for this moment, and we see white smoke, and we both look at each other, and we yell, pope.SHAPIRO: (Laughter).DETROW: And we ran as fast as we could because the goal was to get on the air as soon as there was white smoke.SHAPIRO: Of course, live special rolling coverage. Yeah.DETROW: So I ran as fast as I could, and I...SHAPIRO: I'm imagining you shoving spectators aside, body slamming people.DETROW: I didn't have to throw an elbow, but I was ready. We're getting back as quickly as possible, and we come up, and there's a security checkpoint for the broadcasting area where you have to go - you have to show a code. They have to scan you. It takes a moment. And our editor, Courtney Dorning, just says, jump, just jump. And I truly don't actually have memory of this, but I apparently, without stopping, did a running jump, vaulted over, pushed my hand down, jumped over the fence, sat down, said OK, put on my headphones, and we were on the air, like, 30 seconds later.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: You're listening to live Special Coverage from NPR News. I'm Scott Detrow coming to you from the edge of St. Peter's Square. The bells are tolling at St. Peter's. White smoke has billowed out of the Sistine Chapel's chimney, and that means the Catholic Church has a new pope. This election comes on the second day of the papal conclave.SHAPIRO: So first, you have to fill time until you find out who the pope was.DETROW: Yes.SHAPIRO: And then you find out who it is. Already, this is going to be huge news, whoever the new pope is. And then you find out that he's an American from Chicago. I heard that moment in your voice on the air.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: Oh, my goodness. The pope is from Chicago. Robert Francis Prevost has been selected as the next pope of the Roman Catholic Church, a 69-year-old...To have the name be announced as American, this suddenly becomes this monumental historical moment for Americans. Never in the history of the church has the Pope been American. And as a Catholic growing up, I was taught it's just never going to happen...SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: ...Because they wouldn't elect an American because America has so much power in the world already. But yeah, it was an exciting moment, and listening back, you could hear that I was excited...SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: ...Because we're in this amazing space at this cool breaking news moment, and I don't know. I was excited to be there.SHAPIRO: I think there's something about live coverage that allows you to get caught up in the moment in a way that is journalistically appropriate, whether you're talking about an inauguration or a new pope or the emotion of a tragedy, if you're covering a war or a natural disaster.DETROW: Yeah.SHAPIRO: Being an unbiased, nonpartisan - use whatever word you want to use - journalist doesn't mean you can't feel the electricity in the room.DETROW: Right.SHAPIRO: And you could really hear that in your voice.DETROW: Yeah. Thank you. And I think that's something that - you and I both feel that way, and I don't know necessarily if people in our positions 20 or 30 years ago felt that way. But I think, like, it's OK to sound human, right? And I think about the fact that last summer, I was in the host chair when the Trump assassination attempt took place. And...SHAPIRO: Right...DETROW: ...The first conversation we had on the line was our colleague Danielle Kurtzleben, who had been in the middle...SHAPIRO: At the rally.DETROW: ...At the rally, ducking under a table, terrified. And the first thing I'm doing is talking to Danielle, and I just like - are you OK?(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: ...Wondering about, like, what might happen next.DETROW: You're in a safe position right now, just to ask that?KURTZLEBEN: Yes, they - people are streaming by. Most in the crowd have already left. The leaving started pretty immediately.DETROW: Then we were doing interviews with people who had been in the crowd with their children. I think just, like, letting your humanity show through and being empathetic is important.SHAPIRO: Do you remember the first time you ever did live special coverage?DETROW: Yes, and it was totally terrifying. It's something of a...SHAPIRO: I often find it totally terrifying.DETROW: I've always been attracted to it. Of all the things that broadcast news (ph), Special Coverage has been the most exciting to me. I actually remember listening to you do it for Arab Spring at one point. You were, like, filling in...SHAPIRO: Oh, wow.DETROW: ...On Talk Of The Nation, and I had a long car drive.SHAPIRO: Talk Of The Nation - that's a throwback. Yeah.DETROW: And you were doing it...SHAPIRO: Years ago.DETROW: ...For hours. And it just - you know, it was always cool as a listener for me to think about those moments. And the first time I got a chance to, I was actually pretty new at NPR. We were going to simulcast a PBS presidential debate, and all I had to do was talk for a minute because it was - you know, it started at, like,10:01.SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: Right? And the mic opened...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...At 10 o'clock. And I still remember the feeling of just, like, my throat going down to my toes and...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...Back up.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: From NPR News, this is special coverage of the PBS NewsHour Democratic primary debate. I'm Scott Detrow. In a moment, we expect former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Senator Bernie...And I don't think I sound as bad as I think I sounded, but just, like, you're listening to live Special Coverage  - just because, like, the - there - usually, there's no script at all, you know?SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: And over time, I've gotten more comfortable with that, and I kind of enjoy the adrenaline rush of that.SHAPIRO: You said it's your favorite thing. Why?DETROW: You know, I've always wanted to be a reporter. I think I've always wanted to be a broadcast journalist. I actually come from a family of broadcast journalists. My dad was a longtime radio news anchor. My uncle was a longtime DJ in San Diego. So, like, just, like, talking into microphones is a big part of my family.And I think, like, growing up as I first started to get interested in it, like, those big moments where the TV anchors are bringing you through an election or a big breaking story was always exciting to me.

But yeah, it was an exciting moment, and listening back, you could hear that I was excited...SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: ...Because we're in this amazing space at this cool breaking news moment, and I don't know. I was excited to be there.SHAPIRO: I think there's something about live coverage that allows you to get caught up in the moment in a way that is journalistically appropriate, whether you're talking about an inauguration or a new pope or the emotion of a tragedy, if you're covering a war or a natural disaster.DETROW: Yeah.SHAPIRO: Being an unbiased, nonpartisan - use whatever word you want to use - journalist doesn't mean you can't feel the electricity in the room.DETROW: Right.SHAPIRO: And you could really hear that in your voice.DETROW: Yeah. Thank you. And I think that's something that - you and I both feel that way, and I don't know necessarily if people in our positions 20 or 30 years ago felt that way. But I think, like, it's OK to sound human, right? And I think about the fact that last summer, I was in the host chair when the Trump assassination attempt took place. And...SHAPIRO: Right...DETROW: ...The first conversation we had on the line was our colleague Danielle Kurtzleben, who had been in the middle...SHAPIRO: At the rally.DETROW: ...At the rally, ducking under a table, terrified. And the first thing I'm doing is talking to Danielle, and I just like - are you OK?(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: ...Wondering about, like, what might happen next.DETROW: You're in a safe position right now, just to ask that?KURTZLEBEN: Yes, they - people are streaming by. Most in the crowd have already left. The leaving started pretty immediately.DETROW: Then we were doing interviews with people who had been in the crowd with their children. I think just, like, letting your humanity show through and being empathetic is important.SHAPIRO: Do you remember the first time you ever did live special coverage?DETROW: Yes, and it was totally terrifying. It's something of a...SHAPIRO: I often find it totally terrifying.DETROW: I've always been attracted to it. Of all the things that broadcast news (ph), Special Coverage has been the most exciting to me. I actually remember listening to you do it for Arab Spring at one point. You were, like, filling in...SHAPIRO: Oh, wow.DETROW: ...On Talk Of The Nation, and I had a long car drive.SHAPIRO: Talk Of The Nation - that's a throwback. Yeah.DETROW: And you were doing it...SHAPIRO: Years ago.DETROW: ...For hours. And it just - you know, it was always cool as a listener for me to think about those moments. And the first time I got a chance to, I was actually pretty new at NPR. We were going to simulcast a PBS presidential debate, and all I had to do was talk for a minute because it was - you know, it started at, like,10:01.SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: Right? And the mic opened...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...At 10 o'clock. And I still remember the feeling of just, like, my throat going down to my toes and...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...Back up.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: From NPR News, this is special coverage of the PBS NewsHour Democratic primary debate. I'm Scott Detrow. In a moment, we expect former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Senator Bernie...And I don't think I sound as bad as I think I sounded, but just, like, you're listening to live Special Coverage  - just because, like, the - there - usually, there's no script at all, you know?SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: And over time, I've gotten more comfortable with that, and I kind of enjoy the adrenaline rush of that.SHAPIRO: You said it's your favorite thing. Why?DETROW: You know, I've always wanted to be a reporter. I think I've always wanted to be a broadcast journalist. I actually come from a family of broadcast journalists. My dad was a longtime radio news anchor. My uncle was a longtime DJ in San Diego. So, like, just, like, talking into microphones is a big part of my family.And I think, like, growing up as I first started to get interested in it, like, those big moments where the TV anchors are bringing you through an election or a big breaking story was always exciting to me. As I got older, I would - I'll admit to being a nerd and, like, pulling up YouTube clips of kind of, like, live special coverage through the years of...SHAPIRO: Wow.DETROW: ...Big breaking stories and just kind of, like, watching it to see - especially as I started doing it - to see, like, how the anchors or hosts handle one moment or the other, like, the idea that you don't have a safety net, and you don't have a script in front of you, and it's kind of up to you to think on your feet and kind of bring the audience along with you.I like putting myself in the audience's shoes and asking - sometimes just stopping a reporter and asking a really, really basic question because I'm thinking of, like, what does the person totally fresh to the story need to know? And I think just, like, not being afraid to ask a really basic question. I think sometimes we want to, like, try and impress the people who are listening or who we're interviewing. And I think, like, usually with Special Coverage, the most basic question is, what's happening? Why is that happening? Who is this person? Rinse and repeat.SHAPIRO: What are you seeing? Yeah.DETROW: Yeah, what are you seeing? Tell us what's in front of your eyes, especially for something like that. Like, what are you seeing? And then we go to Ruth Sherlock in the crowd. Like, people are overjoyed and waving American flags and crying in the middle of St. Peter's Square, and it's an exciting moment, you know? Like, that's the story right there.SHAPIRO: My favorite moment from listening to your live Special Coverage in Rome was when you thanked your Latin teacher at the end.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: I want to thank my high school Latin teacher, Father Robert Cregan (ph), for this moment where we were translating Latin on the radio. Thank you so much for listening. Again, a lot more coverage of this enormous story - I'm Scott Detrow. We will talk to you...Father Cregan - he was my teacher of freshman year Latin. He is no longer with us, but it just jumped into my head. I was like, you know, never before and probably never again is translating Latin something I'm going to be using as part of my job, so I'm just going to take this moment to thank him.SHAPIRO: It was a great moment. Scott, thank you for letting us flip the tables and answering my questions for a change.DETROW: Well, I appreciate it. Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

You just got back from Rome. And I love this because you and I often hang out in each other's offices. Hosts talk to each other about what goes on behind the scenes. Now we get to actually share that with other people out in the world.So take us to that moment. You're there covering the new Pope's selection, the conclave. What was it like in the moment that you saw the white smoke coming out of the chimney? Where were you?DETROW: This was interesting. I had thought so much about what this would be like, to wait and just stare at this chimney on the Sistine Chapel, which is one of the most famous, beautiful places in the world. And for the first 3 or 4 hours or so of staring at the chimney, it was really exciting, and I was on the edge of my seat and just waiting. And then it was just kind of waiting, you know?SHAPIRO: Yeah. There was a seagull.DETROW: There was a seagull, a lot of seagulls, a lot of waiting. And we kind of figured out the rhythms of when smoke would appear, black smoke, and when it was safe to wander away.SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: And there was a point on that Thursday where I thought, OK, if this ballot had happened, it would have happened by now and we would have seen the black smoke. I'll be back in a few minutes.SHAPIRO: Oh, so you left.DETROW: So I left. I left our broadcast area, which - it's important for later - was a fenced-in area. There was, like, a maybe 4-foot-high fence surrounding the area. And I walked about - if St. Peter's Square is a clock, our broadcast booth was at 6 o'clock. The basilica is at 12 o'clock. So I walked over to about 3 o'clock, where my favorite thing in all of the square was. It was this marble water fountain of papal tiaras. It was three papal tiaras with a little spout coming out of it. And I just loved the papal tiara water fountain. I'm like, I'm going to go refill my water bottle in the papal tiara water fountain.SHAPIRO: So it was at an actual drinking fountain.DETROW: Yes.SHAPIRO: Was it holy water?DETROW: I'd like to think so.SHAPIRO: (Laughter).DETROW: So I went there with Tyler Bartlam, my producer, and I walk over to get water, and we're just chitchatting. And we just hear this scream, and a scream turns into a roar that spreads out throughout the entire square. And you see..SHAPIRO: 'Cause there are thousands of people there.DETROW: Yeah, just waiting for this moment, and we see white smoke, and we both look at each other, and we yell, pope.SHAPIRO: (Laughter).DETROW: And we ran as fast as we could because the goal was to get on the air as soon as there was white smoke.SHAPIRO: Of course, live special rolling coverage. Yeah.DETROW: So I ran as fast as I could, and I...SHAPIRO: I'm imagining you shoving spectators aside, body slamming people.DETROW: I didn't have to throw an elbow, but I was ready. We're getting back as quickly as possible, and we come up, and there's a security checkpoint for the broadcasting area where you have to go - you have to show a code. They have to scan you. It takes a moment. And our editor, Courtney Dorning, just says, jump, just jump. And I truly don't actually have memory of this, but I apparently, without stopping, did a running jump, vaulted over, pushed my hand down, jumped over the fence, sat down, said OK, put on my headphones, and we were on the air, like, 30 seconds later.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: You're listening to live Special Coverage from NPR News. I'm Scott Detrow coming to you from the edge of St. Peter's Square. The bells are tolling at St. Peter's. White smoke has billowed out of the Sistine Chapel's chimney, and that means the Catholic Church has a new pope. This election comes on the second day of the papal conclave.SHAPIRO: So first, you have to fill time until you find out who the pope was.DETROW: Yes.SHAPIRO: And then you find out who it is. Already, this is going to be huge news, whoever the new pope is. And then you find out that he's an American from Chicago. I heard that moment in your voice on the air.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: Oh, my goodness. The pope is from Chicago. Robert Francis Prevost has been selected as the next pope of the Roman Catholic Church, a 69-year-old...To have the name be announced as American, this suddenly becomes this monumental historical moment for Americans. Never in the history of the church has the Pope been American. And as a Catholic growing up, I was taught it's just never going to happen...SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: ...Because they wouldn't elect an American because America has so much power in the world already.

And we kind of figured out the rhythms of when smoke would appear, black smoke, and when it was safe to wander away.SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: And there was a point on that Thursday where I thought, OK, if this ballot had happened, it would have happened by now and we would have seen the black smoke. I'll be back in a few minutes.SHAPIRO: Oh, so you left.DETROW: So I left. I left our broadcast area, which - it's important for later - was a fenced-in area. There was, like, a maybe 4-foot-high fence surrounding the area. And I walked about - if St. Peter's Square is a clock, our broadcast booth was at 6 o'clock. The basilica is at 12 o'clock. So I walked over to about 3 o'clock, where my favorite thing in all of the square was. It was this marble water fountain of papal tiaras. It was three papal tiaras with a little spout coming out of it. And I just loved the papal tiara water fountain. I'm like, I'm going to go refill my water bottle in the papal tiara water fountain.SHAPIRO: So it was at an actual drinking fountain.DETROW: Yes.SHAPIRO: Was it holy water?DETROW: I'd like to think so.SHAPIRO: (Laughter).DETROW: So I went there with Tyler Bartlam, my producer, and I walk over to get water, and we're just chitchatting. And we just hear this scream, and a scream turns into a roar that spreads out throughout the entire square. And you see..SHAPIRO: 'Cause there are thousands of people there.DETROW: Yeah, just waiting for this moment, and we see white smoke, and we both look at each other, and we yell, pope.SHAPIRO: (Laughter).DETROW: And we ran as fast as we could because the goal was to get on the air as soon as there was white smoke.SHAPIRO: Of course, live special rolling coverage. Yeah.DETROW: So I ran as fast as I could, and I...SHAPIRO: I'm imagining you shoving spectators aside, body slamming people.DETROW: I didn't have to throw an elbow, but I was ready. We're getting back as quickly as possible, and we come up, and there's a security checkpoint for the broadcasting area where you have to go - you have to show a code. They have to scan you. It takes a moment. And our editor, Courtney Dorning, just says, jump, just jump. And I truly don't actually have memory of this, but I apparently, without stopping, did a running jump, vaulted over, pushed my hand down, jumped over the fence, sat down, said OK, put on my headphones, and we were on the air, like, 30 seconds later.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: You're listening to live Special Coverage from NPR News. I'm Scott Detrow coming to you from the edge of St. Peter's Square. The bells are tolling at St. Peter's. White smoke has billowed out of the Sistine Chapel's chimney, and that means the Catholic Church has a new pope. This election comes on the second day of the papal conclave.SHAPIRO: So first, you have to fill time until you find out who the pope was.DETROW: Yes.SHAPIRO: And then you find out who it is. Already, this is going to be huge news, whoever the new pope is. And then you find out that he's an American from Chicago. I heard that moment in your voice on the air.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: Oh, my goodness. The pope is from Chicago. Robert Francis Prevost has been selected as the next pope of the Roman Catholic Church, a 69-year-old...To have the name be announced as American, this suddenly becomes this monumental historical moment for Americans. Never in the history of the church has the Pope been American. And as a Catholic growing up, I was taught it's just never going to happen...SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: ...Because they wouldn't elect an American because America has so much power in the world already. But yeah, it was an exciting moment, and listening back, you could hear that I was excited...SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: ...Because we're in this amazing space at this cool breaking news moment, and I don't know. I was excited to be there.SHAPIRO: I think there's something about live coverage that allows you to get caught up in the moment in a way that is journalistically appropriate, whether you're talking about an inauguration or a new pope or the emotion of a tragedy, if you're covering a war or a natural disaster.DETROW: Yeah.SHAPIRO: Being an unbiased, nonpartisan - use whatever word you want to use - journalist doesn't mean you can't feel the electricity in the room.DETROW: Right.SHAPIRO: And you could really hear that in your voice.DETROW: Yeah. Thank you. And I think that's something that - you and I both feel that way, and I don't know necessarily if people in our positions 20 or 30 years ago felt that way. But I think, like, it's OK to sound human, right? And I think about the fact that last summer, I was in the host chair when the Trump assassination attempt took place. And...SHAPIRO: Right...DETROW: ...The first conversation we had on the line was our colleague Danielle Kurtzleben, who had been in the middle...SHAPIRO: At the rally.DETROW: ...At the rally, ducking under a table, terrified. And the first thing I'm doing is talking to Danielle, and I just like - are you OK?(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: ...Wondering about, like, what might happen next.DETROW: You're in a safe position right now, just to ask that?KURTZLEBEN: Yes, they - people are streaming by. Most in the crowd have already left. The leaving started pretty immediately.DETROW: Then we were doing interviews with people who had been in the crowd with their children. I think just, like, letting your humanity show through and being empathetic is important.SHAPIRO: Do you remember the first time you ever did live special coverage?DETROW: Yes, and it was totally terrifying. It's something of a...SHAPIRO: I often find it totally terrifying.DETROW: I've always been attracted to it. Of all the things that broadcast news (ph), Special Coverage has been the most exciting to me. I actually remember listening to you do it for Arab Spring at one point. You were, like, filling in...SHAPIRO: Oh, wow.DETROW: ...On Talk Of The Nation, and I had a long car drive.SHAPIRO: Talk Of The Nation - that's a throwback. Yeah.DETROW: And you were doing it...SHAPIRO: Years ago.DETROW: ...For hours. And it just - you know, it was always cool as a listener for me to think about those moments. And the first time I got a chance to, I was actually pretty new at NPR. We were going to simulcast a PBS presidential debate, and all I had to do was talk for a minute because it was - you know, it started at, like,10:01.SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: Right? And the mic opened...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...At 10 o'clock. And I still remember the feeling of just, like, my throat going down to my toes and...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...Back up.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: From NPR News, this is special coverage of the PBS NewsHour Democratic primary debate. I'm Scott Detrow. In a moment, we expect former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Senator Bernie...And I don't think I sound as bad as I think I sounded, but just, like, you're listening to live Special Coverage  - just because, like, the - there - usually, there's no script at all, you know?SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: And over time, I've gotten more comfortable with that, and I kind of enjoy the adrenaline rush of that.SHAPIRO: You said it's your favorite thing. Why?DETROW: You know, I've always wanted to be a reporter. I think I've always wanted to be a broadcast journalist. I actually come from a family of broadcast journalists. My dad was a longtime radio news anchor. My uncle was a longtime DJ in San Diego. So, like, just, like, talking into microphones is a big part of my family.And I think, like, growing up as I first started to get interested in it, like, those big moments where the TV anchors are bringing you through an election or a big breaking story was always exciting to me. As I got older, I would - I'll admit to being a nerd and, like, pulling up YouTube clips of kind of, like, live special coverage through the years of...SHAPIRO: Wow.DETROW: ...Big breaking stories and just kind of, like, watching it to see - especially as I started doing it - to see, like, how the anchors or hosts handle one moment or the other, like, the idea that you don't have a safety net, and you don't have a script in front of you, and it's kind of up to you to think on your feet and kind of bring the audience along with you.I like putting myself in the audience's shoes and asking - sometimes just stopping a reporter and asking a really, really basic question because I'm thinking of, like, what does the person totally fresh to the story need to know? And I think just, like, not being afraid to ask a really basic question. I think sometimes we want to, like, try and impress the people who are listening or who we're interviewing. And I think, like, usually with Special Coverage, the most basic question is, what's happening? Why is that happening? Who is this person? Rinse and repeat.SHAPIRO: What are you seeing? Yeah.DETROW: Yeah, what are you seeing? Tell us what's in front of your eyes, especially for something like that. Like, what are you seeing? And then we go to Ruth Sherlock in the crowd. Like, people are overjoyed and waving American flags and crying in the middle of St. Peter's Square, and it's an exciting moment, you know? Like, that's the story right there.SHAPIRO: My favorite moment from listening to your live Special Coverage in Rome was when you thanked your Latin teacher at the end.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: I want to thank my high school Latin teacher, Father Robert Cregan (ph), for this moment where we were translating Latin on the radio. Thank you so much for listening. Again, a lot more coverage of this enormous story - I'm Scott Detrow. We will talk to you...Father Cregan - he was my teacher of freshman year Latin. He is no longer with us, but it just jumped into my head. I was like, you know, never before and probably never again is translating Latin something I'm going to be using as part of my job, so I'm just going to take this moment to thank him.SHAPIRO: It was a great moment. Scott, thank you for letting us flip the tables and answering my questions for a change.DETROW: Well, I appreciate it. Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Hosts talk to each other about what goes on behind the scenes. Now we get to actually share that with other people out in the world.So take us to that moment. You're there covering the new Pope's selection, the conclave. What was it like in the moment that you saw the white smoke coming out of the chimney? Where were you?DETROW: This was interesting. I had thought so much about what this would be like, to wait and just stare at this chimney on the Sistine Chapel, which is one of the most famous, beautiful places in the world. And for the first 3 or 4 hours or so of staring at the chimney, it was really exciting, and I was on the edge of my seat and just waiting.

As I got older, I would - I'll admit to being a nerd and, like, pulling up YouTube clips of kind of, like, live special coverage through the years of...SHAPIRO: Wow.DETROW: ...Big breaking stories and just kind of, like, watching it to see - especially as I started doing it - to see, like, how the anchors or hosts handle one moment or the other, like, the idea that you don't have a safety net, and you don't have a script in front of you, and it's kind of up to you to think on your feet and kind of bring the audience along with you.I like putting myself in the audience's shoes and asking - sometimes just stopping a reporter and asking a really, really basic question because I'm thinking of, like, what does the person totally fresh to the story need to know? And I think just, like, not being afraid to ask a really basic question. I think sometimes we want to, like, try and impress the people who are listening or who we're interviewing. And I think, like, usually with Special Coverage, the most basic question is, what's happening? Why is that happening? Who is this person? Rinse and repeat.SHAPIRO: What are you seeing? Yeah.DETROW: Yeah, what are you seeing? Tell us what's in front of your eyes, especially for something like that. Like, what are you seeing? And then we go to Ruth Sherlock in the crowd. Like, people are overjoyed and waving American flags and crying in the middle of St. Peter's Square, and it's an exciting moment, you know? Like, that's the story right there.SHAPIRO: My favorite moment from listening to your live Special Coverage in Rome was when you thanked your Latin teacher at the end.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: I want to thank my high school Latin teacher, Father Robert Cregan (ph), for this moment where we were translating Latin on the radio. Thank you so much for listening. Again, a lot more coverage of this enormous story - I'm Scott Detrow. We will talk to you...Father Cregan - he was my teacher of freshman year Latin. He is no longer with us, but it just jumped into my head. I was like, you know, never before and probably never again is translating Latin something I'm going to be using as part of my job, so I'm just going to take this moment to thank him.SHAPIRO: It was a great moment. Scott, thank you for letting us flip the tables and answering my questions for a change.DETROW: Well, I appreciate it. Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The authoritative record of NPR’s programming is the audio record. So take us to that moment. You're there covering the new Pope's selection, the conclave. What was it like in the moment that you saw the white smoke coming out of the chimney? Where were you?DETROW: This was interesting. I had thought so much about what this would be like, to wait and just stare at this chimney on the Sistine Chapel, which is one of the most famous, beautiful places in the world. And for the first 3 or 4 hours or so of staring at the chimney, it was really exciting, and I was on the edge of my seat and just waiting. And then it was just kind of waiting, you know?SHAPIRO: Yeah. There was a seagull.DETROW: There was a seagull, a lot of seagulls, a lot of waiting. And we kind of figured out the rhythms of when smoke would appear, black smoke, and when it was safe to wander away.SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: And there was a point on that Thursday where I thought, OK, if this ballot had happened, it would have happened by now and we would have seen the black smoke. I'll be back in a few minutes.SHAPIRO: Oh, so you left.DETROW: So I left. I left our broadcast area, which - it's important for later - was a fenced-in area. There was, like, a maybe 4-foot-high fence surrounding the area. And I walked about - if St. Peter's Square is a clock, our broadcast booth was at 6 o'clock. The basilica is at 12 o'clock. So I walked over to about 3 o'clock, where my favorite thing in all of the square was. It was this marble water fountain of papal tiaras. It was three papal tiaras with a little spout coming out of it. And I just loved the papal tiara water fountain. I'm like, I'm going to go refill my water bottle in the papal tiara water fountain.SHAPIRO: So it was at an actual drinking fountain.DETROW: Yes.SHAPIRO: Was it holy water?DETROW: I'd like to think so.SHAPIRO: (Laughter).DETROW: So I went there with Tyler Bartlam, my producer, and I walk over to get water, and we're just chitchatting. And we just hear this scream, and a scream turns into a roar that spreads out throughout the entire square. And you see..SHAPIRO: 'Cause there are thousands of people there.DETROW: Yeah, just waiting for this moment, and we see white smoke, and we both look at each other, and we yell, pope.SHAPIRO: (Laughter).DETROW: And we ran as fast as we could because the goal was to get on the air as soon as there was white smoke.SHAPIRO: Of course, live special rolling coverage. Yeah.DETROW: So I ran as fast as I could, and I...SHAPIRO: I'm imagining you shoving spectators aside, body slamming people.DETROW: I didn't have to throw an elbow, but I was ready. We're getting back as quickly as possible, and we come up, and there's a security checkpoint for the broadcasting area where you have to go - you have to show a code. They have to scan you. It takes a moment. And our editor, Courtney Dorning, just says, jump, just jump. And I truly don't actually have memory of this, but I apparently, without stopping, did a running jump, vaulted over, pushed my hand down, jumped over the fence, sat down, said OK, put on my headphones, and we were on the air, like, 30 seconds later.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: You're listening to live Special Coverage from NPR News. I'm Scott Detrow coming to you from the edge of St. Peter's Square. The bells are tolling at St. Peter's. White smoke has billowed out of the Sistine Chapel's chimney, and that means the Catholic Church has a new pope. This election comes on the second day of the papal conclave.SHAPIRO: So first, you have to fill time until you find out who the pope was.DETROW: Yes.SHAPIRO: And then you find out who it is. Already, this is going to be huge news, whoever the new pope is. And then you find out that he's an American from Chicago. I heard that moment in your voice on the air.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: Oh, my goodness. The pope is from Chicago. Robert Francis Prevost has been selected as the next pope of the Roman Catholic Church, a 69-year-old...To have the name be announced as American, this suddenly becomes this monumental historical moment for Americans. Never in the history of the church has the Pope been American. And as a Catholic growing up, I was taught it's just never going to happen...SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: ...Because they wouldn't elect an American because America has so much power in the world already. But yeah, it was an exciting moment, and listening back, you could hear that I was excited...SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: ...Because we're in this amazing space at this cool breaking news moment, and I don't know. I was excited to be there.SHAPIRO: I think there's something about live coverage that allows you to get caught up in the moment in a way that is journalistically appropriate, whether you're talking about an inauguration or a new pope or the emotion of a tragedy, if you're covering a war or a natural disaster.DETROW: Yeah.SHAPIRO: Being an unbiased, nonpartisan - use whatever word you want to use - journalist doesn't mean you can't feel the electricity in the room.DETROW: Right.SHAPIRO: And you could really hear that in your voice.DETROW: Yeah. Thank you. And I think that's something that - you and I both feel that way, and I don't know necessarily if people in our positions 20 or 30 years ago felt that way. But I think, like, it's OK to sound human, right? And I think about the fact that last summer, I was in the host chair when the Trump assassination attempt took place. And...SHAPIRO: Right...DETROW: ...The first conversation we had on the line was our colleague Danielle Kurtzleben, who had been in the middle...SHAPIRO: At the rally.DETROW: ...At the rally, ducking under a table, terrified. And the first thing I'm doing is talking to Danielle, and I just like - are you OK?(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: ...Wondering about, like, what might happen next.DETROW: You're in a safe position right now, just to ask that?KURTZLEBEN: Yes, they - people are streaming by. Most in the crowd have already left. The leaving started pretty immediately.DETROW: Then we were doing interviews with people who had been in the crowd with their children. I think just, like, letting your humanity show through and being empathetic is important.SHAPIRO: Do you remember the first time you ever did live special coverage?DETROW: Yes, and it was totally terrifying. It's something of a...SHAPIRO: I often find it totally terrifying.DETROW: I've always been attracted to it. Of all the things that broadcast news (ph), Special Coverage has been the most exciting to me. I actually remember listening to you do it for Arab Spring at one point. You were, like, filling in...SHAPIRO: Oh, wow.DETROW: ...On Talk Of The Nation, and I had a long car drive.SHAPIRO: Talk Of The Nation - that's a throwback. Yeah.DETROW: And you were doing it...SHAPIRO: Years ago.DETROW: ...For hours. And it just - you know, it was always cool as a listener for me to think about those moments. And the first time I got a chance to, I was actually pretty new at NPR. We were going to simulcast a PBS presidential debate, and all I had to do was talk for a minute because it was - you know, it started at, like,10:01.SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: Right? And the mic opened...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...At 10 o'clock. And I still remember the feeling of just, like, my throat going down to my toes and...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...Back up.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: From NPR News, this is special coverage of the PBS NewsHour Democratic primary debate. I'm Scott Detrow. In a moment, we expect former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Senator Bernie...And I don't think I sound as bad as I think I sounded, but just, like, you're listening to live Special Coverage  - just because, like, the - there - usually, there's no script at all, you know?SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: And over time, I've gotten more comfortable with that, and I kind of enjoy the adrenaline rush of that.SHAPIRO: You said it's your favorite thing. Why?DETROW: You know, I've always wanted to be a reporter. I think I've always wanted to be a broadcast journalist. I actually come from a family of broadcast journalists. My dad was a longtime radio news anchor. My uncle was a longtime DJ in San Diego. So, like, just, like, talking into microphones is a big part of my family.And I think, like, growing up as I first started to get interested in it, like, those big moments where the TV anchors are bringing you through an election or a big breaking story was always exciting to me.

Most in the crowd have already left. The leaving started pretty immediately.DETROW: Then we were doing interviews with people who had been in the crowd with their children. I think just, like, letting your humanity show through and being empathetic is important.SHAPIRO: Do you remember the first time you ever did live special coverage?DETROW: Yes, and it was totally terrifying. It's something of a...SHAPIRO: I often find it totally terrifying.DETROW: I've always been attracted to it. Of all the things that broadcast news (ph), Special Coverage has been the most exciting to me. I actually remember listening to you do it for Arab Spring at one point. You were, like, filling in...SHAPIRO: Oh, wow.DETROW: ...On Talk Of The Nation, and I had a long car drive.SHAPIRO: Talk Of The Nation - that's a throwback. Yeah.DETROW: And you were doing it...SHAPIRO: Years ago.DETROW: ...For hours. And it just - you know, it was always cool as a listener for me to think about those moments. And the first time I got a chance to, I was actually pretty new at NPR. We were going to simulcast a PBS presidential debate, and all I had to do was talk for a minute because it was - you know, it started at, like,10:01.SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: Right? And the mic opened...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...At 10 o'clock. And I still remember the feeling of just, like, my throat going down to my toes and...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...Back up.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: From NPR News, this is special coverage of the PBS NewsHour Democratic primary debate. I'm Scott Detrow. In a moment, we expect former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Senator Bernie...And I don't think I sound as bad as I think I sounded, but just, like, you're listening to live Special Coverage  - just because, like, the - there - usually, there's no script at all, you know?SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: And over time, I've gotten more comfortable with that, and I kind of enjoy the adrenaline rush of that.SHAPIRO: You said it's your favorite thing. Why?DETROW: You know, I've always wanted to be a reporter. I think I've always wanted to be a broadcast journalist. I actually come from a family of broadcast journalists. My dad was a longtime radio news anchor. My uncle was a longtime DJ in San Diego. So, like, just, like, talking into microphones is a big part of my family.And I think, like, growing up as I first started to get interested in it, like, those big moments where the TV anchors are bringing you through an election or a big breaking story was always exciting to me. As I got older, I would - I'll admit to being a nerd and, like, pulling up YouTube clips of kind of, like, live special coverage through the years of...SHAPIRO: Wow.DETROW: ...Big breaking stories and just kind of, like, watching it to see - especially as I started doing it - to see, like, how the anchors or hosts handle one moment or the other, like, the idea that you don't have a safety net, and you don't have a script in front of you, and it's kind of up to you to think on your feet and kind of bring the audience along with you.I like putting myself in the audience's shoes and asking - sometimes just stopping a reporter and asking a really, really basic question because I'm thinking of, like, what does the person totally fresh to the story need to know? And I think just, like, not being afraid to ask a really basic question. I think sometimes we want to, like, try and impress the people who are listening or who we're interviewing. And I think, like, usually with Special Coverage, the most basic question is, what's happening? Why is that happening? Who is this person? Rinse and repeat.SHAPIRO: What are you seeing? Yeah.DETROW: Yeah, what are you seeing? Tell us what's in front of your eyes, especially for something like that. Like, what are you seeing? And then we go to Ruth Sherlock in the crowd. Like, people are overjoyed and waving American flags and crying in the middle of St. Peter's Square, and it's an exciting moment, you know? Like, that's the story right there.SHAPIRO: My favorite moment from listening to your live Special Coverage in Rome was when you thanked your Latin teacher at the end.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: I want to thank my high school Latin teacher, Father Robert Cregan (ph), for this moment where we were translating Latin on the radio. Thank you so much for listening. Again, a lot more coverage of this enormous story - I'm Scott Detrow. We will talk to you...Father Cregan - he was my teacher of freshman year Latin. He is no longer with us, but it just jumped into my head. I was like, you know, never before and probably never again is translating Latin something I'm going to be using as part of my job, so I'm just going to take this moment to thank him.SHAPIRO: It was a great moment. Scott, thank you for letting us flip the tables and answering my questions for a change.DETROW: Well, I appreciate it. Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

I had thought so much about what this would be like, to wait and just stare at this chimney on the Sistine Chapel, which is one of the most famous, beautiful places in the world. And for the first 3 or 4 hours or so of staring at the chimney, it was really exciting, and I was on the edge of my seat and just waiting. And then it was just kind of waiting, you know?SHAPIRO: Yeah. There was a seagull.DETROW: There was a seagull, a lot of seagulls, a lot of waiting. And we kind of figured out the rhythms of when smoke would appear, black smoke, and when it was safe to wander away.SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: And there was a point on that Thursday where I thought, OK, if this ballot had happened, it would have happened by now and we would have seen the black smoke. I'll be back in a few minutes.SHAPIRO: Oh, so you left.DETROW: So I left. I left our broadcast area, which - it's important for later - was a fenced-in area. There was, like, a maybe 4-foot-high fence surrounding the area. And I walked about - if St. Peter's Square is a clock, our broadcast booth was at 6 o'clock. The basilica is at 12 o'clock. So I walked over to about 3 o'clock, where my favorite thing in all of the square was. It was this marble water fountain of papal tiaras. It was three papal tiaras with a little spout coming out of it. And I just loved the papal tiara water fountain. I'm like, I'm going to go refill my water bottle in the papal tiara water fountain.SHAPIRO: So it was at an actual drinking fountain.DETROW: Yes.SHAPIRO: Was it holy water?DETROW: I'd like to think so.SHAPIRO: (Laughter).DETROW: So I went there with Tyler Bartlam, my producer, and I walk over to get water, and we're just chitchatting. And we just hear this scream, and a scream turns into a roar that spreads out throughout the entire square. And you see..SHAPIRO: 'Cause there are thousands of people there.DETROW: Yeah, just waiting for this moment, and we see white smoke, and we both look at each other, and we yell, pope.SHAPIRO: (Laughter).DETROW: And we ran as fast as we could because the goal was to get on the air as soon as there was white smoke.SHAPIRO: Of course, live special rolling coverage. Yeah.DETROW: So I ran as fast as I could, and I...SHAPIRO: I'm imagining you shoving spectators aside, body slamming people.DETROW: I didn't have to throw an elbow, but I was ready. We're getting back as quickly as possible, and we come up, and there's a security checkpoint for the broadcasting area where you have to go - you have to show a code. They have to scan you. It takes a moment. And our editor, Courtney Dorning, just says, jump, just jump. And I truly don't actually have memory of this, but I apparently, without stopping, did a running jump, vaulted over, pushed my hand down, jumped over the fence, sat down, said OK, put on my headphones, and we were on the air, like, 30 seconds later.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: You're listening to live Special Coverage from NPR News. I'm Scott Detrow coming to you from the edge of St. Peter's Square. The bells are tolling at St. Peter's. White smoke has billowed out of the Sistine Chapel's chimney, and that means the Catholic Church has a new pope. This election comes on the second day of the papal conclave.SHAPIRO: So first, you have to fill time until you find out who the pope was.DETROW: Yes.SHAPIRO: And then you find out who it is. Already, this is going to be huge news, whoever the new pope is. And then you find out that he's an American from Chicago. I heard that moment in your voice on the air.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: Oh, my goodness. The pope is from Chicago. Robert Francis Prevost has been selected as the next pope of the Roman Catholic Church, a 69-year-old...To have the name be announced as American, this suddenly becomes this monumental historical moment for Americans. Never in the history of the church has the Pope been American. And as a Catholic growing up, I was taught it's just never going to happen...SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: ...Because they wouldn't elect an American because America has so much power in the world already. But yeah, it was an exciting moment, and listening back, you could hear that I was excited...SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: ...Because we're in this amazing space at this cool breaking news moment, and I don't know. I was excited to be there.SHAPIRO: I think there's something about live coverage that allows you to get caught up in the moment in a way that is journalistically appropriate, whether you're talking about an inauguration or a new pope or the emotion of a tragedy, if you're covering a war or a natural disaster.DETROW: Yeah.SHAPIRO: Being an unbiased, nonpartisan - use whatever word you want to use - journalist doesn't mean you can't feel the electricity in the room.DETROW: Right.SHAPIRO: And you could really hear that in your voice.DETROW: Yeah. Thank you. And I think that's something that - you and I both feel that way, and I don't know necessarily if people in our positions 20 or 30 years ago felt that way. But I think, like, it's OK to sound human, right? And I think about the fact that last summer, I was in the host chair when the Trump assassination attempt took place. And...SHAPIRO: Right...DETROW: ...The first conversation we had on the line was our colleague Danielle Kurtzleben, who had been in the middle...SHAPIRO: At the rally.DETROW: ...At the rally, ducking under a table, terrified.

But yeah, it was an exciting moment, and listening back, you could hear that I was excited...SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: ...Because we're in this amazing space at this cool breaking news moment, and I don't know. I was excited to be there.SHAPIRO: I think there's something about live coverage that allows you to get caught up in the moment in a way that is journalistically appropriate, whether you're talking about an inauguration or a new pope or the emotion of a tragedy, if you're covering a war or a natural disaster.DETROW: Yeah.SHAPIRO: Being an unbiased, nonpartisan - use whatever word you want to use - journalist doesn't mean you can't feel the electricity in the room.DETROW: Right.SHAPIRO: And you could really hear that in your voice.DETROW: Yeah. Thank you. And I think that's something that - you and I both feel that way, and I don't know necessarily if people in our positions 20 or 30 years ago felt that way. But I think, like, it's OK to sound human, right? And I think about the fact that last summer, I was in the host chair when the Trump assassination attempt took place. And...SHAPIRO: Right...DETROW: ...The first conversation we had on the line was our colleague Danielle Kurtzleben, who had been in the middle...SHAPIRO: At the rally.DETROW: ...At the rally, ducking under a table, terrified. And the first thing I'm doing is talking to Danielle, and I just like - are you OK?(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: ...Wondering about, like, what might happen next.DETROW: You're in a safe position right now, just to ask that?KURTZLEBEN: Yes, they - people are streaming by. Most in the crowd have already left. The leaving started pretty immediately.DETROW: Then we were doing interviews with people who had been in the crowd with their children. I think just, like, letting your humanity show through and being empathetic is important.SHAPIRO: Do you remember the first time you ever did live special coverage?DETROW: Yes, and it was totally terrifying. It's something of a...SHAPIRO: I often find it totally terrifying.DETROW: I've always been attracted to it. Of all the things that broadcast news (ph), Special Coverage has been the most exciting to me. I actually remember listening to you do it for Arab Spring at one point. You were, like, filling in...SHAPIRO: Oh, wow.DETROW: ...On Talk Of The Nation, and I had a long car drive.SHAPIRO: Talk Of The Nation - that's a throwback. Yeah.DETROW: And you were doing it...SHAPIRO: Years ago.DETROW: ...For hours. And it just - you know, it was always cool as a listener for me to think about those moments. And the first time I got a chance to, I was actually pretty new at NPR. We were going to simulcast a PBS presidential debate, and all I had to do was talk for a minute because it was - you know, it started at, like,10:01.SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: Right? And the mic opened...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...At 10 o'clock. And I still remember the feeling of just, like, my throat going down to my toes and...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...Back up.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: From NPR News, this is special coverage of the PBS NewsHour Democratic primary debate. I'm Scott Detrow. In a moment, we expect former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Senator Bernie...And I don't think I sound as bad as I think I sounded, but just, like, you're listening to live Special Coverage  - just because, like, the - there - usually, there's no script at all, you know?SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: And over time, I've gotten more comfortable with that, and I kind of enjoy the adrenaline rush of that.SHAPIRO: You said it's your favorite thing. Why?DETROW: You know, I've always wanted to be a reporter. I think I've always wanted to be a broadcast journalist. I actually come from a family of broadcast journalists. My dad was a longtime radio news anchor. My uncle was a longtime DJ in San Diego. So, like, just, like, talking into microphones is a big part of my family.And I think, like, growing up as I first started to get interested in it, like, those big moments where the TV anchors are bringing you through an election or a big breaking story was always exciting to me. As I got older, I would - I'll admit to being a nerd and, like, pulling up YouTube clips of kind of, like, live special coverage through the years of...SHAPIRO: Wow.DETROW: ...Big breaking stories and just kind of, like, watching it to see - especially as I started doing it - to see, like, how the anchors or hosts handle one moment or the other, like, the idea that you don't have a safety net, and you don't have a script in front of you, and it's kind of up to you to think on your feet and kind of bring the audience along with you.I like putting myself in the audience's shoes and asking - sometimes just stopping a reporter and asking a really, really basic question because I'm thinking of, like, what does the person totally fresh to the story need to know? And I think just, like, not being afraid to ask a really basic question. I think sometimes we want to, like, try and impress the people who are listening or who we're interviewing. And I think, like, usually with Special Coverage, the most basic question is, what's happening? Why is that happening? Who is this person? Rinse and repeat.SHAPIRO: What are you seeing? Yeah.DETROW: Yeah, what are you seeing? Tell us what's in front of your eyes, especially for something like that. Like, what are you seeing? And then we go to Ruth Sherlock in the crowd. Like, people are overjoyed and waving American flags and crying in the middle of St. Peter's Square, and it's an exciting moment, you know? Like, that's the story right there.SHAPIRO: My favorite moment from listening to your live Special Coverage in Rome was when you thanked your Latin teacher at the end.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: I want to thank my high school Latin teacher, Father Robert Cregan (ph), for this moment where we were translating Latin on the radio. Thank you so much for listening. Again, a lot more coverage of this enormous story - I'm Scott Detrow. We will talk to you...Father Cregan - he was my teacher of freshman year Latin. He is no longer with us, but it just jumped into my head. I was like, you know, never before and probably never again is translating Latin something I'm going to be using as part of my job, so I'm just going to take this moment to thank him.SHAPIRO: It was a great moment. Scott, thank you for letting us flip the tables and answering my questions for a change.DETROW: Well, I appreciate it. Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

And we kind of figured out the rhythms of when smoke would appear, black smoke, and when it was safe to wander away.SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: And there was a point on that Thursday where I thought, OK, if this ballot had happened, it would have happened by now and we would have seen the black smoke. I'll be back in a few minutes.SHAPIRO: Oh, so you left.DETROW: So I left. I left our broadcast area, which - it's important for later - was a fenced-in area. There was, like, a maybe 4-foot-high fence surrounding the area. And I walked about - if St. Peter's Square is a clock, our broadcast booth was at 6 o'clock. The basilica is at 12 o'clock. So I walked over to about 3 o'clock, where my favorite thing in all of the square was. It was this marble water fountain of papal tiaras. It was three papal tiaras with a little spout coming out of it. And I just loved the papal tiara water fountain. I'm like, I'm going to go refill my water bottle in the papal tiara water fountain.SHAPIRO: So it was at an actual drinking fountain.DETROW: Yes.SHAPIRO: Was it holy water?DETROW: I'd like to think so.SHAPIRO: (Laughter).DETROW: So I went there with Tyler Bartlam, my producer, and I walk over to get water, and we're just chitchatting. And we just hear this scream, and a scream turns into a roar that spreads out throughout the entire square. And you see..SHAPIRO: 'Cause there are thousands of people there.DETROW: Yeah, just waiting for this moment, and we see white smoke, and we both look at each other, and we yell, pope.SHAPIRO: (Laughter).DETROW: And we ran as fast as we could because the goal was to get on the air as soon as there was white smoke.SHAPIRO: Of course, live special rolling coverage. Yeah.DETROW: So I ran as fast as I could, and I...SHAPIRO: I'm imagining you shoving spectators aside, body slamming people.DETROW: I didn't have to throw an elbow, but I was ready. We're getting back as quickly as possible, and we come up, and there's a security checkpoint for the broadcasting area where you have to go - you have to show a code. They have to scan you. It takes a moment. And our editor, Courtney Dorning, just says, jump, just jump. And I truly don't actually have memory of this, but I apparently, without stopping, did a running jump, vaulted over, pushed my hand down, jumped over the fence, sat down, said OK, put on my headphones, and we were on the air, like, 30 seconds later.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: You're listening to live Special Coverage from NPR News. I'm Scott Detrow coming to you from the edge of St. Peter's Square. The bells are tolling at St. Peter's. White smoke has billowed out of the Sistine Chapel's chimney, and that means the Catholic Church has a new pope. This election comes on the second day of the papal conclave.SHAPIRO: So first, you have to fill time until you find out who the pope was.DETROW: Yes.SHAPIRO: And then you find out who it is. Already, this is going to be huge news, whoever the new pope is. And then you find out that he's an American from Chicago. I heard that moment in your voice on the air.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: Oh, my goodness. The pope is from Chicago. Robert Francis Prevost has been selected as the next pope of the Roman Catholic Church, a 69-year-old...To have the name be announced as American, this suddenly becomes this monumental historical moment for Americans. Never in the history of the church has the Pope been American. And as a Catholic growing up, I was taught it's just never going to happen...SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: ...Because they wouldn't elect an American because America has so much power in the world already.

Already, this is going to be huge news, whoever the new pope is. And then you find out that he's an American from Chicago. I heard that moment in your voice on the air.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: Oh, my goodness. The pope is from Chicago. Robert Francis Prevost has been selected as the next pope of the Roman Catholic Church, a 69-year-old...To have the name be announced as American, this suddenly becomes this monumental historical moment for Americans. Never in the history of the church has the Pope been American. And as a Catholic growing up, I was taught it's just never going to happen...SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: ...Because they wouldn't elect an American because America has so much power in the world already. But yeah, it was an exciting moment, and listening back, you could hear that I was excited...SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: ...Because we're in this amazing space at this cool breaking news moment, and I don't know. I was excited to be there.SHAPIRO: I think there's something about live coverage that allows you to get caught up in the moment in a way that is journalistically appropriate, whether you're talking about an inauguration or a new pope or the emotion of a tragedy, if you're covering a war or a natural disaster.DETROW: Yeah.SHAPIRO: Being an unbiased, nonpartisan - use whatever word you want to use - journalist doesn't mean you can't feel the electricity in the room.DETROW: Right.SHAPIRO: And you could really hear that in your voice.DETROW: Yeah. Thank you. And I think that's something that - you and I both feel that way, and I don't know necessarily if people in our positions 20 or 30 years ago felt that way. But I think, like, it's OK to sound human, right? And I think about the fact that last summer, I was in the host chair when the Trump assassination attempt took place. And...SHAPIRO: Right...DETROW: ...The first conversation we had on the line was our colleague Danielle Kurtzleben, who had been in the middle...SHAPIRO: At the rally.DETROW: ...At the rally, ducking under a table, terrified. And the first thing I'm doing is talking to Danielle, and I just like - are you OK?(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: ...Wondering about, like, what might happen next.DETROW: You're in a safe position right now, just to ask that?KURTZLEBEN: Yes, they - people are streaming by. Most in the crowd have already left. The leaving started pretty immediately.DETROW: Then we were doing interviews with people who had been in the crowd with their children. I think just, like, letting your humanity show through and being empathetic is important.SHAPIRO: Do you remember the first time you ever did live special coverage?DETROW: Yes, and it was totally terrifying. It's something of a...SHAPIRO: I often find it totally terrifying.DETROW: I've always been attracted to it. Of all the things that broadcast news (ph), Special Coverage has been the most exciting to me. I actually remember listening to you do it for Arab Spring at one point. You were, like, filling in...SHAPIRO: Oh, wow.DETROW: ...On Talk Of The Nation, and I had a long car drive.SHAPIRO: Talk Of The Nation - that's a throwback. Yeah.DETROW: And you were doing it...SHAPIRO: Years ago.DETROW: ...For hours. And it just - you know, it was always cool as a listener for me to think about those moments. And the first time I got a chance to, I was actually pretty new at NPR. We were going to simulcast a PBS presidential debate, and all I had to do was talk for a minute because it was - you know, it started at, like,10:01.SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: Right? And the mic opened...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...At 10 o'clock. And I still remember the feeling of just, like, my throat going down to my toes and...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...Back up.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: From NPR News, this is special coverage of the PBS NewsHour Democratic primary debate. I'm Scott Detrow. In a moment, we expect former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Senator Bernie...And I don't think I sound as bad as I think I sounded, but just, like, you're listening to live Special Coverage  - just because, like, the - there - usually, there's no script at all, you know?SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: And over time, I've gotten more comfortable with that, and I kind of enjoy the adrenaline rush of that.SHAPIRO: You said it's your favorite thing. Why?DETROW: You know, I've always wanted to be a reporter. I think I've always wanted to be a broadcast journalist. I actually come from a family of broadcast journalists. My dad was a longtime radio news anchor. My uncle was a longtime DJ in San Diego. So, like, just, like, talking into microphones is a big part of my family.And I think, like, growing up as I first started to get interested in it, like, those big moments where the TV anchors are bringing you through an election or a big breaking story was always exciting to me. As I got older, I would - I'll admit to being a nerd and, like, pulling up YouTube clips of kind of, like, live special coverage through the years of...SHAPIRO: Wow.DETROW: ...Big breaking stories and just kind of, like, watching it to see - especially as I started doing it - to see, like, how the anchors or hosts handle one moment or the other, like, the idea that you don't have a safety net, and you don't have a script in front of you, and it's kind of up to you to think on your feet and kind of bring the audience along with you.I like putting myself in the audience's shoes and asking - sometimes just stopping a reporter and asking a really, really basic question because I'm thinking of, like, what does the person totally fresh to the story need to know? And I think just, like, not being afraid to ask a really basic question. I think sometimes we want to, like, try and impress the people who are listening or who we're interviewing. And I think, like, usually with Special Coverage, the most basic question is, what's happening? Why is that happening? Who is this person? Rinse and repeat.SHAPIRO: What are you seeing? Yeah.DETROW: Yeah, what are you seeing? Tell us what's in front of your eyes, especially for something like that. Like, what are you seeing? And then we go to Ruth Sherlock in the crowd. Like, people are overjoyed and waving American flags and crying in the middle of St. Peter's Square, and it's an exciting moment, you know? Like, that's the story right there.SHAPIRO: My favorite moment from listening to your live Special Coverage in Rome was when you thanked your Latin teacher at the end.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: I want to thank my high school Latin teacher, Father Robert Cregan (ph), for this moment where we were translating Latin on the radio. Thank you so much for listening. Again, a lot more coverage of this enormous story - I'm Scott Detrow. We will talk to you...Father Cregan - he was my teacher of freshman year Latin. He is no longer with us, but it just jumped into my head. I was like, you know, never before and probably never again is translating Latin something I'm going to be using as part of my job, so I'm just going to take this moment to thank him.SHAPIRO: It was a great moment. Scott, thank you for letting us flip the tables and answering my questions for a change.DETROW: Well, I appreciate it. Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: And there was a point on that Thursday where I thought, OK, if this ballot had happened, it would have happened by now and we would have seen the black smoke. I'll be back in a few minutes.SHAPIRO: Oh, so you left.DETROW: So I left. I left our broadcast area, which - it's important for later - was a fenced-in area. There was, like, a maybe 4-foot-high fence surrounding the area. And I walked about - if St. Peter's Square is a clock, our broadcast booth was at 6 o'clock. The basilica is at 12 o'clock. So I walked over to about 3 o'clock, where my favorite thing in all of the square was. It was this marble water fountain of papal tiaras. It was three papal tiaras with a little spout coming out of it. And I just loved the papal tiara water fountain. I'm like, I'm going to go refill my water bottle in the papal tiara water fountain.SHAPIRO: So it was at an actual drinking fountain.DETROW: Yes.SHAPIRO: Was it holy water?DETROW: I'd like to think so.SHAPIRO: (Laughter).DETROW: So I went there with Tyler Bartlam, my producer, and I walk over to get water, and we're just chitchatting. And we just hear this scream, and a scream turns into a roar that spreads out throughout the entire square. And you see..SHAPIRO: 'Cause there are thousands of people there.DETROW: Yeah, just waiting for this moment, and we see white smoke, and we both look at each other, and we yell, pope.SHAPIRO: (Laughter).DETROW: And we ran as fast as we could because the goal was to get on the air as soon as there was white smoke.SHAPIRO: Of course, live special rolling coverage. Yeah.DETROW: So I ran as fast as I could, and I...SHAPIRO: I'm imagining you shoving spectators aside, body slamming people.DETROW: I didn't have to throw an elbow, but I was ready. We're getting back as quickly as possible, and we come up, and there's a security checkpoint for the broadcasting area where you have to go - you have to show a code. They have to scan you. It takes a moment. And our editor, Courtney Dorning, just says, jump, just jump. And I truly don't actually have memory of this, but I apparently, without stopping, did a running jump, vaulted over, pushed my hand down, jumped over the fence, sat down, said OK, put on my headphones, and we were on the air, like, 30 seconds later.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: You're listening to live Special Coverage from NPR News.

White smoke has billowed out of the Sistine Chapel's chimney, and that means the Catholic Church has a new pope. This election comes on the second day of the papal conclave.SHAPIRO: So first, you have to fill time until you find out who the pope was.DETROW: Yes.SHAPIRO: And then you find out who it is. Already, this is going to be huge news, whoever the new pope is. And then you find out that he's an American from Chicago. I heard that moment in your voice on the air.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: Oh, my goodness. The pope is from Chicago. Robert Francis Prevost has been selected as the next pope of the Roman Catholic Church, a 69-year-old...To have the name be announced as American, this suddenly becomes this monumental historical moment for Americans. Never in the history of the church has the Pope been American. And as a Catholic growing up, I was taught it's just never going to happen...SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: ...Because they wouldn't elect an American because America has so much power in the world already. But yeah, it was an exciting moment, and listening back, you could hear that I was excited...SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: ...Because we're in this amazing space at this cool breaking news moment, and I don't know. I was excited to be there.SHAPIRO: I think there's something about live coverage that allows you to get caught up in the moment in a way that is journalistically appropriate, whether you're talking about an inauguration or a new pope or the emotion of a tragedy, if you're covering a war or a natural disaster.DETROW: Yeah.SHAPIRO: Being an unbiased, nonpartisan - use whatever word you want to use - journalist doesn't mean you can't feel the electricity in the room.DETROW: Right.SHAPIRO: And you could really hear that in your voice.DETROW: Yeah. Thank you. And I think that's something that - you and I both feel that way, and I don't know necessarily if people in our positions 20 or 30 years ago felt that way. But I think, like, it's OK to sound human, right? And I think about the fact that last summer, I was in the host chair when the Trump assassination attempt took place. And...SHAPIRO: Right...DETROW: ...The first conversation we had on the line was our colleague Danielle Kurtzleben, who had been in the middle...SHAPIRO: At the rally.DETROW: ...At the rally, ducking under a table, terrified. And the first thing I'm doing is talking to Danielle, and I just like - are you OK?(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: ...Wondering about, like, what might happen next.DETROW: You're in a safe position right now, just to ask that?KURTZLEBEN: Yes, they - people are streaming by. Most in the crowd have already left. The leaving started pretty immediately.DETROW: Then we were doing interviews with people who had been in the crowd with their children. I think just, like, letting your humanity show through and being empathetic is important.SHAPIRO: Do you remember the first time you ever did live special coverage?DETROW: Yes, and it was totally terrifying. It's something of a...SHAPIRO: I often find it totally terrifying.DETROW: I've always been attracted to it. Of all the things that broadcast news (ph), Special Coverage has been the most exciting to me. I actually remember listening to you do it for Arab Spring at one point. You were, like, filling in...SHAPIRO: Oh, wow.DETROW: ...On Talk Of The Nation, and I had a long car drive.SHAPIRO: Talk Of The Nation - that's a throwback. Yeah.DETROW: And you were doing it...SHAPIRO: Years ago.DETROW: ...For hours. And it just - you know, it was always cool as a listener for me to think about those moments. And the first time I got a chance to, I was actually pretty new at NPR. We were going to simulcast a PBS presidential debate, and all I had to do was talk for a minute because it was - you know, it started at, like,10:01.SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: Right? And the mic opened...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...At 10 o'clock. And I still remember the feeling of just, like, my throat going down to my toes and...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...Back up.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: From NPR News, this is special coverage of the PBS NewsHour Democratic primary debate. I'm Scott Detrow. In a moment, we expect former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Senator Bernie...And I don't think I sound as bad as I think I sounded, but just, like, you're listening to live Special Coverage  - just because, like, the - there - usually, there's no script at all, you know?SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: And over time, I've gotten more comfortable with that, and I kind of enjoy the adrenaline rush of that.SHAPIRO: You said it's your favorite thing. Why?DETROW: You know, I've always wanted to be a reporter. I think I've always wanted to be a broadcast journalist. I actually come from a family of broadcast journalists. My dad was a longtime radio news anchor. My uncle was a longtime DJ in San Diego. So, like, just, like, talking into microphones is a big part of my family.And I think, like, growing up as I first started to get interested in it, like, those big moments where the TV anchors are bringing you through an election or a big breaking story was always exciting to me. As I got older, I would - I'll admit to being a nerd and, like, pulling up YouTube clips of kind of, like, live special coverage through the years of...SHAPIRO: Wow.DETROW: ...Big breaking stories and just kind of, like, watching it to see - especially as I started doing it - to see, like, how the anchors or hosts handle one moment or the other, like, the idea that you don't have a safety net, and you don't have a script in front of you, and it's kind of up to you to think on your feet and kind of bring the audience along with you.I like putting myself in the audience's shoes and asking - sometimes just stopping a reporter and asking a really, really basic question because I'm thinking of, like, what does the person totally fresh to the story need to know? And I think just, like, not being afraid to ask a really basic question. I think sometimes we want to, like, try and impress the people who are listening or who we're interviewing. And I think, like, usually with Special Coverage, the most basic question is, what's happening? Why is that happening? Who is this person? Rinse and repeat.SHAPIRO: What are you seeing? Yeah.DETROW: Yeah, what are you seeing? Tell us what's in front of your eyes, especially for something like that. Like, what are you seeing? And then we go to Ruth Sherlock in the crowd. Like, people are overjoyed and waving American flags and crying in the middle of St. Peter's Square, and it's an exciting moment, you know? Like, that's the story right there.SHAPIRO: My favorite moment from listening to your live Special Coverage in Rome was when you thanked your Latin teacher at the end.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: I want to thank my high school Latin teacher, Father Robert Cregan (ph), for this moment where we were translating Latin on the radio. Thank you so much for listening. Again, a lot more coverage of this enormous story - I'm Scott Detrow. We will talk to you...Father Cregan - he was my teacher of freshman year Latin. He is no longer with us, but it just jumped into my head. I was like, you know, never before and probably never again is translating Latin something I'm going to be using as part of my job, so I'm just going to take this moment to thank him.SHAPIRO: It was a great moment. Scott, thank you for letting us flip the tables and answering my questions for a change.DETROW: Well, I appreciate it. Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The authoritative record of NPR’s programming is the audio record. SHAPIRO: Oh, so you left.DETROW: So I left. I left our broadcast area, which - it's important for later - was a fenced-in area. There was, like, a maybe 4-foot-high fence surrounding the area. And I walked about - if St. Peter's Square is a clock, our broadcast booth was at 6 o'clock. The basilica is at 12 o'clock. So I walked over to about 3 o'clock, where my favorite thing in all of the square was. It was this marble water fountain of papal tiaras. It was three papal tiaras with a little spout coming out of it. And I just loved the papal tiara water fountain. I'm like, I'm going to go refill my water bottle in the papal tiara water fountain.SHAPIRO: So it was at an actual drinking fountain.DETROW: Yes.SHAPIRO: Was it holy water?DETROW: I'd like to think so.SHAPIRO: (Laughter).DETROW: So I went there with Tyler Bartlam, my producer, and I walk over to get water, and we're just chitchatting. And we just hear this scream, and a scream turns into a roar that spreads out throughout the entire square. And you see..SHAPIRO: 'Cause there are thousands of people there.DETROW: Yeah, just waiting for this moment, and we see white smoke, and we both look at each other, and we yell, pope.SHAPIRO: (Laughter).DETROW: And we ran as fast as we could because the goal was to get on the air as soon as there was white smoke.SHAPIRO: Of course, live special rolling coverage. Yeah.DETROW: So I ran as fast as I could, and I...SHAPIRO: I'm imagining you shoving spectators aside, body slamming people.DETROW: I didn't have to throw an elbow, but I was ready. We're getting back as quickly as possible, and we come up, and there's a security checkpoint for the broadcasting area where you have to go - you have to show a code. They have to scan you. It takes a moment. And our editor, Courtney Dorning, just says, jump, just jump. And I truly don't actually have memory of this, but I apparently, without stopping, did a running jump, vaulted over, pushed my hand down, jumped over the fence, sat down, said OK, put on my headphones, and we were on the air, like, 30 seconds later.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: You're listening to live Special Coverage from NPR News.

This election comes on the second day of the papal conclave.SHAPIRO: So first, you have to fill time until you find out who the pope was.DETROW: Yes.SHAPIRO: And then you find out who it is. Already, this is going to be huge news, whoever the new pope is. And then you find out that he's an American from Chicago. I heard that moment in your voice on the air.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: Oh, my goodness. The pope is from Chicago. Robert Francis Prevost has been selected as the next pope of the Roman Catholic Church, a 69-year-old...To have the name be announced as American, this suddenly becomes this monumental historical moment for Americans. Never in the history of the church has the Pope been American. And as a Catholic growing up, I was taught it's just never going to happen...SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: ...Because they wouldn't elect an American because America has so much power in the world already. But yeah, it was an exciting moment, and listening back, you could hear that I was excited...SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: ...Because we're in this amazing space at this cool breaking news moment, and I don't know. I was excited to be there.SHAPIRO: I think there's something about live coverage that allows you to get caught up in the moment in a way that is journalistically appropriate, whether you're talking about an inauguration or a new pope or the emotion of a tragedy, if you're covering a war or a natural disaster.DETROW: Yeah.SHAPIRO: Being an unbiased, nonpartisan - use whatever word you want to use - journalist doesn't mean you can't feel the electricity in the room.DETROW: Right.SHAPIRO: And you could really hear that in your voice.DETROW: Yeah. Thank you. And I think that's something that - you and I both feel that way, and I don't know necessarily if people in our positions 20 or 30 years ago felt that way. But I think, like, it's OK to sound human, right? And I think about the fact that last summer, I was in the host chair when the Trump assassination attempt took place. And...SHAPIRO: Right...DETROW: ...The first conversation we had on the line was our colleague Danielle Kurtzleben, who had been in the middle...SHAPIRO: At the rally.DETROW: ...At the rally, ducking under a table, terrified. And the first thing I'm doing is talking to Danielle, and I just like - are you OK?(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: ...Wondering about, like, what might happen next.DETROW: You're in a safe position right now, just to ask that?KURTZLEBEN: Yes, they - people are streaming by. Most in the crowd have already left. The leaving started pretty immediately.DETROW: Then we were doing interviews with people who had been in the crowd with their children. I think just, like, letting your humanity show through and being empathetic is important.SHAPIRO: Do you remember the first time you ever did live special coverage?DETROW: Yes, and it was totally terrifying. It's something of a...SHAPIRO: I often find it totally terrifying.DETROW: I've always been attracted to it. Of all the things that broadcast news (ph), Special Coverage has been the most exciting to me. I actually remember listening to you do it for Arab Spring at one point. You were, like, filling in...SHAPIRO: Oh, wow.DETROW: ...On Talk Of The Nation, and I had a long car drive.SHAPIRO: Talk Of The Nation - that's a throwback. Yeah.DETROW: And you were doing it...SHAPIRO: Years ago.DETROW: ...For hours. And it just - you know, it was always cool as a listener for me to think about those moments. And the first time I got a chance to, I was actually pretty new at NPR. We were going to simulcast a PBS presidential debate, and all I had to do was talk for a minute because it was - you know, it started at, like,10:01.SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: Right? And the mic opened...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...At 10 o'clock. And I still remember the feeling of just, like, my throat going down to my toes and...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...Back up.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: From NPR News, this is special coverage of the PBS NewsHour Democratic primary debate. I'm Scott Detrow. In a moment, we expect former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Senator Bernie...And I don't think I sound as bad as I think I sounded, but just, like, you're listening to live Special Coverage  - just because, like, the - there - usually, there's no script at all, you know?SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: And over time, I've gotten more comfortable with that, and I kind of enjoy the adrenaline rush of that.SHAPIRO: You said it's your favorite thing. Why?DETROW: You know, I've always wanted to be a reporter. I think I've always wanted to be a broadcast journalist. I actually come from a family of broadcast journalists. My dad was a longtime radio news anchor. My uncle was a longtime DJ in San Diego. So, like, just, like, talking into microphones is a big part of my family.And I think, like, growing up as I first started to get interested in it, like, those big moments where the TV anchors are bringing you through an election or a big breaking story was always exciting to me. As I got older, I would - I'll admit to being a nerd and, like, pulling up YouTube clips of kind of, like, live special coverage through the years of...SHAPIRO: Wow.DETROW: ...Big breaking stories and just kind of, like, watching it to see - especially as I started doing it - to see, like, how the anchors or hosts handle one moment or the other, like, the idea that you don't have a safety net, and you don't have a script in front of you, and it's kind of up to you to think on your feet and kind of bring the audience along with you.I like putting myself in the audience's shoes and asking - sometimes just stopping a reporter and asking a really, really basic question because I'm thinking of, like, what does the person totally fresh to the story need to know? And I think just, like, not being afraid to ask a really basic question. I think sometimes we want to, like, try and impress the people who are listening or who we're interviewing. And I think, like, usually with Special Coverage, the most basic question is, what's happening? Why is that happening? Who is this person? Rinse and repeat.SHAPIRO: What are you seeing? Yeah.DETROW: Yeah, what are you seeing? Tell us what's in front of your eyes, especially for something like that. Like, what are you seeing? And then we go to Ruth Sherlock in the crowd. Like, people are overjoyed and waving American flags and crying in the middle of St. Peter's Square, and it's an exciting moment, you know? Like, that's the story right there.SHAPIRO: My favorite moment from listening to your live Special Coverage in Rome was when you thanked your Latin teacher at the end.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: I want to thank my high school Latin teacher, Father Robert Cregan (ph), for this moment where we were translating Latin on the radio. Thank you so much for listening. Again, a lot more coverage of this enormous story - I'm Scott Detrow. We will talk to you...Father Cregan - he was my teacher of freshman year Latin. He is no longer with us, but it just jumped into my head. I was like, you know, never before and probably never again is translating Latin something I'm going to be using as part of my job, so I'm just going to take this moment to thank him.SHAPIRO: It was a great moment. Scott, thank you for letting us flip the tables and answering my questions for a change.DETROW: Well, I appreciate it. Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

There was, like, a maybe 4-foot-high fence surrounding the area. And I walked about - if St. Peter's Square is a clock, our broadcast booth was at 6 o'clock. The basilica is at 12 o'clock. So I walked over to about 3 o'clock, where my favorite thing in all of the square was. It was this marble water fountain of papal tiaras. It was three papal tiaras with a little spout coming out of it. And I just loved the papal tiara water fountain. I'm like, I'm going to go refill my water bottle in the papal tiara water fountain.SHAPIRO: So it was at an actual drinking fountain.DETROW: Yes.SHAPIRO: Was it holy water?DETROW: I'd like to think so.SHAPIRO: (Laughter).DETROW: So I went there with Tyler Bartlam, my producer, and I walk over to get water, and we're just chitchatting. And we just hear this scream, and a scream turns into a roar that spreads out throughout the entire square. And you see..SHAPIRO: 'Cause there are thousands of people there.DETROW: Yeah, just waiting for this moment, and we see white smoke, and we both look at each other, and we yell, pope.SHAPIRO: (Laughter).DETROW: And we ran as fast as we could because the goal was to get on the air as soon as there was white smoke.SHAPIRO: Of course, live special rolling coverage. Yeah.DETROW: So I ran as fast as I could, and I...SHAPIRO: I'm imagining you shoving spectators aside, body slamming people.DETROW: I didn't have to throw an elbow, but I was ready. We're getting back as quickly as possible, and we come up, and there's a security checkpoint for the broadcasting area where you have to go - you have to show a code. They have to scan you. It takes a moment. And our editor, Courtney Dorning, just says, jump, just jump. And I truly don't actually have memory of this, but I apparently, without stopping, did a running jump, vaulted over, pushed my hand down, jumped over the fence, sat down, said OK, put on my headphones, and we were on the air, like, 30 seconds later.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: You're listening to live Special Coverage from NPR News.

But I think, like, it's OK to sound human, right? And I think about the fact that last summer, I was in the host chair when the Trump assassination attempt took place. And...SHAPIRO: Right...DETROW: ...The first conversation we had on the line was our colleague Danielle Kurtzleben, who had been in the middle...SHAPIRO: At the rally.DETROW: ...At the rally, ducking under a table, terrified. And the first thing I'm doing is talking to Danielle, and I just like - are you OK?(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: ...Wondering about, like, what might happen next.DETROW: You're in a safe position right now, just to ask that?KURTZLEBEN: Yes, they - people are streaming by. Most in the crowd have already left. The leaving started pretty immediately.DETROW: Then we were doing interviews with people who had been in the crowd with their children. I think just, like, letting your humanity show through and being empathetic is important.SHAPIRO: Do you remember the first time you ever did live special coverage?DETROW: Yes, and it was totally terrifying. It's something of a...SHAPIRO: I often find it totally terrifying.DETROW: I've always been attracted to it. Of all the things that broadcast news (ph), Special Coverage has been the most exciting to me. I actually remember listening to you do it for Arab Spring at one point. You were, like, filling in...SHAPIRO: Oh, wow.DETROW: ...On Talk Of The Nation, and I had a long car drive.SHAPIRO: Talk Of The Nation - that's a throwback. Yeah.DETROW: And you were doing it...SHAPIRO: Years ago.DETROW: ...For hours. And it just - you know, it was always cool as a listener for me to think about those moments. And the first time I got a chance to, I was actually pretty new at NPR. We were going to simulcast a PBS presidential debate, and all I had to do was talk for a minute because it was - you know, it started at, like,10:01.SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: Right? And the mic opened...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...At 10 o'clock. And I still remember the feeling of just, like, my throat going down to my toes and...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...Back up.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: From NPR News, this is special coverage of the PBS NewsHour Democratic primary debate. I'm Scott Detrow. In a moment, we expect former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Senator Bernie...And I don't think I sound as bad as I think I sounded, but just, like, you're listening to live Special Coverage  - just because, like, the - there - usually, there's no script at all, you know?SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: And over time, I've gotten more comfortable with that, and I kind of enjoy the adrenaline rush of that.SHAPIRO: You said it's your favorite thing. Why?DETROW: You know, I've always wanted to be a reporter. I think I've always wanted to be a broadcast journalist. I actually come from a family of broadcast journalists. My dad was a longtime radio news anchor. My uncle was a longtime DJ in San Diego. So, like, just, like, talking into microphones is a big part of my family.And I think, like, growing up as I first started to get interested in it, like, those big moments where the TV anchors are bringing you through an election or a big breaking story was always exciting to me. As I got older, I would - I'll admit to being a nerd and, like, pulling up YouTube clips of kind of, like, live special coverage through the years of...SHAPIRO: Wow.DETROW: ...Big breaking stories and just kind of, like, watching it to see - especially as I started doing it - to see, like, how the anchors or hosts handle one moment or the other, like, the idea that you don't have a safety net, and you don't have a script in front of you, and it's kind of up to you to think on your feet and kind of bring the audience along with you.I like putting myself in the audience's shoes and asking - sometimes just stopping a reporter and asking a really, really basic question because I'm thinking of, like, what does the person totally fresh to the story need to know? And I think just, like, not being afraid to ask a really basic question. I think sometimes we want to, like, try and impress the people who are listening or who we're interviewing. And I think, like, usually with Special Coverage, the most basic question is, what's happening? Why is that happening? Who is this person? Rinse and repeat.SHAPIRO: What are you seeing? Yeah.DETROW: Yeah, what are you seeing? Tell us what's in front of your eyes, especially for something like that. Like, what are you seeing? And then we go to Ruth Sherlock in the crowd. Like, people are overjoyed and waving American flags and crying in the middle of St. Peter's Square, and it's an exciting moment, you know? Like, that's the story right there.SHAPIRO: My favorite moment from listening to your live Special Coverage in Rome was when you thanked your Latin teacher at the end.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: I want to thank my high school Latin teacher, Father Robert Cregan (ph), for this moment where we were translating Latin on the radio. Thank you so much for listening. Again, a lot more coverage of this enormous story - I'm Scott Detrow. We will talk to you...Father Cregan - he was my teacher of freshman year Latin. He is no longer with us, but it just jumped into my head. I was like, you know, never before and probably never again is translating Latin something I'm going to be using as part of my job, so I'm just going to take this moment to thank him.SHAPIRO: It was a great moment. Scott, thank you for letting us flip the tables and answering my questions for a change.DETROW: Well, I appreciate it. Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

DETROW: Yes.SHAPIRO: Was it holy water?DETROW: I'd like to think so.SHAPIRO: (Laughter).DETROW: So I went there with Tyler Bartlam, my producer, and I walk over to get water, and we're just chitchatting. And we just hear this scream, and a scream turns into a roar that spreads out throughout the entire square. And you see..SHAPIRO: 'Cause there are thousands of people there.DETROW: Yeah, just waiting for this moment, and we see white smoke, and we both look at each other, and we yell, pope.SHAPIRO: (Laughter).DETROW: And we ran as fast as we could because the goal was to get on the air as soon as there was white smoke.SHAPIRO: Of course, live special rolling coverage. Yeah.DETROW: So I ran as fast as I could, and I...SHAPIRO: I'm imagining you shoving spectators aside, body slamming people.DETROW: I didn't have to throw an elbow, but I was ready. We're getting back as quickly as possible, and we come up, and there's a security checkpoint for the broadcasting area where you have to go - you have to show a code. They have to scan you. It takes a moment. And our editor, Courtney Dorning, just says, jump, just jump. And I truly don't actually have memory of this, but I apparently, without stopping, did a running jump, vaulted over, pushed my hand down, jumped over the fence, sat down, said OK, put on my headphones, and we were on the air, like, 30 seconds later.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: You're listening to live Special Coverage from NPR News. I'm Scott Detrow coming to you from the edge of St. Peter's Square. The bells are tolling at St. Peter's. White smoke has billowed out of the Sistine Chapel's chimney, and that means the Catholic Church has a new pope. This election comes on the second day of the papal conclave.SHAPIRO: So first, you have to fill time until you find out who the pope was.DETROW: Yes.SHAPIRO: And then you find out who it is. Already, this is going to be huge news, whoever the new pope is. And then you find out that he's an American from Chicago. I heard that moment in your voice on the air.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: Oh, my goodness. The pope is from Chicago. Robert Francis Prevost has been selected as the next pope of the Roman Catholic Church, a 69-year-old...To have the name be announced as American, this suddenly becomes this monumental historical moment for Americans. Never in the history of the church has the Pope been American. And as a Catholic growing up, I was taught it's just never going to happen...SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: ...Because they wouldn't elect an American because America has so much power in the world already. But yeah, it was an exciting moment, and listening back, you could hear that I was excited...SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: ...Because we're in this amazing space at this cool breaking news moment, and I don't know. I was excited to be there.SHAPIRO: I think there's something about live coverage that allows you to get caught up in the moment in a way that is journalistically appropriate, whether you're talking about an inauguration or a new pope or the emotion of a tragedy, if you're covering a war or a natural disaster.DETROW: Yeah.SHAPIRO: Being an unbiased, nonpartisan - use whatever word you want to use - journalist doesn't mean you can't feel the electricity in the room.DETROW: Right.SHAPIRO: And you could really hear that in your voice.DETROW: Yeah.

And I still remember the feeling of just, like, my throat going down to my toes and...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...Back up.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: From NPR News, this is special coverage of the PBS NewsHour Democratic primary debate. I'm Scott Detrow. In a moment, we expect former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Senator Bernie...And I don't think I sound as bad as I think I sounded, but just, like, you're listening to live Special Coverage  - just because, like, the - there - usually, there's no script at all, you know?SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: And over time, I've gotten more comfortable with that, and I kind of enjoy the adrenaline rush of that.SHAPIRO: You said it's your favorite thing. Why?DETROW: You know, I've always wanted to be a reporter. I think I've always wanted to be a broadcast journalist. I actually come from a family of broadcast journalists. My dad was a longtime radio news anchor. My uncle was a longtime DJ in San Diego. So, like, just, like, talking into microphones is a big part of my family.And I think, like, growing up as I first started to get interested in it, like, those big moments where the TV anchors are bringing you through an election or a big breaking story was always exciting to me. As I got older, I would - I'll admit to being a nerd and, like, pulling up YouTube clips of kind of, like, live special coverage through the years of...SHAPIRO: Wow.DETROW: ...Big breaking stories and just kind of, like, watching it to see - especially as I started doing it - to see, like, how the anchors or hosts handle one moment or the other, like, the idea that you don't have a safety net, and you don't have a script in front of you, and it's kind of up to you to think on your feet and kind of bring the audience along with you.I like putting myself in the audience's shoes and asking - sometimes just stopping a reporter and asking a really, really basic question because I'm thinking of, like, what does the person totally fresh to the story need to know? And I think just, like, not being afraid to ask a really basic question. I think sometimes we want to, like, try and impress the people who are listening or who we're interviewing. And I think, like, usually with Special Coverage, the most basic question is, what's happening? Why is that happening? Who is this person? Rinse and repeat.SHAPIRO: What are you seeing? Yeah.DETROW: Yeah, what are you seeing? Tell us what's in front of your eyes, especially for something like that. Like, what are you seeing? And then we go to Ruth Sherlock in the crowd. Like, people are overjoyed and waving American flags and crying in the middle of St. Peter's Square, and it's an exciting moment, you know? Like, that's the story right there.SHAPIRO: My favorite moment from listening to your live Special Coverage in Rome was when you thanked your Latin teacher at the end.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: I want to thank my high school Latin teacher, Father Robert Cregan (ph), for this moment where we were translating Latin on the radio. Thank you so much for listening. Again, a lot more coverage of this enormous story - I'm Scott Detrow. We will talk to you...Father Cregan - he was my teacher of freshman year Latin. He is no longer with us, but it just jumped into my head. I was like, you know, never before and probably never again is translating Latin something I'm going to be using as part of my job, so I'm just going to take this moment to thank him.SHAPIRO: It was a great moment. Scott, thank you for letting us flip the tables and answering my questions for a change.DETROW: Well, I appreciate it. Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

SHAPIRO: Was it holy water?DETROW: I'd like to think so.SHAPIRO: (Laughter).DETROW: So I went there with Tyler Bartlam, my producer, and I walk over to get water, and we're just chitchatting. And we just hear this scream, and a scream turns into a roar that spreads out throughout the entire square. And you see..SHAPIRO: 'Cause there are thousands of people there.DETROW: Yeah, just waiting for this moment, and we see white smoke, and we both look at each other, and we yell, pope.SHAPIRO: (Laughter).DETROW: And we ran as fast as we could because the goal was to get on the air as soon as there was white smoke.SHAPIRO: Of course, live special rolling coverage. Yeah.DETROW: So I ran as fast as I could, and I...SHAPIRO: I'm imagining you shoving spectators aside, body slamming people.DETROW: I didn't have to throw an elbow, but I was ready. We're getting back as quickly as possible, and we come up, and there's a security checkpoint for the broadcasting area where you have to go - you have to show a code. They have to scan you. It takes a moment. And our editor, Courtney Dorning, just says, jump, just jump. And I truly don't actually have memory of this, but I apparently, without stopping, did a running jump, vaulted over, pushed my hand down, jumped over the fence, sat down, said OK, put on my headphones, and we were on the air, like, 30 seconds later.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: You're listening to live Special Coverage from NPR News. I'm Scott Detrow coming to you from the edge of St. Peter's Square. The bells are tolling at St. Peter's. White smoke has billowed out of the Sistine Chapel's chimney, and that means the Catholic Church has a new pope. This election comes on the second day of the papal conclave.SHAPIRO: So first, you have to fill time until you find out who the pope was.DETROW: Yes.SHAPIRO: And then you find out who it is. Already, this is going to be huge news, whoever the new pope is. And then you find out that he's an American from Chicago. I heard that moment in your voice on the air.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: Oh, my goodness. The pope is from Chicago. Robert Francis Prevost has been selected as the next pope of the Roman Catholic Church, a 69-year-old...To have the name be announced as American, this suddenly becomes this monumental historical moment for Americans. Never in the history of the church has the Pope been American. And as a Catholic growing up, I was taught it's just never going to happen...SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: ...Because they wouldn't elect an American because America has so much power in the world already. But yeah, it was an exciting moment, and listening back, you could hear that I was excited...SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: ...Because we're in this amazing space at this cool breaking news moment, and I don't know. I was excited to be there.SHAPIRO: I think there's something about live coverage that allows you to get caught up in the moment in a way that is journalistically appropriate, whether you're talking about an inauguration or a new pope or the emotion of a tragedy, if you're covering a war or a natural disaster.DETROW: Yeah.SHAPIRO: Being an unbiased, nonpartisan - use whatever word you want to use - journalist doesn't mean you can't feel the electricity in the room.DETROW: Right.SHAPIRO: And you could really hear that in your voice.DETROW: Yeah. Thank you. And I think that's something that - you and I both feel that way, and I don't know necessarily if people in our positions 20 or 30 years ago felt that way. But I think, like, it's OK to sound human, right? And I think about the fact that last summer, I was in the host chair when the Trump assassination attempt took place. And...SHAPIRO: Right...DETROW: ...The first conversation we had on the line was our colleague Danielle Kurtzleben, who had been in the middle...SHAPIRO: At the rally.DETROW: ...At the rally, ducking under a table, terrified. And the first thing I'm doing is talking to Danielle, and I just like - are you OK?(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: ...Wondering about, like, what might happen next.DETROW: You're in a safe position right now, just to ask that?KURTZLEBEN: Yes, they - people are streaming by. Most in the crowd have already left. The leaving started pretty immediately.DETROW: Then we were doing interviews with people who had been in the crowd with their children. I think just, like, letting your humanity show through and being empathetic is important.SHAPIRO: Do you remember the first time you ever did live special coverage?DETROW: Yes, and it was totally terrifying. It's something of a...SHAPIRO: I often find it totally terrifying.DETROW: I've always been attracted to it. Of all the things that broadcast news (ph), Special Coverage has been the most exciting to me. I actually remember listening to you do it for Arab Spring at one point. You were, like, filling in...SHAPIRO: Oh, wow.DETROW: ...On Talk Of The Nation, and I had a long car drive.SHAPIRO: Talk Of The Nation - that's a throwback. Yeah.DETROW: And you were doing it...SHAPIRO: Years ago.DETROW: ...For hours. And it just - you know, it was always cool as a listener for me to think about those moments. And the first time I got a chance to, I was actually pretty new at NPR. We were going to simulcast a PBS presidential debate, and all I had to do was talk for a minute because it was - you know, it started at, like,10:01.SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: Right?

Like, that's the story right there.SHAPIRO: My favorite moment from listening to your live Special Coverage in Rome was when you thanked your Latin teacher at the end.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: I want to thank my high school Latin teacher, Father Robert Cregan (ph), for this moment where we were translating Latin on the radio. Thank you so much for listening. Again, a lot more coverage of this enormous story - I'm Scott Detrow. We will talk to you...Father Cregan - he was my teacher of freshman year Latin. He is no longer with us, but it just jumped into my head. I was like, you know, never before and probably never again is translating Latin something I'm going to be using as part of my job, so I'm just going to take this moment to thank him.SHAPIRO: It was a great moment. Scott, thank you for letting us flip the tables and answering my questions for a change.DETROW: Well, I appreciate it. Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The authoritative record of NPR’s programming is the audio record. SHAPIRO: (Laughter).DETROW: So I went there with Tyler Bartlam, my producer, and I walk over to get water, and we're just chitchatting. And we just hear this scream, and a scream turns into a roar that spreads out throughout the entire square. And you see..SHAPIRO: 'Cause there are thousands of people there.DETROW: Yeah, just waiting for this moment, and we see white smoke, and we both look at each other, and we yell, pope.SHAPIRO: (Laughter).DETROW: And we ran as fast as we could because the goal was to get on the air as soon as there was white smoke.SHAPIRO: Of course, live special rolling coverage. Yeah.DETROW: So I ran as fast as I could, and I...SHAPIRO: I'm imagining you shoving spectators aside, body slamming people.DETROW: I didn't have to throw an elbow, but I was ready. We're getting back as quickly as possible, and we come up, and there's a security checkpoint for the broadcasting area where you have to go - you have to show a code. They have to scan you. It takes a moment. And our editor, Courtney Dorning, just says, jump, just jump. And I truly don't actually have memory of this, but I apparently, without stopping, did a running jump, vaulted over, pushed my hand down, jumped over the fence, sat down, said OK, put on my headphones, and we were on the air, like, 30 seconds later.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: You're listening to live Special Coverage from NPR News. I'm Scott Detrow coming to you from the edge of St. Peter's Square. The bells are tolling at St. Peter's. White smoke has billowed out of the Sistine Chapel's chimney, and that means the Catholic Church has a new pope. This election comes on the second day of the papal conclave.SHAPIRO: So first, you have to fill time until you find out who the pope was.DETROW: Yes.SHAPIRO: And then you find out who it is. Already, this is going to be huge news, whoever the new pope is. And then you find out that he's an American from Chicago. I heard that moment in your voice on the air.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: Oh, my goodness. The pope is from Chicago. Robert Francis Prevost has been selected as the next pope of the Roman Catholic Church, a 69-year-old...To have the name be announced as American, this suddenly becomes this monumental historical moment for Americans. Never in the history of the church has the Pope been American. And as a Catholic growing up, I was taught it's just never going to happen...SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: ...Because they wouldn't elect an American because America has so much power in the world already. But yeah, it was an exciting moment, and listening back, you could hear that I was excited...SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: ...Because we're in this amazing space at this cool breaking news moment, and I don't know. I was excited to be there.SHAPIRO: I think there's something about live coverage that allows you to get caught up in the moment in a way that is journalistically appropriate, whether you're talking about an inauguration or a new pope or the emotion of a tragedy, if you're covering a war or a natural disaster.DETROW: Yeah.SHAPIRO: Being an unbiased, nonpartisan - use whatever word you want to use - journalist doesn't mean you can't feel the electricity in the room.DETROW: Right.SHAPIRO: And you could really hear that in your voice.DETROW: Yeah. Thank you. And I think that's something that - you and I both feel that way, and I don't know necessarily if people in our positions 20 or 30 years ago felt that way. But I think, like, it's OK to sound human, right? And I think about the fact that last summer, I was in the host chair when the Trump assassination attempt took place. And...SHAPIRO: Right...DETROW: ...The first conversation we had on the line was our colleague Danielle Kurtzleben, who had been in the middle...SHAPIRO: At the rally.DETROW: ...At the rally, ducking under a table, terrified. And the first thing I'm doing is talking to Danielle, and I just like - are you OK?(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: ...Wondering about, like, what might happen next.DETROW: You're in a safe position right now, just to ask that?KURTZLEBEN: Yes, they - people are streaming by. Most in the crowd have already left. The leaving started pretty immediately.DETROW: Then we were doing interviews with people who had been in the crowd with their children. I think just, like, letting your humanity show through and being empathetic is important.SHAPIRO: Do you remember the first time you ever did live special coverage?DETROW: Yes, and it was totally terrifying. It's something of a...SHAPIRO: I often find it totally terrifying.DETROW: I've always been attracted to it. Of all the things that broadcast news (ph), Special Coverage has been the most exciting to me. I actually remember listening to you do it for Arab Spring at one point. You were, like, filling in...SHAPIRO: Oh, wow.DETROW: ...On Talk Of The Nation, and I had a long car drive.SHAPIRO: Talk Of The Nation - that's a throwback. Yeah.DETROW: And you were doing it...SHAPIRO: Years ago.DETROW: ...For hours. And it just - you know, it was always cool as a listener for me to think about those moments. And the first time I got a chance to, I was actually pretty new at NPR. We were going to simulcast a PBS presidential debate, and all I had to do was talk for a minute because it was - you know, it started at, like,10:01.SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: Right? And the mic opened...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...At 10 o'clock. And I still remember the feeling of just, like, my throat going down to my toes and...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...Back up.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: From NPR News, this is special coverage of the PBS NewsHour Democratic primary debate. I'm Scott Detrow. In a moment, we expect former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Senator Bernie...And I don't think I sound as bad as I think I sounded, but just, like, you're listening to live Special Coverage  - just because, like, the - there - usually, there's no script at all, you know?SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: And over time, I've gotten more comfortable with that, and I kind of enjoy the adrenaline rush of that.SHAPIRO: You said it's your favorite thing. Why?DETROW: You know, I've always wanted to be a reporter. I think I've always wanted to be a broadcast journalist. I actually come from a family of broadcast journalists. My dad was a longtime radio news anchor. My uncle was a longtime DJ in San Diego. So, like, just, like, talking into microphones is a big part of my family.And I think, like, growing up as I first started to get interested in it, like, those big moments where the TV anchors are bringing you through an election or a big breaking story was always exciting to me. As I got older, I would - I'll admit to being a nerd and, like, pulling up YouTube clips of kind of, like, live special coverage through the years of...SHAPIRO: Wow.DETROW: ...Big breaking stories and just kind of, like, watching it to see - especially as I started doing it - to see, like, how the anchors or hosts handle one moment or the other, like, the idea that you don't have a safety net, and you don't have a script in front of you, and it's kind of up to you to think on your feet and kind of bring the audience along with you.I like putting myself in the audience's shoes and asking - sometimes just stopping a reporter and asking a really, really basic question because I'm thinking of, like, what does the person totally fresh to the story need to know? And I think just, like, not being afraid to ask a really basic question. I think sometimes we want to, like, try and impress the people who are listening or who we're interviewing. And I think, like, usually with Special Coverage, the most basic question is, what's happening? Why is that happening? Who is this person? Rinse and repeat.SHAPIRO: What are you seeing? Yeah.DETROW: Yeah, what are you seeing? Tell us what's in front of your eyes, especially for something like that. Like, what are you seeing? And then we go to Ruth Sherlock in the crowd. Like, people are overjoyed and waving American flags and crying in the middle of St. Peter's Square, and it's an exciting moment, you know?

This election comes on the second day of the papal conclave.SHAPIRO: So first, you have to fill time until you find out who the pope was.DETROW: Yes.SHAPIRO: And then you find out who it is. Already, this is going to be huge news, whoever the new pope is. And then you find out that he's an American from Chicago. I heard that moment in your voice on the air.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: Oh, my goodness. The pope is from Chicago. Robert Francis Prevost has been selected as the next pope of the Roman Catholic Church, a 69-year-old...To have the name be announced as American, this suddenly becomes this monumental historical moment for Americans. Never in the history of the church has the Pope been American. And as a Catholic growing up, I was taught it's just never going to happen...SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: ...Because they wouldn't elect an American because America has so much power in the world already. But yeah, it was an exciting moment, and listening back, you could hear that I was excited...SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: ...Because we're in this amazing space at this cool breaking news moment, and I don't know. I was excited to be there.SHAPIRO: I think there's something about live coverage that allows you to get caught up in the moment in a way that is journalistically appropriate, whether you're talking about an inauguration or a new pope or the emotion of a tragedy, if you're covering a war or a natural disaster.DETROW: Yeah.SHAPIRO: Being an unbiased, nonpartisan - use whatever word you want to use - journalist doesn't mean you can't feel the electricity in the room.DETROW: Right.SHAPIRO: And you could really hear that in your voice.DETROW: Yeah. Thank you. And I think that's something that - you and I both feel that way, and I don't know necessarily if people in our positions 20 or 30 years ago felt that way. But I think, like, it's OK to sound human, right? And I think about the fact that last summer, I was in the host chair when the Trump assassination attempt took place. And...SHAPIRO: Right...DETROW: ...The first conversation we had on the line was our colleague Danielle Kurtzleben, who had been in the middle...SHAPIRO: At the rally.DETROW: ...At the rally, ducking under a table, terrified. And the first thing I'm doing is talking to Danielle, and I just like - are you OK?(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: ...Wondering about, like, what might happen next.DETROW: You're in a safe position right now, just to ask that?KURTZLEBEN: Yes, they - people are streaming by. Most in the crowd have already left. The leaving started pretty immediately.DETROW: Then we were doing interviews with people who had been in the crowd with their children. I think just, like, letting your humanity show through and being empathetic is important.SHAPIRO: Do you remember the first time you ever did live special coverage?DETROW: Yes, and it was totally terrifying. It's something of a...SHAPIRO: I often find it totally terrifying.DETROW: I've always been attracted to it. Of all the things that broadcast news (ph), Special Coverage has been the most exciting to me. I actually remember listening to you do it for Arab Spring at one point. You were, like, filling in...SHAPIRO: Oh, wow.DETROW: ...On Talk Of The Nation, and I had a long car drive.SHAPIRO: Talk Of The Nation - that's a throwback. Yeah.DETROW: And you were doing it...SHAPIRO: Years ago.DETROW: ...For hours. And it just - you know, it was always cool as a listener for me to think about those moments. And the first time I got a chance to, I was actually pretty new at NPR. We were going to simulcast a PBS presidential debate, and all I had to do was talk for a minute because it was - you know, it started at, like,10:01.SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: Right? And the mic opened...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...At 10 o'clock. And I still remember the feeling of just, like, my throat going down to my toes and...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...Back up.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: From NPR News, this is special coverage of the PBS NewsHour Democratic primary debate. I'm Scott Detrow. In a moment, we expect former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Senator Bernie...And I don't think I sound as bad as I think I sounded, but just, like, you're listening to live Special Coverage  - just because, like, the - there - usually, there's no script at all, you know?SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: And over time, I've gotten more comfortable with that, and I kind of enjoy the adrenaline rush of that.SHAPIRO: You said it's your favorite thing. Why?DETROW: You know, I've always wanted to be a reporter. I think I've always wanted to be a broadcast journalist. I actually come from a family of broadcast journalists. My dad was a longtime radio news anchor. My uncle was a longtime DJ in San Diego. So, like, just, like, talking into microphones is a big part of my family.And I think, like, growing up as I first started to get interested in it, like, those big moments where the TV anchors are bringing you through an election or a big breaking story was always exciting to me. As I got older, I would - I'll admit to being a nerd and, like, pulling up YouTube clips of kind of, like, live special coverage through the years of...SHAPIRO: Wow.DETROW: ...Big breaking stories and just kind of, like, watching it to see - especially as I started doing it - to see, like, how the anchors or hosts handle one moment or the other, like, the idea that you don't have a safety net, and you don't have a script in front of you, and it's kind of up to you to think on your feet and kind of bring the audience along with you.I like putting myself in the audience's shoes and asking - sometimes just stopping a reporter and asking a really, really basic question because I'm thinking of, like, what does the person totally fresh to the story need to know? And I think just, like, not being afraid to ask a really basic question. I think sometimes we want to, like, try and impress the people who are listening or who we're interviewing. And I think, like, usually with Special Coverage, the most basic question is, what's happening? Why is that happening? Who is this person? Rinse and repeat.SHAPIRO: What are you seeing? Yeah.DETROW: Yeah, what are you seeing? Tell us what's in front of your eyes, especially for something like that. Like, what are you seeing? And then we go to Ruth Sherlock in the crowd. Like, people are overjoyed and waving American flags and crying in the middle of St. Peter's Square, and it's an exciting moment, you know? Like, that's the story right there.SHAPIRO: My favorite moment from listening to your live Special Coverage in Rome was when you thanked your Latin teacher at the end.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: I want to thank my high school Latin teacher, Father Robert Cregan (ph), for this moment where we were translating Latin on the radio. Thank you so much for listening. Again, a lot more coverage of this enormous story - I'm Scott Detrow. We will talk to you...Father Cregan - he was my teacher of freshman year Latin. He is no longer with us, but it just jumped into my head. I was like, you know, never before and probably never again is translating Latin something I'm going to be using as part of my job, so I'm just going to take this moment to thank him.SHAPIRO: It was a great moment. Scott, thank you for letting us flip the tables and answering my questions for a change.DETROW: Well, I appreciate it. Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

SHAPIRO: 'Cause there are thousands of people there.DETROW: Yeah, just waiting for this moment, and we see white smoke, and we both look at each other, and we yell, pope.SHAPIRO: (Laughter).DETROW: And we ran as fast as we could because the goal was to get on the air as soon as there was white smoke.SHAPIRO: Of course, live special rolling coverage. Yeah.DETROW: So I ran as fast as I could, and I...SHAPIRO: I'm imagining you shoving spectators aside, body slamming people.DETROW: I didn't have to throw an elbow, but I was ready. We're getting back as quickly as possible, and we come up, and there's a security checkpoint for the broadcasting area where you have to go - you have to show a code. They have to scan you. It takes a moment. And our editor, Courtney Dorning, just says, jump, just jump. And I truly don't actually have memory of this, but I apparently, without stopping, did a running jump, vaulted over, pushed my hand down, jumped over the fence, sat down, said OK, put on my headphones, and we were on the air, like, 30 seconds later.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: You're listening to live Special Coverage from NPR News.

And the mic opened...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...At 10 o'clock. And I still remember the feeling of just, like, my throat going down to my toes and...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...Back up.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: From NPR News, this is special coverage of the PBS NewsHour Democratic primary debate. I'm Scott Detrow. In a moment, we expect former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Senator Bernie...And I don't think I sound as bad as I think I sounded, but just, like, you're listening to live Special Coverage  - just because, like, the - there - usually, there's no script at all, you know?SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: And over time, I've gotten more comfortable with that, and I kind of enjoy the adrenaline rush of that.SHAPIRO: You said it's your favorite thing. Why?DETROW: You know, I've always wanted to be a reporter. I think I've always wanted to be a broadcast journalist. I actually come from a family of broadcast journalists. My dad was a longtime radio news anchor. My uncle was a longtime DJ in San Diego. So, like, just, like, talking into microphones is a big part of my family.And I think, like, growing up as I first started to get interested in it, like, those big moments where the TV anchors are bringing you through an election or a big breaking story was always exciting to me. As I got older, I would - I'll admit to being a nerd and, like, pulling up YouTube clips of kind of, like, live special coverage through the years of...SHAPIRO: Wow.DETROW: ...Big breaking stories and just kind of, like, watching it to see - especially as I started doing it - to see, like, how the anchors or hosts handle one moment or the other, like, the idea that you don't have a safety net, and you don't have a script in front of you, and it's kind of up to you to think on your feet and kind of bring the audience along with you.I like putting myself in the audience's shoes and asking - sometimes just stopping a reporter and asking a really, really basic question because I'm thinking of, like, what does the person totally fresh to the story need to know? And I think just, like, not being afraid to ask a really basic question. I think sometimes we want to, like, try and impress the people who are listening or who we're interviewing. And I think, like, usually with Special Coverage, the most basic question is, what's happening? Why is that happening? Who is this person? Rinse and repeat.SHAPIRO: What are you seeing? Yeah.DETROW: Yeah, what are you seeing? Tell us what's in front of your eyes, especially for something like that. Like, what are you seeing? And then we go to Ruth Sherlock in the crowd. Like, people are overjoyed and waving American flags and crying in the middle of St. Peter's Square, and it's an exciting moment, you know? Like, that's the story right there.SHAPIRO: My favorite moment from listening to your live Special Coverage in Rome was when you thanked your Latin teacher at the end.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: I want to thank my high school Latin teacher, Father Robert Cregan (ph), for this moment where we were translating Latin on the radio. Thank you so much for listening. Again, a lot more coverage of this enormous story - I'm Scott Detrow. We will talk to you...Father Cregan - he was my teacher of freshman year Latin. He is no longer with us, but it just jumped into my head. I was like, you know, never before and probably never again is translating Latin something I'm going to be using as part of my job, so I'm just going to take this moment to thank him.SHAPIRO: It was a great moment. Scott, thank you for letting us flip the tables and answering my questions for a change.DETROW: Well, I appreciate it. Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The authoritative record of NPR’s programming is the audio record. DETROW: Yeah, just waiting for this moment, and we see white smoke, and we both look at each other, and we yell, pope.SHAPIRO: (Laughter).DETROW: And we ran as fast as we could because the goal was to get on the air as soon as there was white smoke.SHAPIRO: Of course, live special rolling coverage. Yeah.DETROW: So I ran as fast as I could, and I...SHAPIRO: I'm imagining you shoving spectators aside, body slamming people.DETROW: I didn't have to throw an elbow, but I was ready. We're getting back as quickly as possible, and we come up, and there's a security checkpoint for the broadcasting area where you have to go - you have to show a code. They have to scan you. It takes a moment. And our editor, Courtney Dorning, just says, jump, just jump. And I truly don't actually have memory of this, but I apparently, without stopping, did a running jump, vaulted over, pushed my hand down, jumped over the fence, sat down, said OK, put on my headphones, and we were on the air, like, 30 seconds later.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: You're listening to live Special Coverage from NPR News. I'm Scott Detrow coming to you from the edge of St. Peter's Square. The bells are tolling at St. Peter's. White smoke has billowed out of the Sistine Chapel's chimney, and that means the Catholic Church has a new pope. This election comes on the second day of the papal conclave.SHAPIRO: So first, you have to fill time until you find out who the pope was.DETROW: Yes.SHAPIRO: And then you find out who it is. Already, this is going to be huge news, whoever the new pope is. And then you find out that he's an American from Chicago. I heard that moment in your voice on the air.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: Oh, my goodness. The pope is from Chicago. Robert Francis Prevost has been selected as the next pope of the Roman Catholic Church, a 69-year-old...To have the name be announced as American, this suddenly becomes this monumental historical moment for Americans. Never in the history of the church has the Pope been American. And as a Catholic growing up, I was taught it's just never going to happen...SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: ...Because they wouldn't elect an American because America has so much power in the world already. But yeah, it was an exciting moment, and listening back, you could hear that I was excited...SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: ...Because we're in this amazing space at this cool breaking news moment, and I don't know. I was excited to be there.SHAPIRO: I think there's something about live coverage that allows you to get caught up in the moment in a way that is journalistically appropriate, whether you're talking about an inauguration or a new pope or the emotion of a tragedy, if you're covering a war or a natural disaster.DETROW: Yeah.SHAPIRO: Being an unbiased, nonpartisan - use whatever word you want to use - journalist doesn't mean you can't feel the electricity in the room.DETROW: Right.SHAPIRO: And you could really hear that in your voice.DETROW: Yeah. Thank you. And I think that's something that - you and I both feel that way, and I don't know necessarily if people in our positions 20 or 30 years ago felt that way. But I think, like, it's OK to sound human, right? And I think about the fact that last summer, I was in the host chair when the Trump assassination attempt took place. And...SHAPIRO: Right...DETROW: ...The first conversation we had on the line was our colleague Danielle Kurtzleben, who had been in the middle...SHAPIRO: At the rally.DETROW: ...At the rally, ducking under a table, terrified. And the first thing I'm doing is talking to Danielle, and I just like - are you OK?(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: ...Wondering about, like, what might happen next.DETROW: You're in a safe position right now, just to ask that?KURTZLEBEN: Yes, they - people are streaming by. Most in the crowd have already left. The leaving started pretty immediately.DETROW: Then we were doing interviews with people who had been in the crowd with their children. I think just, like, letting your humanity show through and being empathetic is important.SHAPIRO: Do you remember the first time you ever did live special coverage?DETROW: Yes, and it was totally terrifying. It's something of a...SHAPIRO: I often find it totally terrifying.DETROW: I've always been attracted to it. Of all the things that broadcast news (ph), Special Coverage has been the most exciting to me. I actually remember listening to you do it for Arab Spring at one point. You were, like, filling in...SHAPIRO: Oh, wow.DETROW: ...On Talk Of The Nation, and I had a long car drive.SHAPIRO: Talk Of The Nation - that's a throwback. Yeah.DETROW: And you were doing it...SHAPIRO: Years ago.DETROW: ...For hours. And it just - you know, it was always cool as a listener for me to think about those moments. And the first time I got a chance to, I was actually pretty new at NPR. We were going to simulcast a PBS presidential debate, and all I had to do was talk for a minute because it was - you know, it started at, like,10:01.SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: Right?

Yeah.DETROW: So I ran as fast as I could, and I...SHAPIRO: I'm imagining you shoving spectators aside, body slamming people.DETROW: I didn't have to throw an elbow, but I was ready. We're getting back as quickly as possible, and we come up, and there's a security checkpoint for the broadcasting area where you have to go - you have to show a code. They have to scan you. It takes a moment. And our editor, Courtney Dorning, just says, jump, just jump. And I truly don't actually have memory of this, but I apparently, without stopping, did a running jump, vaulted over, pushed my hand down, jumped over the fence, sat down, said OK, put on my headphones, and we were on the air, like, 30 seconds later.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: You're listening to live Special Coverage from NPR News. I'm Scott Detrow coming to you from the edge of St. Peter's Square. The bells are tolling at St. Peter's. White smoke has billowed out of the Sistine Chapel's chimney, and that means the Catholic Church has a new pope. This election comes on the second day of the papal conclave.SHAPIRO: So first, you have to fill time until you find out who the pope was.DETROW: Yes.SHAPIRO: And then you find out who it is. Already, this is going to be huge news, whoever the new pope is. And then you find out that he's an American from Chicago. I heard that moment in your voice on the air.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: Oh, my goodness. The pope is from Chicago. Robert Francis Prevost has been selected as the next pope of the Roman Catholic Church, a 69-year-old...To have the name be announced as American, this suddenly becomes this monumental historical moment for Americans. Never in the history of the church has the Pope been American. And as a Catholic growing up, I was taught it's just never going to happen...SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: ...Because they wouldn't elect an American because America has so much power in the world already. But yeah, it was an exciting moment, and listening back, you could hear that I was excited...SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: ...Because we're in this amazing space at this cool breaking news moment, and I don't know. I was excited to be there.SHAPIRO: I think there's something about live coverage that allows you to get caught up in the moment in a way that is journalistically appropriate, whether you're talking about an inauguration or a new pope or the emotion of a tragedy, if you're covering a war or a natural disaster.DETROW: Yeah.SHAPIRO: Being an unbiased, nonpartisan - use whatever word you want to use - journalist doesn't mean you can't feel the electricity in the room.DETROW: Right.SHAPIRO: And you could really hear that in your voice.DETROW: Yeah. Thank you. And I think that's something that - you and I both feel that way, and I don't know necessarily if people in our positions 20 or 30 years ago felt that way. But I think, like, it's OK to sound human, right? And I think about the fact that last summer, I was in the host chair when the Trump assassination attempt took place. And...SHAPIRO: Right...DETROW: ...The first conversation we had on the line was our colleague Danielle Kurtzleben, who had been in the middle...SHAPIRO: At the rally.DETROW: ...At the rally, ducking under a table, terrified. And the first thing I'm doing is talking to Danielle, and I just like - are you OK?(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: ...Wondering about, like, what might happen next.DETROW: You're in a safe position right now, just to ask that?KURTZLEBEN: Yes, they - people are streaming by. Most in the crowd have already left. The leaving started pretty immediately.DETROW: Then we were doing interviews with people who had been in the crowd with their children. I think just, like, letting your humanity show through and being empathetic is important.SHAPIRO: Do you remember the first time you ever did live special coverage?DETROW: Yes, and it was totally terrifying. It's something of a...SHAPIRO: I often find it totally terrifying.DETROW: I've always been attracted to it. Of all the things that broadcast news (ph), Special Coverage has been the most exciting to me. I actually remember listening to you do it for Arab Spring at one point. You were, like, filling in...SHAPIRO: Oh, wow.DETROW: ...On Talk Of The Nation, and I had a long car drive.SHAPIRO: Talk Of The Nation - that's a throwback. Yeah.DETROW: And you were doing it...SHAPIRO: Years ago.DETROW: ...For hours. And it just - you know, it was always cool as a listener for me to think about those moments. And the first time I got a chance to, I was actually pretty new at NPR. We were going to simulcast a PBS presidential debate, and all I had to do was talk for a minute because it was - you know, it started at, like,10:01.SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: Right? And the mic opened...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...At 10 o'clock. And I still remember the feeling of just, like, my throat going down to my toes and...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...Back up.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: From NPR News, this is special coverage of the PBS NewsHour Democratic primary debate. I'm Scott Detrow. In a moment, we expect former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Senator Bernie...And I don't think I sound as bad as I think I sounded, but just, like, you're listening to live Special Coverage  - just because, like, the - there - usually, there's no script at all, you know?SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: And over time, I've gotten more comfortable with that, and I kind of enjoy the adrenaline rush of that.SHAPIRO: You said it's your favorite thing. Why?DETROW: You know, I've always wanted to be a reporter. I think I've always wanted to be a broadcast journalist. I actually come from a family of broadcast journalists. My dad was a longtime radio news anchor. My uncle was a longtime DJ in San Diego. So, like, just, like, talking into microphones is a big part of my family.And I think, like, growing up as I first started to get interested in it, like, those big moments where the TV anchors are bringing you through an election or a big breaking story was always exciting to me. As I got older, I would - I'll admit to being a nerd and, like, pulling up YouTube clips of kind of, like, live special coverage through the years of...SHAPIRO: Wow.DETROW: ...Big breaking stories and just kind of, like, watching it to see - especially as I started doing it - to see, like, how the anchors or hosts handle one moment or the other, like, the idea that you don't have a safety net, and you don't have a script in front of you, and it's kind of up to you to think on your feet and kind of bring the audience along with you.I like putting myself in the audience's shoes and asking - sometimes just stopping a reporter and asking a really, really basic question because I'm thinking of, like, what does the person totally fresh to the story need to know? And I think just, like, not being afraid to ask a really basic question. I think sometimes we want to, like, try and impress the people who are listening or who we're interviewing. And I think, like, usually with Special Coverage, the most basic question is, what's happening? Why is that happening? Who is this person? Rinse and repeat.SHAPIRO: What are you seeing? Yeah.DETROW: Yeah, what are you seeing? Tell us what's in front of your eyes, especially for something like that. Like, what are you seeing? And then we go to Ruth Sherlock in the crowd. Like, people are overjoyed and waving American flags and crying in the middle of St. Peter's Square, and it's an exciting moment, you know? Like, that's the story right there.SHAPIRO: My favorite moment from listening to your live Special Coverage in Rome was when you thanked your Latin teacher at the end.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: I want to thank my high school Latin teacher, Father Robert Cregan (ph), for this moment where we were translating Latin on the radio. Thank you so much for listening. Again, a lot more coverage of this enormous story - I'm Scott Detrow. We will talk to you...Father Cregan - he was my teacher of freshman year Latin. He is no longer with us, but it just jumped into my head. I was like, you know, never before and probably never again is translating Latin something I'm going to be using as part of my job, so I'm just going to take this moment to thank him.SHAPIRO: It was a great moment. Scott, thank you for letting us flip the tables and answering my questions for a change.DETROW: Well, I appreciate it. Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

We were going to simulcast a PBS presidential debate, and all I had to do was talk for a minute because it was - you know, it started at, like,10:01.SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: Right? And the mic opened...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...At 10 o'clock. And I still remember the feeling of just, like, my throat going down to my toes and...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...Back up.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: From NPR News, this is special coverage of the PBS NewsHour Democratic primary debate. I'm Scott Detrow. In a moment, we expect former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Senator Bernie...And I don't think I sound as bad as I think I sounded, but just, like, you're listening to live Special Coverage  - just because, like, the - there - usually, there's no script at all, you know?SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: And over time, I've gotten more comfortable with that, and I kind of enjoy the adrenaline rush of that.SHAPIRO: You said it's your favorite thing. Why?DETROW: You know, I've always wanted to be a reporter. I think I've always wanted to be a broadcast journalist. I actually come from a family of broadcast journalists. My dad was a longtime radio news anchor. My uncle was a longtime DJ in San Diego. So, like, just, like, talking into microphones is a big part of my family.And I think, like, growing up as I first started to get interested in it, like, those big moments where the TV anchors are bringing you through an election or a big breaking story was always exciting to me. As I got older, I would - I'll admit to being a nerd and, like, pulling up YouTube clips of kind of, like, live special coverage through the years of...SHAPIRO: Wow.DETROW: ...Big breaking stories and just kind of, like, watching it to see - especially as I started doing it - to see, like, how the anchors or hosts handle one moment or the other, like, the idea that you don't have a safety net, and you don't have a script in front of you, and it's kind of up to you to think on your feet and kind of bring the audience along with you.I like putting myself in the audience's shoes and asking - sometimes just stopping a reporter and asking a really, really basic question because I'm thinking of, like, what does the person totally fresh to the story need to know? And I think just, like, not being afraid to ask a really basic question. I think sometimes we want to, like, try and impress the people who are listening or who we're interviewing. And I think, like, usually with Special Coverage, the most basic question is, what's happening? Why is that happening? Who is this person? Rinse and repeat.SHAPIRO: What are you seeing? Yeah.DETROW: Yeah, what are you seeing? Tell us what's in front of your eyes, especially for something like that. Like, what are you seeing? And then we go to Ruth Sherlock in the crowd. Like, people are overjoyed and waving American flags and crying in the middle of St. Peter's Square, and it's an exciting moment, you know? Like, that's the story right there.SHAPIRO: My favorite moment from listening to your live Special Coverage in Rome was when you thanked your Latin teacher at the end.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: I want to thank my high school Latin teacher, Father Robert Cregan (ph), for this moment where we were translating Latin on the radio. Thank you so much for listening. Again, a lot more coverage of this enormous story - I'm Scott Detrow. We will talk to you...Father Cregan - he was my teacher of freshman year Latin. He is no longer with us, but it just jumped into my head. I was like, you know, never before and probably never again is translating Latin something I'm going to be using as part of my job, so I'm just going to take this moment to thank him.SHAPIRO: It was a great moment. Scott, thank you for letting us flip the tables and answering my questions for a change.DETROW: Well, I appreciate it. Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

DETROW: So I ran as fast as I could, and I...SHAPIRO: I'm imagining you shoving spectators aside, body slamming people.DETROW: I didn't have to throw an elbow, but I was ready. We're getting back as quickly as possible, and we come up, and there's a security checkpoint for the broadcasting area where you have to go - you have to show a code. They have to scan you. It takes a moment. And our editor, Courtney Dorning, just says, jump, just jump. And I truly don't actually have memory of this, but I apparently, without stopping, did a running jump, vaulted over, pushed my hand down, jumped over the fence, sat down, said OK, put on my headphones, and we were on the air, like, 30 seconds later.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: You're listening to live Special Coverage from NPR News. I'm Scott Detrow coming to you from the edge of St. Peter's Square. The bells are tolling at St. Peter's. White smoke has billowed out of the Sistine Chapel's chimney, and that means the Catholic Church has a new pope. This election comes on the second day of the papal conclave.SHAPIRO: So first, you have to fill time until you find out who the pope was.DETROW: Yes.SHAPIRO: And then you find out who it is. Already, this is going to be huge news, whoever the new pope is. And then you find out that he's an American from Chicago. I heard that moment in your voice on the air.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: Oh, my goodness. The pope is from Chicago. Robert Francis Prevost has been selected as the next pope of the Roman Catholic Church, a 69-year-old...To have the name be announced as American, this suddenly becomes this monumental historical moment for Americans. Never in the history of the church has the Pope been American. And as a Catholic growing up, I was taught it's just never going to happen...SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: ...Because they wouldn't elect an American because America has so much power in the world already. But yeah, it was an exciting moment, and listening back, you could hear that I was excited...SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: ...Because we're in this amazing space at this cool breaking news moment, and I don't know. I was excited to be there.SHAPIRO: I think there's something about live coverage that allows you to get caught up in the moment in a way that is journalistically appropriate, whether you're talking about an inauguration or a new pope or the emotion of a tragedy, if you're covering a war or a natural disaster.DETROW: Yeah.SHAPIRO: Being an unbiased, nonpartisan - use whatever word you want to use - journalist doesn't mean you can't feel the electricity in the room.DETROW: Right.SHAPIRO: And you could really hear that in your voice.DETROW: Yeah. Thank you. And I think that's something that - you and I both feel that way, and I don't know necessarily if people in our positions 20 or 30 years ago felt that way. But I think, like, it's OK to sound human, right? And I think about the fact that last summer, I was in the host chair when the Trump assassination attempt took place. And...SHAPIRO: Right...DETROW: ...The first conversation we had on the line was our colleague Danielle Kurtzleben, who had been in the middle...SHAPIRO: At the rally.DETROW: ...At the rally, ducking under a table, terrified. And the first thing I'm doing is talking to Danielle, and I just like - are you OK?(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: ...Wondering about, like, what might happen next.DETROW: You're in a safe position right now, just to ask that?KURTZLEBEN: Yes, they - people are streaming by. Most in the crowd have already left. The leaving started pretty immediately.DETROW: Then we were doing interviews with people who had been in the crowd with their children. I think just, like, letting your humanity show through and being empathetic is important.SHAPIRO: Do you remember the first time you ever did live special coverage?DETROW: Yes, and it was totally terrifying. It's something of a...SHAPIRO: I often find it totally terrifying.DETROW: I've always been attracted to it. Of all the things that broadcast news (ph), Special Coverage has been the most exciting to me. I actually remember listening to you do it for Arab Spring at one point. You were, like, filling in...SHAPIRO: Oh, wow.DETROW: ...On Talk Of The Nation, and I had a long car drive.SHAPIRO: Talk Of The Nation - that's a throwback. Yeah.DETROW: And you were doing it...SHAPIRO: Years ago.DETROW: ...For hours. And it just - you know, it was always cool as a listener for me to think about those moments.

I'm Scott Detrow coming to you from the edge of St. Peter's Square. The bells are tolling at St. Peter's. White smoke has billowed out of the Sistine Chapel's chimney, and that means the Catholic Church has a new pope. This election comes on the second day of the papal conclave.SHAPIRO: So first, you have to fill time until you find out who the pope was.DETROW: Yes.SHAPIRO: And then you find out who it is. Already, this is going to be huge news, whoever the new pope is. And then you find out that he's an American from Chicago. I heard that moment in your voice on the air.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: Oh, my goodness. The pope is from Chicago. Robert Francis Prevost has been selected as the next pope of the Roman Catholic Church, a 69-year-old...To have the name be announced as American, this suddenly becomes this monumental historical moment for Americans. Never in the history of the church has the Pope been American. And as a Catholic growing up, I was taught it's just never going to happen...SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: ...Because they wouldn't elect an American because America has so much power in the world already. But yeah, it was an exciting moment, and listening back, you could hear that I was excited...SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: ...Because we're in this amazing space at this cool breaking news moment, and I don't know. I was excited to be there.SHAPIRO: I think there's something about live coverage that allows you to get caught up in the moment in a way that is journalistically appropriate, whether you're talking about an inauguration or a new pope or the emotion of a tragedy, if you're covering a war or a natural disaster.DETROW: Yeah.SHAPIRO: Being an unbiased, nonpartisan - use whatever word you want to use - journalist doesn't mean you can't feel the electricity in the room.DETROW: Right.SHAPIRO: And you could really hear that in your voice.DETROW: Yeah. Thank you. And I think that's something that - you and I both feel that way, and I don't know necessarily if people in our positions 20 or 30 years ago felt that way. But I think, like, it's OK to sound human, right? And I think about the fact that last summer, I was in the host chair when the Trump assassination attempt took place. And...SHAPIRO: Right...DETROW: ...The first conversation we had on the line was our colleague Danielle Kurtzleben, who had been in the middle...SHAPIRO: At the rally.DETROW: ...At the rally, ducking under a table, terrified. And the first thing I'm doing is talking to Danielle, and I just like - are you OK?(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: ...Wondering about, like, what might happen next.DETROW: You're in a safe position right now, just to ask that?KURTZLEBEN: Yes, they - people are streaming by. Most in the crowd have already left. The leaving started pretty immediately.DETROW: Then we were doing interviews with people who had been in the crowd with their children. I think just, like, letting your humanity show through and being empathetic is important.SHAPIRO: Do you remember the first time you ever did live special coverage?DETROW: Yes, and it was totally terrifying. It's something of a...SHAPIRO: I often find it totally terrifying.DETROW: I've always been attracted to it. Of all the things that broadcast news (ph), Special Coverage has been the most exciting to me. I actually remember listening to you do it for Arab Spring at one point. You were, like, filling in...SHAPIRO: Oh, wow.DETROW: ...On Talk Of The Nation, and I had a long car drive.SHAPIRO: Talk Of The Nation - that's a throwback. Yeah.DETROW: And you were doing it...SHAPIRO: Years ago.DETROW: ...For hours. And it just - you know, it was always cool as a listener for me to think about those moments. And the first time I got a chance to, I was actually pretty new at NPR. We were going to simulcast a PBS presidential debate, and all I had to do was talk for a minute because it was - you know, it started at, like,10:01.SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: Right? And the mic opened...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...At 10 o'clock. And I still remember the feeling of just, like, my throat going down to my toes and...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...Back up.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: From NPR News, this is special coverage of the PBS NewsHour Democratic primary debate. I'm Scott Detrow. In a moment, we expect former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Senator Bernie...And I don't think I sound as bad as I think I sounded, but just, like, you're listening to live Special Coverage  - just because, like, the - there - usually, there's no script at all, you know?SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: And over time, I've gotten more comfortable with that, and I kind of enjoy the adrenaline rush of that.SHAPIRO: You said it's your favorite thing. Why?DETROW: You know, I've always wanted to be a reporter. I think I've always wanted to be a broadcast journalist. I actually come from a family of broadcast journalists. My dad was a longtime radio news anchor. My uncle was a longtime DJ in San Diego. So, like, just, like, talking into microphones is a big part of my family.And I think, like, growing up as I first started to get interested in it, like, those big moments where the TV anchors are bringing you through an election or a big breaking story was always exciting to me. As I got older, I would - I'll admit to being a nerd and, like, pulling up YouTube clips of kind of, like, live special coverage through the years of...SHAPIRO: Wow.DETROW: ...Big breaking stories and just kind of, like, watching it to see - especially as I started doing it - to see, like, how the anchors or hosts handle one moment or the other, like, the idea that you don't have a safety net, and you don't have a script in front of you, and it's kind of up to you to think on your feet and kind of bring the audience along with you.I like putting myself in the audience's shoes and asking - sometimes just stopping a reporter and asking a really, really basic question because I'm thinking of, like, what does the person totally fresh to the story need to know? And I think just, like, not being afraid to ask a really basic question. I think sometimes we want to, like, try and impress the people who are listening or who we're interviewing. And I think, like, usually with Special Coverage, the most basic question is, what's happening? Why is that happening? Who is this person? Rinse and repeat.SHAPIRO: What are you seeing? Yeah.DETROW: Yeah, what are you seeing? Tell us what's in front of your eyes, especially for something like that. Like, what are you seeing? And then we go to Ruth Sherlock in the crowd. Like, people are overjoyed and waving American flags and crying in the middle of St. Peter's Square, and it's an exciting moment, you know? Like, that's the story right there.SHAPIRO: My favorite moment from listening to your live Special Coverage in Rome was when you thanked your Latin teacher at the end.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: I want to thank my high school Latin teacher, Father Robert Cregan (ph), for this moment where we were translating Latin on the radio. Thank you so much for listening. Again, a lot more coverage of this enormous story - I'm Scott Detrow. We will talk to you...Father Cregan - he was my teacher of freshman year Latin. He is no longer with us, but it just jumped into my head. I was like, you know, never before and probably never again is translating Latin something I'm going to be using as part of my job, so I'm just going to take this moment to thank him.SHAPIRO: It was a great moment. Scott, thank you for letting us flip the tables and answering my questions for a change.DETROW: Well, I appreciate it. Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

As I got older, I would - I'll admit to being a nerd and, like, pulling up YouTube clips of kind of, like, live special coverage through the years of...SHAPIRO: Wow.DETROW: ...Big breaking stories and just kind of, like, watching it to see - especially as I started doing it - to see, like, how the anchors or hosts handle one moment or the other, like, the idea that you don't have a safety net, and you don't have a script in front of you, and it's kind of up to you to think on your feet and kind of bring the audience along with you.I like putting myself in the audience's shoes and asking - sometimes just stopping a reporter and asking a really, really basic question because I'm thinking of, like, what does the person totally fresh to the story need to know? And I think just, like, not being afraid to ask a really basic question. I think sometimes we want to, like, try and impress the people who are listening or who we're interviewing. And I think, like, usually with Special Coverage, the most basic question is, what's happening? Why is that happening? Who is this person? Rinse and repeat.SHAPIRO: What are you seeing? Yeah.DETROW: Yeah, what are you seeing? Tell us what's in front of your eyes, especially for something like that. Like, what are you seeing? And then we go to Ruth Sherlock in the crowd. Like, people are overjoyed and waving American flags and crying in the middle of St. Peter's Square, and it's an exciting moment, you know? Like, that's the story right there.SHAPIRO: My favorite moment from listening to your live Special Coverage in Rome was when you thanked your Latin teacher at the end.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: I want to thank my high school Latin teacher, Father Robert Cregan (ph), for this moment where we were translating Latin on the radio. Thank you so much for listening. Again, a lot more coverage of this enormous story - I'm Scott Detrow. We will talk to you...Father Cregan - he was my teacher of freshman year Latin. He is no longer with us, but it just jumped into my head. I was like, you know, never before and probably never again is translating Latin something I'm going to be using as part of my job, so I'm just going to take this moment to thank him.SHAPIRO: It was a great moment. Scott, thank you for letting us flip the tables and answering my questions for a change.DETROW: Well, I appreciate it. Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

I'm Scott Detrow coming to you from the edge of St. Peter's Square. The bells are tolling at St. Peter's. White smoke has billowed out of the Sistine Chapel's chimney, and that means the Catholic Church has a new pope. This election comes on the second day of the papal conclave.SHAPIRO: So first, you have to fill time until you find out who the pope was.DETROW: Yes.SHAPIRO: And then you find out who it is. Already, this is going to be huge news, whoever the new pope is. And then you find out that he's an American from Chicago. I heard that moment in your voice on the air.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: Oh, my goodness. The pope is from Chicago. Robert Francis Prevost has been selected as the next pope of the Roman Catholic Church, a 69-year-old...To have the name be announced as American, this suddenly becomes this monumental historical moment for Americans. Never in the history of the church has the Pope been American. And as a Catholic growing up, I was taught it's just never going to happen...SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: ...Because they wouldn't elect an American because America has so much power in the world already. But yeah, it was an exciting moment, and listening back, you could hear that I was excited...SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: ...Because we're in this amazing space at this cool breaking news moment, and I don't know. I was excited to be there.SHAPIRO: I think there's something about live coverage that allows you to get caught up in the moment in a way that is journalistically appropriate, whether you're talking about an inauguration or a new pope or the emotion of a tragedy, if you're covering a war or a natural disaster.DETROW: Yeah.SHAPIRO: Being an unbiased, nonpartisan - use whatever word you want to use - journalist doesn't mean you can't feel the electricity in the room.DETROW: Right.SHAPIRO: And you could really hear that in your voice.DETROW: Yeah. Thank you. And I think that's something that - you and I both feel that way, and I don't know necessarily if people in our positions 20 or 30 years ago felt that way. But I think, like, it's OK to sound human, right? And I think about the fact that last summer, I was in the host chair when the Trump assassination attempt took place. And...SHAPIRO: Right...DETROW: ...The first conversation we had on the line was our colleague Danielle Kurtzleben, who had been in the middle...SHAPIRO: At the rally.DETROW: ...At the rally, ducking under a table, terrified. And the first thing I'm doing is talking to Danielle, and I just like - are you OK?(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: ...Wondering about, like, what might happen next.DETROW: You're in a safe position right now, just to ask that?KURTZLEBEN: Yes, they - people are streaming by. Most in the crowd have already left. The leaving started pretty immediately.DETROW: Then we were doing interviews with people who had been in the crowd with their children. I think just, like, letting your humanity show through and being empathetic is important.SHAPIRO: Do you remember the first time you ever did live special coverage?DETROW: Yes, and it was totally terrifying. It's something of a...SHAPIRO: I often find it totally terrifying.DETROW: I've always been attracted to it. Of all the things that broadcast news (ph), Special Coverage has been the most exciting to me. I actually remember listening to you do it for Arab Spring at one point. You were, like, filling in...SHAPIRO: Oh, wow.DETROW: ...On Talk Of The Nation, and I had a long car drive.SHAPIRO: Talk Of The Nation - that's a throwback. Yeah.DETROW: And you were doing it...SHAPIRO: Years ago.DETROW: ...For hours. And it just - you know, it was always cool as a listener for me to think about those moments. And the first time I got a chance to, I was actually pretty new at NPR. We were going to simulcast a PBS presidential debate, and all I had to do was talk for a minute because it was - you know, it started at, like,10:01.SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: Right? And the mic opened...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...At 10 o'clock. And I still remember the feeling of just, like, my throat going down to my toes and...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...Back up.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: From NPR News, this is special coverage of the PBS NewsHour Democratic primary debate. I'm Scott Detrow. In a moment, we expect former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Senator Bernie...And I don't think I sound as bad as I think I sounded, but just, like, you're listening to live Special Coverage  - just because, like, the - there - usually, there's no script at all, you know?SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: And over time, I've gotten more comfortable with that, and I kind of enjoy the adrenaline rush of that.SHAPIRO: You said it's your favorite thing. Why?DETROW: You know, I've always wanted to be a reporter. I think I've always wanted to be a broadcast journalist. I actually come from a family of broadcast journalists. My dad was a longtime radio news anchor. My uncle was a longtime DJ in San Diego.

In a moment, we expect former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Senator Bernie...And I don't think I sound as bad as I think I sounded, but just, like, you're listening to live Special Coverage  - just because, like, the - there - usually, there's no script at all, you know?SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: And over time, I've gotten more comfortable with that, and I kind of enjoy the adrenaline rush of that.SHAPIRO: You said it's your favorite thing. Why?DETROW: You know, I've always wanted to be a reporter. I think I've always wanted to be a broadcast journalist. I actually come from a family of broadcast journalists. My dad was a longtime radio news anchor. My uncle was a longtime DJ in San Diego. So, like, just, like, talking into microphones is a big part of my family.And I think, like, growing up as I first started to get interested in it, like, those big moments where the TV anchors are bringing you through an election or a big breaking story was always exciting to me. As I got older, I would - I'll admit to being a nerd and, like, pulling up YouTube clips of kind of, like, live special coverage through the years of...SHAPIRO: Wow.DETROW: ...Big breaking stories and just kind of, like, watching it to see - especially as I started doing it - to see, like, how the anchors or hosts handle one moment or the other, like, the idea that you don't have a safety net, and you don't have a script in front of you, and it's kind of up to you to think on your feet and kind of bring the audience along with you.I like putting myself in the audience's shoes and asking - sometimes just stopping a reporter and asking a really, really basic question because I'm thinking of, like, what does the person totally fresh to the story need to know? And I think just, like, not being afraid to ask a really basic question. I think sometimes we want to, like, try and impress the people who are listening or who we're interviewing. And I think, like, usually with Special Coverage, the most basic question is, what's happening? Why is that happening? Who is this person? Rinse and repeat.SHAPIRO: What are you seeing? Yeah.DETROW: Yeah, what are you seeing? Tell us what's in front of your eyes, especially for something like that. Like, what are you seeing? And then we go to Ruth Sherlock in the crowd. Like, people are overjoyed and waving American flags and crying in the middle of St. Peter's Square, and it's an exciting moment, you know? Like, that's the story right there.SHAPIRO: My favorite moment from listening to your live Special Coverage in Rome was when you thanked your Latin teacher at the end.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: I want to thank my high school Latin teacher, Father Robert Cregan (ph), for this moment where we were translating Latin on the radio. Thank you so much for listening. Again, a lot more coverage of this enormous story - I'm Scott Detrow. We will talk to you...Father Cregan - he was my teacher of freshman year Latin. He is no longer with us, but it just jumped into my head. I was like, you know, never before and probably never again is translating Latin something I'm going to be using as part of my job, so I'm just going to take this moment to thank him.SHAPIRO: It was a great moment. Scott, thank you for letting us flip the tables and answering my questions for a change.DETROW: Well, I appreciate it. Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The authoritative record of NPR’s programming is the audio record. SHAPIRO: So first, you have to fill time until you find out who the pope was.DETROW: Yes.SHAPIRO: And then you find out who it is. Already, this is going to be huge news, whoever the new pope is. And then you find out that he's an American from Chicago. I heard that moment in your voice on the air.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: Oh, my goodness. The pope is from Chicago. Robert Francis Prevost has been selected as the next pope of the Roman Catholic Church, a 69-year-old...To have the name be announced as American, this suddenly becomes this monumental historical moment for Americans. Never in the history of the church has the Pope been American. And as a Catholic growing up, I was taught it's just never going to happen...SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: ...Because they wouldn't elect an American because America has so much power in the world already. But yeah, it was an exciting moment, and listening back, you could hear that I was excited...SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: ...Because we're in this amazing space at this cool breaking news moment, and I don't know. I was excited to be there.SHAPIRO: I think there's something about live coverage that allows you to get caught up in the moment in a way that is journalistically appropriate, whether you're talking about an inauguration or a new pope or the emotion of a tragedy, if you're covering a war or a natural disaster.DETROW: Yeah.SHAPIRO: Being an unbiased, nonpartisan - use whatever word you want to use - journalist doesn't mean you can't feel the electricity in the room.DETROW: Right.SHAPIRO: And you could really hear that in your voice.DETROW: Yeah. Thank you. And I think that's something that - you and I both feel that way, and I don't know necessarily if people in our positions 20 or 30 years ago felt that way. But I think, like, it's OK to sound human, right? And I think about the fact that last summer, I was in the host chair when the Trump assassination attempt took place. And...SHAPIRO: Right...DETROW: ...The first conversation we had on the line was our colleague Danielle Kurtzleben, who had been in the middle...SHAPIRO: At the rally.DETROW: ...At the rally, ducking under a table, terrified. And the first thing I'm doing is talking to Danielle, and I just like - are you OK?(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: ...Wondering about, like, what might happen next.DETROW: You're in a safe position right now, just to ask that?KURTZLEBEN: Yes, they - people are streaming by. Most in the crowd have already left. The leaving started pretty immediately.DETROW: Then we were doing interviews with people who had been in the crowd with their children. I think just, like, letting your humanity show through and being empathetic is important.SHAPIRO: Do you remember the first time you ever did live special coverage?DETROW: Yes, and it was totally terrifying. It's something of a...SHAPIRO: I often find it totally terrifying.DETROW: I've always been attracted to it. Of all the things that broadcast news (ph), Special Coverage has been the most exciting to me. I actually remember listening to you do it for Arab Spring at one point. You were, like, filling in...SHAPIRO: Oh, wow.DETROW: ...On Talk Of The Nation, and I had a long car drive.SHAPIRO: Talk Of The Nation - that's a throwback. Yeah.DETROW: And you were doing it...SHAPIRO: Years ago.DETROW: ...For hours. And it just - you know, it was always cool as a listener for me to think about those moments. And the first time I got a chance to, I was actually pretty new at NPR. We were going to simulcast a PBS presidential debate, and all I had to do was talk for a minute because it was - you know, it started at, like,10:01.SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: Right? And the mic opened...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...At 10 o'clock. And I still remember the feeling of just, like, my throat going down to my toes and...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...Back up.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: From NPR News, this is special coverage of the PBS NewsHour Democratic primary debate.

So, like, just, like, talking into microphones is a big part of my family.And I think, like, growing up as I first started to get interested in it, like, those big moments where the TV anchors are bringing you through an election or a big breaking story was always exciting to me. As I got older, I would - I'll admit to being a nerd and, like, pulling up YouTube clips of kind of, like, live special coverage through the years of...SHAPIRO: Wow.DETROW: ...Big breaking stories and just kind of, like, watching it to see - especially as I started doing it - to see, like, how the anchors or hosts handle one moment or the other, like, the idea that you don't have a safety net, and you don't have a script in front of you, and it's kind of up to you to think on your feet and kind of bring the audience along with you.I like putting myself in the audience's shoes and asking - sometimes just stopping a reporter and asking a really, really basic question because I'm thinking of, like, what does the person totally fresh to the story need to know? And I think just, like, not being afraid to ask a really basic question. I think sometimes we want to, like, try and impress the people who are listening or who we're interviewing. And I think, like, usually with Special Coverage, the most basic question is, what's happening? Why is that happening? Who is this person? Rinse and repeat.SHAPIRO: What are you seeing? Yeah.DETROW: Yeah, what are you seeing? Tell us what's in front of your eyes, especially for something like that. Like, what are you seeing? And then we go to Ruth Sherlock in the crowd. Like, people are overjoyed and waving American flags and crying in the middle of St. Peter's Square, and it's an exciting moment, you know? Like, that's the story right there.SHAPIRO: My favorite moment from listening to your live Special Coverage in Rome was when you thanked your Latin teacher at the end.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: I want to thank my high school Latin teacher, Father Robert Cregan (ph), for this moment where we were translating Latin on the radio. Thank you so much for listening. Again, a lot more coverage of this enormous story - I'm Scott Detrow. We will talk to you...Father Cregan - he was my teacher of freshman year Latin. He is no longer with us, but it just jumped into my head. I was like, you know, never before and probably never again is translating Latin something I'm going to be using as part of my job, so I'm just going to take this moment to thank him.SHAPIRO: It was a great moment. Scott, thank you for letting us flip the tables and answering my questions for a change.DETROW: Well, I appreciate it. Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

And then you find out that he's an American from Chicago. I heard that moment in your voice on the air.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: Oh, my goodness. The pope is from Chicago. Robert Francis Prevost has been selected as the next pope of the Roman Catholic Church, a 69-year-old...To have the name be announced as American, this suddenly becomes this monumental historical moment for Americans. Never in the history of the church has the Pope been American. And as a Catholic growing up, I was taught it's just never going to happen...SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: ...Because they wouldn't elect an American because America has so much power in the world already. But yeah, it was an exciting moment, and listening back, you could hear that I was excited...SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: ...Because we're in this amazing space at this cool breaking news moment, and I don't know. I was excited to be there.SHAPIRO: I think there's something about live coverage that allows you to get caught up in the moment in a way that is journalistically appropriate, whether you're talking about an inauguration or a new pope or the emotion of a tragedy, if you're covering a war or a natural disaster.DETROW: Yeah.SHAPIRO: Being an unbiased, nonpartisan - use whatever word you want to use - journalist doesn't mean you can't feel the electricity in the room.DETROW: Right.SHAPIRO: And you could really hear that in your voice.DETROW: Yeah. Thank you. And I think that's something that - you and I both feel that way, and I don't know necessarily if people in our positions 20 or 30 years ago felt that way. But I think, like, it's OK to sound human, right? And I think about the fact that last summer, I was in the host chair when the Trump assassination attempt took place. And...SHAPIRO: Right...DETROW: ...The first conversation we had on the line was our colleague Danielle Kurtzleben, who had been in the middle...SHAPIRO: At the rally.DETROW: ...At the rally, ducking under a table, terrified. And the first thing I'm doing is talking to Danielle, and I just like - are you OK?(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: ...Wondering about, like, what might happen next.DETROW: You're in a safe position right now, just to ask that?KURTZLEBEN: Yes, they - people are streaming by. Most in the crowd have already left. The leaving started pretty immediately.DETROW: Then we were doing interviews with people who had been in the crowd with their children. I think just, like, letting your humanity show through and being empathetic is important.SHAPIRO: Do you remember the first time you ever did live special coverage?DETROW: Yes, and it was totally terrifying. It's something of a...SHAPIRO: I often find it totally terrifying.DETROW: I've always been attracted to it. Of all the things that broadcast news (ph), Special Coverage has been the most exciting to me. I actually remember listening to you do it for Arab Spring at one point. You were, like, filling in...SHAPIRO: Oh, wow.DETROW: ...On Talk Of The Nation, and I had a long car drive.SHAPIRO: Talk Of The Nation - that's a throwback. Yeah.DETROW: And you were doing it...SHAPIRO: Years ago.DETROW: ...For hours. And it just - you know, it was always cool as a listener for me to think about those moments. And the first time I got a chance to, I was actually pretty new at NPR. We were going to simulcast a PBS presidential debate, and all I had to do was talk for a minute because it was - you know, it started at, like,10:01.SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: Right? And the mic opened...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...At 10 o'clock. And I still remember the feeling of just, like, my throat going down to my toes and...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...Back up.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: From NPR News, this is special coverage of the PBS NewsHour Democratic primary debate. I'm Scott Detrow. In a moment, we expect former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Senator Bernie...And I don't think I sound as bad as I think I sounded, but just, like, you're listening to live Special Coverage  - just because, like, the - there - usually, there's no script at all, you know?SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: And over time, I've gotten more comfortable with that, and I kind of enjoy the adrenaline rush of that.SHAPIRO: You said it's your favorite thing. Why?DETROW: You know, I've always wanted to be a reporter. I think I've always wanted to be a broadcast journalist. I actually come from a family of broadcast journalists.

Like, people are overjoyed and waving American flags and crying in the middle of St. Peter's Square, and it's an exciting moment, you know? Like, that's the story right there.SHAPIRO: My favorite moment from listening to your live Special Coverage in Rome was when you thanked your Latin teacher at the end.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: I want to thank my high school Latin teacher, Father Robert Cregan (ph), for this moment where we were translating Latin on the radio. Thank you so much for listening. Again, a lot more coverage of this enormous story - I'm Scott Detrow. We will talk to you...Father Cregan - he was my teacher of freshman year Latin. He is no longer with us, but it just jumped into my head. I was like, you know, never before and probably never again is translating Latin something I'm going to be using as part of my job, so I'm just going to take this moment to thank him.SHAPIRO: It was a great moment. Scott, thank you for letting us flip the tables and answering my questions for a change.DETROW: Well, I appreciate it. Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Robert Francis Prevost has been selected as the next pope of the Roman Catholic Church, a 69-year-old...To have the name be announced as American, this suddenly becomes this monumental historical moment for Americans. Never in the history of the church has the Pope been American. And as a Catholic growing up, I was taught it's just never going to happen...SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: ...Because they wouldn't elect an American because America has so much power in the world already. But yeah, it was an exciting moment, and listening back, you could hear that I was excited...SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: ...Because we're in this amazing space at this cool breaking news moment, and I don't know. I was excited to be there.SHAPIRO: I think there's something about live coverage that allows you to get caught up in the moment in a way that is journalistically appropriate, whether you're talking about an inauguration or a new pope or the emotion of a tragedy, if you're covering a war or a natural disaster.DETROW: Yeah.SHAPIRO: Being an unbiased, nonpartisan - use whatever word you want to use - journalist doesn't mean you can't feel the electricity in the room.DETROW: Right.SHAPIRO: And you could really hear that in your voice.DETROW: Yeah. Thank you. And I think that's something that - you and I both feel that way, and I don't know necessarily if people in our positions 20 or 30 years ago felt that way. But I think, like, it's OK to sound human, right? And I think about the fact that last summer, I was in the host chair when the Trump assassination attempt took place. And...SHAPIRO: Right...DETROW: ...The first conversation we had on the line was our colleague Danielle Kurtzleben, who had been in the middle...SHAPIRO: At the rally.DETROW: ...At the rally, ducking under a table, terrified. And the first thing I'm doing is talking to Danielle, and I just like - are you OK?(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: ...Wondering about, like, what might happen next.DETROW: You're in a safe position right now, just to ask that?KURTZLEBEN: Yes, they - people are streaming by. Most in the crowd have already left. The leaving started pretty immediately.DETROW: Then we were doing interviews with people who had been in the crowd with their children. I think just, like, letting your humanity show through and being empathetic is important.SHAPIRO: Do you remember the first time you ever did live special coverage?DETROW: Yes, and it was totally terrifying. It's something of a...SHAPIRO: I often find it totally terrifying.DETROW: I've always been attracted to it. Of all the things that broadcast news (ph), Special Coverage has been the most exciting to me. I actually remember listening to you do it for Arab Spring at one point. You were, like, filling in...SHAPIRO: Oh, wow.DETROW: ...On Talk Of The Nation, and I had a long car drive.SHAPIRO: Talk Of The Nation - that's a throwback. Yeah.DETROW: And you were doing it...SHAPIRO: Years ago.DETROW: ...For hours. And it just - you know, it was always cool as a listener for me to think about those moments. And the first time I got a chance to, I was actually pretty new at NPR. We were going to simulcast a PBS presidential debate, and all I had to do was talk for a minute because it was - you know, it started at, like,10:01.SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: Right? And the mic opened...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...At 10 o'clock. And I still remember the feeling of just, like, my throat going down to my toes and...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...Back up.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: From NPR News, this is special coverage of the PBS NewsHour Democratic primary debate. I'm Scott Detrow. In a moment, we expect former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Senator Bernie...And I don't think I sound as bad as I think I sounded, but just, like, you're listening to live Special Coverage  - just because, like, the - there - usually, there's no script at all, you know?SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: And over time, I've gotten more comfortable with that, and I kind of enjoy the adrenaline rush of that.SHAPIRO: You said it's your favorite thing. Why?DETROW: You know, I've always wanted to be a reporter. I think I've always wanted to be a broadcast journalist. I actually come from a family of broadcast journalists. My dad was a longtime radio news anchor. My uncle was a longtime DJ in San Diego. So, like, just, like, talking into microphones is a big part of my family.And I think, like, growing up as I first started to get interested in it, like, those big moments where the TV anchors are bringing you through an election or a big breaking story was always exciting to me. As I got older, I would - I'll admit to being a nerd and, like, pulling up YouTube clips of kind of, like, live special coverage through the years of...SHAPIRO: Wow.DETROW: ...Big breaking stories and just kind of, like, watching it to see - especially as I started doing it - to see, like, how the anchors or hosts handle one moment or the other, like, the idea that you don't have a safety net, and you don't have a script in front of you, and it's kind of up to you to think on your feet and kind of bring the audience along with you.I like putting myself in the audience's shoes and asking - sometimes just stopping a reporter and asking a really, really basic question because I'm thinking of, like, what does the person totally fresh to the story need to know? And I think just, like, not being afraid to ask a really basic question. I think sometimes we want to, like, try and impress the people who are listening or who we're interviewing. And I think, like, usually with Special Coverage, the most basic question is, what's happening? Why is that happening? Who is this person? Rinse and repeat.SHAPIRO: What are you seeing? Yeah.DETROW: Yeah, what are you seeing? Tell us what's in front of your eyes, especially for something like that. Like, what are you seeing? And then we go to Ruth Sherlock in the crowd.

But I think, like, it's OK to sound human, right? And I think about the fact that last summer, I was in the host chair when the Trump assassination attempt took place. And...SHAPIRO: Right...DETROW: ...The first conversation we had on the line was our colleague Danielle Kurtzleben, who had been in the middle...SHAPIRO: At the rally.DETROW: ...At the rally, ducking under a table, terrified. And the first thing I'm doing is talking to Danielle, and I just like - are you OK?(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: ...Wondering about, like, what might happen next.DETROW: You're in a safe position right now, just to ask that?KURTZLEBEN: Yes, they - people are streaming by. Most in the crowd have already left. The leaving started pretty immediately.DETROW: Then we were doing interviews with people who had been in the crowd with their children. I think just, like, letting your humanity show through and being empathetic is important.SHAPIRO: Do you remember the first time you ever did live special coverage?DETROW: Yes, and it was totally terrifying. It's something of a...SHAPIRO: I often find it totally terrifying.DETROW: I've always been attracted to it. Of all the things that broadcast news (ph), Special Coverage has been the most exciting to me. I actually remember listening to you do it for Arab Spring at one point. You were, like, filling in...SHAPIRO: Oh, wow.DETROW: ...On Talk Of The Nation, and I had a long car drive.SHAPIRO: Talk Of The Nation - that's a throwback. Yeah.DETROW: And you were doing it...SHAPIRO: Years ago.DETROW: ...For hours. And it just - you know, it was always cool as a listener for me to think about those moments. And the first time I got a chance to, I was actually pretty new at NPR. We were going to simulcast a PBS presidential debate, and all I had to do was talk for a minute because it was - you know, it started at, like,10:01.SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: Right? And the mic opened...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...At 10 o'clock. And I still remember the feeling of just, like, my throat going down to my toes and...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...Back up.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: From NPR News, this is special coverage of the PBS NewsHour Democratic primary debate. I'm Scott Detrow. In a moment, we expect former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Senator Bernie...And I don't think I sound as bad as I think I sounded, but just, like, you're listening to live Special Coverage  - just because, like, the - there - usually, there's no script at all, you know?SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: And over time, I've gotten more comfortable with that, and I kind of enjoy the adrenaline rush of that.SHAPIRO: You said it's your favorite thing. Why?DETROW: You know, I've always wanted to be a reporter. I think I've always wanted to be a broadcast journalist. I actually come from a family of broadcast journalists. My dad was a longtime radio news anchor. My uncle was a longtime DJ in San Diego. So, like, just, like, talking into microphones is a big part of my family.And I think, like, growing up as I first started to get interested in it, like, those big moments where the TV anchors are bringing you through an election or a big breaking story was always exciting to me. As I got older, I would - I'll admit to being a nerd and, like, pulling up YouTube clips of kind of, like, live special coverage through the years of...SHAPIRO: Wow.DETROW: ...Big breaking stories and just kind of, like, watching it to see - especially as I started doing it - to see, like, how the anchors or hosts handle one moment or the other, like, the idea that you don't have a safety net, and you don't have a script in front of you, and it's kind of up to you to think on your feet and kind of bring the audience along with you.I like putting myself in the audience's shoes and asking - sometimes just stopping a reporter and asking a really, really basic question because I'm thinking of, like, what does the person totally fresh to the story need to know? And I think just, like, not being afraid to ask a really basic question. I think sometimes we want to, like, try and impress the people who are listening or who we're interviewing. And I think, like, usually with Special Coverage, the most basic question is, what's happening? Why is that happening? Who is this person? Rinse and repeat.SHAPIRO: What are you seeing? Yeah.DETROW: Yeah, what are you seeing? Tell us what's in front of your eyes, especially for something like that. Like, what are you seeing? And then we go to Ruth Sherlock in the crowd. Like, people are overjoyed and waving American flags and crying in the middle of St. Peter's Square, and it's an exciting moment, you know? Like, that's the story right there.SHAPIRO: My favorite moment from listening to your live Special Coverage in Rome was when you thanked your Latin teacher at the end.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: I want to thank my high school Latin teacher, Father Robert Cregan (ph), for this moment where we were translating Latin on the radio. Thank you so much for listening. Again, a lot more coverage of this enormous story - I'm Scott Detrow. We will talk to you...Father Cregan - he was my teacher of freshman year Latin. He is no longer with us, but it just jumped into my head. I was like, you know, never before and probably never again is translating Latin something I'm going to be using as part of my job, so I'm just going to take this moment to thank him.SHAPIRO: It was a great moment. Scott, thank you for letting us flip the tables and answering my questions for a change.DETROW: Well, I appreciate it. Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

As I got older, I would - I'll admit to being a nerd and, like, pulling up YouTube clips of kind of, like, live special coverage through the years of...SHAPIRO: Wow.DETROW: ...Big breaking stories and just kind of, like, watching it to see - especially as I started doing it - to see, like, how the anchors or hosts handle one moment or the other, like, the idea that you don't have a safety net, and you don't have a script in front of you, and it's kind of up to you to think on your feet and kind of bring the audience along with you.I like putting myself in the audience's shoes and asking - sometimes just stopping a reporter and asking a really, really basic question because I'm thinking of, like, what does the person totally fresh to the story need to know? And I think just, like, not being afraid to ask a really basic question. I think sometimes we want to, like, try and impress the people who are listening or who we're interviewing. And I think, like, usually with Special Coverage, the most basic question is, what's happening? Why is that happening? Who is this person? Rinse and repeat.SHAPIRO: What are you seeing? Yeah.DETROW: Yeah, what are you seeing? Tell us what's in front of your eyes, especially for something like that. Like, what are you seeing? And then we go to Ruth Sherlock in the crowd. Like, people are overjoyed and waving American flags and crying in the middle of St. Peter's Square, and it's an exciting moment, you know? Like, that's the story right there.SHAPIRO: My favorite moment from listening to your live Special Coverage in Rome was when you thanked your Latin teacher at the end.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: I want to thank my high school Latin teacher, Father Robert Cregan (ph), for this moment where we were translating Latin on the radio. Thank you so much for listening. Again, a lot more coverage of this enormous story - I'm Scott Detrow. We will talk to you...Father Cregan - he was my teacher of freshman year Latin. He is no longer with us, but it just jumped into my head. I was like, you know, never before and probably never again is translating Latin something I'm going to be using as part of my job, so I'm just going to take this moment to thank him.SHAPIRO: It was a great moment. Scott, thank you for letting us flip the tables and answering my questions for a change.DETROW: Well, I appreciate it. Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

I was excited to be there.SHAPIRO: I think there's something about live coverage that allows you to get caught up in the moment in a way that is journalistically appropriate, whether you're talking about an inauguration or a new pope or the emotion of a tragedy, if you're covering a war or a natural disaster.DETROW: Yeah.SHAPIRO: Being an unbiased, nonpartisan - use whatever word you want to use - journalist doesn't mean you can't feel the electricity in the room.DETROW: Right.SHAPIRO: And you could really hear that in your voice.DETROW: Yeah. Thank you. And I think that's something that - you and I both feel that way, and I don't know necessarily if people in our positions 20 or 30 years ago felt that way. But I think, like, it's OK to sound human, right? And I think about the fact that last summer, I was in the host chair when the Trump assassination attempt took place. And...SHAPIRO: Right...DETROW: ...The first conversation we had on the line was our colleague Danielle Kurtzleben, who had been in the middle...SHAPIRO: At the rally.DETROW: ...At the rally, ducking under a table, terrified. And the first thing I'm doing is talking to Danielle, and I just like - are you OK?(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: ...Wondering about, like, what might happen next.DETROW: You're in a safe position right now, just to ask that?KURTZLEBEN: Yes, they - people are streaming by. Most in the crowd have already left. The leaving started pretty immediately.DETROW: Then we were doing interviews with people who had been in the crowd with their children. I think just, like, letting your humanity show through and being empathetic is important.SHAPIRO: Do you remember the first time you ever did live special coverage?DETROW: Yes, and it was totally terrifying. It's something of a...SHAPIRO: I often find it totally terrifying.DETROW: I've always been attracted to it. Of all the things that broadcast news (ph), Special Coverage has been the most exciting to me. I actually remember listening to you do it for Arab Spring at one point. You were, like, filling in...SHAPIRO: Oh, wow.DETROW: ...On Talk Of The Nation, and I had a long car drive.SHAPIRO: Talk Of The Nation - that's a throwback. Yeah.DETROW: And you were doing it...SHAPIRO: Years ago.DETROW: ...For hours. And it just - you know, it was always cool as a listener for me to think about those moments. And the first time I got a chance to, I was actually pretty new at NPR. We were going to simulcast a PBS presidential debate, and all I had to do was talk for a minute because it was - you know, it started at, like,10:01.SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: Right? And the mic opened...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...At 10 o'clock. And I still remember the feeling of just, like, my throat going down to my toes and...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...Back up.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: From NPR News, this is special coverage of the PBS NewsHour Democratic primary debate. I'm Scott Detrow. In a moment, we expect former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Senator Bernie...And I don't think I sound as bad as I think I sounded, but just, like, you're listening to live Special Coverage  - just because, like, the - there - usually, there's no script at all, you know?SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: And over time, I've gotten more comfortable with that, and I kind of enjoy the adrenaline rush of that.SHAPIRO: You said it's your favorite thing. Why?DETROW: You know, I've always wanted to be a reporter. I think I've always wanted to be a broadcast journalist. I actually come from a family of broadcast journalists. My dad was a longtime radio news anchor. My uncle was a longtime DJ in San Diego.

You were, like, filling in...SHAPIRO: Oh, wow.DETROW: ...On Talk Of The Nation, and I had a long car drive.SHAPIRO: Talk Of The Nation - that's a throwback. Yeah.DETROW: And you were doing it...SHAPIRO: Years ago.DETROW: ...For hours. And it just - you know, it was always cool as a listener for me to think about those moments. And the first time I got a chance to, I was actually pretty new at NPR. We were going to simulcast a PBS presidential debate, and all I had to do was talk for a minute because it was - you know, it started at, like,10:01.SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: Right? And the mic opened...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...At 10 o'clock. And I still remember the feeling of just, like, my throat going down to my toes and...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...Back up.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: From NPR News, this is special coverage of the PBS NewsHour Democratic primary debate. I'm Scott Detrow. In a moment, we expect former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Senator Bernie...And I don't think I sound as bad as I think I sounded, but just, like, you're listening to live Special Coverage  - just because, like, the - there - usually, there's no script at all, you know?SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: And over time, I've gotten more comfortable with that, and I kind of enjoy the adrenaline rush of that.SHAPIRO: You said it's your favorite thing. Why?DETROW: You know, I've always wanted to be a reporter. I think I've always wanted to be a broadcast journalist. I actually come from a family of broadcast journalists. My dad was a longtime radio news anchor. My uncle was a longtime DJ in San Diego. So, like, just, like, talking into microphones is a big part of my family.And I think, like, growing up as I first started to get interested in it, like, those big moments where the TV anchors are bringing you through an election or a big breaking story was always exciting to me. As I got older, I would - I'll admit to being a nerd and, like, pulling up YouTube clips of kind of, like, live special coverage through the years of...SHAPIRO: Wow.DETROW: ...Big breaking stories and just kind of, like, watching it to see - especially as I started doing it - to see, like, how the anchors or hosts handle one moment or the other, like, the idea that you don't have a safety net, and you don't have a script in front of you, and it's kind of up to you to think on your feet and kind of bring the audience along with you.I like putting myself in the audience's shoes and asking - sometimes just stopping a reporter and asking a really, really basic question because I'm thinking of, like, what does the person totally fresh to the story need to know? And I think just, like, not being afraid to ask a really basic question. I think sometimes we want to, like, try and impress the people who are listening or who we're interviewing. And I think, like, usually with Special Coverage, the most basic question is, what's happening? Why is that happening? Who is this person? Rinse and repeat.SHAPIRO: What are you seeing? Yeah.DETROW: Yeah, what are you seeing? Tell us what's in front of your eyes, especially for something like that. Like, what are you seeing? And then we go to Ruth Sherlock in the crowd. Like, people are overjoyed and waving American flags and crying in the middle of St. Peter's Square, and it's an exciting moment, you know? Like, that's the story right there.SHAPIRO: My favorite moment from listening to your live Special Coverage in Rome was when you thanked your Latin teacher at the end.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: I want to thank my high school Latin teacher, Father Robert Cregan (ph), for this moment where we were translating Latin on the radio. Thank you so much for listening. Again, a lot more coverage of this enormous story - I'm Scott Detrow. We will talk to you...Father Cregan - he was my teacher of freshman year Latin. He is no longer with us, but it just jumped into my head. I was like, you know, never before and probably never again is translating Latin something I'm going to be using as part of my job, so I'm just going to take this moment to thank him.SHAPIRO: It was a great moment. Scott, thank you for letting us flip the tables and answering my questions for a change.DETROW: Well, I appreciate it. Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Thank you. And I think that's something that - you and I both feel that way, and I don't know necessarily if people in our positions 20 or 30 years ago felt that way. But I think, like, it's OK to sound human, right? And I think about the fact that last summer, I was in the host chair when the Trump assassination attempt took place. And...SHAPIRO: Right...DETROW: ...The first conversation we had on the line was our colleague Danielle Kurtzleben, who had been in the middle...SHAPIRO: At the rally.DETROW: ...At the rally, ducking under a table, terrified. And the first thing I'm doing is talking to Danielle, and I just like - are you OK?(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: ...Wondering about, like, what might happen next.DETROW: You're in a safe position right now, just to ask that?KURTZLEBEN: Yes, they - people are streaming by. Most in the crowd have already left. The leaving started pretty immediately.DETROW: Then we were doing interviews with people who had been in the crowd with their children. I think just, like, letting your humanity show through and being empathetic is important.SHAPIRO: Do you remember the first time you ever did live special coverage?DETROW: Yes, and it was totally terrifying.

It's something of a...SHAPIRO: I often find it totally terrifying.DETROW: I've always been attracted to it. Of all the things that broadcast news (ph), Special Coverage has been the most exciting to me. I actually remember listening to you do it for Arab Spring at one point. You were, like, filling in...SHAPIRO: Oh, wow.DETROW: ...On Talk Of The Nation, and I had a long car drive.SHAPIRO: Talk Of The Nation - that's a throwback. Yeah.DETROW: And you were doing it...SHAPIRO: Years ago.DETROW: ...For hours. And it just - you know, it was always cool as a listener for me to think about those moments. And the first time I got a chance to, I was actually pretty new at NPR. We were going to simulcast a PBS presidential debate, and all I had to do was talk for a minute because it was - you know, it started at, like,10:01.SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: Right? And the mic opened...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...At 10 o'clock. And I still remember the feeling of just, like, my throat going down to my toes and...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...Back up.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: From NPR News, this is special coverage of the PBS NewsHour Democratic primary debate. I'm Scott Detrow. In a moment, we expect former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Senator Bernie...And I don't think I sound as bad as I think I sounded, but just, like, you're listening to live Special Coverage  - just because, like, the - there - usually, there's no script at all, you know?SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: And over time, I've gotten more comfortable with that, and I kind of enjoy the adrenaline rush of that.SHAPIRO: You said it's your favorite thing. Why?DETROW: You know, I've always wanted to be a reporter. I think I've always wanted to be a broadcast journalist. I actually come from a family of broadcast journalists. My dad was a longtime radio news anchor. My uncle was a longtime DJ in San Diego. So, like, just, like, talking into microphones is a big part of my family.And I think, like, growing up as I first started to get interested in it, like, those big moments where the TV anchors are bringing you through an election or a big breaking story was always exciting to me. As I got older, I would - I'll admit to being a nerd and, like, pulling up YouTube clips of kind of, like, live special coverage through the years of...SHAPIRO: Wow.DETROW: ...Big breaking stories and just kind of, like, watching it to see - especially as I started doing it - to see, like, how the anchors or hosts handle one moment or the other, like, the idea that you don't have a safety net, and you don't have a script in front of you, and it's kind of up to you to think on your feet and kind of bring the audience along with you.I like putting myself in the audience's shoes and asking - sometimes just stopping a reporter and asking a really, really basic question because I'm thinking of, like, what does the person totally fresh to the story need to know? And I think just, like, not being afraid to ask a really basic question. I think sometimes we want to, like, try and impress the people who are listening or who we're interviewing. And I think, like, usually with Special Coverage, the most basic question is, what's happening? Why is that happening? Who is this person? Rinse and repeat.SHAPIRO: What are you seeing? Yeah.DETROW: Yeah, what are you seeing? Tell us what's in front of your eyes, especially for something like that. Like, what are you seeing? And then we go to Ruth Sherlock in the crowd. Like, people are overjoyed and waving American flags and crying in the middle of St. Peter's Square, and it's an exciting moment, you know? Like, that's the story right there.SHAPIRO: My favorite moment from listening to your live Special Coverage in Rome was when you thanked your Latin teacher at the end.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: I want to thank my high school Latin teacher, Father Robert Cregan (ph), for this moment where we were translating Latin on the radio. Thank you so much for listening. Again, a lot more coverage of this enormous story - I'm Scott Detrow. We will talk to you...Father Cregan - he was my teacher of freshman year Latin. He is no longer with us, but it just jumped into my head. I was like, you know, never before and probably never again is translating Latin something I'm going to be using as part of my job, so I'm just going to take this moment to thank him.SHAPIRO: It was a great moment. Scott, thank you for letting us flip the tables and answering my questions for a change.DETROW: Well, I appreciate it. Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

And I think that's something that - you and I both feel that way, and I don't know necessarily if people in our positions 20 or 30 years ago felt that way. But I think, like, it's OK to sound human, right? And I think about the fact that last summer, I was in the host chair when the Trump assassination attempt took place. And...SHAPIRO: Right...DETROW: ...The first conversation we had on the line was our colleague Danielle Kurtzleben, who had been in the middle...SHAPIRO: At the rally.DETROW: ...At the rally, ducking under a table, terrified. And the first thing I'm doing is talking to Danielle, and I just like - are you OK?(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: ...Wondering about, like, what might happen next.DETROW: You're in a safe position right now, just to ask that?KURTZLEBEN: Yes, they - people are streaming by.

We were going to simulcast a PBS presidential debate, and all I had to do was talk for a minute because it was - you know, it started at, like,10:01.SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: Right? And the mic opened...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...At 10 o'clock. And I still remember the feeling of just, like, my throat going down to my toes and...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...Back up.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: From NPR News, this is special coverage of the PBS NewsHour Democratic primary debate. I'm Scott Detrow. In a moment, we expect former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Senator Bernie...And I don't think I sound as bad as I think I sounded, but just, like, you're listening to live Special Coverage  - just because, like, the - there - usually, there's no script at all, you know?SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: And over time, I've gotten more comfortable with that, and I kind of enjoy the adrenaline rush of that.SHAPIRO: You said it's your favorite thing. Why?DETROW: You know, I've always wanted to be a reporter. I think I've always wanted to be a broadcast journalist. I actually come from a family of broadcast journalists. My dad was a longtime radio news anchor. My uncle was a longtime DJ in San Diego. So, like, just, like, talking into microphones is a big part of my family.And I think, like, growing up as I first started to get interested in it, like, those big moments where the TV anchors are bringing you through an election or a big breaking story was always exciting to me. As I got older, I would - I'll admit to being a nerd and, like, pulling up YouTube clips of kind of, like, live special coverage through the years of...SHAPIRO: Wow.DETROW: ...Big breaking stories and just kind of, like, watching it to see - especially as I started doing it - to see, like, how the anchors or hosts handle one moment or the other, like, the idea that you don't have a safety net, and you don't have a script in front of you, and it's kind of up to you to think on your feet and kind of bring the audience along with you.I like putting myself in the audience's shoes and asking - sometimes just stopping a reporter and asking a really, really basic question because I'm thinking of, like, what does the person totally fresh to the story need to know? And I think just, like, not being afraid to ask a really basic question. I think sometimes we want to, like, try and impress the people who are listening or who we're interviewing. And I think, like, usually with Special Coverage, the most basic question is, what's happening? Why is that happening? Who is this person? Rinse and repeat.SHAPIRO: What are you seeing? Yeah.DETROW: Yeah, what are you seeing? Tell us what's in front of your eyes, especially for something like that. Like, what are you seeing? And then we go to Ruth Sherlock in the crowd. Like, people are overjoyed and waving American flags and crying in the middle of St. Peter's Square, and it's an exciting moment, you know? Like, that's the story right there.SHAPIRO: My favorite moment from listening to your live Special Coverage in Rome was when you thanked your Latin teacher at the end.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: I want to thank my high school Latin teacher, Father Robert Cregan (ph), for this moment where we were translating Latin on the radio. Thank you so much for listening. Again, a lot more coverage of this enormous story - I'm Scott Detrow. We will talk to you...Father Cregan - he was my teacher of freshman year Latin. He is no longer with us, but it just jumped into my head. I was like, you know, never before and probably never again is translating Latin something I'm going to be using as part of my job, so I'm just going to take this moment to thank him.SHAPIRO: It was a great moment. Scott, thank you for letting us flip the tables and answering my questions for a change.DETROW: Well, I appreciate it. Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Most in the crowd have already left. The leaving started pretty immediately.DETROW: Then we were doing interviews with people who had been in the crowd with their children. I think just, like, letting your humanity show through and being empathetic is important.SHAPIRO: Do you remember the first time you ever did live special coverage?DETROW: Yes, and it was totally terrifying. It's something of a...SHAPIRO: I often find it totally terrifying.DETROW: I've always been attracted to it. Of all the things that broadcast news (ph), Special Coverage has been the most exciting to me. I actually remember listening to you do it for Arab Spring at one point. You were, like, filling in...SHAPIRO: Oh, wow.DETROW: ...On Talk Of The Nation, and I had a long car drive.SHAPIRO: Talk Of The Nation - that's a throwback.

Yeah.DETROW: Yeah, what are you seeing? Tell us what's in front of your eyes, especially for something like that. Like, what are you seeing? And then we go to Ruth Sherlock in the crowd. Like, people are overjoyed and waving American flags and crying in the middle of St. Peter's Square, and it's an exciting moment, you know? Like, that's the story right there.SHAPIRO: My favorite moment from listening to your live Special Coverage in Rome was when you thanked your Latin teacher at the end.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: I want to thank my high school Latin teacher, Father Robert Cregan (ph), for this moment where we were translating Latin on the radio. Thank you so much for listening. Again, a lot more coverage of this enormous story - I'm Scott Detrow. We will talk to you...Father Cregan - he was my teacher of freshman year Latin. He is no longer with us, but it just jumped into my head. I was like, you know, never before and probably never again is translating Latin something I'm going to be using as part of my job, so I'm just going to take this moment to thank him.SHAPIRO: It was a great moment. Scott, thank you for letting us flip the tables and answering my questions for a change.DETROW: Well, I appreciate it. Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

And the first thing I'm doing is talking to Danielle, and I just like - are you OK?(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: ...Wondering about, like, what might happen next.DETROW: You're in a safe position right now, just to ask that?KURTZLEBEN: Yes, they - people are streaming by. Most in the crowd have already left. The leaving started pretty immediately.DETROW: Then we were doing interviews with people who had been in the crowd with their children. I think just, like, letting your humanity show through and being empathetic is important.SHAPIRO: Do you remember the first time you ever did live special coverage?DETROW: Yes, and it was totally terrifying. It's something of a...SHAPIRO: I often find it totally terrifying.DETROW: I've always been attracted to it. Of all the things that broadcast news (ph), Special Coverage has been the most exciting to me. I actually remember listening to you do it for Arab Spring at one point. You were, like, filling in...SHAPIRO: Oh, wow.DETROW: ...On Talk Of The Nation, and I had a long car drive.SHAPIRO: Talk Of The Nation - that's a throwback. Yeah.DETROW: And you were doing it...SHAPIRO: Years ago.DETROW: ...For hours. And it just - you know, it was always cool as a listener for me to think about those moments. And the first time I got a chance to, I was actually pretty new at NPR. We were going to simulcast a PBS presidential debate, and all I had to do was talk for a minute because it was - you know, it started at, like,10:01.SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: Right? And the mic opened...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...At 10 o'clock. And I still remember the feeling of just, like, my throat going down to my toes and...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...Back up.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: From NPR News, this is special coverage of the PBS NewsHour Democratic primary debate. I'm Scott Detrow. In a moment, we expect former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Senator Bernie...And I don't think I sound as bad as I think I sounded, but just, like, you're listening to live Special Coverage  - just because, like, the - there - usually, there's no script at all, you know?SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: And over time, I've gotten more comfortable with that, and I kind of enjoy the adrenaline rush of that.SHAPIRO: You said it's your favorite thing. Why?DETROW: You know, I've always wanted to be a reporter. I think I've always wanted to be a broadcast journalist. I actually come from a family of broadcast journalists. My dad was a longtime radio news anchor. My uncle was a longtime DJ in San Diego. So, like, just, like, talking into microphones is a big part of my family.And I think, like, growing up as I first started to get interested in it, like, those big moments where the TV anchors are bringing you through an election or a big breaking story was always exciting to me. As I got older, I would - I'll admit to being a nerd and, like, pulling up YouTube clips of kind of, like, live special coverage through the years of...SHAPIRO: Wow.DETROW: ...Big breaking stories and just kind of, like, watching it to see - especially as I started doing it - to see, like, how the anchors or hosts handle one moment or the other, like, the idea that you don't have a safety net, and you don't have a script in front of you, and it's kind of up to you to think on your feet and kind of bring the audience along with you.I like putting myself in the audience's shoes and asking - sometimes just stopping a reporter and asking a really, really basic question because I'm thinking of, like, what does the person totally fresh to the story need to know? And I think just, like, not being afraid to ask a really basic question. I think sometimes we want to, like, try and impress the people who are listening or who we're interviewing.

In a moment, we expect former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Senator Bernie...And I don't think I sound as bad as I think I sounded, but just, like, you're listening to live Special Coverage  - just because, like, the - there - usually, there's no script at all, you know?SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: And over time, I've gotten more comfortable with that, and I kind of enjoy the adrenaline rush of that.SHAPIRO: You said it's your favorite thing. Why?DETROW: You know, I've always wanted to be a reporter. I think I've always wanted to be a broadcast journalist. I actually come from a family of broadcast journalists. My dad was a longtime radio news anchor. My uncle was a longtime DJ in San Diego. So, like, just, like, talking into microphones is a big part of my family.And I think, like, growing up as I first started to get interested in it, like, those big moments where the TV anchors are bringing you through an election or a big breaking story was always exciting to me. As I got older, I would - I'll admit to being a nerd and, like, pulling up YouTube clips of kind of, like, live special coverage through the years of...SHAPIRO: Wow.DETROW: ...Big breaking stories and just kind of, like, watching it to see - especially as I started doing it - to see, like, how the anchors or hosts handle one moment or the other, like, the idea that you don't have a safety net, and you don't have a script in front of you, and it's kind of up to you to think on your feet and kind of bring the audience along with you.I like putting myself in the audience's shoes and asking - sometimes just stopping a reporter and asking a really, really basic question because I'm thinking of, like, what does the person totally fresh to the story need to know? And I think just, like, not being afraid to ask a really basic question. I think sometimes we want to, like, try and impress the people who are listening or who we're interviewing. And I think, like, usually with Special Coverage, the most basic question is, what's happening? Why is that happening? Who is this person? Rinse and repeat.SHAPIRO: What are you seeing? Yeah.DETROW: Yeah, what are you seeing? Tell us what's in front of your eyes, especially for something like that. Like, what are you seeing? And then we go to Ruth Sherlock in the crowd. Like, people are overjoyed and waving American flags and crying in the middle of St. Peter's Square, and it's an exciting moment, you know? Like, that's the story right there.SHAPIRO: My favorite moment from listening to your live Special Coverage in Rome was when you thanked your Latin teacher at the end.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: I want to thank my high school Latin teacher, Father Robert Cregan (ph), for this moment where we were translating Latin on the radio. Thank you so much for listening. Again, a lot more coverage of this enormous story - I'm Scott Detrow. We will talk to you...Father Cregan - he was my teacher of freshman year Latin. He is no longer with us, but it just jumped into my head. I was like, you know, never before and probably never again is translating Latin something I'm going to be using as part of my job, so I'm just going to take this moment to thank him.SHAPIRO: It was a great moment. Scott, thank you for letting us flip the tables and answering my questions for a change.DETROW: Well, I appreciate it. Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Most in the crowd have already left. The leaving started pretty immediately.DETROW: Then we were doing interviews with people who had been in the crowd with their children. I think just, like, letting your humanity show through and being empathetic is important.SHAPIRO: Do you remember the first time you ever did live special coverage?DETROW: Yes, and it was totally terrifying. It's something of a...SHAPIRO: I often find it totally terrifying.DETROW: I've always been attracted to it. Of all the things that broadcast news (ph), Special Coverage has been the most exciting to me. I actually remember listening to you do it for Arab Spring at one point. You were, like, filling in...SHAPIRO: Oh, wow.DETROW: ...On Talk Of The Nation, and I had a long car drive.SHAPIRO: Talk Of The Nation - that's a throwback. Yeah.DETROW: And you were doing it...SHAPIRO: Years ago.DETROW: ...For hours. And it just - you know, it was always cool as a listener for me to think about those moments. And the first time I got a chance to, I was actually pretty new at NPR. We were going to simulcast a PBS presidential debate, and all I had to do was talk for a minute because it was - you know, it started at, like,10:01.SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: Right?

And the mic opened...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...At 10 o'clock. And I still remember the feeling of just, like, my throat going down to my toes and...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...Back up.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: From NPR News, this is special coverage of the PBS NewsHour Democratic primary debate. I'm Scott Detrow. In a moment, we expect former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Senator Bernie...And I don't think I sound as bad as I think I sounded, but just, like, you're listening to live Special Coverage  - just because, like, the - there - usually, there's no script at all, you know?SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: And over time, I've gotten more comfortable with that, and I kind of enjoy the adrenaline rush of that.SHAPIRO: You said it's your favorite thing. Why?DETROW: You know, I've always wanted to be a reporter. I think I've always wanted to be a broadcast journalist. I actually come from a family of broadcast journalists. My dad was a longtime radio news anchor. My uncle was a longtime DJ in San Diego. So, like, just, like, talking into microphones is a big part of my family.And I think, like, growing up as I first started to get interested in it, like, those big moments where the TV anchors are bringing you through an election or a big breaking story was always exciting to me. As I got older, I would - I'll admit to being a nerd and, like, pulling up YouTube clips of kind of, like, live special coverage through the years of...SHAPIRO: Wow.DETROW: ...Big breaking stories and just kind of, like, watching it to see - especially as I started doing it - to see, like, how the anchors or hosts handle one moment or the other, like, the idea that you don't have a safety net, and you don't have a script in front of you, and it's kind of up to you to think on your feet and kind of bring the audience along with you.I like putting myself in the audience's shoes and asking - sometimes just stopping a reporter and asking a really, really basic question because I'm thinking of, like, what does the person totally fresh to the story need to know? And I think just, like, not being afraid to ask a really basic question. I think sometimes we want to, like, try and impress the people who are listening or who we're interviewing. And I think, like, usually with Special Coverage, the most basic question is, what's happening? Why is that happening? Who is this person? Rinse and repeat.SHAPIRO: What are you seeing? Yeah.DETROW: Yeah, what are you seeing? Tell us what's in front of your eyes, especially for something like that. Like, what are you seeing? And then we go to Ruth Sherlock in the crowd. Like, people are overjoyed and waving American flags and crying in the middle of St. Peter's Square, and it's an exciting moment, you know? Like, that's the story right there.SHAPIRO: My favorite moment from listening to your live Special Coverage in Rome was when you thanked your Latin teacher at the end.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: I want to thank my high school Latin teacher, Father Robert Cregan (ph), for this moment where we were translating Latin on the radio. Thank you so much for listening. Again, a lot more coverage of this enormous story - I'm Scott Detrow. We will talk to you...Father Cregan - he was my teacher of freshman year Latin. He is no longer with us, but it just jumped into my head. I was like, you know, never before and probably never again is translating Latin something I'm going to be using as part of my job, so I'm just going to take this moment to thank him.SHAPIRO: It was a great moment. Scott, thank you for letting us flip the tables and answering my questions for a change.DETROW: Well, I appreciate it. Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Of all the things that broadcast news (ph), Special Coverage has been the most exciting to me. I actually remember listening to you do it for Arab Spring at one point. You were, like, filling in...SHAPIRO: Oh, wow.DETROW: ...On Talk Of The Nation, and I had a long car drive.SHAPIRO: Talk Of The Nation - that's a throwback. Yeah.DETROW: And you were doing it...SHAPIRO: Years ago.DETROW: ...For hours. And it just - you know, it was always cool as a listener for me to think about those moments.

As I got older, I would - I'll admit to being a nerd and, like, pulling up YouTube clips of kind of, like, live special coverage through the years of...SHAPIRO: Wow.DETROW: ...Big breaking stories and just kind of, like, watching it to see - especially as I started doing it - to see, like, how the anchors or hosts handle one moment or the other, like, the idea that you don't have a safety net, and you don't have a script in front of you, and it's kind of up to you to think on your feet and kind of bring the audience along with you.I like putting myself in the audience's shoes and asking - sometimes just stopping a reporter and asking a really, really basic question because I'm thinking of, like, what does the person totally fresh to the story need to know? And I think just, like, not being afraid to ask a really basic question. I think sometimes we want to, like, try and impress the people who are listening or who we're interviewing. And I think, like, usually with Special Coverage, the most basic question is, what's happening? Why is that happening? Who is this person? Rinse and repeat.SHAPIRO: What are you seeing? Yeah.DETROW: Yeah, what are you seeing? Tell us what's in front of your eyes, especially for something like that. Like, what are you seeing? And then we go to Ruth Sherlock in the crowd. Like, people are overjoyed and waving American flags and crying in the middle of St. Peter's Square, and it's an exciting moment, you know? Like, that's the story right there.SHAPIRO: My favorite moment from listening to your live Special Coverage in Rome was when you thanked your Latin teacher at the end.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: I want to thank my high school Latin teacher, Father Robert Cregan (ph), for this moment where we were translating Latin on the radio. Thank you so much for listening. Again, a lot more coverage of this enormous story - I'm Scott Detrow. We will talk to you...Father Cregan - he was my teacher of freshman year Latin. He is no longer with us, but it just jumped into my head. I was like, you know, never before and probably never again is translating Latin something I'm going to be using as part of my job, so I'm just going to take this moment to thank him.SHAPIRO: It was a great moment. Scott, thank you for letting us flip the tables and answering my questions for a change.DETROW: Well, I appreciate it. Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Of all the things that broadcast news (ph), Special Coverage has been the most exciting to me. I actually remember listening to you do it for Arab Spring at one point.

Yeah.DETROW: And you were doing it...SHAPIRO: Years ago.DETROW: ...For hours. And it just - you know, it was always cool as a listener for me to think about those moments. And the first time I got a chance to, I was actually pretty new at NPR. We were going to simulcast a PBS presidential debate, and all I had to do was talk for a minute because it was - you know, it started at, like,10:01.SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: Right? And the mic opened...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...At 10 o'clock. And I still remember the feeling of just, like, my throat going down to my toes and...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...Back up.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: From NPR News, this is special coverage of the PBS NewsHour Democratic primary debate. I'm Scott Detrow. In a moment, we expect former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Senator Bernie...And I don't think I sound as bad as I think I sounded, but just, like, you're listening to live Special Coverage  - just because, like, the - there - usually, there's no script at all, you know?SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: And over time, I've gotten more comfortable with that, and I kind of enjoy the adrenaline rush of that.SHAPIRO: You said it's your favorite thing.

And the mic opened...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...At 10 o'clock. And I still remember the feeling of just, like, my throat going down to my toes and...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...Back up.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: From NPR News, this is special coverage of the PBS NewsHour Democratic primary debate. I'm Scott Detrow. In a moment, we expect former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Senator Bernie...And I don't think I sound as bad as I think I sounded, but just, like, you're listening to live Special Coverage  - just because, like, the - there - usually, there's no script at all, you know?SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: And over time, I've gotten more comfortable with that, and I kind of enjoy the adrenaline rush of that.SHAPIRO: You said it's your favorite thing. Why?DETROW: You know, I've always wanted to be a reporter. I think I've always wanted to be a broadcast journalist. I actually come from a family of broadcast journalists. My dad was a longtime radio news anchor. My uncle was a longtime DJ in San Diego. So, like, just, like, talking into microphones is a big part of my family.And I think, like, growing up as I first started to get interested in it, like, those big moments where the TV anchors are bringing you through an election or a big breaking story was always exciting to me. As I got older, I would - I'll admit to being a nerd and, like, pulling up YouTube clips of kind of, like, live special coverage through the years of...SHAPIRO: Wow.DETROW: ...Big breaking stories and just kind of, like, watching it to see - especially as I started doing it - to see, like, how the anchors or hosts handle one moment or the other, like, the idea that you don't have a safety net, and you don't have a script in front of you, and it's kind of up to you to think on your feet and kind of bring the audience along with you.I like putting myself in the audience's shoes and asking - sometimes just stopping a reporter and asking a really, really basic question because I'm thinking of, like, what does the person totally fresh to the story need to know? And I think just, like, not being afraid to ask a really basic question. I think sometimes we want to, like, try and impress the people who are listening or who we're interviewing. And I think, like, usually with Special Coverage, the most basic question is, what's happening? Why is that happening? Who is this person? Rinse and repeat.SHAPIRO: What are you seeing? Yeah.DETROW: Yeah, what are you seeing? Tell us what's in front of your eyes, especially for something like that. Like, what are you seeing? And then we go to Ruth Sherlock in the crowd. Like, people are overjoyed and waving American flags and crying in the middle of St. Peter's Square, and it's an exciting moment, you know? Like, that's the story right there.SHAPIRO: My favorite moment from listening to your live Special Coverage in Rome was when you thanked your Latin teacher at the end.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: I want to thank my high school Latin teacher, Father Robert Cregan (ph), for this moment where we were translating Latin on the radio. Thank you so much for listening. Again, a lot more coverage of this enormous story - I'm Scott Detrow. We will talk to you...Father Cregan - he was my teacher of freshman year Latin. He is no longer with us, but it just jumped into my head. I was like, you know, never before and probably never again is translating Latin something I'm going to be using as part of my job, so I'm just going to take this moment to thank him.SHAPIRO: It was a great moment. Scott, thank you for letting us flip the tables and answering my questions for a change.DETROW: Well, I appreciate it. Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

And I still remember the feeling of just, like, my throat going down to my toes and...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...Back up.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: From NPR News, this is special coverage of the PBS NewsHour Democratic primary debate. I'm Scott Detrow. In a moment, we expect former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Senator Bernie...And I don't think I sound as bad as I think I sounded, but just, like, you're listening to live Special Coverage  - just because, like, the - there - usually, there's no script at all, you know?SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: And over time, I've gotten more comfortable with that, and I kind of enjoy the adrenaline rush of that.SHAPIRO: You said it's your favorite thing. Why?DETROW: You know, I've always wanted to be a reporter. I think I've always wanted to be a broadcast journalist. I actually come from a family of broadcast journalists. My dad was a longtime radio news anchor. My uncle was a longtime DJ in San Diego. So, like, just, like, talking into microphones is a big part of my family.And I think, like, growing up as I first started to get interested in it, like, those big moments where the TV anchors are bringing you through an election or a big breaking story was always exciting to me. As I got older, I would - I'll admit to being a nerd and, like, pulling up YouTube clips of kind of, like, live special coverage through the years of...SHAPIRO: Wow.DETROW: ...Big breaking stories and just kind of, like, watching it to see - especially as I started doing it - to see, like, how the anchors or hosts handle one moment or the other, like, the idea that you don't have a safety net, and you don't have a script in front of you, and it's kind of up to you to think on your feet and kind of bring the audience along with you.I like putting myself in the audience's shoes and asking - sometimes just stopping a reporter and asking a really, really basic question because I'm thinking of, like, what does the person totally fresh to the story need to know? And I think just, like, not being afraid to ask a really basic question. I think sometimes we want to, like, try and impress the people who are listening or who we're interviewing. And I think, like, usually with Special Coverage, the most basic question is, what's happening? Why is that happening? Who is this person? Rinse and repeat.SHAPIRO: What are you seeing? Yeah.DETROW: Yeah, what are you seeing? Tell us what's in front of your eyes, especially for something like that. Like, what are you seeing? And then we go to Ruth Sherlock in the crowd. Like, people are overjoyed and waving American flags and crying in the middle of St. Peter's Square, and it's an exciting moment, you know? Like, that's the story right there.SHAPIRO: My favorite moment from listening to your live Special Coverage in Rome was when you thanked your Latin teacher at the end.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: I want to thank my high school Latin teacher, Father Robert Cregan (ph), for this moment where we were translating Latin on the radio. Thank you so much for listening. Again, a lot more coverage of this enormous story - I'm Scott Detrow. We will talk to you...Father Cregan - he was my teacher of freshman year Latin. He is no longer with us, but it just jumped into my head. I was like, you know, never before and probably never again is translating Latin something I'm going to be using as part of my job, so I'm just going to take this moment to thank him.SHAPIRO: It was a great moment. Scott, thank you for letting us flip the tables and answering my questions for a change.DETROW: Well, I appreciate it. Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Scott, thank you for letting us flip the tables and answering my questions for a change.DETROW: Well, I appreciate it. Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

And I still remember the feeling of just, like, my throat going down to my toes and...SHAPIRO: Yeah.DETROW: ...Back up.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: From NPR News, this is special coverage of the PBS NewsHour Democratic primary debate. I'm Scott Detrow. In a moment, we expect former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Senator Bernie...And I don't think I sound as bad as I think I sounded, but just, like, you're listening to live Special Coverage  - just because, like, the - there - usually, there's no script at all, you know?SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: And over time, I've gotten more comfortable with that, and I kind of enjoy the adrenaline rush of that.SHAPIRO: You said it's your favorite thing. Why?DETROW: You know, I've always wanted to be a reporter. I think I've always wanted to be a broadcast journalist. I actually come from a family of broadcast journalists. My dad was a longtime radio news anchor. My uncle was a longtime DJ in San Diego. So, like, just, like, talking into microphones is a big part of my family.And I think, like, growing up as I first started to get interested in it, like, those big moments where the TV anchors are bringing you through an election or a big breaking story was always exciting to me. As I got older, I would - I'll admit to being a nerd and, like, pulling up YouTube clips of kind of, like, live special coverage through the years of...SHAPIRO: Wow.DETROW: ...Big breaking stories and just kind of, like, watching it to see - especially as I started doing it - to see, like, how the anchors or hosts handle one moment or the other, like, the idea that you don't have a safety net, and you don't have a script in front of you, and it's kind of up to you to think on your feet and kind of bring the audience along with you.I like putting myself in the audience's shoes and asking - sometimes just stopping a reporter and asking a really, really basic question because I'm thinking of, like, what does the person totally fresh to the story need to know? And I think just, like, not being afraid to ask a really basic question. I think sometimes we want to, like, try and impress the people who are listening or who we're interviewing. And I think, like, usually with Special Coverage, the most basic question is, what's happening? Why is that happening? Who is this person? Rinse and repeat.SHAPIRO: What are you seeing? Yeah.DETROW: Yeah, what are you seeing? Tell us what's in front of your eyes, especially for something like that. Like, what are you seeing? And then we go to Ruth Sherlock in the crowd. Like, people are overjoyed and waving American flags and crying in the middle of St. Peter's Square, and it's an exciting moment, you know? Like, that's the story right there.SHAPIRO: My favorite moment from listening to your live Special Coverage in Rome was when you thanked your Latin teacher at the end.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: I want to thank my high school Latin teacher, Father Robert Cregan (ph), for this moment where we were translating Latin on the radio. Thank you so much for listening. Again, a lot more coverage of this enormous story - I'm Scott Detrow. We will talk to you...Father Cregan - he was my teacher of freshman year Latin. He is no longer with us, but it just jumped into my head. I was like, you know, never before and probably never again is translating Latin something I'm going to be using as part of my job, so I'm just going to take this moment to thank him.SHAPIRO: It was a great moment.

In a moment, we expect former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Senator Bernie...And I don't think I sound as bad as I think I sounded, but just, like, you're listening to live Special Coverage  - just because, like, the - there - usually, there's no script at all, you know?SHAPIRO: Right.DETROW: And over time, I've gotten more comfortable with that, and I kind of enjoy the adrenaline rush of that.SHAPIRO: You said it's your favorite thing. Why?DETROW: You know, I've always wanted to be a reporter. I think I've always wanted to be a broadcast journalist. I actually come from a family of broadcast journalists. My dad was a longtime radio news anchor. My uncle was a longtime DJ in San Diego. So, like, just, like, talking into microphones is a big part of my family.And I think, like, growing up as I first started to get interested in it, like, those big moments where the TV anchors are bringing you through an election or a big breaking story was always exciting to me. As I got older, I would - I'll admit to being a nerd and, like, pulling up YouTube clips of kind of, like, live special coverage through the years of...SHAPIRO: Wow.DETROW: ...Big breaking stories and just kind of, like, watching it to see - especially as I started doing it - to see, like, how the anchors or hosts handle one moment or the other, like, the idea that you don't have a safety net, and you don't have a script in front of you, and it's kind of up to you to think on your feet and kind of bring the audience along with you.I like putting myself in the audience's shoes and asking - sometimes just stopping a reporter and asking a really, really basic question because I'm thinking of, like, what does the person totally fresh to the story need to know? And I think just, like, not being afraid to ask a really basic question. I think sometimes we want to, like, try and impress the people who are listening or who we're interviewing. And I think, like, usually with Special Coverage, the most basic question is, what's happening? Why is that happening? Who is this person? Rinse and repeat.SHAPIRO: What are you seeing? Yeah.DETROW: Yeah, what are you seeing? Tell us what's in front of your eyes, especially for something like that. Like, what are you seeing? And then we go to Ruth Sherlock in the crowd. Like, people are overjoyed and waving American flags and crying in the middle of St. Peter's Square, and it's an exciting moment, you know? Like, that's the story right there.SHAPIRO: My favorite moment from listening to your live Special Coverage in Rome was when you thanked your Latin teacher at the end.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: I want to thank my high school Latin teacher, Father Robert Cregan (ph), for this moment where we were translating Latin on the radio. Thank you so much for listening. Again, a lot more coverage of this enormous story - I'm Scott Detrow. We will talk to you...Father Cregan - he was my teacher of freshman year Latin. He is no longer with us, but it just jumped into my head. I was like, you know, never before and probably never again is translating Latin something I'm going to be using as part of my job, so I'm just going to take this moment to thank him.SHAPIRO: It was a great moment. Scott, thank you for letting us flip the tables and answering my questions for a change.DETROW: Well, I appreciate it. Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

As I got older, I would - I'll admit to being a nerd and, like, pulling up YouTube clips of kind of, like, live special coverage through the years of...SHAPIRO: Wow.DETROW: ...Big breaking stories and just kind of, like, watching it to see - especially as I started doing it - to see, like, how the anchors or hosts handle one moment or the other, like, the idea that you don't have a safety net, and you don't have a script in front of you, and it's kind of up to you to think on your feet and kind of bring the audience along with you.I like putting myself in the audience's shoes and asking - sometimes just stopping a reporter and asking a really, really basic question because I'm thinking of, like, what does the person totally fresh to the story need to know? And I think just, like, not being afraid to ask a really basic question. I think sometimes we want to, like, try and impress the people who are listening or who we're interviewing. And I think, like, usually with Special Coverage, the most basic question is, what's happening? Why is that happening? Who is this person? Rinse and repeat.SHAPIRO: What are you seeing? Yeah.DETROW: Yeah, what are you seeing? Tell us what's in front of your eyes, especially for something like that. Like, what are you seeing? And then we go to Ruth Sherlock in the crowd. Like, people are overjoyed and waving American flags and crying in the middle of St. Peter's Square, and it's an exciting moment, you know? Like, that's the story right there.SHAPIRO: My favorite moment from listening to your live Special Coverage in Rome was when you thanked your Latin teacher at the end.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)DETROW: I want to thank my high school Latin teacher, Father Robert Cregan (ph), for this moment where we were translating Latin on the radio. Thank you so much for listening. Again, a lot more coverage of this enormous story - I'm Scott Detrow. We will talk to you...Father Cregan - he was my teacher of freshman year Latin. He is no longer with us, but it just jumped into my head. I was like, you know, never before and probably never again is translating Latin something I'm going to be using as part of my job, so I'm just going to take this moment to thank him.SHAPIRO: It was a great moment. Scott, thank you for letting us flip the tables and answering my questions for a change.DETROW: Well, I appreciate it. Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "title": "Sen. Ernst doubles down on bleak response to Medicaid grilling",
    "article_text": "By Alana Wise U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, speaks to reporters as she walks to a Senate luncheons at the U.S. Capitol on Nov. 19, 2024.Kevin Dietsch/Getty Imageshide caption Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst faced intense questioning from her constituents during a Friday town hall, eliciting shouts and boos from community members over her support for President Trump's contentiousOne Big Beautiful Bill Act. One dismissive comment drew particularly intense ire: In response to constituents' concerns over Medicaid cuts, Ernst said, \"We all are going to die.\" The next day, the senator doubled down on her comments in a sarcastic apology video posted to social media. In the video, she appears to be speaking from the grounds of a cemetery. Her original remarks came during a town hall in Butler County, Iowa. The first speaker offered Ernst a softball question, telling the National Guard veteran that his sole request was for her to be the guest speaker at the American Legion for Memorial Day next year. But just minutes into thehour-long session, the tenor quickly shifted. The crowd grew tense and Ernst appeared flip and defensive. Ernst was repeatedly peppered with questions about the thousand-page bill, with many attendees focusing on proposed cuts to safety net programs likeMedicaidandSNAP. Ernst defended the bill, arguing that those eliminated from these programs would be people who were not eligible to benefit from them in the first place. \"When you're arguing about illegals that are receiving Medicaid benefits, 1.4 million (people) … they are not eligible so they will be coming off,\" Ernst said. Someone in the crowd shouted in response: \"People are going to die.\" \"Well, we all are going to die,\" Ernst responded. \"For heaven's sakes, folks,\" she continued with a smile. The crowd, which had already grown hostile to Ernst's tone, erupted in roars of disapproval. The GOP budget package is a sweeping piece of legislation that would provide massive tax cuts to the wealthy and slash funding for social programs including Medicaid and food assistance. A version of the billnarrowly passedin the House earlier this month — eking by with a final vote of 215-214. But the act faces pushback in the Senate over concerns regarding some of the more consequential aspects of the legislation,which include: extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts — with about $3.8 trillion in cuts overall, largely for the nation's top earners; raising the national debt ceiling by $4 trillion; and costly fees on asylum seekers and those who sponsor unaccompanied minors. As written, the bill is projected to add trillions to the nation's debt over the next decade. The bill is now going through the process ofreconciliation— a complicated Senate process that would allow Republicans to avoid a filibuster by Democratic legislators and pass the bill on a simple majority. Back at the Iowa town hall, Ernst continued to spar with voters over her support for these changes. In another heated exchange, a man — who identified himself as a Navy veteran and retired school superintendent — grilled Ernst about Trump's authoritarian style of governing. \"Are you afraid of Trump? Are you corrupt like Trump? Or are you just at the point that you don't care anymore and that's why you don't do anything?,\" the man asked to cheers. Her response set off another round of dissenting yells. \"Obviously I don't agree because I don't think our country is being destroyed,\" she said as the crowd offered shouts in protest. After the event, Ernst posteda messageto social media, appearing unbothered by the turn of events at the town hall. \"Thanks folks for coming out to my town hall in Parkersburg today,\" she wrote. \"I always enjoy hearing from constituents and sharing my work to cut government red tape for you.\" The next day, she appeared to stand firm in her remarks while taking a sarcastic tone a video shared to her Instagram stories. Appearing on camera with what look like tombstones in the background, Ernst said: \"I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely apologize for a statement that I made yesterday at my town hall.\" \"I made an incorrect assumption that everyone in the auditorium understood that yes, we are all going to perish from this Earth,\" she continued, adding that she's glad she didn't have to bring up the subject of the tooth fairy. \"But for those that would like to see eternal and everlasting life, I encourage you to embrace my lord and savior, Jesus Christ,\" she said.

Video shared on social media andlocal newsshows armed and masked agents in full tactical gear swarming the area near a popular Italian restaurant called Buona Forchetta late Friday afternoon. A crowd of people gathers, filming and yelling in protest, surrounding cars and detention vans. Then, a momentary explosion of what appears to be a flash-bang grenade sends smoke floating through the street. A special agent with the Department of Homeland Securitytold NPR member station KPBSthat officials were \"executing a criminal search warrant\" during a workplace raid. Some witnesses in news reports say agents at first handcuffed the entire restaurant crew as they asked for identification. Several workers were ultimately detained, though witness accounts differ on how many. ICE agents used what appeared to be a smoke device to disperse the crowd near Buona Forchetta on Friday.Lara McCaffrey/KPBShide caption DHS' Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, did not immediately respond to NPR's email inquiry Saturday. Neither did the restaurant. One employee cried while speaking with KPBS on Friday as she described how federal agents handcuffed her coworkers in the restaurant, just before it was scheduled to open. The crowd of locals at one point blocked an unmarked DHS vehicle from leaving a nearby intersection; they shouted profanities and called agents fascists. Agents sounded sirens, then deployed what KPBS described as a smoke device to disperse the crowd. The San Diego Police Department told NPR in a statement that it was asked to assist at the scene of Friday's workplace raid, but that federal agents had left the area prior to their arrival, and that SDPD officers \"did not ultimately provide any assistance or take enforcement action.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

Within an hour of touching down at Chopin Airport in mid-April, I found myself here along the centuries-old Krakowskie Przedmieście street, among the flag-waving supporters of Poland's conservative and nationalist Law and Justice Party, known by its acronym PiS. I have been to many events like this one over the past several years of covering Poland, but I had never been among so many red and white Polish flags. As I elbowed my way through the thousands of marchers, dozens of flags caressed my face and hair, and one managed to cover my head for several seconds, temporarily blinding me as the chanting crowd moved around me. They'd come here to celebrate the 1,000th anniversary of the coronation of Poland's first king, Bolesław the Brave. Many were exhibiting next-level patriotism, wearing traditional, colorfully embroidered costumes and fur hats — symbols that seemed to serve, on this day, the political message about the importance of national identity delivered by the presidential candidate they'd come to see ahead of one of their most important elections in a generation.

Hadeel Al-Shalchi Palestinians inspect the rubble following Israeli strikes on in Gaza City on Saturday.Omar Al-Qattaa/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption Hamas released a statement Saturday saying it sent mediators its response to the U.S. proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza. While the militant group says it will release 10 living and 18 deceased hostages still held in Gaza, there appear to be other details that need to be worked out before a ceasefire is declared. Earlier this week,U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoffproposed the deal, which includes a 60-day ceasefire. Israel had accepted Witkoff's proposal. But it is not a done deal. Hamas is still seeking other demands, according to reports in Arab and Israeli media. It says it wants a comprehensive withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and a permanent end to the war. More than 54,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel since the war began nearly 20 months ago when Hamas militants attacked Israel, killing about 1,200. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Hegseth says the U.S. will reposition military amid threat from China",
    "article_text": "Anthony Kuhn U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth delivers an address at the Shangri-La Dialogue Summit in Singapore on Saturday.Mohd Rasfan/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption SINGAPORE — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave a starkwarningSaturday about China's threat to the status quo in Asia. He said the U.S. is refocusing its strength and policies on deterring China, and coaxed China's neighbors and U.S. allies to help. \"It has to be clear to all that Beijing is credibly preparing to potentially use military force to alter the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific,\" Hegseth told civilian and military officials at the annual Shangri-La Dialogue, Asia's top defense summit. The U.S. does not seek conflict, nor intend to \"dominate or strangle China, to encircle or provoke,\" Hegseth insisted. \"We do not seek regime change.\" Previous U.S. administrations have offered similar reassurances to Beijing. But retired Chinese Senior Col.Zhou Bo, now a senior fellow at the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University in Beijing, says he thought Hegseth's speech was \"far more hostile than any of his predecessors made at the Shangri-La Dialogue,\" and were infused with \"ideological rivalry.\" Zhou adds that Hegseth's Singapore speech was more supportive of U.S. allies than Vice President Vance's starkly criticalremarksat the Munich Security Conference in February. So, Zhou asks, \"which one should we really believe?\" Hegseth said the U.S. is \"reorienting toward deterring aggression by Communist China.\" One implication of this is that the U.S. couldwithdrawsome of the 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea to deal with China, including in a case of a potential conflict between mainland China and Taiwan, which the Pentagon calls its \"sole pacing scenario.\" The Pentagon says it has no plans to pull its forces out of South Korea, but insists it must have the \"strategic flexibility\" to put troops where it needs them. U.S. interests could diverge from those of South Korea, as the South sees its primary threat coming from North Korea. \"I do think we're likely to see a change in force posture on the peninsula. I think the administration has been starting to signal that pretty openly,\" saysZack Cooper, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, D.C., who was attending the Shangri-La dialogue. \"I think the message from the Trump administration,\" he added, \"is that all that matters is what South Korea does on China. And the reality is that U.S.-South Korea interests go far beyond what South Korea does on China.\" Hegseth's emphasis on U.S. priorities echoed much of President Trump's \"America First\" rhetoric. The defense secretary slammed the Biden administration's policies as \"feckless,\" while praising President Trump's acumen as a dealmaker and efforts to seal its borders to an \"invasion\" of illegal immigrants. \"We are not here to pressure other countries to embrace and adopt our politics or ideology,\" Hegseth told the assembled leaders and military officials. Hegseth conceded that geography makes it necessary for Asian nations to rely on China economically, while seeking defense cooperation with the U.S. \"But beware the leverage that the CCP [Chinese Communist Party] seeks with that entanglement,\" he warned. \"Economic dependence on China only deepens their malign influence and complicates our defense decision space during times of tension.\" Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said his country would remain non-aligned, and against major powers carving out spheres of influence. He said Malaysia would continue to welcome the U.S. presence in the region, but also continue to value it ties with China. \"What Southeast Asia needs is a dynamic equilibrium,\" he said, \"that enables cooperation without coercion, and balance without bloc politics.\" In a speech at the forum the evening before Hegseth spoke, French President Emmanuel Macron offered acritiqueof U.S. policies, and encouraged nations to maintain strategic autonomy amid the U.S.-China rivalry. \"We want to cooperate. But we don't want to be instructed on a daily basis what is allowed, what is not allowed and how our life will change because of the decision of a single person,\" he said, apparently alluding to Trump. Macron also rejected the double standard of rushing to defend Taiwan — a self-governing island that China claims as part of its territory — while abandoning Ukraine, a move which he said would undermine the U.S.' own credibility. China's embassy in Singapore shot back on itsFacebook pagethat \"comparing the Taiwan question with the Ukraine issue is unacceptable,\" as the Taiwan issue is China's internal affair. \"If we use a double standard to look at a double standard,\" it argued, \"we still end up with a double standard.\" in response to Hegseth's remarks, the embassy said ina separate Facebook postthat the U.S. \"claims to safeguard peace and not to seek conflicts. We've heard it. Let's see what moves will it take.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "article_text": "Scott Simon Commuters pause walking past the newly unveiled high relief depicting Soviet dictator Josef Stalin in a passage at Taganskaya metro station in Moscow on May 15, 2025.Alexander Nemenov/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption Comrade Stalin is back — at least underground. A monument to the Soviet dictator, once torn down, has been replicated and reinstalled in a Moscow metro station. The original statue, depicting Joseph Stalin with a wry smile, surrounded by admiring children and worshipful workers, was removed long before the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. It was pulled down in the 60s, after the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev denounced his predecessor at a secret session of the Communist Party and started the long process of \"de-Stalinization\". Joseph Stalin is not remembered for his winning smile. He unleashed the Great Terror of the 1930's, in which hundreds of thousands of Soviet citizens were executed in a political purge. He oversaw the deportation of ethnic minorities his government called \"enemies of the people,\" including Chechens, Ingush, and Crimean Tatars. His policies starved millions of Ukrainians in the Holodomor, the mass famine of 1932 and 33. He annexed the Baltic states and parts of several other neighboring countries. Russian President Vladimir Putin has not been known as a public apologist for Stalin. At the unveiling of the Wall of Sorrow monument in Moscow, which remembers victims of Stalinist purges, Putin said, \"It is very important that we all and future generations…know about, and remember this tragic period in our history…\" Nonetheless, an estimated 105 statues honoring the brutal dictator have been erected since Putin came to power. Britain's Sky Newsreportedthis week that some passersby have left red carnations in front of the new subway Stalin. In a country in which people can pay dearly for speaking out, a woman named Olga told the news agency, \"It's excellent. History of art, culture, significance, beauty.\" But someone identified only as Svetlana asked \"What were they thinking? How many died under his leadership? And suddenly he appears here, this bloodsucker. How is this possible?\" Architectural historian Alexander Zinoviev pointed out that the restored monument does not include several features of the original. He wrote on Telegram that the statue is, \"…more of an ideological gesture than a genuine attempt to restore the historical architectural appearance.\" You might wonder, more than three years into Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, if the vision the Putin regime has for Russia's future is set in the stone of that subway station.

    "article_text": "Also: drumming chimpanzees, picking styles of two jazz greats, and an ancient underground city's soundscape It's a regrettable reality that there is never time to cover all the interesting scientific stories we come across each month. In the past, we've featured year-end roundups ofcool science storieswe (almost) missed. This year, we're experimenting with a monthly collection. May's list includes a nifty experiment to make a predicted effect of special relativity visible; a ping-pong playing robot that can return hits with 88 percent accuracy; and the discovery of the rare genetic mutation that makes orange cats orange, among other highlights. Credit:\n\n          \n          TU Wien Perhaps the most well-known feature of Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity is time dilation and length contraction. In 1959, two physicists predicted another feature of relativistic motion: an object moving near the speed of light should also appear to be rotated. It's not been possible to demonstrate this experimentally, however—until now. Physicists at the Vienna University of Technology figured out how to reproduce this rotational effect in the lab using laser pulses and precision cameras, according toa paperpublished in the journal Communications Physics. They found their inspiration in art, specifically an earlier collaboration with an artist named Enar de Dios Rodriguez, who collaborated with VUT and the University of Vienna on a project involving ultra-fast photography and slow light. For this latest research, they used objects shaped like a cube and a sphere and moved them around the lab while zapping them with ultrashort laser pulses, recording the flashes with a high-speed camera. Getting the timing just right effectively yields similar results to a light speed of 2 m/s. After photographing the objects many times using this method, the team then combined the still images into a single image. The results: the cube looked twisted and the sphere's North Pole was in a different location—a demonstration of the rotational effect predicted back in 1959.

Chimpanzees are known to \"drum\" on the roots of trees as a means of communication, often combining that action with what are known as \"pant-hoot\" vocalizations (see above video). Scientists have found that the chimps' drumming exhibits key elements of musical rhythm much like humans, according toa paperpublished in the journal Current Biology—specifically non-random timing and isochrony. And chimps from different geographical regions have different drumming rhythms. Back in 2022, the same team observed that individual chimps had unique styles of \"buttress drumming,\" which served as a kind of communication, letting others in the same group know their identity, location, and activity. This time around they wanted to know if this was also true of chimps living in different groups and whether their drumming was rhythmic in nature. So they collected video footage of the drumming behavior among 11 chimpanzee communities across six populations in East Africa (Uganda) and West Africa (Ivory Coast), amounting to 371 drumming bouts. Their analysis of the drum patterns confirmed their hypothesis. The western chimps drummed in regularly spaced hits, used faster tempos, and started drumming earlier during their pant-hoot vocalizations. Eastern chimps would alternate between shorter and longer spaced hits. Since this kind of rhythmic percussion is one of the earliest evolved forms of human musical expression and is ubiquitous across cultures, findings such as this could shed light on how our love of rhythm evolved.

Montgomery, for instance, didn't use a pick, preferring to pluck the strings with his thumb—a method he developed because he practiced at night after working all day as a machinist and didn't want to wake his children or neighbors. Pass developed his own range of picking techniques, including fingerpicking, hybrid picking, and \"flat picking.\" Chirag Gokani and Preston Wilson, both with Applied Research Laboratories and the University of Texas, Austin, greatly admired both Pass and Montgomery and decided to explore the underlying the acoustics of their distinctive playing, modeling the interactions of the thumb, fingers, and pick with a guitar string. Theydescribedtheir research duringa meetingof the Acoustical Society of America in New Orleans, LA. Among their findings: Montgomery achieved his warm tone by playing closer to the bridge and mostly plucking at the string. Pass's rich tone arose from a combination of using a pick and playing closer to the guitar neck. There were also differences in how much a thumb, finger, and pick slip off the string:  use of the thumb (Montgomery) produced more of a \"pluck\" compared to the pick (Pass), which produced more of a \"strike.\" Gokani and Wilson think their model could be used to synthesize digital guitars with a more realistic sound, as well as helping guitarists better emulate Pass and Montgomery.

It was later expanded to include four main ventilation channels (and some 50,000 smaller shafts) serving seven levels, which could be closed off from the inside with a large rolling stone. The city could hold up to 20,000 people and it  was connected to another underground city, Kaymakli, via tunnels. Derinkuyu helped protect Arab Muslims during the Arab-Byzantine wars, served as a refuge from the Ottomans in the 14th century, and as a haven for Armenians escaping persecution in the early 20th century, among other functions. The tunnels were rediscovered in the 1960s and about half of the city has been open to visitors since 2016. The site is naturally of great archaeological interest, but there has been little to no research on the acoustics of the site, particularly the ventilation channels—one of Derinkuyu's most unique features, according to Sezin Nas, an architectural acoustician at Istanbul Galata University in Turkey.  She gavea talkata meetingof the Acoustical Society of America in New Orleans, LA, about her work on the site's acoustic environment. Nas analyzed a church, a living area, and a kitchen, measuring sound sources and reverberation patterns, among other factors, to create a 3D virtual soundscape. The hope is that a better understanding of this aspect of Derinkuyu could improve the design of future underground urban spaces—as well as one day using her virtual soundscape to enable visitors to experience the sounds of the city themselves. Robots playing ping-pong have been a thing since the 1980s, of particular interest to scientists because it requires the robot to combine the slow, precise ability to grasp and pick up objects with dynamic, adaptable locomotion. Such robots need high-speed machine vision, fast motors and actuators, precise control, and the ability to make accurate predictions in real time, not to mention being able to develop a game strategy. More recent designs use AI techniques to allow the robots to \"learn\" from prior data to improve their performance. MIT researchers have built their own version of a ping-pong playing robot, incorporating a lightweight design and the ability to precisely return shots. They built on prior work developing the Humanoid, a small bipedal two-armed robot—specifically, modifying the Humanoid's arm by adding an extra degree of freedom to the wrist so the robot could control a ping-pong paddle. They tested their robot by mounting it on a ping-pong table and lobbing 150 balls at it from the other side of the table, capturing the action with high-speed cameras. The new bot can execute three different swing types (loop, drive, and chip) and during the trial runs it returned the ball with impressive accuracy across all three types: 88.4 percent, 89.2 percent, and 87.5 percent, respectively. Subsequent tweaks to theirrystem brought the robot's strike speed up to 19 meters per second (about 42 MPH), close to the 12 to 25 meters per second of advanced human players. The addition of control algorithms gave the robot the ability to aim. The robot still has limited mobility and reach because it has to be fixed to the ping-pong table but the MIT researchers plan to rig it to a gantry or wheeled platform in the future to address that shortcoming.

Sure, lots of animals have orange, ginger, or yellow hues, like tigers, orangutans, and golden retrievers. But in domestic cats that color is specifically linked to sex. Almost all orange cats are male. Scientists have now identified the genetic mutation responsible and it appears to be unique to cats, according toa paperpublished in the journal Current Biology. Prior work had narrowed down the region on the X chromosome most likely to contain the relevant mutation. The scientists knew that females usually have just one copy of the mutation and in that case have tortoiseshell (partially orange) coloring, although in rare cases, a female cat will be orange if both X chromosomes have the mutation. Over the last five to ten years, there has been an explosion in genome resources (including complete sequenced genomes) for cats which greatly aided the team's research, along with taking additional DNA samples from cats at spay and neuter clinics. From an initial pool of 51 candidate variants, the scientists narrowed it down to three genes, only one of which was likely to play any role in gene regulation: Arhgap36. It wasn't known to play any role in pigment cells in humans, mice, or non-orange cats. But orange cats are special; their mutation (sex-linked orange) turns on Arhgap36 expression in pigment cells (and only pigment cells), thereby interfering with the molecular pathway that controls coat color in other orange-shaded mammals. The scientists suggest that this is an example of how genes can acquire new functions, thereby enabling species to better adapt and evolve.

Credit:\n\n          \n          Martin Smith In 1936, archaeologists excavating the Iron Age hill fort Maiden Castle in the UK unearthed dozens of human skeletons, all showing signs of lethal injuries to the head and upper body—likely inflicted with weaponry. At the time, this was interpreted as evidence of a pitched battle between the Britons of the local Durotriges tribe and invading Romans. The Romans slaughtered the native inhabitants, thereby bringing a sudden violent end to the Iron Age. At least that's the popular narrative that has prevailed ever since in countless popular articles, books, and documentaries. Buta paperpublished in the Oxford Journal of Archaeology calls that narrative into question. Archaeologists at Bournemouth University have re-analyzed those burials, incorporating radiocarbon dating into their efforts. They concluded that those individuals didn't die in a single brutal battle. Rather, it was Britons killing other Britons over multiple generations between the first century BCE and the first century CE—most likely in periodic localized outbursts of violence in the lead-up to the Roman conquest of Britain. It's possible there are still many human remains waiting to be discovered at the site, which could shed further light on what happened at Maiden Castle.

    "title": "Trump pulls Isaacman nomination for space. Source: “NASA is f***ed”",
    "article_text": "\"NASA's budget request is just a going-out-of-business mode\" without Isaacman. The Trump administration has confirmed that it is pulling the nomination of private astronaut Jared Isaacman to lead NASA. First reportedby Semafor, the decision appears to have been made because Isaacman was not politically loyal enough to the Trump Administration. \"The Administrator of NASA will help lead humanity into space and execute President Trump’s bold mission of planting the American flag on the planet Mars,\" Liz Huston, a White House Spokesperson, said in a statement released Saturday. \"It's essential that the next leader of NASA is in complete alignment with President Trump’s America First agenda and a replacement will be announced directly by President Trump soon.\" The US Senate Commerce Committeeapproved Issacman's nominationby a vote of 19 to 9 one month ago, advancing his candidacy to the floor of the US Senate, with unanimous support from Republicans in that April vote. Approval was anticipated after the Memorial Day holiday. But the tide started to turn against Isaacman late this past week, with the first rumblings of problems coming on Friday, May 30. On Saturday, far-right political activist Laura Loomersaid on X, \"Deep State operatives are trying to derail President Trump’s NASA Administrator pick Jared Isaacman before his Senate confirmation vote this week.\" This was the first public sign that Isaacman's candidacy was imperiled. So what happened? The waters of MAGA run murky, and the political machinations of the Trump administration are abstruse. However, the timing of Isaacman's derailment coincides with the recent departure of SpaceX founder Elon Musk from Washington. Musk had a central role in the Trump Administration during its first four months.In an interview on Tuesday, Musk told Ars that he has now \"significantly\" reduced his involvement in politics. Musk was a key factor behindIsaacman's nomination as NASA administrator, and with his backing, Isaacman was able to skip some of the party purity tests that have been applied to other Trump administration nominees. One mark against Isaacman is that he had recently donated money to Democrats. He also indicated opposition to some of theWhite House's proposed cutsto NASA's science budget. Musk's role in the government was highly controversial, winning him enemies both among opponents of Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" agenda as well as inside the administration. One source told Ars that, with Musk's exit, his opponents within the administration sought to punish him by killing Isaacman's nomination. The loss of Isaacman is almost certainly a blow to NASA, which faces substantial budget cuts. The Trump Administration's budget request for fiscal year 2026,released Friday, seeks $18.8 billion for the agency next year—a 24 percent cut from the agency's budget of $24.8 billion for FY 2025. Isaacman is generally well-liked in the space community and is known to care deeply about space exploration. Officials within the space agency—and the larger space community—hoped that having him as NASA's leader would help the agency restore some of these cuts. Now? \"NASA is f---ed,\" one current leader in the agency told Ars on Saturday. \"NASA's budget request is just a going-out-of-business mode without Jared there to innovate,\" a former senior NASA leader said. The Trump administration did not immediately name a new nominee, but two people told Ars that former US Air Force Lieutenant General Steven L. Kwast may be near the top of the list. Now retired, Kwast has a distinguished record in the Air Force and is politically loyal to Trump and MAGA. However, his background seems to be far less oriented toward NASA's civil space mission and far more focused onseeing space as a battlefield—decidedly not an arena for cooperation and peaceful exploration.

    "title": "Ransomware kingpin “Stern” apparently IDed by German law enforcement",
    "article_text": "BSA names Vi­ta­ly Ni­ko­lae­vich Kovalev is \"Stern,\" the leader of Trickbot. For years, members of the Russian cybercrime cartelTrickbotunleashed a relentless hacking spree on the world. The group attacked thousands of victims, including businesses, schools, and hospitals. “Fuck clinics in the usa this week,” one member wrote ininternal Trickbot messagesin 2020 about a list of 428 hospitals to target. Orchestrated by an enigmatic leader using the online moniker “Stern,” the group of around 100 cybercriminals stole hundreds of millions of dollars over the course of roughly six years. Despite a wave oflaw enforcementdisruptionsand adamagingleak of more than 60,000 internal chat messagesfrom Trickbot and the closely associated counterpart group Conti, the identity of Stern has remained a mystery. Last week, though, Germany’s federal police agency, the Bundeskriminalamt or BKA, and local prosecutorsalleged that Stern’s real-world name is Vi­ta­ly Ni­ko­lae­vich Kovalev, a 36-year-old, 5-foot-11-inch Russian man who cops believe is in his home country and thus shielded from potential extradition. A recently issued Interpolred noticesays that Kovalev is wanted by Germany for allegedly being the “ringleader” of a “criminal organisation.” “Stern’s naming is a significant event that bridges gaps in our understanding of Trickbot—one of the most notorious transnational cybercriminal groups to ever exist,” says Alexander Leslie, a threat intelligence analyst at the security firm Recorded Future. “As Trickbot's ‘big boss’ and one of the most noteworthy figures in the Russian cybercriminal underground, Stern remained an elusive character, and his real name was taboo for years.” Stern has notably seemed to be absent from multiple rounds of Western sanctions and indictments in recent years calling out alleged Trickbot and Conti members. Leslie and other researchers have long speculated to WIRED that global law enforcement may have strategically withheld Stern’s alleged identity as part ofongoing investigations. Kovalev is suspected of being the “founder” of Trickbot and allegedly used the Stern moniker, the BKA said in anonline announcement. “It has long been assumed, based on numerous indications, that ‘Stern’ is in fact Kovalev,” a BKA spokesperson says in written responses to questions from WIRED. They add that “the investigating authorities involved in Operation Endgame were only able to identify the actor Stern as Kovalev during their investigation this year,” referring to amulti-year international effort to identify and disruptcybercriminal infrastructure, known as Operation Endgame. The BKA spokesperson also notes in written statements to WIRED that information obtained through a 2023investigation into the Qakbot malwareas well as analysis of the leakedTrickbot and Conti chats from 2022were “helpful” in making the attribution. They added, too, that the “assessment is also shared by international partners.” The German announcement is the first time that officials from any government have publicly alleged an identity for a suspect behind the Stern moniker. As part of Operation Endgame, BKA’s Stern attribution inherently comes in the context of a multinational law enforcement collaboration. But unlike in other Trickbot- and Conti-related attributions, other countries have not publicly concurred with BKA’s Stern identification thus far. Europol, the US Department of Justice, the US Treasury, and the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office did not immediately respond to WIRED’s requests for comment. Several cybersecurity researchers who have tracked Trickbot extensively tell WIRED they were unaware of the announcement. An anonymous account on the social media platform X recently claimed that Kovalev used the Stern handle and published alleged details about him. WIRED messaged multiple accounts that supposedly belong to Kovalev, according to the X account and a database of hacked and leaked records compiled by District 4 Labs but received no response. Meanwhile, Kovalev’s name and face may already be surprisingly familiar to those who have been following recent Trickbot revelations. This is because Kovalev was jointly sanctioned by theUnited StatesandUnited Kingdomin early 2023 for his alleged involvement as a senior member in Trickbot. He was alsocharged in the USat the time with hacking linked to bank fraud allegedly committed in 2010. The US added him to itsmost-wanted list. In all of this activity, though, the US and UK linked Kovalev to the online handles “ben” and “Bentley.” The 2023 sanctions did not mention a connection to the Stern handle. And, in fact, Kovalev’s 2023 indictment was mainly noteworthy because his use of “Bentley” as a handle was determined to be “historic” and distinct from that ofanother key Trickbot member who also went by “Bentley.” The Trickbot ransomware group first emerged around 2016, after its membersmoved from theDyre malwarethat was disrupted by Russian authorities. Over the course of its lifespan, the Trickbot group—which used its namesake malware, alongside other ransomware variants such as Ryuk, IcedID, and Diavol—increasingly overlapped in operations and personnel with the Conti gang. In early 2022, Conti published a statement backing Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and a cybersecurity researcher who had infiltrated the groupsleaked more than 60,000 messages from Trickbot and Conti members, revealing a huge trove of information about their day-to-day operations and structure. Stern acted like a “CEO” of the Trickbot and Conti groups and ran them like a legitimate company, leaked chat messagesanalyzed by WIREDandsecurity researchersshow. “Trickbot set the mold for the modern ‘as-a-service’ cybercriminal business model that was adopted by countless groups that followed,” Recorded Future’s Leslie says. “While there were certainly organized groups that preceded Trickbot, Stern oversaw a period of Russian cybercrime that was characterized by a high level of professionalization. This trend continues today, is reproduced worldwide, and is visible in most active groups on the dark web.” Stern’s eminence within Russian cybercrime has been widely documented. The cryptocurrency-tracing firm Chainalysis does not publicly name cybercriminal actors and declined to comment on BKA’s identification, but the company emphasized that the Stern persona alone is one of the all-time most profitable ransomware actors it tracks. “The investigation revealed that Stern generated significant revenues from illegal activities, in particular in connection with ransomware,” the BKA spokesperson tells WIRED. Stern “surrounds himself with very technical people, many of which he claims to have sometimes decades of experience, and he’s willing to delegate substantial tasks to these experienced people whom he trusts,” says Keith Jarvis, a senior security researcher at cybersecurity firm Sophos’ Counter Threat Unit. “I think he’s always probably lived in that organizational role.” Increasing evidence in recent years has indicated that Stern has at least some loose connections to Russia’s intelligence apparatus, including its main security agency, the Federal Security Service (FSB). The Stern handle mentioned setting up an office for “government topics” in July 2020, whileresearchers have seenother membersof the Trickbot group say that Stern is likely the “link between us and the ranks/head of department type at FSB.” Stern’s consistent presence was a significant contributor to Trickbot and Conti’s effectiveness—as was the entity’s ability to maintain strong operational security and remain hidden. As Sophos’ Jarvis put it, “I have no thoughts on the attribution, as I’ve never heard a compelling story about Stern’s identity from anyone prior to this announcement.” This story originally appeared onwired.com.

    "title": "Real TikTokers are pretending to be Veo 3 AI creations for fun, attention",
    "article_text": "From music videos to \"Are you a prompt?\" stunts, \"real\" videos are presenting as AI. Since Google released its Veo 3 AI model last week, social media users have been having fun with its ability toquickly generate highly realistic eight-second clips complete with sound and lip-synced dialogue. TikTok's algorithm has been serving me plenty of Veo-generated videos featuringimpossible challenges,fake news reports, and evensurreal short narrative films, to name just a few popular archetypes. However, among all the AI-generated video experiments spreading around, I've also noticed a surprising counter-trend on my TikTok feed. Amid all the videos of Veo-generated avatars pretending to be real people, there are now also a bunch of videos of real people pretending to be Veo-generated avatars. I stumbled on this trend when the TikTok algorithm fed methis videotopped with the extra-large caption \"Google VEO 3 THIS IS 100% AI.\" As I watched and listened to the purported AI-generated band that appeared to be playing in the crowded corner of someone's living room, I read the caption containing the supposed prompt that had generated the clip: \"a band of brothers with beards playing rock music in 6/8 with an accordion.\" After a few seconds of taking those captions at face value, something started to feel a little off. After a few more seconds, I finally noticed the video was posted by Kongos, an indie band that you might recognize fromtheir minor 2012 hit \"Come With Me Now.\"And after a little digging, I discovered the band in the video was actually just Kongos, and the tune wasa 9-year-old songthat the band had dressed up as an AI creation to get attention. Here's the sad thing: It worked! Without the \"Look what Veo 3 did!\" hook, I might have quickly scrolled by this video before I took the time to listen to the (pretty good!) song. The novel AI angle made me stop just long enough to pay attention to a Kongos song for the first time in over a decade. Kongos isn't the only musical act trying to grab attention by claiming their real performances are AI creations. Darden Belapostedthat Veo 3 had \"created a realistic AI music video\" over a clip from what is actuallya 2-year-old music video with some unremarkable special effects. Rapper GameBoi Patdressed up an 11-month-old songwitha new TikTok clipcaptioned \"Google's Veo 3 created a realistic sounding rapper... This has to be real. There's no way it's AI\" (that last part is true, at least). I could go on, but you get the idea. I know it's tough to get noticed on TikTok, and that creators will go to great lengths to gain attention from the fickle algorithm. Still, there's something more than a little off-putting about flesh-and-blood musicians pretending to be AI creations just to make social media users pause their scrolling for a few extra seconds before they catch on to the joke (or don't, based on some of the comments). The whole thing evokes last year's stunt where a couple of podcast hostsreleased a posthumous \"AI-generated\" George Carlin routinebeforeadmitting that it had been written by a humanafter legal threats started flying. As an attention-grabbing stunt, the conceit still works. You want AI-generated content? I can pretend to be that! Some of the most existentially troubling Veo-generated videos floating around TikTok these days center around a gag known as \"the prompt theory.\"These clipsfocus on various AI-generated people reacting to the idea that they are \"just prompts\" with various levels of skepticism, fear, or even conspiratorial paranoia. On the other side of that gag, some humans are making joke videos playing off the idea that they're merely prompts. RedondoKid used the conceitin a basketball trick shot video, saying \"of course I'm going to make this. This is AI, you put that I'm going to make this in the prompt.\" User thisisamurica thanked his faux prompters for putting him in \"a world with such delicious food\" beforetheatrically choking on a forkful of meat. And comedian Drake Cummings developed TikTok skits pretending that it was actually AI video prompts forcing him to indulge in vices likeshots of alcoholoronline gambling(\"Goolgle’s [sic] New A.I. Veo 3 is at it again!! When will the prompts end?!\" Cummings jokes in the caption). Beyond the obvious jokes, though, I've also seen a growing trend of TikTok creators approaching friends or strangers and asking them to react to the idea that \"we're all just prompts.\" The reactions run the gamut from\"get the fuck away from me\"to\"I blame that [prompter], I now have to pay taxes\"tosolipsistic philosophical musings from convenience store employees. I'm loath to call this a full-blown TikTok trend based on a few stray examples. Still, these attempts to exploit the confusion between real and AI-generated video are interesting to see. As one commenter on an \"Are you a prompt?\" ambush video put it: \"New trend: Do normal videos and write 'Google Veo 3' on top of the video.\" The best Veo-related TikTok engagement hack I've stumbled on so far, though, might be the videos that show multiple short clips and ask the viewer to decide which are real and which are fake. One video I stumbled on showsan increasing number of \"Veo 3 Goth Girls\"across four clips, challenging in the caption that \"one of these videos is real... can you guess which one?\" Inanother example, two similar sets of kids are shown hanging out in cars while the caption asks, \"Are you able to identify which scene is real and which one is from veo3?\" After watching both of these videos on loop a few times, I'm relatively (but not entirely) convinced that every single clip in them is a Veo creation. The fact that I watched these videos multiple times shows how effective the \"Real or Veo\" challenge framing is at grabbing my attention. Additionally, I'm still not 100 percent confident in my assessments, which is a testament to just how good Google's new model is at creating convincing videos. There are still some telltale signs for distinguishing a real video from a Veo creation, though. For one, Veo clips are still limited to just eight seconds, so any video that runs longer (without an apparent change in camera angle) is almost certainly not generated by Google's AI. Looking back at a creator's other videos can also provide some clues—if the same person was appearing in \"normal\" videos two weeks ago, it's unlikely they would be appearing in Veo creations suddenly. There's also a subtle but distinctive style to most Veo creations that can distinguish them from the kind of candid handheld smartphone videos that usually fill TikTok. The lighting in a Veo video tends to be too bright, the camera movements a bit too smooth, and the edges of people and objects a little too polished. After you watch enough \"genuine\" Veo creations, you can start to pick out the patterns. Regardless, TikTokers trying to pass off real videos as fakes—even as a joke or engagement hack—is a recognition that video sites are nowdeep in the \"deep doubt\" era, where you have to be extra skeptical of even legitimate-looking video footage. And the mere existence of convincing AI fakes makes it easier than ever to claim real events captured on video didn't really happen, a problem that political scientists callthe liar's dividend. We saw this when then-candidate Trumpaccused Democratic nominee Kamala Harris of \"A.I.'d\" crowdsin real photos of her Detroit airport rally. For now, TikTokers of all stripes are having fun playing with that idea to gain social media attention. In the long term, though, the implications for discerning truth from reality are more troubling. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Chris Hemsworth’s Oddly Timed Thor Video Freaks Out ‘Avengers: Doomsday’ Fans",
    "article_text": "Fans of the MCU are on pins and needles asÂAvengers: DoomsdayÂhas entered production. Therecently delayed filmis bringing back a number of franchise heroes, including Chris Hemsworth’s Thor, who might’ve unintentionally set fans into a tizzy with an innocent video. Earlier this week, the Australia actor published a video looking back on his time as Thor, from 2011’sThorÂ to when we last saw him in 2022’sLove & Thunder. It’s worth noting the video itself is nearly three years old andoriginally publishedbeforeLove’sÂrelease, but what caught viewers’ eye was the description: “Playing Thor has been one of the greatest honors of my life. For the last 15 years I’ve held Mjolnir and then Stormbreaker as the God of Thunder, but what made it truly specialâ¦ was sharing it with all of you. Your passion, your cheers, and your love for this character have meant everything to me. Thank you for making my journey through the Marvel Cinematic Universe unforgettable.. Next up,Doomsday!” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip9UIGStPeU The firstÂThorÂturns 15 in May 2026 (the same month ofÂDoomsday’sÂoriginal release), so most likely, he just accidentally published it way in advance of that milestone. But the description’s wording has longtime fans wondering if this is curtains for the God of Thunder; he’s one of three original Avengers still around and alive, he’s a father, and he’s got Mjolnir again. As the one with the most heroic tenure when we enterÂDoomsday,Âthe thinking seems to be he’s due to go down, same as Tony and Natasha before him. Speaking of Tony, these thoughts are likely enhanced by Robert Downey Jr. playing Doctor Doom, the thinking being someone’s got to be shocked by seeing this villain wear their friend’s face, so why not pull that punch and thenÂ kill off Thor to raise the stakes? Hemsworth himself has been mum on the video at time of writing, and we likely won’t know what awaits Thor untilÂDoomsday. But death’s always the end for the Avengers: Natasha got a final send-off inBlack Widow,Âand Downey andChris Evansare both coming back as other characters. The same could be true for Hemsworth down the line, or maybe we get a fifth solo movie showing if he got up to any Olympian stuff betweenLoveÂandÂDoomsday. Even ifDoomsdaydoes kill him off, it won’t be the last we see of Hemsworthâeven if it’s not ’til he’s 90, we’ll probably see him swing and strike down enemies with Mjolnir or Stormbreaker a few more times.

    "article_text": "With the conclusion of thelatest season ofÂDoctor Who, all eyes are on what’s next for adventures in time and space… and when, exactly, we’ll be getting them. But before the Doctor returns, Earth is going to have to stand alone in a new spinoff miniseries,The War Between Land and the Sea. To mark the climax ofÂDoctor Who‘s 2025 season, today the BBC revealed the first footage fromÂWar Between Land and Sea, which will see UNIT as the front line of defense whenthe Sea Devilsâa race of aquatic reptilians who have existed on Earth since the dawn of time, hiding their advance civilization in hibernation alongside their other distantly affiliated ancient Earth dwellers, the Silurians, for millions of yearsâemerge from hiding and make themselves known to the Human race. How do things go? Well, you could tell by the title of the miniseries alone that the answer to that is seemingly “not well”âand without the Doctor to fall back on like they’ve been able to the last couple of times the Sea Devils and Silurians alike tried to emerge, it’s up to humanity to find away to counter the threat of Earth’s ancient reclaimers… and if not co-exist with them, survive their wrath. War Between Land and the Seawill feature several familiar faces fromÂDoctor Who. There’s a few returning characters, including Jemma Redgrave, Alexander Devrient, and Ruth Madeley reprising their roles in UNIT as Kate Lethbridge-Stewart, Colonel Ibrahim, and Shirley Ann Bingham, respectively. In more of a deep cut, Colin McFarlane will reprise his role as General Austin Pierce from the third season ofTorchwood,ÂChildren of Earth. But, as seen in the trailer above, the series also stars twoÂDoctor Whofavorites, but as entirely new characters.Loki‘s Gugu Mbatha-Rawplayed companion Martha Jones’ sister, Tish, throughout the third season ofDoctor Who, and is now a mysterious vanguard of the Sea Devils’ return, whileBeing Human‘s Russell Tovey previously appeared in the 2007 holiday special “Voyage of the Damned” as Midshipman Alonso Frame, now plays Barclay, a human who has seemingly been tasked with leading humanity’s response. The War Between Land and the Seawill run for five episodes when it hits the BBC in the UK, and Disney+ internationally, and is currently expected to launch sometime in 2026. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "What the Hell Just Happened on ‘Doctor Who’?",
    "article_text": "Doctor Who‘s latest season has just come to an endâand with it, we just got hit with an absolute shocker of a cliffhanger. Let’s discuss, shall we? Preparing to sacrifice himself to shift time and save the young Poppyâa descendant of human and Time Lord biologyâby shunting his regenerative energy into the Time Vortex, “The Reality War” climaxes as the 15th Doctor shuts himself in his TARDIS and flies away from Earth, bracing to give it all. The paradox of time itself splitting apart, however, gives him a helping hand… in the form of none other thanJodie Whittaker’s 13th Doctor. Who doesn’t take much convincing, strewn out of her own timestream by the impending schism, to help this new Doctor say goodbye for the sake of reality. After an emotional farewell where the two of them ruminate on lives cut shortâa pointed nod, perhapsâthe Doctor exposes himself to the TARDIS’ console, practically ripping the regenerative energy out of his own body to blast the time machine. Everything shatters, and the Doctor realises that his time his up. Delaying regeneration as long as possible and finding himself back on Earth, and right in Belinda’s back garden the 15th Doctor starts his long goodbye, realising that he’s managed to save the day and bring Poppy to back to existence. Bidding a tearful goodbye to Belinda and Poppy (who has become human in the process of being restored), the Doctor returns to the TARDIS. Unable to hold it back any longer, the 15th Doctor begins his regeneration, bursting with golden light as he stands leaning out of the TARDIS doors and into the whole universe. He changes. Into a woman. A blonde woman. She looks an awful lotlike Rose Tyler, because Billie Piper is the Doctor. “Oh hello,” the new Doctor says. And that’s howÂDoctor Who‘s current season comes to an end. Just how long we have to wait to see the ramifications of the 16th Doctor’s familiar face remains to be seen. The BBC and Disney have yet to confirm just when, or if,ÂDoctor WhoÂwill return in its current form. There’s probably something to be said with the fact that the episode credits Piper as-is, rather than introducing Billie Piper “as The Doctor”, as is the usual tradition with these things. For what it’s worth, by Ncuti Gatwa and Jodie Whittaker were credited as such, making the absence for Piper stand out all the more. What further complicates things is that this era of the series was already bookended by pretty much identical “stunt” casting: of course, Whittaker’s own Doctor regenerated shockingly in “Power of the Doctor” not into Gatwa,but David Tennant, who returned to play a new, 14th incarnation of the Doctor forÂDoctor Who‘s 60th anniversary specials, before passing the regenerative torch over to Gatwa in the (equally tumultuous)arrival of ‘bi-regeneration’, letting a Time Lord inadvertently split into two bodies in the moment of their regeneration. Neither company has yet to officially confirm future seasons ofÂDoctorWho, although a regeneration, with Piper or otherwise, obviously leaves things open for a new era to begin at some point. Not evena Christmas special for 2025was commissioned, and with the upcoming spinoffWar Between Land and the Seaon the way, it might be a good while yet until we see just what the real deal is here. Regardless though, Ncuti Gatwa’s time onÂDoctor Whohas come to an end… and very uncertain future lies ahead of the TARDIS’ latest inhabitant. We’ll be back on Monday to deliver our full recap of “The Reality War.” In the meantime, let us know what you thought in the comments. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "‘Black Panther’ and Its Team Deserved Better Than This",
    "article_text": "Days ago, the video game sphere was thrown into shock when EA revealed it’d canceledits Black Panther game. The project, announced in2023, was to be the debut of developer Cliffhanger Games, which was headed up by developers who madeMiddle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor.ÂWith its game dead, Cliffhanger’s been shut down, and anyone not transferred elsewhere within EA’s various internal studios has been laid off. At the time of the game’s cancellation, Cliffhanger hadn’t revealed anything aboutÂBlack Panther,Âand all we had to go on was a job listing indicating it’d be a single-player, open-world title. In the wake of the project and studio’s end, we now know some of it would’ve involvedseveral playable charactersâfrom T’Challa to his sister Shuri andson Azariâfighting Skrulls invading Wakanda. This game would’ve featured Skrulls posing as allies and relationships formed between the other non-playable heroes and other NPCs in Wakanda. For all intents and purposes, it was to be similar to the Nemesis System introduced in theMiddle-Earth: Shadowgames. Several alums from Monolith’sLord of the Ringsduology reunited to form Cliffhanger, but EA felt the studio was moving too slow, which came in part because Cliffhanger was building staff alongside its prototypes and builds to show EA how it would all come together. What makes this situation even more sad is how not shocking it is that Black Panther got killed. Last year, EA canceled asingle-playerStar WarsÂFPSfrom Respawn, its own internal studio responsible for the hitÂJediÂgames, and which has also had twoseparate, attemptedspinoffsfor its ownTitanfallÂseries suffer the same fate. This past February, WB Games put the kibosh onits Wonder Woman gamefromÂ Monolith (which also got closed down), and we learned in April of aÂBlade RunnerÂgame that’ll likely never see the light of day.The Last of Us,Spider-Man,Halo;whether it’s a whole game or a specific mode, from an established franchise orsomething new, in development or justrecently came out, the industry has been full of cancellations in recent years, with layoffs following not long after. On the outside looking in, a Black Panther game feels like an easy call to make. Superhero video games are in a good place right now, and this specific character’s been an A-lister since his debut inCaptain America: Civil WarÂin 2016 and his own 2018 movie became amassive, global phenomenon. He’s part of the ever-increasing lineup ofÂMarvel RivalsÂand is set to co-lead Skydance’s 2026-boundMarvel 1943,Âand whether it’d be T’Challa, Shuri, or Azari, the hero has never headlined a game on his lonesome, making EA’s decision to kill it so frustrating. It certainly doesn’t appear to be affecting its three-game deal with Marvel;both companieshave since said the partnership will continue with Motive’s Iron Man game and at least one other project yet to be announced. But in the wake of this news, and EA’s alleged treatment of its original, non-multiplayer franchises likeDragon Age,Âit’s hard to fully buy that either of these projects, or anysingle-player projectat the publisher’s internal teams will come out, which puts the people actually making those games in an unfair light. The games industry’s problems didn’t start with Cliffhanger and Black Panther, and they’ll continue well past this moment in time. But it speaks volumes that an attempted game of this caliber starring a character from one of the biggest media franchises around right now can’t get off the ground and the team behind it is paying for EA’s past, unrelated financial troubles. More than anything, the studio should’ve gotten to have its moment in the sun, as all developers do for the games they’ve spent nearly a decade or less of their lives making. Those opportunities feel like they’re becoming increasingly rarer in this industry, and it won’t be good for anyone should it continue becoming the norm. Want more io9 news?

Special features include standard deleted scenes and behind-the-scenes featurettes on the movie’s music, creature FX, and more. An HBO Max release date wasn’t set. Earlier this week,Sinnersfinally came to the people of Clarksdale, Mississippiâwhere the film takes placeâfollowing a passionate online movement to get it screened in the theaterless town. It’s playing in town six times over a three-day period, and perReuters, WB provided the city’s civic auditorium with a big screen, projector, and sound system. Coogler attended the screening with production staff, including composer Ludwig GÃ¶ransson and actor Miles Caton, who plays Sammie.Â Clarksidale residents and those in the area flocked to see it,Âand “hundreds” came to attend the first screening of day one. Attendees praised the film for its portrayal of their town and the Jim Crow era, and mayor Chuck Espy told Reuters the film’s attention could help draw attention to the town. At time of writing,ÂSinnersÂis still playing in theaters in standard, non-IMAX formats. WB’s not in a rush to pull it from theaters, but you’ll be glad to have it at home once they do.

    "article_text": "Update (5/31/2025 @ 1:23 PM ET):MoreBlack Phone 2teasers have emerged: one, from Derrickson, shows the Grabber’s lair in the original movie has fallen apart since his death. Grafitti on the walls call for him to burn in hell, but the place might not be as abandoned as it seems. Another shows the Grabber’s various masks buried in the ice and someone trying to get at one of them, followed by quick flashes of black balloons, someone struggling inside a van, and a half-burned victim. The two words featured in the teasers are “a” and “dead,” and when put together with the previous ones, it looks like you’ve got the film’s tagline: “Dead is just a word.” pic.twitter.com/zgbYiIGiY3 — N O S â Æ I á´ á´ Æ á¡   â¥ â¥ O Æ S (@scottderrickson)May 31, 2025 More teaser videos for BLACK PHONE 2 just arrived on our phone via a mysterious text message from an unknown number ð± ðpic.twitter.com/4FIYWQQ5c6 — Fandango (@Fandango)May 31, 2025 Original story:In 2022, horror duoScott Derricksonand C. Robert Cargill ofÂSinisterÂfame teamed to adapt Joe Hill’s short storyThe Black Phone. Things wrapped pretty conclusively in that one, but you can’t keep a good Grabber (Ethan Hawke) down it seems, because he’s backin a sequelcoming this fall. The first film saw Finn (Mason Thames) kidnapped by the Grabber and stuck in a room with a rotary phone that could contact ghosts of the killer’s previous victims. With their help, Finn killed the Grabber and reunited with his family. In anticipation forBlack Phone 2, Blumhouse’s released three teasers that let you know the Grabber’s returned and set his sights on kids at Colorado’s Alpine Lake Youth Camp during the winter. âThe phone is ringing again. Are you going to answer?â We just got a text that included the first tease for BLACK PHONE 2!

(One victim’s left in the ice, another folded under a bed, and the third has half his face burned and appears throughout all of them, either looking at the camera or appearing and disappearing without a word.) Each teaser also has a single word flash onscreen, which spell out the phrase “Word is Just.” Finally, there’s a phone booth somewhere on the premises with its own black phone, which keeps ringing and is waiting for someone to answer. Back at April’sCinemaCon, Universal showed offÂBlack Phone 2Âfootage teasing the Grabber is using the titular phone to come back and haunt the surviving kids from the previous movie. If that’s the case, he certainly hasn’t lost a step, and we’ll find out what other tricks he’s got up his sleeve when the film releases October 17. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "A Brief History of Our Obsession With Prime Numbers—and Where the Hunt Goes Next",
    "article_text": "A shard of smooth bone etched with irregular marks dating back 20,000 years puzzled archaeologists until they noticed something unique â the etchings, lines like tally marks, may haverepresented prime numbers. Similarly, aclay tablet from 1800 B.C.E.inscribed with Babylonian numbers describes a number system built on prime numbers. As the Ishango bone, the Plimpton 322 tablet and other artifacts throughout history display, prime numbers have fascinated and captivated people throughout history. Today, prime numbers and their properties are studied innumber theory, a branch of mathematics and active area of research today. Informally, a positive counting number larger than oneis primeif that number of dots can be arranged only into a rectangular array with one column or one row. For example, 11 is a prime number since 11 dots form only rectangular arrays of sizes 1 by 11 and 11 by 1. Conversely, 12 is not prime since you can use 12 dots to make an array of 3 by 4 dots, with multiple rows and multiple columns. Math textbooks define a prime number as a whole number greater than one whose only positive divisors are only 1 and itself. Math historian Peter S. Rudman suggests thatGreek mathematicianswere likely the first to understand the concept of prime numbers, around 500 B.C.E. Around 300 B.C.E., the Greek mathematician and logician Euler proved that there areinfinitely many prime numbers. Euler began by assuming that there is a finite number of primes. Then he came up with a prime that was not on the original list to create a contradiction. Since a fundamental principle of mathematics is being logically consistent with no contradictions, Euler then concluded that his original assumption must be false. So, there are infinitely many primes. The argument established the existence of infinitely many primes, however it was not particularly constructive. Euler had no efficient method to list all the primes in an ascending list. In the middle ages, Arab mathematicians advanced the Greeksâ theory of prime numbers, referred to as hasam numbers during this time. The Persian mathematicianKamal al-Din al-Farisiformulated the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which states that any positive integer larger than one can be expressed uniquely as a product of primes. From this view, prime numbers are the basic building blocks for constructing any positive whole number using multiplication â akin to atoms combining to make molecules in chemistry. Prime numbers can be sorted into different types. In 1202,Leonardo Fibonacciintroduced in his book âLiber Abaci: Book of Calculationâ prime numbers of the form (2p– 1) where p is also prime. Today, primes in this form are calledMersenne primesafter the French monkMarin Mersenne. Many of the largest known primes follow this format. Several early mathematicians believed that a number of the form (2pâ 1) is prime whenever p is prime. But in 1536,mathematician Hudalricus Regius noticedthat 11 is prime but not (211– 1), which equals 2047. The number 2047 can be expressed as 11 times 89, disproving the conjecture. While not always true, number theorists realized that the (2p– 1) shortcut often produces primes and gives a systematic way to search for large primes. The number (2pâ 1) is much larger relative to the value of p and provides opportunities to identify large primes. When the number (2p– 1) becomes sufficiently large, it is much harder to check whether (2p– 1) is prime â that is, if (2p– 1) dots can be arranged only into a rectangular array with one column or one row. Fortunately,Ãdouard Lucasdeveloped a prime number test in 1878, later proved byDerrick Henry Lehmerin 1930. Their work resulted in an efficient algorithm for evaluating potential Mersenne primes. Using this algorithm with hand computations on paper, Lucas showed in 1876 that the 39-digit number (2127– 1) equals 170,141,183,460,469,231,731,687,303,715,884,105,727, and that value is prime. Also known as M127, this number remains the largest prime verified by hand computations. It held the record for largest known prime for 75 years. Researchers began using computers in the 1950s, and the pace of discovering new large primes increased. In 1952,Raphael M. Robinson identified five new Mersenne primesusing a Standard Western Automatic Computer to carry out the Lucas-Lehmer prime number tests. As computers improved, the list of Mersenne primes grew, especially with theCray supercomputerâs arrivalin 1964. Although there are infinitely many primes, researchers are unsure how many fit the type (2p– 1) and are Mersenne primes. By the early 1980s, researchers had accumulated enough data to confidently believe that infinitely many Mersenne primes exist. They could even guesshow often these prime numbers appear, on average. Mathematicians have not found proof so far, but new data continues to support these guesses. George Woltman, a computer scientist, founded the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search, or GIMPS, in 1996. Through this collaborative program, anyone can download freely available software from theGIMPSwebsite to search for Mersenne prime numbers on their personal computers. The website contains specific instructions on how to participate. GIMPS has now identified 18 Mersenne primes, primarily on personal computers usingIntel chips. The program averages a new discovery about every one to two years. Luke Durant, a retired programmer, discovered the current record for the largest known prime, (2136,279,841– 1), in October 2024.Â Referred to asM136279841, this 41,024,320-digit number was the 52nd Mersenne prime identified and was found by running GIMPS on a publicly availablecloud-based computing network. This network used Nvidia chips and ran across 17 countries and 24 data centers. Theseadvanced chipsprovide faster computing by handling thousands of calculations simultaneously. The result is shorter run times for algorithms such as prime number testing. The Electronic Frontier Foundation is a civil liberty group that offers cash prizes for identifying large primes. It awarded prizes in 2000 and 2009 for the firstverified 1 million-digitand10 million-digit prime numbers. Large prime number enthusiastsâ next two challenges are to identify the first 100 million-digit and 1 billion-digit primes.EFF prizesof US$150,000 and $250,000, respectively, await the first successful individual or group. Eight of the 10 largest known prime numbers are Mersenne primes, so GIMPS and cloud computing are poised to play a prominent role in the search for record-breaking large prime numbers. Large prime numbers have a vital role in many encryption methods in cybersecurity, so every internet user stands to benefit from the search for large prime numbers. These searches help keepdigital communications and sensitive information safe. Jeremiah Bartz, Associate Professor of Mathematics,University of North Dakota.

Being a Sekiro enthusiast who oftenopts for katana buildsin other Souls games, Ongbal naturally favors theExecutor in Nightreign. This katana edgelord's unique ability shifts him into a special stance that enables Sekiro-style timed blocks, as distinct from the big to-do of Elden Ring's high risk, high reward parries. Nightreign's final boss, Heolstor, starts out in a sluggish, \"oooh I'm just a decrepit tragic king don't hurt me\" mode reminiscent of Vendrick from Dark Souls 2. He naturally launches into a \"Haha, I'm actually a killer instinct anime sword god\" mode once you deplete his first health bar⁠—think Lady Maria in Bloodborne or Gael phase 2 in Dark Souls 3. We're playing the hits. This isn't a no-hit fight⁠—that's probably coming later⁠—but Ongbal makes pretty short work of the bloke. I don't think Heolstor gave me the most trouble of Nightreign's bosses⁠—that prize goes to eitherGaping Jawor Darkdrift Knight⁠—but it's an incredible battle visually, and I'm particularly impressed at how well Ongbal kept their cool once the mega final boss particle effects started flying.

    "title": "It's not just you: Elden Ring Nightreign's matchmaking is taking forever if it works at all, and there doesn't seem to be a fix⁠—aside from queueing with a full group",
    "article_text": "FromSoft's suggested fixes so far are \"turn it off and on again\" and \"some weird thing only for PlayStation owners.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. First reported by Eurogamer,FromSoftwarehas acknowledged long matchmaking times forElden RingNightreign despitehaving 2 million players and counting. The studio's initial suggested fixes are not particularly helpful, especially on PC, and the best solution right now is really just queueing with a full team of three. In aninitial tweetabout matchmaking, FromSoft suggested restarting the matchmaking process if it's taking too long⁠—I and the commenters on Twitter thread can tell you right now, that hasn't helped. FromSoft'sonly other suggestionhas been changing your NAT connection type on PlayStation. Nightfarers, If you encounter issues finding other players when launching an expedition in #ELDENRING #NIGHTREIGN, please try restarting the matchmaking process. Thank you for your patience and understanding.May 31, 2025 NAT type is something you can also adjust on PC, but I'm sorry: I'm not going to be messing with my router on account of one game's borked matchmaking. This looks to be an issue across all platforms: Commenters on Twitter mention Xbox as well as PS5, and there are threads on theElden Ring subredditandSteam forumsmentioning long wait times as well. And I'm honestly just feeling relieved: PCG contributor Nova Smith and I snagged a single rando for a run across two hours of waiting for matchmaking last night. I was terrified I'd somehow earned an EAC shadowban of some extraction, but nope, the game's just in shambles for everybody right now. It's a fairly confounding set of server woes, judging solely by the symptoms: I can log in fine and connections have been rock solid once in a game⁠—none of the excruciating log-in queues or dropped matches you'd usually associate with a bad live service launch. Matchmaking just takes forever despite the game having between200,000 and 300,000 players onlineon Steam at any given time. Hopefully there's a fix, but until then, your best bet is securing a third player or trying outYui's Seamless Co-op mod for Nightreignto unlock duos.

    "title": "You got Nightreigned: Elden Ring's spinoff is the most aggravating, player-hostile FromSoft game I've played, but I keep staying up past 3 AM for 'one more run'",
    "article_text": "It feels like a mod (complimentary). It feels like a mod (derogatory). I kind of hate it. I kind of love it? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The \"I stayed up way past my bedtime to play this\" test is perhaps one of the most persuasive endorsements of a game I can think of. With my 30th birthday leveling both barrels at me and ready to fire, this status is only becoming harder for a game to wring out of me. I'm not a multiplayer guy either, so the co-op centric nature ofElden RingNightreign was a hurdle that I thought would surely protect me from accumulating a sleep deprivation debuff. Also,this game is such bullshit.And yet, I keep playing it. I'm 42 hours in. I ruined my precious geriatric millennial sleep cycle to stay up late with the west coast multiple times in the pre-launch period. When the servers went down for a day before launch, I kept messaging our group chat asking to play before being reminded we literally could not. I felt like a dog whining and pawing at its bowl nowhere near mealtime. The single player Nightreign experience pissed me off to hell and back⁠—at least before it was patched⁠—but the whole game can be punishing and RNG-dependent in a way that repeatedly drove me to the brink of madness. In multiple runs against a poison-weak boss, we never ran into a single poison weapon drop. We got Nightreigned. Trying to jump up a wall as the circle's closing in, and you just keep clipping through and failing to clamber up? You got Nightreigned. We lost one run trying to figure out a map event boss, ran it back understanding its mechanics, and still couldn't beat it before the circle closed. Later, I found out our reward would have been immunity to Frostbite, a condition that only minor enemies, the boss we failed to beat, and one of the Nightlords⁠—not the one we were queued against⁠—can inflict.Nightreigned. We got \"invaded\" by a special boss inflicting a Dark Souls-style curse effect, limiting our health bars by a quarter. We found the boss, failed to beat him after several attempts, then the circle closed and he went home. But our three-quarter health curse was permanent for the rest of our doomed run. We absolutely got Nightreigned. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. To borrow a turn of phrase from contributor Tyler Colp'sElden Ring Nightreign review, \"There's nothing like fighting a boss in aFromSoftwaregame that is designed to be a joke with you as the punchline,\" but all the friction, trolling, and obtuse mechanics the studio is known for are put in their worst light in a rapid, run-based format that asks for 30 minutes of your time a piece, and offers very little reward when you beef it. If Elden Ring or Bloodborne is Fromsoft in a dimly lit, chic ambience, Nightreign is the studio under the harsh fluorescent glare of a DMV built in 1992. Take the fact that certain bosses are immune to affinity effects like bleed or frostbite⁠—that's just something you come to accept in Dark Souls or Elden Ring. But what about when you claw your way to the end of a half-hour run, only to discover that the poison bow you've built around actually doesn't work against this particular Nightlord?Nightreigned. It turns out, you can click the left stick to see what item passive effects actually give you in your inventory screen: After 30 hours, I discovered that the \"[Nightfarer's] Grief\" effect on weapons you pick up from fallen players actually gives you stacking attribute bonuses. I loaded up on Executor's Grief weapons while playing as Executor to boost his core Dexterity and Arcane stats to great effect. Now, who would think tocarefully read over hidden tooltips in a severely time-limited game with no pause button?Only someone who's been Nightreigned more times than they care to count. PC Gamer contributor Nova Smith pointed out a crazy-making tension in this game to me. It's inherently \"commercial\"—\"Elden Ring Fortnite\" sounds like a hack punchline about C-suite guys on uppers⁠—but this also may very well be the most player-hostile, least approachable game FromSoft has ever made, and that's including primeval stuff like the OG King's Fields. I goddamn love this game. I'm going to keep playing it. If they make DLC, it's day one for me, baby. I think there are three big things that just keep me from putting Nightreign down, despite its myriad frustrations: 1. Snackable Souls:This isn't an Elden Ring boss rush mode, but it's close. I'll always return to and replay the original game, but that also comes with a lot of downtime and exploration, which doesn't quite hit the same on successive replays. The harried rush from camp to camp can't replace the joys of methodical exploration, but it offers its own frantic, blood pressure-raising appeal. You get a mini version of the Souls zero-to-hero RPG arc, and Nightreign's randomized remixing of Elden Ring's massive arsenal really puts it in a new light. I've formed attachments to weapons I never gave a second thought in the original game, while a rare appearance by a favorite likeRivers of Bloodfeels like Christmas. Plus, we finally haveSekiro at home⁠. In fact, the inventive mechanics, striking visual identity, and killer class fantasy represented by each playable character may be the most irrefutably excellent part of the game. 2. Pleasant surprise:One of the FromSoft guarantees is that you will see and feel things you just don't expect in their games⁠—it's why shrill fans sometimes treat the very appearance and names of bosses as the most egregious spoilers, and they're not entirely wrong for doing so. That boss who permanently stole part of our health bars is a great example: Was it an insanely frustrating way to lose a run? Absolutely. But the rush of the unexpected, the gobsmacking audacity to have an end boss show up as a random event to screw you over, it brings a smile to my face just thinking about it. 3. Better with friends:I pretty much play Souls games alone, and the last time I got really into a multiplayer game was Destiny 2 circa the Beyond Light expansion in 2020. It's been a minute since the stars aligned for so many people in my life to be into the same multiplayer game the way they are with Nightreign⁠—friends, colleagues, old coworkers, everybody's playing Nightreign right now, and the enthusiasm is infectious. It also handily magnifies those \"what the hell\" moments Nightreign dishes out to experience them with friends on a Discord call. I just beat the final boss with Tyler and PCG senior guides writer Sean Martin. Our run wentflawlessly, leading us to joke that, for once, the script had flipped andwewere the ones Nightreigning our enemies. The balance of the experience may not be for everyone, but all the bullshit I've had to slog through may be making this game's moments of triumph all the sweeter.

    "article_text": "Big discounts off Morrowind, OG Oblivion, and all the different versions of Skyrim too. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Short of The Elder Scrolls 6 actually coming out, there's never been a better time to be an Elder Scrolls fan.Oblivion Remasteredis rekindling the love for Bethesda's most lovably janky Elder Scrolls game, while mod projects likeTamriel RebuiltandSkyblivionare either releasing massive new updates or are rapidly approaching completion. Now, there's a chance to pick up any bits of Elder Scrolls history you've missed for a discount, as Bethesdahas put the whole dang series on sale. The most notable deal here is for Oblivion Remastered itself, which is20% off at $40/£40.While not an enormous discount, it's a decent chunk when you consider how long it's been since launch, and how successful the overhaul has been. Certainly, it's the cheapest the game has ever been, a better discount thanFanatical's launch day salewhich brought the price down to $41.50. The biggest discounts are on Skyrim Special Edition, two different versions of Oblivion Game of the Year Edition, and the Elder Scrolls Online, all of which are 75% off. Oblivion GOTY is the cheapest of the bunch, down to$3.74 (£3.24).If you get the 'Deluxe' version (which includes the two expansions plus various smaller DLC), that bringsthe price up slightly to $5 (£4). The Elder Scrolls Online isalso $5 (£4),which nets you the base game plus its Morrowind chapter. TESO's come a long way since its launch days, so thismightbe the best overall deal of the bunch. As for Skyrim,the Special Edition is $10 (£8.74),while you can get the Anniversary Edition upgrade, which includes a bunch of Creation Club mods,for the same price again. Steam's user rating is split precisely down the middle on the Anniversary edition though, with a lot of users complaining that they couldn't download the mods after purchasing. Even the positive reviews tend to suggest that you buy it on sale. So if youreallywant to get it, now is probably the time. Oh, and Skyrim VR isalso on a 75% discount at $15 (£12.49). It's a great VR port of the game if you fancy exploring Skyrim in stereoscopic 3D. There are a couple of lesser Elder Scrolls games also available in the sale. The Elder Scrolls Redguardis 60% off at $2.39 (£1.95), while An Elder Scrolls Legend: Battlespireis the same price. Both are pretty middling spinoffs, but if youmustcomplete your collection, this is a cheap way of doing so. Finally, there's good old Morrowind, which is 60% off at $6 (£5.19). It's been said a thousand times before, but Morrowind is an essential part of every PC Gamer's library. Not only is it Bethesda's most interesting game, it's also the basis for countless fascinating mods, including the enormous (and still growing) Tamriel Rebuilt, which just released ahuge new chunk of the Morrowind mainland, and isalready eyeing up the next area, Almalexia.

    "article_text": "Nemesis. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I've always believedPlanet Coaster 2 to be a better game than it's typically given credit for. But one issue I have with the sequel, and indeed, the series in general is that your park visitors are a bit dull. They're gloriously animated, I should stress, with tons of fun incidental detail in how they move and interact with the world. But behaviourally they're all tediously genial, consumerist chuds who wander blithely around your park, going 'whee' on the rides and gleefully lapping up all your overpriced food and souvenir tat. The worst thing that ever happens is they occasionally throw up or get sunburned. Perhaps this is just what Disney adults are like, but either way, it doesn't make for a particularly engaging group of people to manage. Where's the friction? The complaints? The drama? Well,update 5 for Planet Coaster 2 adds a bit of that in,sprinkling a criminal fraternity among your visitors. Now, pickpockets will prowl along the pathways of your park, aiming to fleece the pockets of other visitors. On top of that, parkgoers who are especially dissatisfied with your park will no longer just sulk. They'll actively engage in vandalism, booting over bins and kicking in benches. There's that rebellious spirit I'm after! Of course, as the owner of the park, you don't have to just sit there and take it. You can now hire security guards to counter these criminal acts. Security guards reduce the risk of pickpocketing and vandalism simply by being there, but they'll also chase down guests suspected of misdeeds and eject them from the park (although not literally, sadly). Law and disorder aren't the only new features coming in update 5. The patch brings back the sci-fi theme from the original Planet Coaster, letting you dress up rides and pools in glorious retrofuturism. You can also customise the colour of rocks and glass pieces, while the game's rather cumbersome pathing tool has been improved to feature an area delete tool and customisable stations for both coasters and flumes. The update also provides an array of bugfixes, visual enhancements for several water rides, and adjustments to various systems. The latter includes a much more detailed breakdown of prestige and how it impacts rides, more information on ride reputation, and better explication of guests' individual moods. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The new additions and fixes seems to have made an immediate impact upon players. While the game's overall rating remains mixed on Steam, recent reviews skew toward mostly positive. \"This game has become truly amazing! Its release was a bit rocky, but wow, what a game it is now,writes user Daan. \"Game had a rough start, but a good update schedule has brought it to the point w[h]ere it is THE theme park simulator,\"adds DenniS.

    "title": "This game about being trapped on a spaceship overgrown with a jungle that wants to eat you is basically Project Zomboid in space, and it looks absolutely terrifying",
    "article_text": "Dandelion Void has my attention. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. My favourite type of video game can be summarised as \"something has gone wrong in space\". Whether it's a shooter, immersive sim, strategy game, or kart racer, I'm always up for a game that's about dealing with a horrible problem in the most hostile environment of them all. And wow, does Dandelion Void understand the meaning of the word \"horrible\". The pitch is you're trapped aboard a derelictgeneration shipthat has, in the unknown expanse of time since your ship departed Earth in the late 20thcentury, been completely overgrown by extraterrestrial rainforest. Unlike most games set in abandoned spaceships, this jungle thrums and thrives with new life. On the face of it, this doesn't sound too bad, until you discover that life is rabidly hostile toward anything with fewer than seven legs. To survive among this drifting wilderness, you'll need to explore the ship and scavenge for useful items, cutting through the jungle and ripping up its roots to create a safe area in which to build your base. Venturing deeper into the ship will mean finding ways to open gigantic bulkhead doors. But you won't know exactly where these doors will lead. They could reveal rooms filled with bountiful resources. Or they could expose you directly to the hard vacuum of space. In presentation and play, Dandelion Void looks and sounds a lot like Project Zomboid, which is not surprising considering the developers, Manzanita Interactive, assembled from the modding community of The Indie Stone'sphenomenally successful isometric survival game. There are plenty of setting specific flourishes to the basic survival loop, though, such as having to find and repair different kinds of spacesuit to deal with airless rooms or corridors crackling with radiation. It's a great premise, and a recently released trailer (viewable above) sells it brilliantly. One devilish twist is that the, uh, creatures that prowl this interstellar rainforest grow around the bones of the ship's long-deceased crew, resulting in some thoroughly unpleasant monster designs. This is put to excellent effect in the middle of the trailer too, though I'll say no more about that. There's no release date for Dandelion Void yet, but according to theaccompanying Steam post for the trailer, the game's been in development for a couple of years already. In any case, you can find out more about Dandelion Void on itsSteam page. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "One of the best puzzle games on Steam just got its first update in 11 years and is also verified for Steam Deck: 'We couldn't resist including some visual, aural, and input adjustments'",
    "article_text": "The Swapper gets a visual cleanup and is now officially handheld-friendly When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Have you played The Swapper? If not, you should swap whatever you're doing right now for playing The Swapper. Originally released back in 2013, it's a sci-fi puzzler that hinges on your ability to create clones of yourself, which then mimic your every movement. From this simple concept, The Swapperproduces some delightfully brain-tangling puzzles, and a story that probes the question of personal identity with discomforting acuity. Oh, and it's all wrapped in eerie, Claymation-based art that still looks beautiful today. But not beautiful enough, according to developers Facepalm games. Over the last week or so, Facepalm has been steadily uploading a sequence of updates to The Swapper's beta-build, culminating in the game'sfirst proper Steam updatein 11 years. \"The original purpose of this release was addressing bit rot that had accumulated over the years,\" writes Facepalm in a Steam blog. \"But we couldn't resist including some visual, aural and input adjustments that make the game feel a bit smoother.\" The various touch-ups to the Swapper include the addition of light dithering, enhanced edges when depth of field is switched on, updated textures, and bump-map anti-aliasing. Audio, meanwhile, has been enhanced with more natural sound panning and a slightly louder text blip. Finally, the update includes a bunch of bug fixes, ranging from tiny changes like correcting a typo in a subtitle, to fixing an issue where accessing hidden terminals caused \"catastrophic failure\". Facepalm says the visual and audio updates are \"subtle enough that they could go unnoticed if you're not looking for them\", so they've added a legacy branch to Steam letting players see what the game looked like before the update. The legacy branch retains the essential stability fixes, though, so you can enjoy the original visuals without worrying about bugs or crashes. Aside from these quality-of-life additions, The Swapper is now Steam Deck verified. This appears to have happened shortly after the update's launch, as the update post has been edited to specify the verification, originally stating \"We hope it will be reviewed for official compatibility soon.\" In any case, The Swapper seems tailor-made for handheld gaming, even though it released years before the Steam Deck was a twinkle in Gaben's eye. If you fancy giving it a whirl in portable mode, Facepalm notes that \"The main branch is recommended when playing handheld because the visual stability improvements have a more noticeable effect on smaller resolutions.\" While The Swapper is the only game to be developed by Facepalm as an entity, its director Olli Harjolawent on to create the gleefully chaotic (and enormously successful) roguelike Noita. Meanwhile, the Swapper's writer, Tom Jubert,cowrote the story for The Talos Principleandwrote parts of the sequel, both of which share thematic elements with Facepalm's puzzler.

We covered the biggest streaming news from the event live, so you'll be able to catch up on anything you missed about thebest Netflix showsandnew Netflix moviesall in one place. Scroll down to find out what the biggest news was from Netflix's biggest fan event. And that's a wrap! Netflix Tudum 2025 is now over but you can catch up on all the highlights from the show by visitingNetflix's official YouTube account, streaming the full event on the service itself or by scrolling back through our coverage to get all the biggest streaming news you need to know. Who said nightmares don't come true? Those are among the first words uttered by Jenna Ortega's Wednesday Adams in the first six minutes of season 2 of the Tim Burton show, which sees our titular character tied up in a serial killer's basement. While the opening scene was revealed to fans on stage, it was Lady Gaga's performance that unsurprisingly stole the show as it confirmed rumors that the singer is set to join the cast in the show's sophomore outing. Stranger Thingsactors Finn Wolfhard, Noah Schnapps and Caleb McLaughlin have finally joined the party to bring us our first official update about the final season of the show. Following some behind-the-scenes clips from their time filming the series, Millie Bobby Brown tuned in from the 'void' to tell us about her favorite memory from the making of the show. Before the cast left the stage they gave us one more tape and it's arguably the most exciting from the evening so far as it gave us a highlight reel of some of the show's most memorable moments as well as a very brief sneak peek of what's to come in season 5. At the end of the clip, Netflix announced the release schedule for the show, confirming rumors that it will be released in three parts. The first will be release on November 26, followed by the second part on December 25 and the finale on December 31. Christmas couldn't come soon enough. The full trailer for Adam Sandler's golfer comedy sequel has been revealed and it's got us tapping out feet to the hit 70s song 'Magic' by Pilot. Sandler will return alongside Julie Bowen, Ben Stiller and Christopher McDonald to reprise their roles, but we'll also meet new cast members, including Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio (aka Bad Bunny), daughters Sadie and Sunny Sandler, and Blake Clark. Happy Gilmore 2will stream on Netflix on July 25, 2025. We just got our first look at the long-awaited adaptation of the literary classic Frankenstein from acclaimed director Guillermo Del Toro and if you're as big of a fan of Oscar Isaac as I am then you're in for a treat. This looks like it will absolutely be a smash hit when it arrives and while we still don't have confirmation about when that will be, it's slated for a November release. The new crime thrillerThe Riplooks like it will be a gripping watch going by the brief teaser clip that was just shown. Unfortunately, Netflix hasn't published the video online but we do have the above image of the movie's leading cast membersMatt Damon and Ben Affleck. The pair will star alongside Steven Yeun, Kyle Chandler, Teyana Taylor, Catalina Sandino Moreno and Sasha Call in the new movie from writer-director Joe Carnahan. We can expect to streamThe Ripnext year on January 16, 2026. Netflix's live-action adaptation of one of thebest anime shows,One Piece,is returning with season 2 in 2026 and to build up the excitement the cast of the series has stepped on stage to announce who will be joining the crew. The fan-favorite character Tony Tony Chopper will be played by none other then actor Mikaela Hoover, who will also perform the facial capture for the adorable human reindeer that's known as the doctor of the Straw Hat Pirates. Rian Johnson and Daniel Craig are now in the spotlight (and not just because they have t-shirt guns) with a brief preview of the next chapter of the hit mystery dramaWake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mysteryto announce the movie's release date. The film will stream on Netflix on December 12. It has another all-star cast that includes the aforementioned Craig along with Josh O'Connor, Glenn Close, Josh Brolin, Mila Kunis, Jeremy Renner, Kerry Washington, Andrew Scott, Cailee Spaeny, Daryl McCormack and Thomas Haden Church. Squid Gamehas opened the show with player 456, aka Seong Gi-hun (who's played by Lee Jung-jae), along with other cast members to unveil the official trailer forthe third and final season of the show. While the two-minute trailer gives us a glimpse at the exciting final chapter, it still leaves plenty of questions around whether player 456 will be able to a stop to the games for good. Indeed, as Jung-jae puts it: \"Will the boy doll Cheol-su be nice?\" – we're not counting on it. Squid Gameseason 3 will return to Netflix on June 27. Here we go! We're on stage with Netflix darling Sofia Carson, fromMy Oxford YearandThe Life List,who is hosting this evening's event. It's the first time that Tudum is being live streamed on the platform itself, so it's great to see that such a large crowd still turned out. It's not long until Netflix Tudum 2025 gets underway, so what can fans expect to hear about their favorite TV shows and most-anticipated movies coming to the streamer? Ahead of the event, Netflix confirmed that some of its biggest returning TV shows will be in the spotlight, alongside new updates about upcoming movies and live events that it'll be streaming throughout 2025, including: Such a packed lineup has got many fans – yours truly included – excited to see what Netflix will reveal. Indeed,from aStranger Thingsseason 5 release date to new movie trailer reveals, many of us have been speculating what will be announced. TechRadar's senior entertainment reporter Tom Power has a stacked wishlist that includes aStranger Thingsseason 5 release schedule, an official trailer forSquid Gameseason 3, more footage ofWednesdayseason 2 and release date reveals for Netflix's 2025 movies. Considering that this is Netflix's biggest fan event of the year, I'm hopeful that we'll be able to tick a lot of these off, so stay tuned for all the latest as it happens. You can tune into the Netflix Tudum 2025 live event from home by streaming it live on Netflix on May 31, 2025, at 8pm ET / 5PM PT.

    "title": "Criminals hijacking subdomains of popular websites such as Bose or Panasonic to infect victims with malware: here's how to stay safe",
    "article_text": "Hackers using abandoned web infrastructure to launch invisible scams When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A troubling new online threat is emerging in which criminals hijack subdomains of major organizations, such as Bose,Panasonic, and even the US CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), to spreadmalwareand perpetrate online scams. As flagged by security expertsInfoblox, at the center of this campaign is a threat group known as Hazy Hawk, which has taken a relatively quiet but highly effective approach to compromise user trust and weaponize it against unsuspecting visitors. These subdomain hijackings are not the result of direct hacking but rather of exploiting overlooked infrastructure vulnerabilities. Instead of breaching networks through brute force or phishing, Hazy Hawk exploits abandoned cloud resources linked to misconfigured DNS CNAME records. These so-called “dangling” records occur when an organization decommissions a cloud service but forgets to update or delete the DNS entry pointing to it, leaving the subdomain vulnerable. For example, a forgotten subdomain like something.bose.com might still point to an unused Azure or AWS resource, and if Hazy Hawk registers the corresponding cloud instance, the attacker suddenly controls a legitimate-looking Bose subdomain. This method is dangerous because misconfigurations are not typically flagged by conventional security systems. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! The repurposed subdomains become platforms for delivering scams, including fakeantiviruswarnings, tech support cons, and malware disguised as software updates. Hazy Hawk doesn’t just stop at hijacking - the group uses traffic distribution systems (TDSs) to reroute users from hijacked subdomains to malicious destinations. These TDSs, such as viralclipnow.xyz, assess a user’s device type, location, and browsing behavior to serve up tailored scams. Often, redirection begins with seemingly innocuous developer or blog domains, like share.js.org, before shuffling users through a web of deception. Once users accept push notifications, they continue to receive scam messages long after the initial infection, establishing a lasting vector for fraud. Thefalloutfrom these campaigns is more than theoretical and has affected high-profile organizations and firms like the CDC, Panasonic and Deloitte. Individuals can guard against these threats by refusing push notification requests from unfamiliar sites and exercising caution with links that seem too good to be true. For organizations, the emphasis must be on DNS hygiene. Failing to remove DNS entries for decommissioned cloud services leaves subdomains vulnerable to takeover. Automated DNS monitoring tools, especially those integrated with threat intelligence, can help detect signs of compromise. Security teams should treat these misconfigurations as critical vulnerabilities, not minor oversights.

    "title": "Seagate confirms 40TB hard drives have already been shipped, but don't expect them to go on sale anytime soon",
    "article_text": "Seagate wants HAMR drives to dominate exabyte shipments When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. At the recentSeagate’s Investor and Analyst Conference, the companyrevealedit has delivered limited units of its new 40TB hard drives based on its Mozaic HAMR platform. These 40TB drives use Heat-Assisted Magnetic Recording (HAMR) to achieve 4TB per platter across ten platters, marking a shift toward Seagate’s Mozaic 4+ platform. While these are not yet broadly available, full-scale production is slated to begin in the first half of 2026 following extensive customer qualification testing. “We have shipped limited 40 terabyte engineering samples to our customer already. We do plan to initiate quals next quarter, and we'll continue quals into 2026, where we'll be bringing over a wide portion of our customer base to the Mozaic 4 platform,” said Dr. John Morris, Seagate’s CTO. Volume readiness will depend on howdata centersintegrate and validate the drives. However, the goal is to move a significant share of Seagate’s exabyte shipments to HAMR-based drives, which promise higher capacity and data center efficiency. As CEO, Dr. Dave Mosley explained, “10 disks would get you to 40 terabytes... this gives better efficiencies in the data center. At the fleet level, this is how our customers think.” Seagate's long-term plan involves rolling out even larger capacities, including 44TB drives by 2027 and 50TB drives by 2028. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! The delay from itsoriginal 2017 projectionfor 50TB drives by 2026 underscores the complexities of scaling HAMR technology. Yet, the 40TB development still positions Seagate in the race to offer thelargest HDDon the market. Rival companies are following different strategies. Western Digital (WD) continues to expand capacity through ePMR and OptiNAND, reserving HAMR for itsown 40TB launch expected in late 2026. “Other companies have started adopting HAMR with 30TB HDDs, but we believe HAMR’s true potential begins at 40TB. Until then, we'll continue using technologies like OptiNAND and UltraSMR to increase the capacity of existing HDDs up to 40TB,” said Kimihiko Nishio, WD's sales manager in Japan. Toshiba, another key player, has been developing its technologies, such as Microwave-Assisted Magnetic Recording (MAMR). The company aims to release its first35TB HDD based on HAMR before 2026. Toshiba's strategy involves combining MAMR with future HAMR implementations to achieve these capacities. These drives won’t appeal to average consumers looking for thefastest HDDor even thebest HDDfor home use, their development is closely tied to the AI-driven cybersecurity arms race. Seagate’s early shipments of 40TB drives suggest technical leadership in the race to develop the largest HDD, but the path to commercial reality is winding, and the cautious stance of competitors implies the challenges are considerable.

    "title": "Cybercriminals are deploying deepfake sentinels to test detection systems of businesses: here's what you need to know",
    "article_text": "Repeaters are used to test your system’s defense before large-scale attack When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In a digital world increasingly shaped by artificial intelligence, identity fraud is evolving in scale and sophistication. Experts fromAU10TIXhave flagged a new threat tactic known as “Repeaters” which is reshaping the way fraudsters infiltrate digital systems. Unlike traditional attacks, these aren’t designed for instant damage - instead, Repeaters quietly test the defenses of banks, crypto platforms, and other services by using slightly varied synthetic identities. Once weak points are identified, those same assets are redeployed across multiple platforms in large-scale, coordinated fraud campaigns. At the heart of this strategy are deepfake-enhanced identities, slightly modified versions of a core digital asset. These changes may include tweaks to facial features, background images, or document numbers. When examined individually, each variation appears legitimate, often bypassing traditional Know Your Customer (KYC) processes and biometric checks. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! AU10TIX’s CEO, Yair Tal, describes them as “the fingerprint of a new class of fraud: automated, AI-enhanced attacks that reuse synthetic identities and digital assets at scale.” What makes Repeaters particularly dangerous is how they exploit gaps in current fraud detection systems. Most traditional defenses rely on static validation, evaluating each identity as an isolated event. Techniques like biometric scans, liveness detection, and ID checks often miss the broader picture. Because these synthetic identities are only submitted a few times per platform and appear unique, conventional tools struggle to detect the repetition. To counter this threat, AU10TIX therefore introduces “consortium validation”. Unlike siloed systems, this method allows multiple organizations to share identity signals across a real-time network, just like thebest endpoint protection platforms. If an identity, or even a slightly modified version, appears at more than one member organization, the system flags it immediately. It’s a collaborative defense strategy aimed at connecting the dots between otherwise isolated incidents. “We’re proud to be at the forefront of detecting and blocking these attacks through advanced pattern recognition and real-time consortium validation,” Tal added AU10TIX recommends organizations also audit for vulnerabilities to deepfakes and synthetic identities that can bypass traditional KYC defenses. It also recommends the close monitoring of behaviors across devices, sessions and onboarding events because it can reveal coordinated activities before they scale. The best chance at early detection of such fraudulent activity is a connected and behaviorally aware security infrastructure because no single solution can claim to be thebest antivirusor thebest malware protectionagainst this new generation of fraud.

Firstly, with an H, O, and P all with limited places to go, a word ending  H-O-O-P seemed the most likely possibility. Secondly, when you play Quordle and its many variants for a while, a few words recur more than others and WHOOP is one of them.

It’s called the modern pentathlon to distinguish it from the ancient pentathlon, but in truth it’s not very modern anymore. It’s a bit like someone calling a typewriter a modern pencil. In my opinion there should be more of these tests of sporting ability – I remember a brief attempt at marketing a chessboxing hybrid a while back and there is of course the triathlon, but why stop there? Combining table games, athletics and martial arts creates hundreds of watchable possibilities; who wouldn’t want to watch Jenga-Pole Vault-Judo? Getting the hardest group, comprising of four funds, early was a thrill for me today, tempered slightly by the fact that I don’t understand the blue group ENSURE, AS A VICTORYat all – just like I didn’t understand it a year ago when the exact same group appeared in Connections #340.

NYT Connections is one of several increasingly popular word games made by the New York Times. It challenges you to find groups of four items that share something in common, and each group has a different difficulty level: green is easy, yellow a little harder, blue often quite tough and purple usually very difficult. On the plus side, you don't technically need to solve the final one, as you'll be able to answer that one by a process of elimination. What's more, you can make up to four mistakes, which gives you a little bit of breathing room. It's a little more involved than something like Wordle, however, and there are plenty of opportunities for the game to trip you up with tricks. For instance, watch out for homophones and other word games that could disguise the answers. It's playable for free via theNYT Games siteon desktop or mobile.

    "article_text": "Keep in touch When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Haptic buttons (also known as solid-state buttons) don't physically move – they just give your fingers feedback in the form of vibrations to simulate a click.Appleuses them for its MacBook trackpads, and it seems they'll be coming to many other devices soon. As per well-known tipsterInstant Digital(viaMacRumors), Apple is exploring the idea of using haptic buttons for the iPhone, the iPad, and theApple Watch– though the indications are that this isn't something we'll be seeing in this year's refreshes. This isn't the first time this rumor has appeared – we thought we might get haptic buttonsback with the iPhone 15 series, if you remember – but it appears that they're back on the agenda for Apple, and this time not just for the iPhone. We don't get much more information than that, but the benefits of these haptic buttons are that they last longer (because they're not actually moving), and offer more customization options (because the force of the feedback can be adjusted as needed). Based on this rumor at least, it seems unlikely that haptic buttons are going to be ready for theiPhone 17, or indeed theApple Watch Series 11. Both of those devices will now be in the latter stages of their development ahead of an expected September launch. Looking further down the line though, some of this technology might appear in Apple's 2026 devices (by which time, Apple's launch schedulecould be more staggered). It could show up slowly too, on some buttons but not on others.

It possibly shows Apple experimenting ahead of going all in on haptics. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Other leaks have suggested that Appleis working towardsan all-screen iPhone in the coming years (without any notches or islands), while rumors of a portless iPhone have beenswirling for years.

Below, I've rounded up the latest information on the superhero flick, including its confirmed release date and cast, story details, and more.Potential spoilers followforSupergirl: Woman of Tomorrowand the graphic novel it's based on. Today we celebrate #Supergirl and all her various incarnations. Can’t wait for you to see the latest version, portrayed by the indomitable @millyalcock, in June 2026.Photo by Parisa Taghizadeh. pic.twitter.com/3sXwAFfxJbMarch 31, 2025 Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrowwill land in theaters worldwide onJune 26, 2026. That meansSupergirl will make her DCU debut almost one year after James Gunn'sSupermanmovieofficially kicks off the DCU. Well, if you discountCreature Commandos' first season. But I digress. Although he's not directing it, Gunn, one of DC Studios' co-heads, confirmed (viaThreads) that principal photography wrapped in early May. With over 12 months to complete its post-production phase, there's no reason why theDCU Chapter Onemovie won't make its current release date. Nope. A teaser could be shown at San Diego Comic-Con 2025 in late July, if DC Studios is in attendance and one has been edited in time. Right now, though, no footage is publicly available. Once a trailer is released, I'll update this section. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Potential spoilers follow forSupergirl: Woman of Tomorrow. Here's who I expect to see inSupergirl: Woman of Tomorrow: So far, Alcock and Momoa are the only actors who are officially confirmed to appear. Alcock, who you might recognize fromHouse of the DragonandSirens, was picked to play Supergirl in January 2024.Alcock made it to the final two alongside Meg Donnellylast January, and was then selected by Gunn and his studio co-chief Peter Safran to play a character previously portrayed by the likes of Helen Slater, Melissa Benoist, and Summer Glau in a live-action capacity. Real name Kara Zor-El, she hails from Krypton, aka the destroyed planet that was also home to Kal-El/Clark Kent/Superman. In fact, she'sSuperman's cousin, so you won't be surprised to learn that she possesses identical powers to the only other surviving Kryptonian. Expect to see her use her superhuman physical abilities, heat vision, X-ray vision, invulnerability, and flight-based skills inWoman of Tomorrow. As for Momoa, who playedAquamanin the now-defunct DC Extended Universe (DCEU), he'll cameo as Lobo. The sole survivor of another alien race that lived on the utopian world known as Czarnia, Lobo travels the cosmos as a bounty hunter/mercenary. He's got the skillset for the job, too, with super strength, speed, and agility, plus immortality, self-healing powers, and expert marksmanship, ensuring that few foes can best him in short- and long-range combat. Interestingly, Lobo doesn't appear inWoman of Tomorrow's comic book namesake (more on the story later), so I'm keen to learn why writer Ana Nogueira and director Craig Gillespie included him in the movie adaptation. A post shared by Jason Momoa (@prideofgypsies) A photo posted by on Where the rest of the cast is concerned, Ridley, who appeared in3 Body ProblemonNetflix, will play Ruthye (perDeadline). A young and noble warrior who enlists the eponymous hero's help to track down the individual who murdered her dad, Ruthye will play an integral role in the story. Meanwhile, Krumholtz and Beecham are on board (perThe Hollywood Reporter) as Kara's parents, Zor-El and Alura, so expect to see some flashbacks to Kara's childhood and, potentially, Krypton's demise. According to the aforementioned Deadline article, Schoenaerts is tackling the role of Krem, aka the primary villain of the piece, who's responsible for killing Ruthye's father. Lastly,Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrowwill feature everyone's favorite boisterous pooch, Krypto. Inspired by Gunn's own rescue dog Ouzo, Krypto will make his DCU debut inGunn'sSupermanmoviebefore he traverses the galaxy with Kara and Ruthye. Possible spoilers follow forSupergirl: Woman of Tomorrow. Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrowdoesn't have a story synopsis yet. However, it's already possible to draw some conclusions about its plot because it'll draw heavily from its graphic novel series namesake. Indeed,Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrowis the same title bestowed upon an eight-issue series written by Tom King and drawn by Bilquis Eveley, which ran from June 2021 to February 2022. In it, Kara Zor-El crosses paths with Ruthye and is asked to help the latter find the man (i.e. Krem) responsible for killing her dad. A reluctant Supergirl agrees to help, thus kicking off the literary work's events. I won't spoil much else because, well, spoilers. However,Woman of Tomorrowis a unique comic book series in that it doesn't tell the story from the perspective of the titular hero. Indeed, we witness events play out through Ruthye's eyes, so I'm curious to see if this'll be the case in its movie adaptation, or if Kara will be our eyes and ears instead. Regardless, it seems like Supergirl's first solo DCU outing will be incredibly faithful to its graphic novel counterpart. In January, Gunn revealedWoman of Tomorrow's first behind-the-scenes image, andit showed Alcock's Kara in a place that'll be very familiar to DC fans. Sure, this is just a single picture, but I'd be amazed if the forthcoming flick isn't a near-identical retelling of the plot that plays out inDCComics literature. Of equal intrigue will be the movie's age rating. By all accounts,Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrowis a pretty dark story from a thematic standpoint, so its live-action interpretation could push the boundaries of what's considered to be a PG-13 movie in the US and a 12-plus film in the UK. I suspect these are the age ratings it'll eventually earn, as Gunn, Safran, and company won't want to make a 16-plus or even R-rated film that fewer people will be able to see. The short answer is: I don't know.Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrowwill be the fourth DCU project released afterCreature Commandosseason 1,Superman, andLanterns. The last of that trio is the next HBO TV Original that'll also air on Max (US and Australia) and Sky/Now TV (UK). It's expected to launch in early 2026. Post-Woman of Tomorrow, the only other DCU production confirmed to be in active development, isClayface. A small-budget horror flick from Mike Flanagan, it's currently penciled in to arrive in September 2026 and, based on what's been publicly revealed, it's highly unlikely to have ties toWoman of Tomorrow. Until the Daughter of Krypton's next standalone adventure is out, then, nobody can say what the future holds for Kara Zor-El or how her first DCU solo movie will impact Gunn and Safran's cinematic universe. What we do know is Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) is positioning Supergirl as the fourth superhero that the DCU will be built around. In May, WBD CEO David Zaslav told investors that Superman, Supergirl,Wonder Woman, andBatmanare the DCU's \"big asset builders\" (perYahoo). So, this isn't the last we'll see of Kara in the DCU.

    "article_text": "Kopernica senses stress, anxiety and adapts to the user’s emotional state When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In recent years, artificial intelligence has rapidly advanced in understanding human language and behavior, yet the challenge of truly grasping human emotions remains a frontier. HoweverNeurologycasays its new AI system can “understand” human emotions, sense stress and anxiety, and adapt accordingly. Kopernica integrates multiple sensory inputs and, unlike traditional AI which relies primarily on text or speech, uses a combination of computer vision, natural language processing, and personality modeling. The system monitors over 790 points of reference on the human body, seven times more than comparable market solutions. By using 3D pattern recognition, it can record subtle body language and facial expressions. In order to find emotional clues that go beyond words, it also examines vocal tone and rhythmic patterns. Furthermore, Kopernica continuously learns an individual’s emotional trends and interaction preferences. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! This enables the system to personalize and be more empathetic in engagement over time. Such multi-modal signal fusion is touted as the first technology to combine visual, auditory, and psychological signals to infer complex states like motivation, cognitive load, stress, and attention. \"Today’s AI systems understand what we say, but they can’t understand how we feel,\" said Juan Graña, Co-founder and CEO of Neurologyca. \"With Kopernica, we’ve created the human context layer that will empower these systems to not only capture nuanced human emotions but respond with empathy, adapt their behavior, and genuinely enhance the human-machine relationship.” The promise of an emotionally smart AI is attractive, but the huge question remains: Can AI really understand human emotions in any meaningful sense? The human capacity is very complex. It is shaped by history, context, individual nuance and cultural dimensions that even the most advanced AI system will overlook. It goes beyond simply detecting anxiety or stress markers from micro-expressions and vocal patterns. The interpretation of what caused these expressions and the appropriate response is an issue that most likely requires human judgment. There is also the issue of privacy. Neurologyca claims Kopernica performs real-time processing locally on devices, anonymizing data and ensuring no identifiable information is stored or shared without explicit consent. Yet, any system that claims to consistently monitor human physiological and psychological signals, especially in public settings, will always have privacy issues to deal with.

    "title": "We just got a big hint that the Google Pixel 10 could be launching earlier than expected",
    "article_text": "A preview is scheduled for June 27 When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. We know thatAndroid 16is going to be launching significantly earlier in the year than Android 15 did, and now the signs are that theGoogle Pixel 10could break cover earlier this year than the Pixel 9 did in 2024. According toAndroid Police, Pixel superfans in the UK – so Pixel owners who've signed up for access to a community of people who really, really like Pixels – have been invited to an exclusive Pixel 10 preview event on June 27. Yes, that's June 27, 2025 – a mere 27 days from today (May 31). Now the Pixel 10 isn't mentioned by name on the invitation, but it does refer to \"pre-release Pixel devices\", which most probably means the upcoming flagship phone. We're speculating a bit here, but the Google Pixel 9 launched on August 13, 2024. If Google is going to demo the Pixel 10 to superfans near the end of June, then we might be looking at a launch for the device sometime in July. An earlier Pixel 10 launch would fit with a recent Google trend too: the Google Pixel 8 was unveiled on October 12, 2023, so these launches are getting earlier and earlier with each passing year – perhaps to get way ahead of the traditional September iPhone launch. And Android is launching early this year, too: Android 16 is expected to leave beta sometime in June, whereasAndroid 15wasn't officially finished until September 2024. Google is speeding up its hardware and software development, it seems. Thanks to the Android 16 beta program andGoogle I/O 2025, we already know a lot about what the software upgrade is bringing with it, of course.

    "title": "The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge might look gorgeous, but its headline feature stands out for all the wrong reasons",
    "article_text": "Deserving of its hype, but not the outright winner I expected When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I’ve spent the last two weeks withSamsung Galaxy S25 Edge, and when showing the all-new Galaxy S device to my friends and family, the same two comments would always be made. The first: ‘wow, that’s thin’. The second: ‘why?’. Sadly I’ve been unable to provide a quick answer to the latter. TheSamsungGalaxy S25 Edge doesn’t trim the fat when it comes to being an epic handset – it features the same great user interface that Samsung refined with the S25 launch and, indeed, it looks and feels especially premium. But the feature that justifies its ‘Edge’ namesake hasn’t been demonstrated as particularly useful. Despite being more expensive than theGalaxy S25 Plus(the edge starts at $1,099.99 / £1,099 / AU$1,849, while the Plus starts at $999 / £999 / AU$1,699), it features a lot of the same specs – and where it doesn't, it's often made sacrifices, including with the camera and battery. There’s a nice mix of features here that, on the whole, are probably attractive to a user after a particular spec. That being said, the S25 Plus remains the better phone, and if you’re gravitating towards more expensive phones, I’d recommend the S25 Ultra over the Edge. I don’t really have a lot to say about the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, but if you’re someone who has been craving a thin phone, pay attention to this device. I don’t recommend paying full price but, once Black Friday sales roll around, I’d be more inclined to purchase the Edge at a discount. At full price, however, with the Galaxy S25 Plus now seeing price drops, it's a tough sell. Ask yourself what you’re willing to sacrifice for a thin phone. Battery size? A camera lens? A stylus? To achieve what is likely the thinnest phone on the market right now, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge has sacrificed all of these things but, at the same time, it has received an interesting mishmash of features from both the S25 Plus and S25 Ultra, along with some features of its own. The 200MP lens on the Edge, which it carries over from the Ultra, is great in use and captures a lot of color and detail, though the 12MP ultrawide camera from the Plus is also featured, rather than the much more capable 50MP lens on the Ultra. The telephoto lens is nowhere to be seen, removed to achieve the thinness, meaning that zoom capabilities are severely limited. The battery is only a 3,900mAh capacity pack – smaller than the 4,900mAh battery found in the Plus and the 5,000mAh in the Ultra. This is again due to the thinness. I can confirm that it’s not as devastating as it may read on paper – I’ve been able to yield full-day batteries from the S25 Edge successfully during my time with it; however, I’m left yearning for the gigantic battery in the S25 Ultra, which I could rely on to last me into a second day if I forgot a charge. My 9-5 workday with the S25 Edge saw the phone run down to about 51% once I got home, and using it casually one morning, the phone dropped from 100% to 87% in just under two hours. No doubt it’d be struggling if I forgot to charge it overnight, or when I got home after work. A phone of this price might be unconscionable with a battery like this, but I kind of see it as a non-issue. It’s not really intended to be the same exceptionally capable device as the Ultra, after all – this phone is realistically closer to the Z range, as it’s more niche and experimental (albeit no fold). The display is also fairly nice, though it’s identical to the 6.7-inch, 3,440 x 1,440 resolution screen featured on the Plus – apart from the new Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 protective layer. I would have liked the screen to have similar squared dimensions to the Ultra, along with the flagship phone’s premium anti-glare glass to make it a more competitive handset (and more different to the Plus), but that’s just me. The Snapdragon 8 Elite processor is the exact same as the one that’s in the Plus and Ultra, and the AI feature set (which Samsung still hasn’tindicated the future pricing of) remains identical. And that naturally leads up to the thinness – yeah, it’s thin. I don’t really know what to say: Samsung made a thin phone. Cool. It’s still as thick as a standard phone when you put a case on it, something that I would highly recommend as, although it looks quite nice, I was not confident in holding the phone without a case by the side of the road or when on a balcony. The camera housing also adds a bit of chunkiness, protruding far from the phone's back. The Galaxy S25 Edge feels like a stumble more than anything else, which is a shame considering Samsung’s recent track record: the hugely impressiveGalaxy Ring, the epicGalaxy S25 Ultrarefresh and awesome-valueGalaxy A56are all brilliant examples of the Korean tech giant’s ability to read the room and understand what its customers actually want. While I don’t deny the existence of folks looking for a thin phone, the S25 Edge fails to carve out a unique niche among the Galaxy S family of devices. Simultaneously, the Edge feels too close to the S25 Plus to feel unique on its own, and too feature-stripped to justify buying at full price. There are places that Samsung could take the Edge idea to make it more appealing. As I alluded earlier, bringing it closer in spec and aesthetic to the Ultra, offering its anti-glare layer and more squared shape while also being thinner, smaller and cheaper is one place where the Edge might be justifiable. Another is the opposite: reckoning with the fact that it’s going to be feature-limited to begin with, instead positioning it closer to the base-model Galaxy S25, offering a similar set of cameras and size, along with the incredible thinness with a slightly higher price. It’s close to the issues encountered by theGalaxy Z Flip. That phone has similar battery and camera limitations as the Edge, along with a high price, but the Flip gets a pass as it’sreally coolto treat your phone like a classic flip phone and it has an additional screen. The Edge is just thin. For now, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge feels just a little too niche for mass-market appeal, which explains why the company has only chosen three color options (one being exclusive to Samsung’s online store). It’s a good phone and I recommend purchasing it – just not over the other phones in the S25 range and certainly not for the full price.

    "article_text": "The spellbinding sequel will arrive on September 18, 2026 When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. - Set for release on Sept 18, 2026- Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman reprising their iconic roles- Plot will follow Alice Hoffman'sThe Book of Magicnovel- No official trailer released yet- Expected to stream on HBO Max after theatrical release- Joey King \"in talks\" to play Sally's daughter Practical Magic2 is on its way and considering it's been nearly 30 years since we enjoyed the 1998 original, it's practically magical news – especially because Warner Bros. has already confirmed the release date as September 18, 2026. Will Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman be reprising their iconic roles? Yes, they certainly will. The sequel is set to bring back at least that much of the original's spellbinding magic, with both Sally and Gillian Owens played by the original actors. Marked as a theatrical release at first, it will almost certainly arrive onHBO Maxafter that, as a Warner movie – the originalPractical Magichas found its home there. And who knows,Practical Magic 2may well find itself among thebest Max moviesto watch on one of thebest streaming services.Here's everything we know so far aboutPractical Magic 2from release date, to cast, to plot and so much more. The spell is cast. The date is set. Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman return. Only In Theaters September 18, 2026. Rewatch the original #PracticalMagic now streaming on MAX. pic.twitter.com/SfPT1DduLXMay 6, 2025 Practical Magic 2will arrive in theaters on September 18, 2026. The news was confirmed by an official post on X in May by Warner Bros, accompanied by some magic words from the movie's stars, Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman. They can be heard reciting a spell: \"Tooth of wolf and morning dew. Something old and something new. Let the spell begin to mix. September 18, 2026.\" While it says \"only in theaters\", it's all-but-certain to come to HBO Max after that, since that's Warner Bros. Discovery's official streaming platform. It's where the original 1998Practical Magicjust dropped too, if you want to remind yourself of the magic. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. There's no officialPractical Magic 2trailer yet, which is not surprising considering the cast and crew haven't announced any notice of filming. During an interview withVarietyin February though, Kidman revealed that the sequel is \"moving ahead rapidly\", before shutting down any further questions. I'll be sure to update here when an official trailer drops. As far as thePractical Magic 2cast list goes, it's pretty sparse. But, there's two crucial actors who will be reprising their role, as reported byVariety: It feels as thoughPractical Magic 2wouldn't be possible without the return of Bullock and Kidman as the Owens' sisters, so this casting announcement coming hand-in-hand with revealing the movie's existence makes total sense (and is ahugerelief). To tie the cast together perfectly, we're wondering if Stockard Channing and Dianne Wiest will also reprise their iconic roles as Aunt Franny and Aunt Jet respectively. Both women are still acting, despite being 81 and 77 years old, respectively. There is an important crew member returning, though, and that's Akiva Goldsman who co-wrote the originalPractical Magic.And he's officially back on board for writingPractical Magic 2. Finally, though yet to be confirmed, Joey King is reportedly \"in talks\" to play Sally's daughter (as perVariety) and we'll delve more into the importance of this role in the plot section below. Full spoilers forPractical Magicto follow. Plus, potential spoilers forPractical Magic 2. The originalPractical Magicmovie in 1998 is based on the first novel in the famed series by author, Alice Hoffman. It followed Sally and Gillian, two reluctant witch sisters, who are raised by their aunts in a small town tackling a curse that could stop them from ever finding love. And, as they grow up, they use their gift of practical magic to try to break the wretched curse for good. So, when it comes to the plot ofPractical Magic 2, it marks a return to the books. Hoffman's series consists of four novels;Practical Magic(1995), The Rules of Magic(2017), Magic Lessons(2020)andThe Book of Magic(2021). AndEntertainment Weeklyexclusively revealed in July 2024 thatThe Book of Magicwould be the basis of the sequel's plot. Speaking to EW, producer Denise Di Novi said: \"I think [fans are] going to be very pleased. We're going to be very faithful. We're cognizant to how important those characters and that movie are to so many people. We're not going to reinvent the wheel.\" We know from the official book synopsis that this, the fourth in Hoffman's series, follows \"three generations of the Owens women, and one long-lost brother\", as well as the \"younger generation\" including Kylie Owens, the daughter of Sally. And, of course, there's already talks about casting Sally's daughter, but I won't delve into the synopsis of this book any further for fear of revealing too much. I don't want the same generational curse that haunts the Owens family coming down on me. Never say never. While there's no suggestion that any morePractical Magicmovies are on the way, I can't say for certain that this marks the end. That said, given thatPractical Magic 2is based around Alice Hoffman's conclusive novel of her series, then for Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman's story at least, it feels... well, conclusive. But, while another movie might be out of the question, how about a TV show? The two prequel novels that came betweenPractical MagicandThe Book of Magichave been a focus of previous, though failed, attempts to bringPractical Magicback to life. The most recent by HBO Max as it hoped to create a TV series in 2019. Set to focus on the aunts, Franny and Jet, it failed to get the green light, but perhapsPractical Magic 2can bring the magic back to life? I imagine it will all depend on the success of the movie – if it's a big hit, spin-offs could be worked out pretty quickly.

The improvements are clear and make a big difference throughout the Sony WH-1000XM6, but I’ve selected the three most impactful factors that may convince you XM4 owners out there to upgrade. So, let’s dive straight into things. It’s undeniable. These are thebest Sony headphonesever for noise cancelling. When pitting the XM6 against the XM4 in an ANC test, it wasn’t even a contest. And that says a lot given that the XM4 still put up a strong performance as far as noise cancellation is concerned. Look, the XM4 do well to dispel low-end sounds, and are great if you want to dull harsh noise. When using them, I rarely found it difficult to remain focused on my favorite tracks or TV shows. But the XM6 are a real cut above. It doesn’t matter where I am or what I’m doing, these headphones almost always deliver silence, or at the least, near-silence. In busy, traffic-filled areas, I was totally detached from the world around me. When vacuuming my apartment, disruptive whirring sounds were utterly crushed. And on public transport, it was as if I was traveling alone. The XM6 are kitted out to supply this class-leading ANC. That’s thanks to a new, drastically stronger QN3 HD noise-cancelling processor that channels the abilities of 12 microphones to phase out all ambient sounds. The XM4, meanwhile, have seven fewer mics and a significantly weaker processor. Sure, they had wonderful ANC at the point of launch, but now, they’ve been outclassed by a wide array of rivals – of course the XM6, but also Sony’s own XM5 model and theBose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones, to name just a couple. We rate these as thebest noise cancelling headphoneswhen it comes to pure noise stopping power, and you absolutely will hear the difference if you choose to upgrade. As I mentioned in mySony WH-1000XM6 review, these headphones marry the very best design elements of their two predecessors to perfection. I’m sure a lot of XM4 owners love the foldability of their cans, which is ideal for throwing them in a bag when you’re on the go. And I’m also sure that Sony is under no illusions that removing that feature from the XM5 model put off a lot of XM4 owners who might've considered an upgrade. Thankfully for those people, Sony has listened to its critics and brought folding back from the dead – and improved it. The Sony WH-1000XM6 use fortified metal hinges that are more durable and enduring than those on the XM4. That means you’ll have less to worry about around breakage or damage over the coming years. On top of that, there’s a new magnetic case for you to put the folded-up XM6 into – in my opinion, that’s more practical than the XM4’s zip-up one. But not only do the XM6 fold, they look pretty cool while doing so. Sony’s new cans have largely maintained the slimmer, seamless, rounded design of the XM5 – which already had a more premium look than the XM4 in my view. The headband is greatly improved from that of the XM4, with a less plasticky appearance, a smoother feel, and luxurious levels of comfort thanks to being wider. There’s also a neat paper-like matte consistency to the XM6’s exterior, which looks extremely clean. They feel like a real physical upgrade. Let’s conclude by discussing what matters most on any pair of thebest wireless headphones: sound quality. When we reviewed the Sony WH-1000XM4, we lauded their clean, expressive sound, punchy bass and impressive attention to detail. Their 40mm dynamic drivers – similar to those used in theSony WH-1000XM3before them – are more than capable of handling heavy beats or delicate vocal ballads, with overall audio quality still satisfying me half a decade after launch. But, as you’d hope, the Sony WH-1000XM6 do all of this and then some. In my comparison testing, I found the XM6 produced a more balanced sound, right out of the box. Sony’s new cans were developed alongside a number of well-renowned mastering engineers, and perhaps unsurprisingly, that means there’s a more even sound across all frequencies. The end result is a combination of pumping yet disciplined bass, rich mids, and energetic highs. That new and improved sonic cocktail really makes the XM6 worth the step up in my view. There’s also a ‘noise shaper’ in the XM6, which enhances digital to analog conversion and removes distortion from sudden sound changes, capping off a fantastically controlled listening experience. Another crucial improvement from the XM4 is the XM6’s more nuanced, wider soundstage. Every instrumental element is given plenty of room to breathe, forging open, layered, and hypnotic listening experiences. Yes, the XM6 really are great at immersing you in the music… but also in movies too. That’s thanks to a new feature called 360 Reality Audio Upmix. Just flick Cinema mode on in the Sony Sound Connect app, and the headphones will convert a basic stereo signal into a more expansive format, helping to create a three-dimensional spatial impression. Finally, you’ve still got all the great sound-related features from the XM4. Whether that’s DSEE Extreme upscaling for lower-quality music files, LDAC for ‘hi-res’ Bluetooth listening, or EQ adjustment, you’ll be in for an absolute treat. The XM6 do still have an advantage here, with a 10-band equalizer giving you elevated levels of control, and that improved ANC I mentioned will keep you even more engrossed in the music. You get the picture – the XM6 really do have all bases covered, and you will immediately feel a clear difference moving from the old model to the new.

    "title": "AI powering a “dramatic surge” in cyberthreats as automated scans hit 36,000 per second",
    "article_text": "AI-fuelled cyberattacks are seeing a huge rise When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It won’t come as a surprise to many cybersecurity professionals, but AI is behind a drastic rise in the number of cyberattacks, with new research from Fortinet revealing the apparenty scale of the problem. The study found that year-on-year, automated scanning activity has seen a 16.7% increase, with 36,000 scans per second recorded globally - with the research describing threat actors as “shifting left” towards vulnerable digital assets “earlier in the attack lifecycle”, in particular, Remote Desktop Protocol, IoT systems, and Session Initiation Protocols. Infostealershave been threatening organizationsfor a long time, but this research has unveiled a staggering 500% increase in available logs from compromised systems - meaning over 1.7 billion stolen credentials are circulating on the dark web, noting, “this flood of stolen data has led to a sharp increase in targeted cyberattacks against businesses and individuals.\" The report warns cybercriminals are taking advantage of these login details too, with a 42% increase in compromised credentials observed for sale. Interestingly, zero-day attacks only account for a “small percentage” of threats, and cybercriminals are increasingly using “live of the land” vulnerabilities to remain undetected. The Ransomware-as-a-Service landscape is expanding, with new groups emerging and old players solidifying their gains. Ransomhub was the most active group in 2024, claiming 13% of victims, with LockBit 3.0 (12%), Play (8%) and Medusa (4%) all following close behind. Suchransomwareattacks are targeting one country in particular, with the United States taking 61% of incidents, followed by the UK at 6%, and Canada at 5% - a strong indication of the trend against American organizations. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! “Our 2025 Global Threat Landscape Report makes it clear: cybercriminals are scaling faster than ever, using AI and automation to gain the upper hand,” said Derek Manky, Chief Security Strategist and Global Vice President of Threat Intelligence at FortiGuard Labs. “Defenders must abandon outdated security playbooks and transition to proactive, intelligence-driven strategies that incorporate AI, zero trust architectures, and continuous threat exposure management.” Ellen has been writing for almost four years, with a focus on post-COVID policy whilst studying for BA Politics and International Relations at the University of Cardiff, followed by an MA in Political Communication.

    "title": "Russia-Ukraine peace ‘up to them’ – State Department",
    "article_text": "Washington has done what it can to bring Moscow and Kiev to the negotiating table but won’t wait indefinitely for results, US State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce told Fox News in an interview on Saturday. Russia and Ukraine held their first direct peace talks in three years on May 16 in Istanbul, agreeing to submit detailed ceasefire proposals. Earlier this week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov proposed holding a second round of negotiations in Istanbul on June 2, though Kiev has yet to confirm its participation. “This is not a long-term thing. This is not simply standard operating procedure. It’s not going to go on for months or years,”Bruce said, when asked whether the US had set a concrete timetable for the peace process. “We have gotten people to the table, and they know what we are requiring. But it’s really up to them,”she added. US President Donald Trump has previously warned that he would walk away from the process if no progress is made. He also threatened to impose new sanctions on Moscow should it fail to reach an agreement with Kiev.“Now, if for some reason one of the two parties makes it very difficult, we’re just going to say: ‘You’re foolish. You’re fools. You’re horrible people’ – and we’re going to just take a pass,”Trump told reporters in April. Moscow has rejected accusations of stalling the talks, saying it intends to present a document outlining its terms at the next meeting. Russian diplomats have also accused Kiev of deceiving Washington and“playing games”instead of negotiating in good faith.",

    "title": "Syrian leader threatened by militants who put him in power – WaPo",
    "article_text": "The insurgents who toppled previous Syrian leader Bashar Assad’s government and brought new interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa to power could now threaten his political survival, the Washington Post wrote on Saturday. Multiple militant groups led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) took power in Damascus late last year. They included thousands of foreign fighters who remain in Syria, some of whom have ties to extremist groups like Islamic State and other radical factions, the newspaper wrote. While al-Sharaa“seems intent on keeping”some of them around as he courts Western support, the“hard-line Sunni Muslim militants”are already giving him trouble, WaPo wrote. Some of the militants were involved in massacres of Alawites along the Syrian coast in March, the outlet added. At least 1,300 people, including 973 civilians, were killed in the span of a few days, according to local media. Christian and Druze communities in Syria have also reportedly faced bloody sectarian violence since the change in power. The most radical of the foreign Islamists are“turning their ire”on al-Sharaa, because the new president has not implemented Sharia law and allegedly cooperated with the US and Türkiye to target extremist factions in Syria, WaPo wrote. Earlier in May, US President Donald Trump met with al-Sharaa and announced the lifting of sanctions, most of which had been imposed during the rule of Assad. Al-Sharaa has called Trump’s move“a historic and courageous decision, which alleviates the suffering of the people, contributes to their rebirth, and lays the foundations for stability in the region.” Shortly after the Trump-Sharaa meeting, a top ideologue of Salafi jihadism, Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi, issued a fatwa branding the new Syrian leader an“infidel.” Syria remains a hotbed of extremist activity and could destabilize at any time, according to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The country has become“a playground for jihadist groups, including ISIS and others,”the top diplomat warned last week, adding that it could be“weeks – not many months – away from potential collapse and a full-scale civil war.”",

    "title": "Defeating Russia impossible – German foreign minister",
    "article_text": "It has been clear from the very beginning of the Ukraine conflict that Russia cannot be defeated, particularly due to its nuclear status, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has told the SZ newspaper. Kiev’s Western backers, including top officials in Germany, France, and the UK, as well as the US under former President Joe Biden’s administration, repeatedly stated the intent to inflict a“strategic defeat”on Moscow in the Ukraine conflict, or at least to ensure that it does not emerge victorious. That justification has been used to support continued military assistance to Kiev. Wadephul admitted on Friday that it was obvious the conflict between Moscow and Kiev can only be resolved in a diplomatic way. “It was clear from the beginning that this war would most likely end through a negotiated settlement,”Germany’s top diplomat told SZ in a lengthy interview. “One thing is true: a complete defeat in the sense of a capitulation by nuclear-armed Russia could not have been expected,”the minister stated, adding that“we have now become a little more honest”in this regard. He still maintained that Kiev’s troops have been“successfully defending”against Moscow’s forces, although the Ukrainian military has been losing ground along the entire front over the past several months. The foreign minister maintained it was important to help Kiev get a“strong negotiating position”at peace talks and claimed that Russia was“threatening”Germany as he justified a planned military buildup and increase in defense expenditures. He also said that relations between Moscow and Berlin could no longer be described as a“clear peace situation.” Berlin has taken an even more hardline position on Russia under new Chancellor Friedrich Merz. In the weeks since taking office, Merz has lifted range restrictions on Ukrainian strikes with German-supplied missiles and hinted at the possibility of providing Kiev with Taurus missiles, which have a range of 500km and could reach Moscow. Germany has also announced a new military aid package for Kiev worth €5.2 billion ($5.6 billion), which Berlin says would be allocated mostly to long-range weaponry production inside Ukraine. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov reacted to Merz’s statements by saying that Berlin’s“direct involvement in the war is now obvious.”Germany already followed a similar“slippery slope”a couple of times in the last century“down toward its own collapse,”he added.",

    "title": "Musk explains his black eye",
    "article_text": "Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk raised a lot of eyebrows when he appeared at a press conference with US President Donald Trump at the Oval Office on Friday with what appeared to be a black eye. The event was dedicated to the tech billionaire’s departure from his leadership role in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a task force aimed at cutting wasteful US federal spending. When asked about what had happened to his eye by journalists, Musk replied that he had been“horsing around”with his son,“Lil X.” “I said go ahead and punch me in the face and he did,”the entrepreneur recalled.“I did not really feel much at the time, and then I guess it bruises up.” Trump said that he did not notice Musk’s black eye until it was mentioned by the journalists.“X could do it. If you knew X, he could do it,”the president added. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO also joked that he“was not anywhere near France”when his injury happened, in a nod to an incident earlier this week in which France’s First Lady, Brigitte Macron, slapped President Emmanuel Macron in the face in front of cameras as the pair was about to exit a plane during a visit to Vietnam. On Thursday, the New York Times published a report, citing unnamed sources, who claimed that Musk has been consuming an alarming amount of drugs, including taking ketamine“often, sometimes daily”and mixing it with other drugs, as well as using ecstasy and psychedelic mushrooms. When asked about the article, the tech billionaire dismissed the NYT, pointing out that it is“the same publication that got a Pulitzer Prize for false reporting on Russiagate.” Trump thanked Musk for his work in charge of DOGE, while the Tesla and SpaceX CEO assured that his departure is“not the end”of the agency.“I will continue to be visiting here and be a friend and adviser to the president,”Musk said.",

    "title": "Macron threatens China with NATO expansion",
    "article_text": "French President Emmanuel Macron, speaking at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore on Friday, urged China to prevent its ally, North Korea, from deploying troops on“European soil”if it hopes to prevent an expanded NATO presence in Asia. In April, Pyongyang admitted that its troops were assisting Moscow in liberating Kursk Region, which was invaded by Ukrainian forces last August but has since been reclaimed by Russia. That month, Russian General Staff Chief Valery Gerasimov told President Vladimir Putin that North Korean troops had demonstrated“high professionalism, courage, and heroism”in the operation. During Moscow’s Victory Day celebrations, Putin publicly thanked them for their defense of Kursk Region. “But what’s happening with North Korea being present alongside Russia on European soil is a big question for all of us,”Macron said.“If China doesn’t want NATO being involved in Southeast Asia, they should clearly prevent the DPRK from being engaged on European soil,”he added. Macron also reflected on his past stance, stating,“l had objected to NATO having any role in Asia because, for me, ‘N’ is for North Atlantic, and I don’t believe in being enrolled in someone else’s strategic rivalry.” France’s resistance to the bloc’s Asian expansion was evident when it led efforts to reject a proposed NATO office in Tokyo in 2023, with media reports citing Macron’s vocal opposition. At the time, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg hinted at opening the office in response to growing military ties between China and Russia, underscored by their joint patrols over the Sea of Japan and East China Sea, which had prompted South Korea and Japan to scramble fighter jets. Last year, US President Joe Biden and other Western leaders urged Beijing to rein in Pyongyang’s deepening military ties with Moscow, highlighting concerns regarding North Korea’s growing involvement. The US and South Korea condemned North Korea’s admission of its role in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.“With their public admission of the deployment, while claiming they are fully in accordance with international law, they are once again mocking the international community,”Seoul’s foreign ministry said, according to Yonhap News Agency. A US State Department spokesperson, citing Reuters, noted that Moscow’s training of North Korean soldiers violates UN Security Council resolutions, and urged both nations to cease their unlawful cooperation.",

    "title": "EU state raises alarm about growing illiteracy",
    "article_text": "Almost a third of the population in Austria has poor reading skills, signaling an alarming trend, the EU country’s government statistics office has said. The decline is particularly noticeable among those with jobs that require medium or low qualifications, Statistics Austria said in a statement earlier this week. In Austria, which has a population of nine million, a total of 29.0% or around 2.6 million people have a low level of literacy, according to data on the agency’s website. The number of those who have problems with reading increased by 11.9% between 2012 and 2023, the figures show. The average literacy level among Austrians aged 16 to 65 stands at 254 points, which is significantly below the average of 260 points set by the OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development). People from 16 to 24 performed above the OECD average, while older people appear to have significantly lower reading skills than the expected level, the agency said. “The differences in reading skills among adults are large, and this gap has continued to widen,”Tobias Thomas, Director General of Statistics Austria, was cited as saying. There has been“a particularly strong decline”in the consumption of complex reading materials such as newspapers and magazines, with the Austrians mainly reading emails and other shorter texts, the agency noted. According to Statistics Austria, the number of those with low day-to-day math skills also grew by 6.7% between 2012 and 2023, amounting to 22.6% of the population. Russia’s state-owned pollster VTSIOM said last year that“reading remains a popular means of obtaining knowledge and information among the Russians”despite what it called“serious competition”from visual media. In the poll carried out in November 2024, some 87% of respondents said that they had read something over the previous week. Fiction topped the chart of the most popular reading materials (40%) in Russia, leaving news and social media posts in second place (37%), according to VTSIOM’s figures.",

    "article_text": "Tech billionaire Elon Musk, a major ally of US President Donald Trump, has been consuming an alarming amount of drugs, the New York Times alleged on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter. The report came out shortly after Musk announced that he would step down from his leadership role in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a task force aimed at cutting wasteful US federal spending. Although the CEO of SpaceX, Tesla, and X had admitted in the past to taking ketamine prescribed for depression about every two weeks, the NYT wrote that he has“developed a far more serious habit,”as his drug consumption“went well beyond occasional use.” The Times cited its sources as saying that Musk had been using ketamine“often, sometimes daily,”and mixing it with other drugs, as well as taking ecstasy and psychedelic mushrooms. The businessman reportedly travels with a daily medication box that contains about 20 pills, including ones marked as Adderall, a stimulant used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). He has also been warned in advance about random drug tests of SpaceX employees, the Times said. In 2018, the Times reported that some board members at Tesla were worried about his use of the sleep drug Ambien. The Wall Street Journal reported last year that senior executives at SpaceX and Tesla were also concerned about Musk’s consumption of drugs, including LSD and cocaine. Musk dodged a reporter’s question about his alleged drug use at a press conference with Trump at the Oval Office on Friday, dismissing the Times as“the same publication that got a Pulitzer Prize for false reporting on Russiagate.” He said in 2024 that“not even trace quantities were found of any drugs or alcohol”in his system over the three years of tests at SpaceX. Musk said that his departure is“not the end of DOGE,”whose team will grow over time.“I will continue to be visiting here and be a friend and adviser to the president,”Musk said at the White House.",

    "title": "I took a 4-day men’s haircutting course for the first time – here’s what I learnt (apart from failure)",
    "article_text": "Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Women People Women Women Wellness Wellness Wellness Wellness Living Singapore Singapore Living Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Obsessions Style & Beauty Experiences Travel Dining Dining Travel Experiences Experiences Singapore Style & Beauty Style & Beauty It's not every day that one gets to learn something totally new. So when CNA Lifestyle's Grace Yeoh chanced upon the course, she signed up out of curiosity – and learnt way more than haircutting techniques. The men's haircutting course by Kimage Hairdressing School taught me more than just how to cut hair for men. (Photo: CNA/Grace Yeoh) This audio is generated by an AI tool. Learning a new skill that has nothing to do with your day job is the quickest way to be humbled. Or so I realised after attending a men’s haircutting course at the Kimage Hairdressing School earlier this year. I was influenced to sign up after seeing a friend, who’d finished the same course previously, use her newfound skills on her very trusting male partner. The final product appeared passable by salon standards, at least according to a photo of his haircut; and doable by my standards, according to my lack of self-awareness. Besides, I figured it would be easier to find my own willing male guinea pigs to practise my skills. Men generally cut their hair more frequently than women. And since they also have shorter hair to work with, there seemed less possibility of messing up. Maybe I could even turn this into a side hustle. Like I said, the quickest way to be humbled. For S$460, I was taken through a four-day course on the basics of men’s haircutting by a highly patient trainer. Participants work on mannequin heads – it was for the best, judging by my handiwork – and only move on to human canvases in the following course. Hair sectioning:This involves dividing hair into manageable portions before cutting, which helps to ensure more precise and consistent cuts. Super straightforward – until it wasn’t. I hadn’t realised how embarrassingly bad I was at executing neat parting lines. My mannequin head looked like it’d been through war. After spending 30 minutes on hair sectioning, mostly redoing messy portioning and zigzag lines, my trainer redid some of my work in a fraction of the time and with effortless precision. Scissors handling techniques:One such technique called “scissors over fingers” involves cutting hair held between fingers, typical for layering. Like many left-handers, I’d been using scissors with my right hand since I was young. In the hairdressing class, however, this meant also holding the comb in my right hand, together with the scissors, for efficiency. All while learning to snip by moving only my thumb. Chalk that up to another mental workout lefties never asked for. Finger cutting techniques: The angle that a stylist positions their fingers to control hair while cutting determines the final shape, desired or otherwise. Take vertical finger placement. The pointer and middle finger are held up vertically, so that the hair between the fingers is pulled perpendicular to the head. Unfortunately, I couldn't seem to maintain the position – key to getting even layers and balanced weight distribution. The end result? Unintentional graduation, uneven sections and a clear answer that I am decidedly not the nextDavid Gan. Different layering cuts at horseshoe section:The horseshoe section in hairdressing refers to a curved section that runs from temple to temple around the crown. It separates the top from the sides and back. Different layering cuts done at this section help control volume, shape and movement in the final haircut. The techniques were identical to what I’d learnt trimming hair on the rest of the head. But it was as though I’d been asked to execute an entirely different skill. Diagrams didn’t help either. “Square layering” and “round layering” may as well have been written in Wingdings. My visual-spatial ability was MIA too – but thankfully, my muscle memory wasn’t. When I eventually found my flow state, it was like I’d never struggled. Texturising:This refers to cutting techniques used to remove bulk, add movement or create softness in the hair without altering the overall length. It enhances the haircut’s shape and flow. I focused on learning how to thin hair, using thinning scissors to blend or lighten thicker sections. It always looked deceptively simple (from the customer’s chair, of course), but the key was to ensure consistency across the entire head. Unfortunately, and to no one’s surprise, my inconsistency in every other area of life followed me to hairdressing. One patch ended up so sparse, it seemed my mannequin had run straight through a lawn mower. Multiple times. Handling clipper and attachments:Hold the clipper firmly with thumb and fingers around the body. Keep the blade flat against the scalp for even cutting. Tilt slightly for blending. Use smooth, consistent strokes, typically upward or with the grain of hair growth. The instructions and demonstration were clear. I knew how to handle a clipper and its guard attachments, which control the length of hair being cut. I just hoped the distance from awareness to action wouldn’t be another gaping chasm. Clipper cutting and blending:I now had to use the clippers I’d learnt to handle to actually cut some hair, while seamlessly transitioning between different lengths, such as from the sides to top. A technique known as the “clipper-over-comb” requires using a comb to lift hair, then moving the clippers over the excess hair protruding from the comb. It’s often used to control the blend manually, avoiding harsh lines. And after four days of backbreaking work, my mannequin finally stopped looking like it was in witness protection. I didn’t need four days to learn that hairdressers are deeply underappreciated or to resolve never again to complain about the price of a haircut. Neither did I need that long – the first 30 minutes of Day 1 were sufficient – to convince me I had a sizeable absence of talent that people would sooner pay menotto cut their hair. But I had to get my own hands dirty, struggle to perfect a simple snip and overcome my frustration whenever I couldn’t – to realise that hairdressers, more than anyone else, know that hair is neverjusthair. It’s the reason people travel across the island just to see their longtime stylist. It’s why so many speak oftheir relationship with their hairdresseras if they were family. And it’s why some feel genuine grief when their hairdresser retires or closes shop and they have to find a new go-to. The emotional connection to hair – and what it represents – is also why the classic onscreen makeover moment never gets old. My favourites tend to revolve around female leads, from The Princess Diaries to Miss Congeniality, or the fashion and lifestyle “make-betters” on reality TV series Queer Eye. Then TikTok gave the hallowed trope a fresh spin withviral barber transformation videos. With just a pair of scissors, unassuming men are turned into the next romantic comedy heartthrobs, complete with tapered fades, textured fringes and the ultimate accessory: Anewfound confidence. So an external transformation may start superficially, but it doesn’t contradict the idea of self-acceptance. If anything, many times, it paves the way for an internal shift. And I can only imagine what a privilege it would be to help another see themselves in a new light.

    "title": "We all know the health risks of drinking – is there a 'least bad' alcohol choice?",
    "article_text": "Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Women People Women Women Wellness Wellness Wellness Wellness Living Singapore Singapore Living Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Obsessions Style & Beauty Experiences Travel Dining Dining Travel Experiences Experiences Singapore Wellness Wellness We all know about the health risks of drinking. But if you’re going to partake, it’s natural to want to minimise the damage. (Photo: The New York Times) If you’ve heard thatred wine is better for youthan beer or liquor, or that clear liquor like vodka or gin is less harmful than dark liquor like rum or whiskey, we have bad news. “Alcohol is alcohol,” said Jurgen Rehm, a senior scientist at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto. Drinking any type of alcohol,in any amount, is bad for health. Still, experts say, it’s sometimes not reasonable or even practical for people to avoid alcohol entirely. So if you’re going to drink, there are some strategies you can take to reduce your risk, and to avoid some of the other unpleasant effects of drinking, like hangovers. When you have a drink, your body turns the ethanol that’s present in the alcoholic beverage into a “really nasty substance” called acetaldehyde, which can damage your DNA, said Timothy Stockwell, an alcohol researcher at the University of Victoria in Canada. Many tissues in the body, including those in the mouth, throat, liver, colon and breasts, are susceptible to this harm. And when that DNA gets repaired, cancerous mutations may arise. This is why drinking increases the risk for developing at least seven types of cancer, said Katherine Keyes, a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University. Excessive alcohol use–which includes having eight or more drinks per week for women or 15 or more per week for men; or four or more drinks per occasion for women or five or more for men–is also linked with many other health conditions. These include heart and liver disease, depression, anxiety and memory problems, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The more ethanol in your drink, the more harmful it is, Dr Keyes said. One way to assess this is to look at a drink’s alcohol by volume, or ABV, which manufacturers must list on product labels. If you’re choosing between two beers of the same size, for instance, and one is 4 per cent ABV and the other is 8 per cent, the 4 per cent beer will expose you to half as much ethanol. In general, beer has less ethanol than wine per ounce, and wine has less than liquors like vodka and tequila, Dr Keyes said. But there can be large variations within these categories, Dr Stockwell said. Some strong beers, for instance, have ABVs that are higher than those of some wines (or even some liquors, on the extreme end). A good rule for reducing your exposure to ethanol is to generally choose drinks with lower ABVs, the experts said. But it’s important to pay attention to how much you’re drinking as well. A standard 12-ounce pour of a 5 per cent ABV beer typically has the same amount of ethanol as five ounces of a 12 per cent wine or 1.5 ounces (or a shot) of a 40 per cent liquor. It can be tricky to calculate the ABV of cocktails, said Dr Peng-Sheng (Brian) Ting, an assistant professor of clinical medicine at the Tulane University School of Medicine, since they are often made with sodas, juices and sometimes multiple types of alcohol. For this reason, he recommends sticking with wine or beer in situations where you want to know exactly how much ethanol you’re consuming. Some types of alcohol are also quite high in calories, which when consumed in excess can increase the risk of weight gain and obesity. And some cocktail mixers, like juices and sodas, can containadded sugars, also raising the risk for obesity and other health conditions like Type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Dr Keyes also recommended against consuming alcoholic drinks that are mixed with caffeine (like espresso martinis or vodka Red Bulls). The energy boost you get from them may make you feel less inebriated than you really are, potentially prompting you to drink more and to become more drunk, Dr Keyes said. And while there’s no evidence that darker liquors are more harmful to health than clear ones, there islimited research suggestingthat some darker liquors can cause more severe hangovers, said Damaris Rohsenow, a professor at the Center for Alcohol and Addiction Studies at Brown University. Darker alcohols (like bourbon, rum and brandy) tend to have higher levels of congeners, substances that are created during the fermentation process and contribute to a drink’s flavor, aroma and color. More congeners typically translates to worse hangovers, Dr Rohsenow said. There can be exceptions to the “clear is better” rule, however, Dr Rohsenow added. Some tequilas, which can be clear or light-coloured, for instance, can be high in congeners and may lead to worse hangovers.

    "title": "Can you reverse tooth decay? Here's what dental experts say",
    "article_text": "Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Women People Women Women Wellness Wellness Wellness Wellness Living Singapore Singapore Living Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Obsessions Style & Beauty Experiences Travel Dining Dining Travel Experiences Experiences Singapore Wellness Wellness Advertisements for special toothpastes, powders and gums suggest that it’s possible. (Art: The New York Times/Sean Dong) Most of us know that the best defence against tooth decay–or damage to the surface, or enamel, of your teeth–is to limit sugary foods and to brush and floss regularly. But once that damage has begun, or even progressed into a cavity, can you reverse it? Online advertisements for products like cavity-undoingchewing gumsand enamel-rebuildingtoothpastesandtooth powderssuggest that you can. We asked experts if they work, and if it’s possible to backtrack on tooth decay in the first place. Your mouth is home to both good and bad bacteria, which adhere to your teeth in a sticky layer called plaque. The bad bacteria love to snack on sugary, starchy foods–like sweetened sodas, gummy candies, pastries and fruit juices–and then turn them into acids that, over time, may pull important minerals from your teeth. The more these bad bacteria eat, the more acids they produce that dissolve essential minerals like calcium and phosphate, said John Featherstone, a professor emeritus of preventive and restorative dental sciences at the University of California, San Francisco, School of Dentistry. This dissolution is called demineralisation, Dr Featherstone said, and it can weaken your enamel over months to years until it eventually caves in and forms a cavity. How quickly this damage, or tooth decay, develops depends mostly on how much of these starchy, sugary foods you consume and how well you clean your teeth, he said. Tooth decay is technically reversible, but only if it is caught early, said Dr Margherita Fontana, a researcher and professor of cariology at the University of Michigan School of Dentistry. During the earliest stage of tooth decay, when some minerals have been lost just below the tooth’s surface but a cavity has not yet formed, you (or more likely, your dentist) might notice a white–or sometimes brown or black–spot on your tooth, Dr Fontana said. At this point, you can reverse tooth decay by adding those important minerals back into your teeth–a process called remineralisation, said Dr Yasmi O Crystal, an adjunct clinical professor of paediatric dentistry at the NYU College of Dentistry. Your saliva, which contains calcium and phosphate, naturally remineralises your teeth all the time, such as after eating a sugary snack, Dr Crystal said. But because most of us eat many foods that bad bacteria like, we can’t depend on saliva alone to prevent or reverse decay, Dr Featherstone said. The easiest, cheapest and most effective way to support remineralisation is to brush your teeth with toothpaste that contains fluoride, Dr Crystal said. Fluoride not only reduces the amount of acid that bad bacteria produce, but it also helps saliva to more effectively replenish your teeth with lost minerals by attracting calcium and phosphate to them, Dr Crystal said. The fluoride found in most drinking water also bolsters this process, Dr Fontana said, especially when paired with fluoride toothpaste. This cavity-fighting duo is enough to reverse early tooth decay in most people, the experts said. But some, like those more prone to decay because they produce less saliva (such as smokers, older adults, postmenopausal women and people taking certain medications), may benefit from more concentrated fluoride products. These include prescription-strength fluoride toothpastes, as well as mouth rinses, varnishes and gels that dentists may apply during a visit or prescribe to use at home. Chewingsugar-free gum, in addition to your regular oral hygiene routine, may also help reverse early tooth decay, Dr Featherstone said. Chewing produces saliva that, according to the American Dental Association, contains even more enamel-building minerals than the saliva your mouth makes without stimulation from food. Gum may also prevent tooth decay by removing food particles from your teeth, Dr Fontana said. Once tooth decay has caused a cavity, however, you can’t reverse it and the cavity should be filled, Dr Crystal said. But you can stop a cavity from getting worse, said Dr Domenick T Zero, a professor at the Indiana University School of Dentistry. Regular dental cleanings and proper oral hygiene–brushing for at least two minutes twice a day and flossing once a day–will keep cavity-causing bacteria out of the hole and prevent it from building up on your teeth, he said. Some limited research has suggested that some ingredients likexylitolandhydroxyapatitein products like remineralising tooth powders, toothpastes and chewing gums may help reverse tooth decay by adding minerals back to your teeth. However, all of the experts we spoke with said there wasn’t enough evidence to show that they’re more effective at reversing decay than fluoride, or that they work at all. Amongthe handful of small clinical trialsthat have looked into hydroxyapatite toothpastes, for instance,at leasttwowere funded by the product manufacturers. Dr Fontana also said that these products had been tested mostly on people who are not prone to cavities, so it’s challenging to know how effective they may be for people who actually develop tooth decay. “No one has shown that any of these products come even close to what fluoride toothpaste does,” she said. As with many products you see advertised on social media, if they seem too good to be true, they probably are, Dr Crystal said–“there are no shortcuts.” By Katie Camero © The New York Times Company The article originally appeared inThe New York Times.

    "article_text": "Experiences Experiences Experiences Experiences Obsessions Obsessions Obsessions Obsessions People People People People Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Experiences Experiences For your next Italian getaway, a taste of la dolce vita. Beginning this summer, visitors can stay in a plush villa in Tuscany through the tour company Abercrombie & Kent, whose A&K Private Estates: The Chianti Collection includes five villas in the Chianti area. Above, the Villa Il Santo, an eight-bedroom abode. (Photo: Abercrombie & Kent) A raft of new and renovated properties is opening in Italy just in time for the lazy, sun-drenched days of summer. From Tuscany to Puglia, here are a handful of newcomers and thoughtful restorations, including a boutique hotel in a 16th-century Baroque mansion in Lecce and a collection of luxe villas in the mountains of Chianti. Dating to the early 1920s, this one-time Tuscan villa, and then pensione (or boarding house), by the Ligurian Sea has been transformed into an adults-only beach escape. Where there were once dozens of rooms, there are now just 18 rooms and suites. Allhave terraces or verandas; bamboo furniture that lends a breezy, seaside feel; and products fromOfficina Profumo-Farmaceutica di Santa Maria Novella, the venerable Italian fragrance and personal care brand. If you really want to spread out, consider booking the two-story casita,La Villetta, which has a garden and a plunge pool. Created byCollezione Em(whose hotels include theGrand Hotel Minervain Florence and theViolino d’Oroin Venice), Pensione America is part of theLeading Hotels of the Worldcollection of luxury properties. You can delight in la dolce vita amid the gardens, on a tennis court and in the pool decorated with Sicilian tiles. Go for a stroll or ride on one of the free bikes to the nearby beaches for which the area is known. Begin each morning at the hotel’s restaurantand indulge in sweet crepes or eggs in tomato sauce. At lunchtime, you’ll find a menu inspired by the surrounding waters, with seafood dishes such as ravioli with shellfish and spaghetti with arselle (little clams). The restaurant is also open for dinner. Prices from €1,600, or about US$1,800 (S$2,322) a night. On the harbour of Porto Ercole on Tuscany’s Argentario peninsula (about an hour-and-a-half-to-two-hour drive from Rome), La Roqqa underwent a three-year renovation and is now a 50-room-and-suite boutique hotel designed by the Milan-basedPalomba Serafini Associatistudio. Bold lighting and furniture from the 1960s and ’70s add nostalgic touches to the common areas, while many of the minimalist guest rooms are awash in the colours of the surrounding land and sea. Suites, in contrast, sport lighter hues. All rooms have outdoor spaces with views of hills and trees, or the sea. But why just look from afar when you can get up close? Stretch out under an umbrella atIsolotto Beach Club, part of La Roqqa, on a sandy stretch of beach amid the otherwise rocky coast. Take in the Mediterranean air by hiking, cycling or horseback-riding. Treat yourself to a massage or a facial, or spend some time in the sauna. The hotel, part ofMiramis Hospitality, has its own yacht that can take you to nearby islands, such asGiglioand Giannutri, and can arrange experiences like wine tasting and cooking lessons. If you’d rather someone else did the cooking, order seafood by the water at Isolotto Beach Club, or head over to the hotel’sSciroccorestaurant for family-style Tuscan dishes (and wines, of course) including homemade pastas and dumplings like gnudi with sheep ricotta and nettle, cacio e pepe sauce and fermented lime.Watch day turn to night at theScirocco Rooftop Bar, where you can sip a cocktail — the hotel has several that it says were inspired by Caravaggio paintings — as you gaze out over theCorsini Botanical Gardenand the harbour. Prices from €380 a night. The historical centre of Lecce, in the Apulia region, is rife with Baroque buildings, including this boutique hotel in a limestone mansion that dates to 1557. After a four-year renovation, the property is now an 18-room-and-suite getaway that mixes contemporary design with vaulted ceilings and graceful arches. The rooms are elegant and spare, with 18th-century wooden doors, and each nods to the building’s past, with different touches, including stone walls, brick-and-lime floors, and walls adorned with frescoes. For a special occasion, book the more-than-1,000-sq-ft Suite Zimara, with a balcony, two bathrooms and your own hammam, Jacuzzi and fireplace. Palazzo Zimara is in the heart of the city, so you can go out for a meal or dine al fresco at the hotel’sLa Bocca restaurant. In the mornings, sip caffe leccese, iced coffee sweetened with almond syrup, and sample pastries and local cheeses. Later, try Italian dishes that change with the seasons, like a misticanza salad with peach, walnut and cocoa; and croaker fish, puttanesca style. Unwind with a glass of wine while people-watching from the terrace atRadino Wine Bistro. The hotel, part of theD’Angelo Family Collection, a family-run hospitality group, has plans to also open a rooftop bar next year. Prices from €240a night. This summer, the luxury travel companyAbercrombie & Kentis rolling out five estates for families and groups seeking plush villas in Chianti, the Tuscan region beloved for its mountains and wine. The properties include renovated farmhouses and wine estates with romantic views of hills, olive groves and vineyards. Your trip begins at the airport, where a private car will pick you up. Rates include a case of Tuscan wine and a hamper of food — think homemade bread, local olives and cheese — as well as breakfast, housekeeping and experiences, which include welcome and farewell dinners, a wine-tasting on the estate (or in the winery on your property), a cooking class with — who else? — an Italian chef and a photography session, as well as private return airport transfers. Ranging from five to 10 bedrooms, the estates have amenities such as pools, outdoor kitchens, gyms, wine cellars and a concierge who can book restaurants and private chefs, and arrange car rentals and spa appointments. Prices start at US$55,000 a week for up to 10 people atVilla Pianvecchio, a five-bedroom farmhouse on a wine estate. (If you were splitting that among 10 people it would be about US$786 per person a night.) The other Chianti estates areVilla Castiglioni, with six bedrooms from US$65,000 a week;Villa Il Santo, with eight bedrooms from US$70,000;Villa Tavernaccia, with eight bedrooms from $90,000; andIl Cellese, with 10 bedrooms from US$90,000. The new estates are currently available for 20 per cent off those prices. By Stephanie Rosenbloom © The New York Times. This article originally appeared inThe New York Times.

These new “experts” even come with the ability to use slang to appear relatable and relevant to their target demographic. Embracing the newest technology is yet another cultural shift in the financial services landscape that disrupts some of the norms in the industry. We’ve seen it with the development ofrobo-advisersand the rise of “finfluencers”. Cue the traditionalists turning their noses up at how far thefinancial advice fieldhas strayed from its origins. After all, future iterations of GenAI really could accelerate the long-prophesied doomsday for flesh-and-blood financial planners. But now isn’t the time for humans to declare defeat. Until advanced versions of the technology arrive, people should be doubling down on the one significant advantage they have against their digital counterparts: soft skills. Providinginvesting adviceis only one facet of the job. The role is part therapist, accountability coach and teacher. Real people can push back against panicked requests to sell in a turbulent market instead of simply executing an order. A person understands how and when to ask more questions to determine the reason behind a request for conservative investments such as bonds, even at a young age when it’s detrimental to be overly cautious. The problem for many young adults is that accessing this more holistic approach, which goes beyond stats and data, is costly. Financial advisers usually get paid in one of two ways: assets under management (AUM)–a percentage of a customer’s investments each year–or a flat-rate fee. The latter varies based on the level of service. A comprehensive financial plan can cost thousands of dollars. AUM ranges from 0.25 per cent to 1.5 per cent, with some advisers reducing the cost as the size of a portfolio grows. The greater barrier to entry is the possible minimum investable assets requirement, which often hovers between US$500,000 and US$1 million. Fifteen years ago, these factors prohibited access for millennials. This reality paved the way for cost-effective alternatives in the form of robo-advisers, such as Betterment and Wealthfront, with significantly lower AUM and no asset minimums. The companies sent shockwaves through the industry as many wondered if machines would finally usurp man. As years passed, it became obvious the two could have a symbiotic relationship. In fact, it turned out millennials ultimately did crave some soft skills, which led to platforms launching versions that gave customers access to humans. Instead of cratering the industry, the robo-advisers forced their living counterparts to compete in different ways. Some diversified their services, including offering virtual counsel, and others targeted less-affluent clientele. While it’s easy for the regular consumer to conflate a robo-adviser with GenAI, the two are not the same. The latter is built on language-learning models instead of the mathematical-centric AI models and machine-learning algorithms that provide the underpinnings for companies like Betterment and Wealthfront. Gen Z investors may be more attracted to GenAI because it can simulate how people speak and even look. Plus, the cohort is more primed to be early adopters of the tool. They’ve grown used to receiving free, one-size-fits-all money guidance online. A stunning 77 per cent of teens and 20-somethings use online platforms and social media to answer their money questions, according to a 2025 Credit Karma survey. But they should remember that the technology’s modern iteration is new and, like humans, fallible, which results in inaccurate or misleading information known as “hallucinations.” Even with all these issues to resolve, companies are bullish on GenAI’s ability to spit out 24/7 guidance and woo new clients. Arta Finance, a wealth management startup, is at the forefront of providing an AI financial adviser with Arta AI. The “AI agents”, as the company refers to its investment planner, product specialist, and research analyst offerings, can respond to queries by voice or text (and do so in the aforementioned generationally-appropriate slang). Arta is only available to accredited investors and offers access to human professionals, but the company plans to make Arta AI available to other financial services companies. A move that could give all kinds of retail investors access to its product. It’s likely that plenty of platforms won’t wait to license the service and instead will develop their own. Robinhood Markets plans to launch Robinhood Cortex, an AI-powered digital research assistant, this fall. The app offers a variety of investing options, including Robinhood Strategies, the company’s robo-adviser. Unlike Arta Finance’s offering of real-life advisers alongside its AI agents, Robinhood customers can currently only access a support team, which is mostly available to handle administrative questions. And that’s a huge pitfall. Companies that don’t prioritise establishing relationships with real professionals can cause retail investors to panic in turbulent times, especially novice ones who are able to access advanced opportunities, such as trading options. Granting inexperienced customers access to higher-level investing products without proper support can be financially, mentally and emotionally ruinous. Robinhood should know. In 2020, it paid the largest Financial Industry Regulatory Authority fine in history–US$70 million–for its technical outages, lack of due diligence before approving customers to trade options and sending of misleading information. There is a place for AI in the financial advisory sector, and in due time, it will become a dominant feature. That part is clear. But it’s also obvious that rushing the timing would be a mistake.

    "article_text": "Sport Sport PARIS :When Luis Enrique claimed in early 2024 that Paris St Germain would be better without Kylian Mbappe, many dismissed it as arrogance or deflection. Fifteen months later, after PSG’s first Champions League triumph - a jaw-dropping 5-0 steamrolling of Inter Milan in Saturday’s final in Munich - the Spanish coach’s bold prediction looks less like provocation and more like prophecy. The victory marked the culmination of a profound transformation, from a club defined by star power to one shaped by structure, tactical clarity and collective belief. Luis Enrique’s second season at the helm has delivered what eluded his predecessors - not just a European title, but a new identity for PSG with the youngest squad in the last 16 of the competition, featuring French teenager Desire Doue, who made a decisive impact in Saturday's final.

Dembele drove forward before floating the ball to the far side and Doue had time to control the ball on his chest and his shot took a deflection off Dimarco to beat the wrong-footed Yann Sommer. Inter had to try to attack in the second half but PSG killed off the game with a third goal when Vitinha slid the ball through to Doue in the area and the 19-year-old coolly slipped the ball past Sommer. Inter were shell-shocked but things only got worse. Dembele's defence-splitting pass from his own half sent Kvaratskhelia haring away before beating Sommer at his near post, a goal which brought the PSG bench, including Luis Enrqiue, onto the pitch. Luis Enrique became the second manager, after his former Barcelona teammate Pep Guardiola, to win the continental treble of League, Cup and Champions League in one season twice, both winning their first with Barca and their second by beating Inter. \"He is the man who has changed everything at PSG. Since he came here, he has changed the way football is seen. He is a loyal man, he deserves it more than anyone else,\" Hakimi said. PSG still had time for a fifth as Mayulu fired past Sommer from close range after a pass from substitute Bradley Barcola and the final whistle was greeted with huge roars from the French fans who had been singing loudly all game. Inter had high hopes of making up for their defeat two years ago by Manchester City in Istanbul but finished the season trophyless. \"It absolutely didn't feel like my Inter out there, and the players are the first to know it, but I'm proud of the journey we've taken,\" Inter manager Simone Inzaghi said. Luis Enrique, visibly emotional after the final whistle and wearing a T-shirt with a tribute to his daughter Xana who died in 2019, has turned PSG from a side of superstars into a group of humble players finally playing as a team.

    "article_text": "Sport Sport Tennis - French Open - Roland Garros, Paris, France - May 31, 2025 Serbia's Novak Djokovic in action during his third round match against Austria's Filip Misolic REUTERS/Lisi Niesner PARIS: Novak Djokovic notched his 99th career French Open win with a clinical 6-3 6-4 6-2 defeat of Austrian qualifier Filip Misolic to reach the fourth round on a memorable Saturday (May 31) night in Paris. As 40,000 fans watched Paris St Germain's Champions League final on video screens across the road at the Parc des Princes, the 38 year old turned on the style on Court Philippe Chatrier. Three-time champion Djokovic, bidding for an historic 25th Grand Slam title, was given a thorough workout at times by his 23 year old opponent but more than matched Misolic's power and always looked in complete control. Djokovic failed to convert nine break points early on but made the breakthrough for a 4-2 lead after showing incredible defensive skills to retrieve a barrage of smashes. The Serb saved a break point at 1-2 in the second set and then earned applause from the fans as he sportingly dusted his opponent down after Misolic tumbled over and got his sweat-soaked shirt coated in clay. He soon showed his ruthless side though to break serve with a backhand winner as he raced into a two-set lead. The sixth seed was in no mood for a late night as exploding fireworks and roars rang out from across the road and the third set followed the same pattern as the first two as he cruised through to a last-16 clash against Britain's Cameron Norrie.

The team said Stroll, son of team owner Lawrence, had been experiencing pain for the past six weeks which his medical consultant believed stemmed from surgery following a cycling accident in 2023. \"His medical team have confirmed that he will not race tomorrow and he will undergo a procedure to rectify these issues before focusing on his recovery,\" the team said.

    "title": "Timothée Chalamet Is the King of the Courtside Watch",
    "article_text": "No one is enjoying this New York Knicks playoff run more than Timothée Chalamet. The actor has been flying out to Indiana to see road games,celebrating with fans after wins, and wearing some of themost enormous courtside fits we've seensince Jack Nicholson wassitting on the hardwood for the Showtime Lakers. In addition to the custom Chrome Hearts gear, the wristwear has been an essential element to Timmy’s looks. We are ready to crown Chalamet as the King of the Courtside Watch for his commitment to bringing unusual watches to Madison Square Garden. See:Chalamet in Tank à Guichet. (Rhyme scheme: unintentional yet delightful.)Chalamet in Ballon Bleu de Cartier. (Nottechnicallycourtside but close enough.)Chalamet in steel Panthère. Needless to say, the list goes on. This series against the Indiana Pacers has provided two more points of overwhelming evidence. Chalamet delivered the first during game two while rocking a diamond-studded Baignoire Allongée. For those unfamiliar, theBaignoire(Français for “bathtub”) is an oval-shaped dress watch with the classic Cartier Roman numeral dial and blued steel handset. The Allongée version is somewhat more akin to other elongatedCartier modelsin which the “stretched” case results in warped dial typography. Chalamet’s watch, which appears to be the 21mm x 47mm white gold reference powered by the cal. 1917 manually-wound movement, is what would traditionally be thought of as a ladies’ cocktail watch. These days, of course, thegender lines are fully blurred, with celebrities adopting whatever silhouette suits their fancy, andsmaller watchesabounding on the menswear circuit. It’s no coincidence that Chalamet has been a major part of this movement. And this isn’t the only high-falutin Cartier we’ve spotted as part of Chalamet’s courtside fits lately. Chalamet’s turned to a gem-setTank Américainein 18K white gold with diamonds twice during this series. This version of the Tank was launched in 1989 as a larger, quartz-powered riff on the famously curved Tank Cintrée. The Américaine has since morphed into a large collection of elongated watches in various sizes and configurations. Chalamet’s, with diamonds and a matching, diamond-studded bracelet, is a small execution with aquartz movement. What to make of all this? More and more, brands are using their ambassadors as subtle (yet omnipresent) billboards for their most important models and pending new releases. While we haven’t seen Cartier pull anyOmega-orBreitling-type sneak peaksjust yet, the French firmdoesregularly outfit its star ambassador with wildly cool (and often rare) pieces, the likes of which one simply doesn’t see outside of gatherings of the horological cognoscenti in major metropolitan areas.Tank Louis? All day long at any proper country club wedding. Gem-set Baignoire? Not so much. What’s certain is that no man hath Swiss-made clout likeChalametdoth present when pressed against the baselines. A touching scene at Roland Garros saw two GOATS in mid-embrace:Roger FederergaveRafael Nadala hug andalsogave us watch nerds a glimpse of hisRolex Land-Dweller 40in Oystersteel and white gold. Released atWatches and Wonders 2025, the Land-Dweller is the Crown’s modern luxury sports watch with an integrated bracelet. Following in the footsteps of the Crown’s Oysterquartz models from the 1970s and 1980s, it features a newly designed automatic cal. 7135 movement, a cool honeycomb-motif dial cut with a femtosecond laser—that’s onequadrillionthof a second according to a Google search—and a fluted bezel in the manner of classic Datejust models. At roughly $15K, it’s also one of the most affordable Land-Dweller references. Appearing at an event promotingMission: Impossible – The Final Reckoningin Texas, Tom Cruise’s Rolex bona fides were on full view. On the IMF agent’s left wrist was the GMT-Master II ref. 126719BLRO, a white gold execution of the famous travel watch with a blue and red “Pepsi” bezel and a matching white gold Jubilee bracelet. A dual-timeGMT timepiecemakes sense for a globe-trotting, perpetually wronged government agent trying to stave off the ever-present threat of doom at the hands of powerful supervillains…but it’s also just areally cool watch. Regularly on view at any corner office on Wall Street, it was also the provenance of bebop pioneer Dizzy Gillespie, test pilot Chuck Yeager, and rock n’ roll godBruce Springsteen. Actor, race car driver, and all-around cool dudePatrick Dempseymade an appearance at Oracle Red Bull Racing’s garage during F1 Grand Prix of Monaco this week wearing a spiffy newTAG Heuer. The Monaco Chronograph X Gulf takes the Swiss brand’s famoussquare-cased, automatic chronographfrom the late ‘60s and gives it a white-blue-and-orange livery in honor of Gulf, a longtime racing partner of both Heuer and TAG Heuer. While previous editions in steel have maintained the watch’s well-known blue dial, this execution—housed in a 39mm titanium case—matches the striped white dial to a white fabric strap with orange top stitching. Of course, it’s still powered by the Calibre 11, one of the original crop of automatic chronograph movements from 1969. Most impressively, TAG tracked down the suppliers who made the suit for McQueen forLe Mansand had them make the straps out of the very same material the actor wore in the movie. Momentarily carried into a frenzy as the Knicks took the upper hand last night at the Garden,Ben Stiller’sPanerai Luminor GMT 10 Days ref. PAM00335 was in full view. The spiritual opposite of courtside pal Chalamet’s gem-set Américaine from Game Four, the 44-mm black ceramic Luminor is based upon the Italian-founded brand’smilitary dive watch roots—look closely and you’ll see the (now vestigial) crown protection device for ensuring water resistance, plus the famous luminous “sandwich” dial construction. This version is particularly notable for its all-black construction, GMT complication, and 10-day power reserve, all of which makes it an excellent travel watch.",

    "title": "Mubi, A Streamer For Cinephiles, Is Now Officially Indispensable",
    "article_text": "I’ll be the first to admit that I had little faith in Mubi’s ascendancy until quite recently. When it launched in 2009, it seemed like a sweet little idea—a streaming service for arthouse movie geeks! —that was doomed to obscurity. I thought it would be one for people in their 20s who think they’re more into film than they actually are and would inevitably cancel their membership when they realize they're more excited about the newReacherseason that's about to arrive on Amazon Prime Video. And then, as the years have worn on, the little streamer that could has continued to prove its might, largely through good taste. Around 2016, Mubi began acquiring distribution rights for films like Luca Guadagnino’s balletic horrorSuspiriaand last year's similarly unsettling body horrorThe Substance, which very nearly won Demi Moore her first Oscar. Slowly but surely, its clout grew. Fast-forward to 2025, and Mubi is going toe-to-toe with major powerhouses of indie cinema. Alongside the buzzier likes of A24 and Neon (which picked up its sixth consecutive Palme d'Or forIt Was Just an Accident), the little streamer that could was ever-present at the festival, and left on a high that not even mediocre reviews for the Paul Mescal and Josh O’Connor-led romanceThe History of Soundcould quash. Not only did it arrive with UK distribution rights forSentimental Value, Joachim Trier’s ridiculously acclaimed family drama that got the second-longest standing ovation in Cannes history (19! Minutes!), they left with some of the fest's best-reviewed films, including Lynne Ramsay’sDie My Love, both of the joint-winners of the Jury Prize inThe Sound of FallingandSirat, as well as select international rights toIt Was Just an Accident. On top of this, the first movie that Mubi has fully produced and financed on its own—The Mastermind, a Kelly Reichardt heist movie starringJosh O’Connorand Alana Haim— went down very well with critics. I was in Cannes for a couple of days during week one, and got to seeDie My LoveandThe Sound of Fallingin rapt screening rooms. The former is a beautifully shot descent into post-partum psychosis anchored by an incredible Jennifer Lawrence performance. Alongside her,Robert Pattinsonis also great as a gormless but loving husband who has no idea how to deal with her illness. It's got a disconcerting amount of similarities to Darren Aronofsky'sMother!in which Lawrence also starred, thoughDie My Loveis far more restrained. Like all great Cannes films, though, it wasn't universally beloved: as I walked out of the screening having thoroughly enjoyed myself, I heard an audience member call it “unbearable”. Movies! On the other hand,The Sound of Falling—Mascha Schilling's slow-burn about four girls from different time periods living in the same German farmhouse—left me extremely bored, though I can see why people with a little more artsy taste than I—like the much more cine-literate Cannes jury, which consisted of the greatJeremy Strong, Juliette Binoche and Halle Berry—loved it. It has an impressionistic beauty to it, that's for sure. Considering how flat some of the most-anticipated films of the festival fell—including A24’s way-too-soon Covid movieEddington, which I can tell you firsthand is a slog—Mubi's performance at Cannes feels genuinely impressive. And as a result, Mubi is going to be the place to watch a large handful of the best movies due out in the next twelve months. So, while it pains us to say this, it is indeed time to subscribe to another streaming service. Sorry! This story originally appeared inBritish GQ.",

Best Professional Fragrance OverallChanel Pour Monsieur Eau de ParfumRead more Chanel Best Confidence-Boosting FragranceTom Ford Grey Vetiver Eau de ParfumRead more Tom Ford Best Clean-Smelling FragranceJo Malone Basil & Neroli CologneRead more Jo Malone So you've got your date nightfragranceall sorted. You've prepared asummer scentfor the sunshine, but can you still smell professional after a hot, stuffy commute? A prospective date will likely love a more sensual scent, but we can't guarantee your boss will feel the same way, and it's definitely worth thinking about grabbing a fragrance that's both work appropriate and helps you stand out from the crowd. We're always conscious of wearing anice fragrancearound those you want to impress, but smelling clean and fresh in front of clients, colleagues, and your boss shouldn't be sniffed at. You want a sophisticated aroma that offers little drama and stays on the professional side of alluring, which is a difficult balance to pull off. There's no reason you should stress, though, as ourfragranceexperts have pulled together the six ultimate office-friendly fragrances that are guaranteed to get an approving nod from your boss. Chanel Chanel The only men’s fragrance created while Gabrielle (Coco) Chanel was still alive, Pour Monsieur is the very epitome of elegant, timeless masculinity. Composed by master perfumer Henri Robert in 1955, it is for all intents and purposes the male equivalent of Chanel No. 5; effortlessly chic, discreet, and sophisticated. The fresh-chypre fragrance combines a British sense of refinement and aristocratic charm with a spicy heart and a woody dry down. Opening with a burst of citrus-fresh Sicilian lemon wrapped in petitgrain and Tunisian neroli, it develops with hints of cardamom, ginger, coriander, and basil, before settling on a bed of oakmoss, vetiver and cedar. Whenever anybody asks me which fragrance I would recommend they buy for a relative, I always suggest Pour Monsieur, because I genuinely believe it is impossible to dislike it. Remarkable, understated, and without pretence, it has been a permanent fixture in my fragrance wardrobe for as long as I can remember. Tom Ford Tom Ford Designed to conjure the essence of Tom Ford’s menswear philosophy, Grey Vetiver overdoses on clean-cut, masculine elegance. A stealth scent—which is the olfactory equivalent of the classic blue blazer, the cap-toed shoe, or that beautiful watch—it has been crafted around the most authentic vetiver note available. Created by perfumer Harry Fremont, who moved the vetiver ingredient from the background (its traditional placement in men’s fragrances) to a signature spot (from top note through to long-lasting dry-down), it is also very modern. I love its cool, dry, and richly-woody facets—it’s a traditional man’s scent and is unapologetic about it. Obtained by a revolutionary extraction technique (used here for the first time in perfumery), the ultra pure essence of vetiver used is of a far greater quantity than is traditional in a scent; leaving all of the other ingredients—orange flower, grapefruit, aromatic sage, orris root, nutmeg, pimento oakmoss, and a wash of golden, amber woods—to play important, but supporting positions. The fluted art deco-inspired frosted-glass bottle is also worthy of note; it invisibly slips into your jacket pocket (because it is flat) if you are planning after-work drinks and is a great way to elevate any tired-looking desk. Jo Malone Jo Malone A more contemporary reinterpretation of the OG Jo Malone London cologne, Lime Basil & Mandarin, this charismatic scent brings a heightened level of sophistication without being overbearing. Created by renowned perfumer Anne Flipo, it is the kind of fragrance that has great presence but won’t hijack or upstage an important business meeting. Quintessentially British, I think it also has a slightly flirty and playful edge; a versatile scent that will have your back whether chained to the desk, lunching with clients or after-work entertaining. Fresh and herbaceous, the fragrance begins its journey with a top note of warm and peppery basil, before a deep dive into the green and floral facets of neroli, made from the hand-picked blossoms of the bitter orange tree. Its base of white musk, which has a very clean quality, helps enhance the trail of the scent, tinged with a wink of vetiver. Outstanding in its simplicity, it will never let you down; in my opinion, a future classic in the making. Acqua di Parma Amazon The original Colonia eau de cologne set a precedent when it launched in 1916 as the ultimate fresh, clean and gentlemanly scent. Timeless, sophisticated and the very essence of Italian style and grace, not only has it stood the time by seducing a faithful but demanding clientele (Cary Grant was a big fan), it has also formed the basis for many of ADP’s other crowd-pleasing creations. Subtly changing throughout the day, it opens with the brand’s signature blend of golden citrus fruits: radiant lemon, Calabrian bergamot, and orange. Balance is then achieved through an aromatic heart of Bulgarian rose, verbena, clary sage, rosemary and English lavender; its base is deeply rooted with Mysore sandalwood, Javan vetiver, oakmoss, patchouli, and cedar. I’ve tested and lived with many fragrances over the years, and honestly believe it’s impossible not to fall for the captivating elegance of this iconic, classy cologne. Brioni Harrods As its name would suggest, Suave celebrates Brioni’s blend of nonchalant Roman elegance and peerless Italian know-how; tailoring legends since 1945. Aimed at the stealthy guy who surrounds himself with mid-century furniture and fine art, it is an extension of the Brioni man’s sartorial wardrobe and elegant lifestyle; a scent tailored with top-tier ingredients that evokes the serene embrace of home. This is the sort of fragrance you can literally wear day in and day out—the ultimate signature of masculine sophistication with the volume turned down. Opening with citrus and spices, like streams of sunlight, zesty tangerine, pink peppercorn, and cardamom, brings soft and delicate warmth. A rich leathery heart with earthy vetiver, then gives way to a base of creamy sandalwood intertwined with salted amber that calms and soothes. Created by a crack team of no less than three collaborating perfumers: Michel Almairac (who composed the other 4 Brioni fragrances), Jérôme Epinette and Romain Almairac. AsGQeditors, we all get to test out top-end fragrances regularly. Chief tester here isAdrian Clark, a long-time fragrance industry veteran. Not only has he worn each scent we've shared above personally, but he's also tested them across decades of commutes, travel trips, and boring meetings to assess the quality and longevity. After all that testing, he's landed on the following six, which are his absolute favorites. More From GQ Connect ©2025Condé Nast.

    "title": "Trump Administration Cuts $258M Program Crucial To Discovering HIV Vaccines",
    "article_text": "Two days before the beginning of Pride Month, PresidentDonald Trump’s administrationterminateda $258 million program whose work was instrumental to the search for a vaccine for HIV. On Friday, the program’s two leaders, from Duke University and the Scripps Research Institute, heard the news from the HIV division of the National Institutes of Health—their work was no longer supported. “The consortia for H.I.V./AIDS vaccine development and immunology was reviewed by N.I.H. leadership, which does not support it moving forward,” a senior official at the agency who was not authorized to speak on the matter and who asked not to be identified toldThe New York Times. “N.I.H. expects to be shifting its focus toward using currently available approaches to eliminate H.I.V./AIDS,” the official said. HIV vaccine advocates hold signs as they protest to oppose federal HIV funding cuts in front of the US Capitol in Washington, DC on April 2, 2025. The researchers’ work also improved treatments for other illnesses, including COVID-19, snake bites, and autoimmune diseases. The NIH also paused funding for a separate clinical trial of an HIV vaccine made by Moderna. “The H.I.V. pandemic will never be ended without a vaccine,”John Moore, who researches HIV at Weill Cornell Medical in New York, told theTimes. “So,” he continued, “killing research on one will end up killing people.” “The N.I.H.’s multiyear investment in advanced vaccine technologies shouldn’t be abandoned on a whim like this.” The Trump administration's removal of funding for HIV vaccine research and development is the latest in their wide-reaching attacks on efforts to mitigate a virus that around 40 million people live with worldwide. A virus that, in 2023, led to an estimated 630,000 deaths from AIDS-related illnesses in 2023,accordingto UNAIDS. That number could be as high as 820,000. In 2023, globally, almost half of new HIV infections were among women and girls of all ages. Prevalence and risk continue to be disproportionately high for gay men, men who have sex with men, transgender people, intravenous drug users, and sex workers around the world. “I find it very disappointing that, at this critical juncture, the funding for highly successful H.I.V. vaccine research programs should be pulled,”Dennis Burton, an immunologist who led the program at Scripps, said. According to theTimes, the two research programs, funded from seven-year awards made back in 2019, “focused on so-called broadly neutralizing antibodies, which have been shown in animal studies to provide long-lasting protection against exposure to multiple H.I.V. strains.” Clinical trials based on the Duke and Scripps work may continue, but now that they’ve lost the funding, future trials may be non-starters. “Almost everything in the field is hinged on work that those two programs are doing,”Mitchell Warren, executive director of the HIV prevention organization AVAC, said. “The pipeline just got clogged.” HIV vaccine advocates pile up hundreds of mockup coffins, as they protest in front of the US State Department, demanding the full restoration of the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) in Washington, DC on April 17, 2025. Since taking office in January, Trump and his administration have taken aim at local, national, and global programs aimed at preventing and treating HIV—cuts that both derail progress that has been made over decades and slow down future medical advancements and social mitigation. In January, Trump’s team halted disbursement of funds from Pepfar, or the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the $7.5 billion program that supplied most of the treatment for HIV in Africa and developing countries around the world. While the State Department issued waivers for treatments to continue, it didn’t restore funding moving forward—amovethat risks the health of tens of millions of people in these areas. Also in January, less than two weeks after Trump was inaugurated, a slate of public health information wastaken downfrom the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s website—including contraception guidance, a fact sheet about HIV and transgender people, and details about National Transgender HIV Testing Day, amongst other information related to gender identity. In March, the NIHwithdrewmillions of dollars from a program dedicated to understanding how to diagnose, treat, and prevent HIV infections and AIDS in adolescents and young adults. Trump’s cuts alsotargetedmultiple grants focused on PrEP, a medicine taken by people who do not have HIV that reduces the risk of getting the virus from sex or injection drug use, by about 99% and at least 74%, respectively. Dilapidated signage is seen outside the offices of Uganda Young Positives (UYP) on February 12, 2025 in Kampala, Uganda. UYP is a non-governmental organization dedicated to improving the quality of life for young people living with HIV/AIDS and reducing infection rates through awareness campaigns and programs. Just this week, the administration withheld funds for local prevention work, including in Texas, where the State Department of Health Services directed grantees to stop their work “until further notice,” and in North Carolina, where a lack of funds spurred 10 health department staffers to be laid off. Federal health department officials have said that some of the work related to HIV prevention and treatment will be shifted to the Department of Health and Human Services’ new Administration for a Healthy America. Yet, that agency hasn’t been formed, and no details were provided about how it could serve communities impacted by HIV and AIDS. “It’s just inconceivable,” Warren from AVAC began, “how shortsighted this is.” The Dizzying Rise of MAHA WarriorCalley Means, RFK Jr.’s Right-Hand Man The UnsinkableKathy Bates From RFK Jr. to Patrick Schwarzenegger, a Brief Guide tothe Kennedy Family Why Is Trump Pardoning  thisReality TV CoupleConvicted of Fraud?

    "title": "Elon Musk Follows Bombshell Drug Use Report With Black-Eyed Oval Office Press Conference",
    "article_text": "Elon Musk's time at the right hand ofDonald Trumpbegan with,uh,energeticon-stage appearances during which he performeda very Nazi-like saluteandwaved around a chain saw. But it ended in far more chastened fashion, with arestrained tweet from Muskon Tuesday saying his “scheduled time as a Special Government Employee” was ending, followed by abombshell report on Fridayclaiming Musk is a regular user of Ecstasy, psychedelic mushrooms, Adderall, and Ketamine—the latter of which he used so regularly that he reportedly suffered bladder-related issues as a result. Given that, you can see why his Friday going-away party in the Oval Office was a bit of a letdown. Musk, who has in recent months made a habit ofwearing a baseball capthat reads “Trump was right about everything,\" traded that lid for a black one that simply read “DOGE,\" a reference to theflub-filled federal funding departmentat whichhe's allegedly toiledasTesla burned. Was his farewell event hat-trick more of an Easter egg, intended to indicatehis stated dissatisfactionwith Trump's “Big, beautiful bill”? We do know he'sobsessed withTaylor Swift, perhaps he's bitingher secret message style. President Donald Trump holds a news conference with Elon Musk to mark the end of the Tesla CEO's tenure as a special government employee overseeing the U.S. DOGE Service on Friday May 30, 2025 in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington. He also arrived with a black eye, literally. According to Musk, the injury came from one of his (at least)14 childrenthat heactually spends time with. “I was just horsing around with little X,\"he toldreporters from the event. “I said, ‘Go ahead, punch me in the face.’ And he did.” \"I didn’t really feel much at the time and then, I guess, it bruises up,\" said Musk of his altercation with the child—full name, X Æ A-Xii Musk—whom he shares withGrimes. Musk's shiner was arguably the highlight of the Oval Office gathering, which was loosely structured as a press conference. After some usual rambling remarks such as a reference to a “$20 million\" cut DOGE reportedly made to an “Arab Sesame Street in the Middle East, nobody knows what that’s all about” (a reference, perhaps, to a bilaterally supported program intended tofight Al Qaeda recruitment), Trump handed his “first buddy” a golden key to the White House. “Elon’s really not leaving. He’s going to be back and forth, I think,\" Trump said. “It’s his baby.” A fascinating word choice to describe analleged deadbeat dad. Looks like X isn't the only person in Musk's circle to pack an unexpected punch.

    "title": "Patti LuPone Should Be Banned From The Tony Awards, Over 500 Broadway Artists Say",
    "article_text": "Broadway,TV, and filmstarPatti LuPonehas built a following around her unfiltered—and some might say bellicose—candor. But it appears that lack of restraint might also be her undoing. Following a profile intheNew Yorkerin which LuPone spoke critically of fellow theater starsAudra McDonaldandKecia Lewis, over 500 artists from the theater community and beyond signed an open letter urging the organizers of theTony Awardsto ban LuPone from the event. Patti LuPone has never been known for mincing her words. A list of all her incendiary interviews would have you still on this page two days from now, but a greatest hits compilation might include a 2017What What Happens Liveappearancein which she characterized fellow icon to certain subsetsMadonnaas “dead behind the eyes. She cannot act her way out of a paper bag. She should not be in film or onstage.” Then there's the 2015 admission that shesnatched a cell phonefrom the hands of a texting theater-goer (understandable, but still an arguable assault!). In 2023, it wasKim Kardashianwhobore the bruntof LuPone'sWWHLwrath, when LuPone rhetorically asked “What are you doing with your life? Don’t get on the stage.” Herdeparture fromthe Actor's Equity union that same year left behind even more scorched earth, with LuPone calling it the \"worst union\" and saying, “they don't know who I am basically.” WATCH WHAT HAPPENS LIVE WITH ANDY COHEN -- Episode 20073 -- Pictured: Patti LuPone Given LuPone's decades-long propensity for sideswipes—a habit that, to be fair, has helped make her a household name as much (if not more) thanherAgatha All Alongroledid—it's perhaps understandable that LuPone felt free to cast shade when she spoke with theNew Yorker'sMichael Schulman. But this time, the shade wasn't greeted as gleefully as LuPone's anti-phone aggression. The quotes in question were rooted in a conflict between 2024's LuPone-starring production ofThe Roommate, which was next door toAlicia KeysmusicalHell's Kitchen.After complaints from LuPone over a sound bleed between the productions' shared wall,Hell's Kitchen'sTony-winning starKecia Lewistook to Instagramto request an apology from LuPone, saying “These actions, in my opinion, are bullying; they’re offensive; they’re racially microaggressive; they’re rude; they’re rooted in privilege, and these actions also lack a sense of community and leadership for someone as yourself who has been in the business as long as you have.\" When asked about last fall's dispute by Schulman, LuPone doubled down—especially when it came to Lewis's self-characterization as a veteran performer. Audra McDonald and Patti LuPone pose at the Drama League's 27th Annual All-Star Benefit Gala honoring Patti LuPone at The Pierre Hotel on February 7, 2011 in New York City. “Let’s find out how many Broadway shows Kecia Lewis has done, because she doesn’t know what the fuck she’s talking about,” LuPone said. “She’s done seven. I’ve done 31. Don’t call yourself a vet, bitch.” (In actuality, asPlaybill notes, the 59-year-old Lewis has performed in 10 productions to the 76-year-old LuPone's 28.) When asked about fellow starAudra McDonald's support of Lewis's message, LuPone said “And I thought,You should know better. That’s typical of Audra. She’s not a friend.\" The remarks spurredan open lettercondemning LuPone that's since been signed by hundreds of notable creatives, including Tony winners McDonald andWendell Pierce, as well as less expected names such asCourtney Love. Addressed to the American Theatre Wing and Broadway League, and “the greater theatre community,” it calls on those groups “to take immediate action—not only in response to Patti LuPone’s comments, but in establishing a broader standard of accountability moving forward.” “Individuals, including Patti Lupone, who use their platform to publicly demean, harass, or disparage fellow artists—particularly with racial, gendered, or otherwise violent language—should not be welcomed at industry events, including the Tony Awards, fundraisers, and public programs,” the letter continues. The language LuPone used in her recent interview “is not only degrading and misogynistic—it is a blatant act of racialized disrespect. It constitutes bullying. It constitutes harassment. It is emblematic of the microaggressions and abuse that people in this industry have endured for far too long, too often without consequence,” the letter reads, saying “This is about more than one person. It is about a culture. A pattern. A persistent failure to hold people accountable for violent, disrespectful, or harmful behavior—especially when they are powerful or well-known.” Neither LuPone nor the recipients of the letter have yet to publicly respond to the message. The2025 Tony Awardsare scheduled for Sunday, June 8.

    "article_text": "Walter Leung’s volunteer work with the Red Cross in disaster situations has earned him the Florence Nightingale Medal, the highest international distinction for nurses In a makeshift hospital ward in Rafah, Gaza, reserved for the most severely wounded and dying patients, Hong Kong nurse Walter Leung Wai-yin, 66, walked up to a woman who had lost part of her face in an explosion. The woman was classified as a “blue case”, indicating catastrophic injuries and considered beyond saving. Medical professionals instead shift to end-of-life care, focusing on reducing pain with the heaviest dosage of morphine. “Her skull was gone and her brain was visible. Blood was all over her hair and face. She was still screaming and breathing,” he said. “So I brought my British nurse partner and wiped the blood off her body. You could still smell the gunpowder … We also bandaged her head so that she would look better when her family came to see her.” Leung has been awarded the Florence Nightingale Medal, the highest international distinction for nurses, for his 15 years of volunteer work with the Red Cross in disaster situations. He is the first volunteer from the Hong Kong Red Cross and the third nurse from the city to win the award.",
