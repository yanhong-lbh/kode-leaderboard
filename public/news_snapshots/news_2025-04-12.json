    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. The 89th edition ofthe Mastersis in for a thriller Sunday. Rory McIlroy and Bryson DeChambeau are in the final pairing, and golf fans will remember how these two are connected after the 2024 U.S. Open. DeChambeau won theU.S. Openat Pinehurst No. 2, while McIlroy had an epic meltdown with the putter late in the round to throw away his potential title. This time, McIlroy posted yet another 6-under round at Augusta National Saturday after surging up the leaderboard Friday. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Rory McIlroy plays his shot on the first hole during the third round of the Masters at Augusta National Golf Club.(Michael Madrid/Imagn Images) McIlroy put his disappointing first round, when he finished at even par aftertwo double bogeyson the second nine, in the rearview mirror after posting a 66 in his second round. Then, he got off to a hot start, going birdie, eagle, birdie to quickly take the lead. It was a lead he didn't relinquish even after faltering on holes eight and 10, putting a bogey on the scorecard to move back down to 9-under. However, McIlroy got those shots back with a birdie on No. 13 and No. 15, which ruined his first round after he hit a chip into the water. He buried another eagle to get him to 12-under. RORY MCILROY CHIPS IN EAGLE, BRYSON DECHAMBEAU SINKS DEEP BIRDIE TO START MASTERS THIRD ROUND WITH FIREWORKS So, McIlroy, who needs a green jacket to accomplish a career Grand Slam after winning every other major on the PGA Tour, has a chance Sunday to finally get it, while also winning the elusive fifth major of his career. Bryson DeChambeau reacts after putting on the first green during the third round of the Masters at Augusta National Golf Club.(Michael Madrid/Imagn Images) DeChambeau will be paired with McIlroy and is searching for his own first Masters win. DeChambeau ended his third round in style with a long, winding birdie putt on the 18th hole to finish with a 69 on the day and 10-under for the tournament. He recorded three birdies in his final four holes, and the LIV Golf star let out a roar with fans around the 18th green. Buckle up, folks, because Sunday at Augusta is bound to have some fireworks like we saw Saturday. While all eyes are on McIlroy and DeChambeau after the third round Saturday, Zach Johnson, the 2007 Masters champion, flew up the leaderboard after posting a 66 before the two golfers even teed off. Zach Johnson lines up his putt on 13 during the second round of the Masters at Augusta National Golf Club.(Kyle Terada/Imagn Images) Johnson is now tied for 10th heading into Sunday at 4-under for the tournament. Rose, the Masters’ leader after the first two rounds, was paired with DeChambeau on Saturday, hoping to hold on to that lead heading into the final round. But it was a battle from the get-go. Rose had to scramble to save pars, and it ultimately caught up to him. He posted five bogeys and two birdies to finish 3-over on the day. Rose is now tied in sixth at 5-under, and he will need to look more like he did on Thursday, when he posted a 65 in the opening round, to get a chance at walking through Butler Cabin for a green jacket fitting.

    "title": "Trump is 'going to run for a third term,' Steve Bannon tells Bill Maher",
    "article_text": "‘Fox & Friends Weekend’ co-hosts react to Bill Maher discussing his recent White House meeting with President Donald Trump. Longtime Trump ally Steve Bannon told Bill Maher thatPresident Donald Trumpis \"going to run for a third term\" on an episode of \"Real Time\" on Friday night. During a discussion on the January 6th committee andBannon's recent release from prison, Bannon mentioned that he refused to testify before the committee, not to protect Trump, but to \"stand up for the Constitution.\" Maher then told Bannon that he \"brought a copy\" of the Constitution to the show, and proceeded to read the 22nd Amendment aloud. BILL MAHER REVEALS TRUMP WAS 'GRACIOUS AND MEASURED' AT WHITE HOUSE MEETING, SAYS HE'S NOT THE MAN SEEN ON TV \"Amendment 22. No person shall be elected to the office of the president more than twice,\" Maher read, adding, \"And yet you keep talking about Trump's—maybe you should have this,\" before handing the copy of the Constitution to Bannon. Steve Bannon and Bill Maher clashed over the legality of a possible third term for President Trump.(Photo by Noam Galai/Getty Images)(Randy Holmes via Getty Images) The former Trump advisor clarified that \"President Trump didn't bring up running for a third term,\" and that it was himself and others who were the ones who brought up the idea. \"President Trump is going to run for a third term, and President Trump is going to be elected again on the afternoon of January 20th of 2029. He's going to be President of the United States,\" Bannon asserted. \"OK, but the thing I just read in there,\" Maher replied, pointing atthe Constitution. \"It seemed like there was no wiggle room there, it seemed like it was just, you know, eight or ten words that said only two times.\" CLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST MEDIA AND CULTURE NEWS Bannon told Maher that \"we have a team of people\" who are working on reviewing the amendment. \"How can a team do something about that? I don't care if the team is twelve trillion people, the words are still the words,\" Maher asked. Bannon noted that there are currently \"120 lawsuits on what President Trump is doing for his Article II rights,\" and that those who are suing Trump right now are doing so based off of their own interpretation of the Constitution. Maher, who visited President Trump at the White House on March 31, argued that Trump is not eligible to run for a third term as president due to the 22nd Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.(Screenshot/HBO; Getty Images) While holding up a copy of the Constitution, Bannon said, \"The interpretation of this [the U.S. Constitution] is open for interpretation.\" \"How could it be open — could I have it back?\" Maher responded, reaching over to take back the copy of the Constitution he gave Bannon. The late-night host, laughing along with the audience, then went through every word of the 22nd Amendment with Bannon. \"I don't see what the ‘team’ is finding,\" Maher told Bannon, adding that the two will just have to \"disagree\" on the topic.

    "article_text": "\"R-Evolution,\" the 2015 45-foot-tall sculpture of a nude woman, was originally created for Burning Man before making its current home in San Francisco. (Credit: KTVU) A 45-foot statue of a nude woman is the newest — and tallest — resident ofSan Francisco’sEmbarcadero Plaza. The artwork, titled \"R-Evolution,\" was unveiled with music, lights and performance art Thursday, courtesy of the public art nonprofit Illuminate. Designed to glow at night and appear to \"breathe\" via internal motors, the statue was meant to represent strength and compassion. Instead, it’s sparked backlash, internet memes and questions about the city's priorities. Originally created for Burning Man in 2015 by sculptor Marco Cochrane, the stainless steel figure now stands outside the Ferry Building, casting a long (and anatomically detailed) shadow over a city where fewer and fewer people seem impressed by spectacle. NEWSOM-BACKED SAN FRANCISCO SPEED CAMERA PROGRAM FINES CERTAIN DRIVERS MORE THAN OTHERS While some see the statue as empowering, many San Franciscans see it as another example of the city misreading the room. Social media lit upafter a video by influencer Collin Rugg went viral showing a cherry picker being awkwardly hoisted between the statue’s legs during installation. Commentators quickly had a field day. \"Nothing says ‘reviving downtown’ like a 45-foot naked lady getting rear-end surgery,\" wrote one user. Another deadpanned, \"This picture kind of embodies the spirit of San Francisco — head up a--.\" The 45-foot sculpture, \"R-Evolution,\" by artist Marco Cochrane stands at San Francisco’s Embarcadero Plaza Thursday. The steel mesh statue, which simulates breathing through internal motors, has sparked widespread debate over the city's priorities.(KTVU) The statue was installed just blocks from areas dealing with visible homelessness, open-air drug use and boarded-up storefronts. While the art world might call that \"juxtaposition,\" many residents simply call it tone-deaf. SAN FRANCISCO PRIDE TAKES FINANCIAL HIT AFTER MAJOR COMPANIES PULL SPONSORSHIPS AMID DEI FALLOUT Bruce Lou, the Republican challenger to Nancy Pelosi in the last congressional election, was blunt. \"I don't know where to begin about the misplaced priorities for the city of San Francisco,\" Lou said. \"They seem like they are focused on absolutely everything except the things that matter.\" Lou questioned Pelosi’s connection to the city, noting, \"I'm not even sure Pelosi knows about the statue. She's originally from Baltimore and spends almost all her time in D.C., so the city and her constituents aren't on the top of her mind.\" A view of \"R-Evolution,\" a 45-foot nude woman sculpture in San Francisco.(KTVU) John Dennis, the former San Francisco GOP chair and current CAGOP Chair of Chairs, offered an even sharper assessment. \"The city named after St. Francis is now dominated by the feminist, anti-male agenda. The results speak for themselves,\" he said. \"A giant, naked woman blocking the proud, iconic Ferry Building is a perfect metaphor for San Francisco these days.\" The backlash wasn't limited to conservatives, however. In a KQED commentary, \"Nobody Asked for This,\" arts editor Sarah Hotchkiss wrote, \"As I gazed up at this monumental steel and mesh sculpture on Thursday, I felt embarrassed for the city of San Francisco. One of several problems with R-Evolution is that we are all the audience for this thing, and no one asked us if we wanted it.\" A detailed view of the \"R-Evolution\" statue in San Francisco, which boasts 16 internal motors meant to mimic breathing.(KTVU) Her critique adds to a growing chorus of San Franciscans across the political spectrum questioning how and why this was made a civic priority. According to the most recent point-in-time count from the city, over 8,300people are experiencing homelessnessin San Francisco. The city plans to spend nearly $690 million on housing and homelessness programs in the upcoming fiscal year. Encampments are still widespread in areas like the Tenderloin, SoMa and the Mission. Violent crime dropped14% citywide last year, and car break-ins have hit a 22-year low, a surprising development in a city where \"smash-and-grab\" once felt like a daily ritual. But gun violence has ticked up 5%, and despite stepped-up law enforcement, public safety remains a top concern. Vacant storefronts and empty streets downtown make even the most optimistic \"revitalization\" pitch feel a bit like performance art itself. Homelessness and drugs have plagued San Francisco for years.(Getty Images) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Drug enforcement is also up in 2025, with arrests and citations related to narcotics up nearly 40% compared to early 2024. Still, critics argue that enforcement without addiction treatment or shelter options often just moves the problem around without solving it. \"R-Evolution\" is expected to remain in place for at least six months and possibly up to a year.

An autistic, nonverbal teenage boy who was shot repeatedly byIdaho policefrom the other side of a chain-link fence while he was holding a knife died Saturday after being removed from life support, his family said. Victor Perez, 17, who also has cerebral palsy, had been in a coma since the April 5 shooting, and tests Friday showed that he had no brain activity, his aunt, Ana Vazquez, told The Associated Press. He had undergone several surgeries, with doctors removing nine bullets and amputating his leg. IDAHO AUTHORITIES RELEASE 911 CALL FROM COLLEGE MURDERS Police in the southwest Idaho city of Pocatello responded to a 911 call reporting that an apparently intoxicated man with a knife was chasing someone in a yard. It turned out to be Perez, who was not intoxicated but walked with a staggered gait due to his disabilities, Vazquez said. His family members had been trying to get the large kitchen knife away from him. This photo provided by Ana L Vazquez, shows Victor Perez in a hospital bed in Pocatello, Idaho.(Ana L. Vazquez via AP) Video taken by a neighbor showed that Perez was lying in the yard after falling over when four officers arrived and rushed to the fence at the edge of the yard. They immediately ordered Perez to drop the knife, but instead he stood and began stumbling toward them. Officers opened fire within about 12 seconds of getting out of their patrol cars and made no apparent effort to de-escalate the situation. The shooting outraged Perez’s family and Pocatello residents, and a vigil had been planned for Saturday morning outside thePocatello hospitalwhere he was treated. \"Everybody was trying to tell the police, no, no,\" Vazquez said. \"Those four officers didn’t care. They didn’t ask what was happening, what was the situation.\" \"How’s he going to jump the fence when he can barely walk?\" she said.

    "article_text": "Gold Star parents Kelly Barnett and Darin Hoover, who lost their son, Staff Sergeant Taylor Hoover, joined 'America's Newsroom' to discuss their reaction to the GOP-led report on the withdrawal as lingering questions remain. The Trump administration is ending the protected status for thousands of Afghans who entered the U.S. after its chaotic withdrawalfrom Afghanistanin 2021 under the Biden administration. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security doesn’t plan to renew Afghans' Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which lasts six to 18 months and applies to people from countries that are war-torn or have a natural disaster or some other event that makes returning dangerous. The U.S. military evacuated more than 82,000 Afghans from the country when the U.S. withdrew in 2021, and the Taliban took over.

As part of its review process, USCIS consulted with the Department of State.\" Shawn VanDriver, who served in the military and is president of #AfghanEvac, disagreed with the administration's assessment on Afghanistan.

It's cruel, it's chaotic, and it undermines everything America claimed to stand for when we promised not to leave our allies behind.\" More than 14,000 Afghans and 7,000 Cameroonians are expected to lose their TPS protections.

    "article_text": "Board-certified rheumatologist Dr. Mahsa Tehrani discusses President Donald Trump’s possible 25% tariff on overseas medication and a new study on the relationship between Ozempic and dementia risk on ‘America Reports.’ A U.S. senator said a GLP-1 drug changed his life — and now he's calling for widespread access to anti-obesity medications. In a New York Times op-ed on April 8, Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., wrote about his experience with Mounjaro (tirzepatide). The injectable prescription medicine is primarily used to treat type 2 diabetes. OZEMPIC’S HEALTH BENEFITS KEEP GROWING, BUT ARE THE RISKS WORTH IT? Fetterman was prescribed the medication in July 2024. \"As astroke survivor, I was interested in studies showing [Mounjaro] could significantly reduce the risk of major cardiac events,\" the senator wrote.

    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. We're in for quite the week at Augusta National Golf Club, as the third round ofThe Mastershad fireworks on Saturday afternoon, courtesy of two stars battling for the green jacket. Rory McIlroyand Bryson DeChambeau began the day at 6-under and 7-under, respectively, but those numbers quickly changed, thanks to some fantastic shots to begin their rounds. McIlroy had gotten off to a birdie start with a perfect first hole. But a louder roar came when DeChambeau, in a group with Saturday's leader Justin Rose, teed off right behind him. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Bryson DeChambeau reacts after putting on the first green during the third round of the Masters Tournament at Augusta National Golf Club.(Michael Madrid-Imagn Images) DeChambeau's approach shot hit the green, but it landed on the back with along birdie puttahead. With a downhill break, DeChambeau was likely trying to get it close for an easy par to start the round, but the line was too perfect, as was his speed. DeChambeau and the group of patrons around the first green watched as his ball trickled down the slope and found the bottom of the cup to tie him with Rose at 8-under. DeChambeau let out a small fist pump, though he remained stoic in his demeanor, knowing 17 holes were ahead. But McIlroy's second hole sent patrons into a frenzy, as he took the lead, thanks to some soft hands around the second green. TRUMP SHARES MASTERS ROOTING INTEREST AS TOURNAMENT REACHES PIVOTAL WEEKEND An absolute monster drive carried the right fairway bunkers on Hole 2 that were about 330 yards out on the par-5 585-yarder. McIlroy set himself up for a potential eagle, but his approach went a bit too deep, which required a chip for his third shot. It was a good look to get the ball close for a tap-in birdie to make his start even better, but he saw the line and executed the chip perfectly. The gallery erupts in cheers after Rory McIlroy eagles no. 2 during the third round of the Masters Tournament at Augusta National Golf Club.(Grace Smith-Imagn Images) The ball bounced twice before checking up and working its way toward the hole, and it was the perfect line as it sank for a three and a quick 3-under swing to start his third round. The crowd went wild as McIlroy took the sole lead, which he furthered even more with a birdie on No. 3. It's \"Moving Day\" at Augusta, with players trying their hardest to put themselves in position to hopefully capture the victory in this year's first major. McIlroy and DeChambeau, winners of previous majors, have yet to collect their own green jackets, and they're currently playing like potential champions.

    "title": "Bill Belichick reveals massive Patriots regret he made twice, in new book",
    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Bill Belichick is solely focused on revitalizing theNorth Carolina Tar Heels'football program in the first college coaching stint of his illustrious career. But his new book, \"The Art of Winning: Lessons from My Life in Football,\" Belichick reflects on his time with theNew England Patriots. And while there’s a bunch of lessons to learn about success and what it takes to win the Vince Lombardi Trophy, Belichick did reveal a big regret he had for a decision he made while leading the way in Foxborough – one that he made twice. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM New England Patriots former head coach Bill Belichick addressed the media at Gillette Stadium about his departure.(John Tlumacki/The Boston Globe via Getty Images) The New York Post reports an entire chapter dedicated to \"Mistakes,\" which, yes, brings up not being able to keep Tom Brady a Patriot for his entire career. However, Belichick also mentions passing up on a particular MVP quarterback in the league today:Lamar Jackson. When Jackson was drafted 32nd overall in 2018, the Baltimore Ravens traded back into the first round to nab him with the final pick on day one. Since then, he has won two MVP awards over seven seasons, though he hasn’t had the postseason success he’d like along the way. BILL BELICHICK DOES NOT MENTION ROBERT KRAFT IN NEW BOOK: REPORT The Patriots were coming off a Super Bowl loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, giving them the 31st overall selection in the 2018 NFL Draft. They would select Sony Michel out of Georgia at that spot instead of taking Jackson. The Philadelphia Eagles, winners of the Super Bowl during the 2017 season, traded their No. 32 pick to the Ravens, and the rest is history. But why twice? Well, the Patriots owned the No. 23 pick earlier in the NFL Draft, which they used on offensive tackle/guard Isaiah Wynn, another Georgia product, that shored up their line in front of Brady. Lamar Jackson, #8 of the Baltimore Ravens, steps back to pass against the Buffalo Bills in the third quarter during the AFC Divisional Playoff at Highmark Stadium on January 19, 2025, in Orchard Park, New York.(Al Bello/Getty Images) However, Brady was about to be 41 years old, and while he was still performing, the team had to think about the future at the most important position in the sport. It wasn’t an immediate regret for the Patriots, as they’d go on to win the Super Bowl over the Los Angeles Rams, where Michel capped a rookie season with 931 yards and six touchdowns. Wynn also went on to start 50 games for the Patriots from 2019 to 2022. Now, Jackson didn’t get off to a roaring start to his career, with Joe Flacco still the veteran option above him on the depth chart. But when it was time to pass off the starting duties to Jackson, he took off under John Harbaugh. The Ravens made the playoffs five of the next six seasons following the Patriots’ Super Bowl, while things started to slowly crumble in Foxborough. Brady left before the 2020 season, and he’d go on to win the Super Bowl with theTampa Bay Buccaneers, who also employed Rob Gronkowski at tight end.

    "title": "With Trump's backing Israel pushes deeper into Gaza as pressure builds for hostage deal",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meet at the White House amid reciprocal tariffs uproar, and the president addresses a wide range of questions. Nearly a month into Israel’s renewed ground operation, U.S. backing appears to be shaping the conflict on multiple levels—militarily, diplomatically and politically. Israeli officials have suggested the chances of a hostage deal have significantly increased, with some anticipating developments within the next two weeks. On Monday, sitting beside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office,President Donald Trumptold reporters, \"We are trying very hard to get the hostages out. We're looking at another ceasefire. We'll see what happens.\" The remarks highlighted Trump’s dual-track approach: continued diplomatic pressure on Iran and direct support for Israel’s military campaign in Gaza. With what Israeli officials describe as a \"free hand\" to operate, Israel has expanded its offensive into Rafah and the strategically significant Morag Corridor. The stated aim is to increase pressure on Hamas and help secure the release of the remaining 59 hostages. ISRAEL LAUNCHES NEW GROUND OPERATION IN GAZA A senior Israeli security official told Fox News Digital that the campaign is being carried out in close coordination with the United States. \"Everything is coordinated with the Americans — both the negotiations and the operational activity. The goal is tobring the hostages home. We now have a free hand to act, and no longer facing the threat of a veto at the UN Security Council, unlike during the previous administration.\" The same official pointed to ashift in humanitarian policythat, in their view, has enhanced Israeli leverage. \"Unlike the previous administration, the U.S. is not forcing 350 aid trucks into Gaza every day. That gives us leverage,\" the official said, adding that limiting aid reduces Hamas’s ability to control the population. On Saturday, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz announced the IDF had completed the takeover of the Morag Axis. The Morag Corridor — which separates Rafah from Khan Younis — is part of an effort to establish a new buffer zone and degrade Hamas’s operational capabilities. \"The logic is that the more territory Hamas loses, the more likely it will be to compromise on a hostage deal,\" the official said. IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir reinforced that strategy during a visit to front-line units this week. \"I expect you to defeat the Rafah Brigade and lead to victory wherever you are fighting,\" he told troops. The IDF had previously declared the Rafah Brigade dismantled in September, but forces have returned to key strongholds, where tunnel networks remain. HAMAS LAUNCHES FIRST ATTACK ON ISRAEL SINCE CEASEFIRE COLLAPSE Activity of troops of the 36th Division in the Rafah area on April 5th, 2025.(IDF) In the same statement on Saturday, Katz warned Gazans, \"Hamas is unable to protect the residents or the territory. Hamas leaders are hiding in tunnels with their families or living in luxury hotels abroad, with billions in bank accounts, using you as human shields. Now is the time to rise up, to get rid of Hamas, and to release all the Israeli hostages — that is the only way to stop the war.\" In their Oval Office meeting, Trump and Netanyahu reiterated their alignment on core issues. Netanyahu stated that Gazans should be \"free to choose to go wherever they want,\" in what some analysts view as a reference to renewed discussions about third-country resettlement. Trump went further, floating the idea of a U.S. presence in the Strip, noting, \"Gaza is an incredible piece of important real estate. Having a peace force like the United States there, controlling and owning the Gaza Strip would be a good thing.\" Javed Ali, a former senior director at the U.S. National Security Council and now a professor at the University of Michigan, offered a more measured view of the current military strategy. \"Now that we're almost a full month into the resumption of high-intensity IDF operations in the Gaza Strip against Hamas, Israel's military strategy appears to be focused on clearing and holding remaining pockets of known Hamas elements, which at the same time is displacing Palestinians throughout the territory.\" CEASEFIRE OVER AS ISRAEL STRIKES GAZA AFTER HAMAS REFUSED TO RELEASE HOSTAGES, OFFICIALS SAY Israeli forces establish the Morag Corridor in Gaza.(IDF) Ali said it remains unclear how Israel intends to manage or govern areas it clears. He drew comparisons to the U.S. experience in Iraq and Afghanistan. \"The U.S. encountered its own challenges in the post-9/11 wars with similar 'clear and hold' approaches, since insurgent and jihadist elements in both conflicts utilized guerrilla warfare tactics and terrorist attacks.\" While the Biden administration had previously emphasized humanitarian access, Ali noted that the current White House has not publicly pressed Israel to scale back its operations. \"That could change,\" he said, particularly as humanitarian conditions worsen or if negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program progress. \"If those talks gain momentum, Iran may pressure the U.S. to rein in Israel’s campaign against Hamas to preserve what remains of the group. Whether the U.S. team,led by Steve Witkoff, entertains such demands will be a key regional development to watch.\" On the ground, Israel has moved to reshape the humanitarian landscape in Gaza. The decision to restrict Hamas’s access to aid reflects a broader policy shift under IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, who reversed his predecessor's stance and authorized the military to directly oversee the distribution of supplies. \"Hamas will not regain control over the aid, because that was its lifeline,\" an Israeli security official explained. \"It’s what allowed it to maintain control over the territory throughout this period. People in Gaza know that Hamas controls the aid; if they realize that Hamas no longer does, its control within the Strip becomes ineffective.\" Israeli troops deployed to Gaza.(IDF) Humanitarian organizations and international leaders continue to condemn Israel. U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres, speaking on April 8, condemned the ongoing blockade of aid. \"More than an entire month has passed without a drop of aid into Gaza. No food. No fuel. No medicine. Gaza is a killing field — and civilians are in an endless death loop,\" he said. Israel’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Oren Marmorstein, strongly rejected the Secretary-General’s claims. \"As always, you don’t let the facts get in the way when spreading slander against Israel,\" he posted on X. \"There is no shortage of humanitarian aid in the Gaza Strip — over 25,000 aid trucks have entered during the 42 days of the ceasefire. Hamas used this aid to rebuild its war machine. Yet, not a word in your statement about the imperative for Hamas to leave Gaza. The people of Gaza are braver than you — they’re calling, loud and clear, on Hamas to leave and stop abusing them.\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with Defense Minister Israel Katz(Israeli PM) Eugene Kontorovich, a senior legal scholar at the Heritage Foundation, told Fox News Digital: \"One doesn’t need the Israeli Supreme Court to say there is no starvation in Gaza — this was admitted by the UN’s own Food Security Phase Classification, which in June found that prior UN reports were inaccurate and that there is no famine. There is no serious evidence of starvation in Gaza, and what food scarcity does exist can be attributed to Hamas pillaging and hoarding aid. As the truth comes out, it becomes clear that the starvation claims were designed to halt Israel’s legitimate self-defense against a genocidal attack.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP As military and diplomatic tracks converge, Israeli officials remain cautiously optimistic that talks may soon produce results.

Delegates from the United States and Iran are holding talks in Oman on Saturday in a delicate effort to restart negotiations over Tehran’s controversialnuclear program. The talks, between a mediator toIran's Foreign MinisterAbbas Araghchi and U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff, come nearly seven years after President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the U.S. from Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers in 2018. Since then, indirect talks between the two adversaries have made zero progress. Trump has imposed new sanctions on theIslamic Republicas part of his \"maximum pressure\" campaign and has suggested military action remained a possibility. Despite this, the president has said he still believed a new deal could be reached by writing a letter to Iran's 85-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, which he sent early last month.

Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, whose rule was cemented in a CIA-led coup in 1953, had fled Iran before the revolution, ill with cancer, as demonstrations swelled against his rule. Late in 1979, university students overran the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, seeking the shah's extradition and sparking the 444-day hostage crisis that severed diplomatic relations between Iran and the U.S. TRUMP'S GOT IRAN CORNERED BY FOLLOWING REAGAN'S DOCTRINE In the decades since, Iran-U.S. relations have see-sawed between enmity and grudging diplomacy, with relations peaking when Tehran made the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers before Trump withdrew from the deal, sparking more tensions in the Mideast that persist today.

The last report by the International Atomic Energy Agency on Iran's program put its stockpile at 18,286 pounds as it enriches a fraction of it to 60% purity. U.S. intelligence agencies assess that Iran has yet to begin a weapons program, but has \"undertaken activities that better position it to produce a nuclear device, if it chooses to do so.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Iran has insisted for decades that its nuclear program is peaceful. However, its officials increasingly threaten to pursue a nuclear weapon. Iran now enriches uranium to near weapons-grade levels of 60%, the only country in the world without a nuclear weapons program to do so. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

    "article_text": "Monash IVF clinic in Brisbane, Australia, identified it had mistakenly transferred an embryo that was not genetically related to the mother who gave birth to that child. (Credit: The Associated Press) A fertility clinic inAustralia has confirmeda critical error in which one woman gave birth to another couple’s child after an embryo transfer went wrong. The incident occurred at Monash IVF’s Brisbane clinic and is being described as the result of \"human error,\" despite what the company says are strict protocols in place. Monash IVF revealed that the mistake was identified in February, after the birth parents requested their remaining embryos be transferred to another clinic. During that process, an extra embryo was found in storage, sparking an internal investigation. It was then confirmed that an embryo belonging to a different couple had been incorrectly thawed and transferred, ultimately resulting in the birth of a child. GEORGIA WOMAN SAYS SHE'LL 'NEVER FULLY RECOVER' AFTER IVF MIX-UP LEADS TO HER LOSING CUSTODY OF BABY \"Monash IVF can confirm that an incident has occurred at our Brisbane clinic, where the embryo of one patient was incorrectly transferred to another patient, resulting in the birth of a child,\" Monash IVF said in astatementto Fox News Digital. \"Our focus is on supporting our patients through this extremely distressing time. We are devastated about what has happened and apologize to everyone involved. \"We are truly sorry.\" An exterior view of the Monash IVF clinic in Brisbane, Australia.(AuBC, CHANNEL 9 via AP) The clinic stressed that it is prioritizing the privacy of the families involved, including the child, and confirmed that the information being shared publicly has been de-identified with their knowledge.

Within a week, the Medical Director of the Brisbane clinic began meeting with the affected patients to offer apologies and support. The company said it conducts regular compliance audits and is now undertaking full process reviews while reinforcing safeguards acrossall of its clinics. \"On behalf of Monash IVF, I want to say how truly sorry I am for what has happened. All of us at Monash IVF are devastated and we apologize to everyone involved. We will continue to support the patients through this extremely distressing time,\" Monash IVF Group CEO Michael Knaap said. \"Since becoming aware of this incident, we have undertaken additional audits and we're confident that this is an isolated incident. \"We are reinforcing all our safeguards across our clinics – we also commissioned an independent investigation and are committed to implementing its recommendations in full.\" A technician conducts a control check during the IVF process using a microscope.(Getty Images) Monash IVF has not released further information about how the child was returned to the biological parents or the current legal status of the case. The case echoes a similar incident in the U.S. involving a Georgia woman. In 2023, Krystena Murray underwent IVF treatment at Coastal Fertility Specialists and gave birth to a baby who was not biologically hers. A DNA test confirmed the error, and after a custody battle, Murray was compelled to give the child, a boy, to his biological parents. Murray has since filed a lawsuit against the clinic, citing emotional distress and negligence. It is unclear if the families involved will be compensated for the Monash IVF Group's error.

    "article_text": "President Donald Trump signs executive orders aimed at deregulating a range of industries and takes questions from reporters after a tariff pause on countries other than China. PresidentDonald Trumpramped up steep tariffs against Chinese imports to the U.S. this week while alleviating them for other countries during trade negotiations this week. He also signed a series of executive orders aimed at repealing Biden-era restrictions. The Trump administration announced Wednesday it would lower reciprocal tariffs on other countries, while also revealing that the administration would immediately hike tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%. In response, China has raised its tariffs on U.S. goods to 125%. Trump disclosed historic tariffs in a ceremony at the White House’s Rose Garden for a \"Make America Wealthy Again\" event on April 2, asserting that these new duties would generate new jobs for U.S. workers. HOW WE GOT TO LIBERATION DAY: A LOOK AT TRUMP'S PAST COMMENTS ON TARIFFS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent departs following a tariff announcement in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, April 2, 2025.(Photographer: Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA/Bloomberg via Getty Images) The tariff plan established a baseline tax of 10% on all imports to the U.S., along with customized tariffs for countries that place higher tariffs on U.S. goods. The baseline tariffs of 10% took effect Saturday, while the others took effect Wednesday at midnight. But Trump announced in a post on Truth Social Wednesday that reciprocal tariffs announced last week would remain paused for 90 days, during which period the countries would only face the baseline 10% tariff. \"At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable,\" Trump posted on his Truth Social media platform on Wednesday. Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent said that the tariffs suggest that China is at odds with the rest of the world. \"China is the most imbalanced economy in the history of the modern world,\" Bessent told reporters Wednesday. \"They are the biggest source of the U.S. trade problems, and indeed they are the problem for the rest of the world.\" Here’s what also happened this week: Trump also signed an executive order this week aimed at reinvigorating the shipbuilding industry in the U.S., amid concerns that China is outpacing the U.S. in production. China is responsible for more than 50% of global shipbuilding, compared to just 0.1% from the U.S., according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The executive order requires agencies to craft a Maritime Action Plan and instructs the United States Trade Representative to provide a list of recommendations to deal with China’s \"anticompetitive actions within the shipbuilding industry,\" among other things. TRUMP ENDS BIDEN-ERA WATER REGULATIONS TO ‘MAKE AMERICA’S SHOWERS GREAT AGAIN' President Donald Trump speaks to reporters as he signs executive orders in the Oval Office of the White House on April 9, 2025.(Getty Images) Trump also signed an executive order to reverse Obama- and Biden-era conservation measures that limited water pressure in showers in an attempt to\"make showers great again.\"Former President Barack Obama initially imposed the water pressure restrictions, and Trump sought to ease some of them during his first term. However, former President Joe Biden reinstated the measure, which limited multi-nozzle shower heads from releasing more than 2.5 gallons of water per minute. \"I like to take a nice shower, take care of my beautiful hair,\" Trump said Wednesday. \"I have to stand in the shower for 15 minutes until it gets wet. Comes out drip, drip, drip. It’s ridiculous.\" The Trump administration also unveiled plans this week for upcoming talks to negotiate with Iran on Saturday. While Trump has reiterated that these discussions will be \"direct\" nuclear talks, Iran has pushed back on that description and characterized them as \"indirect\" negotiations instead. Middle East envoy Stever Witkoff will travel to Oman on Saturday and is slated to potentially meet with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. However, Iran has maintained that the discussions will be held through a third party instead. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt speaks with reporters in the James Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House, Friday, April 11, 2025, in Washington. \"The ultimate objective is to ensure that Iran can never obtain a nuclear weapon,\" Leavitt told reporters Friday. \"The president believes in diplomacy, direct talks, talking directly in the same room in order to achieve that goal. But he's made it very clear to the Iranians, and his national security team will, as well, that all options are on the table and Iran has a choice to make. You can agree to President Trump's demand, or there will be all hell to pay. And that's how the president feels. He feels very strongly about it.\" Fox News’ Bonny Chu, Danielle Wallace, and Caitlin McFall contributed to this report.

Gretchen Whitmer has \"done an excellent job\" and called her a \"very good person.\" (Credit: X/ @RapidResponse47) While most Democrats have rejected President Donald Trump throughout his second term, Michigan Gov.Gretchen Whitmerbucked the party line during a trip to Washington Wednesday amid speculation about her 2028 campaign aspirations. Democratic governors, many rumored to harbor 2028 presidential ambitions, spoke out against Trump's tariffs this week as governorsJB Pritzkerand Gavin Newsom worked independently with trade partners to try to soften the damage to their state economies. Whitmer's diplomatic moves put her out of step with her party, and the verdict is still out on how it will affect her politically down the line. Brad Bannon, a Democratic strategist and the president of Bannon Communications Research, told Fox News Digital dialogue with Trump is critical to Whitmer delivering for Michigan, particularly through the uncertainty of Trump's tariff deals. But he said Whitmer, a potential 2028 presidential candidate, getting too close to Trump could jeopardize her status as a \"first-tier presidential candidate,\" alongside governors Josh Shapiro, Andy Beshear and Newsom. \"This is a double-edged sword,\" Bannon said. \"She has to have an open dialogue with the president, but at the same time, if she's going to win the Democratic presidential nomination or have a chance to win it, she is going to have to be very critical of Trump.\" DEM GOVERNORS REVOLT AGAINST TRUMP'S 'LIBERATION DAY' TARIFFS Michigan Gov.

Newsom has invited Trump allies and conservative guests, including Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon, onto his show in an attempt to show he is open to \"criticism and debate without demeaning or dehumanizing one another.\" The strategy follows criticism after the 2024 presidential election that Democrats didn't prioritize new media appearances and unscripted conversations enough. Whitmer seemed to embrace the bipartisan strategy this week by carefully criticizing Trump's tariffs while also acknowledging an understanding the president's \"motivation behind the tariffs\" and even agreeing with Trump that we \"need to make more stuff in America.\" GRETCHEN WHITMER ANGERS DEMOCRATS, SUFFERS 'HUGE EMBARRASSMENT' WITH TRUMP MEETING AT WHITE HOUSE Michigan Gov.

As Trump signed executive orders and answered questions from the press in the Oval Office, he said Whitmer had \"done an excellent job\" as governor and called her a \"very good person,\" a break from his typical lines of attack on her character. \"One of her opponents will dig that clip up and put it in a television ad,\" Bannon said. The Democratic Governors Association (DGA), which applauded Democratic governors for standing up and speaking out against Trump's tariffs this week, characterized Whitmer's trip to Washington as a willingness to work with \"anyone\" to deliver for Michigan. \"Gov. Whitmer and Democratic governors across the country are doing what they’ve always done as strong and successful state executives — working with anyone to get real results for their states while also standing up against policies that harm their residents. As Donald Trump and Republicans in D.C. continue to sow economic chaos and raise prices, it’s more important than ever that we continue to elect Democratic governors who know how to get things done on the biggest issues impacting families every day,\" DGA communication director Sam Newton told Fox News Digital.

    "article_text": "Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sen. Tim Scott talks trade war with China, the future of crypto, and debanking. FIRST ON FOX— In an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital, Republican South Carolina Senator and former presidential candidateTim Scottshared his views on his first hundred days as Senate Banking Committee chairman, breaking down a trade war with China, the future of cryptocurrency and controversial debanking policies. With Republicans holding power in both chambers of Congress andPresident Donald Trumpin the White House, party leaders and supporters across the country had high expectations of the GOP’s policy agenda and ability to pass critical legislation swiftly and effectively. However, it has not been a perfect start to the 119th Congress. Republicans in the House of Representatives hold a slim 7-seat majority, and GOP infighting has forced internal debates that have delayed key pieces of legislation, like Trump’s \"big, beautiful\" tax bill, which passed last Thursdayjust 216 to 214. GOP SENATORS BULLISH ON POST-EASTER 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL' BUDGET AGREEMENT Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.) photographed inside his office at the Senate Hart Building in Washington, D.C.(Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post via Getty Images) On the Senate side, Republicans hold an 3-seat majority over Democrats. With just 100 members in the upper chamber, the same principle of internal harmony must exist for legislation to move forward. Despite the narrow margins, Scott says some of the policy goals the committee has set they have \"been able to accomplish.\" \"I wanted within the first hundred days to have some crypto or digital asset legislation marked up and run through our committee,\" Scott told Fox News Digital. \"Good news is the GENIUS Act is stamped. Done. Heading to the Senate floor. Number two, the FIRM Act. Focusing on debanking. Done. Heading onto the Senate Floor. Number three, our ability to listen to President Trump, the leader of not only our party, but of our country.\" Trump’s role in working with congressional leaders was first demonstrated asevery cabinet memberthat reached the Senate so far for confirmation was approved at the fastest pace in more than 20 years. \"We've been running these folks through our committee,\" said Scott. \"It is a lightning-fast approach, but the good news is President Trump and the American people deserve his team in place. Promises made, promises kept. We are well on our way.\" VP VANCE BLASTS MCCONNELL'S VOTE AGAINST TRUMP PENTAGON NOMINEE: 'POLITICAL PETTINESS' Senate Banking Committee chairman Tim Scott has described the first hundred days of Congress, a trade war with China and the timeline for implementing critical crypto policies.(Reuters) Outside the nominees, several prominent issues have made their way through the banking committee in the first hundred days. And one of the hottest items in banking today is the implementation of cryptocurrency into U.S. markets and day-to-day life. Notably, the GENIUS Act, a bill\"to provide for the regulation of payment stablecoins,\"would be a major advancement for crypto markets, showing the federal government is taking the digital asset market more seriously. But Scott blamed theBiden administrationfor the lack of enthusiasm to get pro-crypto legislation signed into law. \"There's no doubt that under the Biden administration and Gensler at the SEC, they just... didn't like crypto. What I've said very often is simply this: we must innovate before we regulate. That means allowing innovation to happen here at home in the digital asset space is critical to American economic dominance across the globe,\" he explained. The GENIUS Act passed through committee in March and now heads to the Senate Floor. Scott predicted the timeline as to when the bill would be signed into law, telling Fox he believed the legislation would be \"passed into law by August.\" TRUMP CRYPTO CHIEF SAYS WE ARE IN THE 'GOLDEN AGE' FOR DIGITAL ASSETS, 'CLEARING THE DECK' OF BIDEN BARRIERS The bill made its way through committee with an 18-6 as Senators Mark Warner, D-Indiana, Andy Kim, D-New Jersey, Ruben Gallego, D-Arizona, Lisa Blunt Rochester, D-Pennsylvania and Angela Alsobrooks, D-Maryland all voted with Republican against the wishes of Ranking Leader Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts. Cryptocurrency markets have been highly volatile in the past weeks largely due to ongoing tariffs policies and trade standoffs.(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) But crypto markets, along with U.S. stocks, have been highly volatile in the past weeks, largely due to Trump’scontroversial tariffs policiesand trade standoffs. When asked about the mounting pressure between the U.S. and China, Scott backed Trump’s strategy, telling Fox News Digital, \"This is about a country, China, that lies, cheats, and steals. Not on the watch of President Trump. He is going to use every tool in his toolkit to make sure that the Chinese government does not continue to take advantage of the American economy. I am thankful that we finally have a president with a backbone made of steel to stand up to President Xi and protect not just America's present but America's future.\" HERE’S WHEN AMERICAN CONSUMERS, BUSINESSES WILL FEEL THE STING OF 145% CHINA TARIFFS Scott argued that establishing economic dominance \"requires hard conversations and a tariff regime to push China into the smallest corner of the global economy if they're going to lie, cheat, and steal against us.\" He added, \"We are not going to give them full and unfettered access to our market. That's called common sense.\" President Donald Trump sits for an interview with Fox News.(Fox News/Hannity) On Friday, China raised tariffs on U.S. imports to 125%, which Trump has maintained that a 145% tariff will be placed on China’s imports.

    "article_text": "Fox News national correspondent Jeff Paul reports on Moscow's release of a U.S.-Russia dual national who was jailed over a pro-Ukraine donation on 'Special Report.' At least 26 Americans held hostage abroad have been freed since President Donald Trump entered the Oval Office in January. Those who gained their freedom include a ballerina, a teacher and a mechanic, among others. On Jan. 21, 2025, just one day after Trump’s second term began, Ryan Corbett and William McKenty were released from Taliban captivity in Afghanistan. While Corbett and McKenty were freed under Trump, the deal that secured their release was completed by the Biden administration. Corbett and his family moved to Afghanistan in 2010, where they lived in Kabul and Jalalabad. According to awebsite set up by his family, Corbett did work for NGOs, which focused on education, birth and life-saving skills. He also started a project in 2017, Bloom Afghanistan, with the goal of strengthening the country’s private sector. In 2021, the Corbett family evacuated as the Taliban took control of the country. Corbett returned to Afghanistan a year later and was captured by the Taliban, which his family suspects was because of his \"value as political leverage.\" There aren’t many details on McKenty or exactly why he was in Afghanistan.According to the BBC, his family asked for privacy.

While Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced Nuhfer’s release, he did not give details on when she was detained or why. However, according to The Associated Press, a former high-ranking Belarusian official said the arrest was linked to 2020 protests against Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. Special envoy Ric Grenell secured the release of six Americans after meeting with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. Grenell posted a photo of himself and the men on a plane and said that they \"couldn’t stop thanking\" Trump when speaking to him on the phone. The men were not identified.

American schoolteacher Marc Fogel was released from Russian captivity Feb. 11, 2025, more than three years after he was detained. Fogel was carrying less than one ounce of medical marijuana, according tohis family’s website, which he used for severe pain. The Fogel family criticized former President Joe Biden’s handling of Marc’s case, especially in light of his work to release WNBA player Brittney Griner, who was also arrested for having marijuana. On July 13, 2024, Fogel’s mother, Malphine, attended a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, Marc’s hometown. She spoke with Trump, who promised to bring her son home.

    "article_text": "National Republican Senatorial Committee chair Sen. Tim Scott tells Fox News Digital his goal is 55 seats in next year's midterm elections. Longtime Republican Rep. Bill Huizengaof Michigansays that as soon as Democratic Sen. Gary Peters announced earlier this year that he wouldn't seek re-election in the key Great Lakes battleground state in next year's midterms, \"my phone started to ring and it hasn't stopped ringing.\" Huizenga, who was first elected to the House in 2010 and represents Michigan's 4th Congressional District, which covers parts of the southwestern part of the state, highlighted that he's getting \"encouragement\" to seek the Senate from \"grassroots folks,\" as well as donors. \"I have been very flattered and honored to have this kind of support emerging,\" he said. TheSenate seatin Michigan is a top target for the GOP in the 2026 midterm elections to flip from blue to red, as the party aims to expand its current 53-47 majority in the chamber. And the emerging showdown is expected to be one of the most expensive and bruising battles of the cycle. 2026 ELECTIONS: THIS SENATOR IS RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR NEXT YEAR Republican Rep. Bill Huizenga of Michigan speaks at a campaign rally for former President Donald Trump in Portage, Michigan, on Nov. 1, 2024.(Bill Huizenga campaign) Huizenga, who is now the vice chair of the House Financial Services Committee, pointed to \"the connections that I've got and have built up over the last now going into my eighth term here\" when asked about fundraising. \"It's donors in Michigan. It's donors nationally,\" he touted. \"I've got a network of folks that have been very, very helpful in the past, and they're very interested in helping me out again.\" WILL THIS BLUE STATE REPUBLICAN END THE GOP'S 20-YEAR LOSING STREAK IN HIS STATE? But Huizenga isn't the only Republican making noise about a Senate run. Former Rep. Mike Rogersannounced at the end of January that he was \"strongly considering\" a second straight Republican run. And Rogers, a former FBI special agent who later served as chair of the House Intelligence Committee during his tenure in Congress, is likely to announce his campaign on Monday. Michigan Republican Senate candidate Mike Rogers speaks during a Trump/Vance campaign rally in Flint, Michigan, on Nov. 4, 2024.(AP Photo/Paul Sancya) Rogers won the 2024 GOP Senate nomination in Michigan but narrowly lost to Rep. Elissa Slotkin, the Democrats' nominee, in last November's election in the race to succeed longtime Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow, who retired. Slotkin, who vastly outspent Rogers, edged him by roughly 19,000 votes, or a third of a percentage point. Asked if a campaign launch by Rogers would affect his decision-making process, Huizenga said \"quite honestly, no.\" \"I think the question that everyone needs to answer is, who can win? Who can win the state of Michigan, and Michigan politics has shifted, and that's the reality,\" he said. A LIKELY BRUISING SENATE BATTLE IN BATTLEGROUND MICHIGAN HEATS UP AS THIS CANDIDATE ENTERS THE RACE Michigan was once part of the Democratic Party's blue wall states that helped boost the party's candidates in presidential elections. But PresidentDonald Trumpnarrowly carried Michigan in his 2016 and 2024 White House victories. \"What we don't know is whether that Trump coalition of union households, Hispanics, the Arab American population and African Americans, especially males, that came out and supported Donald Trump, along with those independents and Republicans, whether that coalition is going to be held,\" Huizenga said. Republican Rep. Bill Huizenga of Michigan arrives at a campaign rally for former President Donald Trump in Portage, Michigan, on Nov. 1, 2024.(Bill Huizenga campaign) And Huizenga pointed to his double-digit re-election margin last year in a competitive House District (his seat is one of 35 House seats Democrats are targeting in next year's midterms). Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer narrowly won the district in her 2022 re-election victory, and Trump carried the district by six points last November. WHY PETE BUTTIGIEG SAID NO TO RUNNING FOR THE SENATE NEXT YEAR An endorsement by Trump, whose sway over the GOP is stronger than ever, is expected to play a significant role in the Republican Senate primary in Michigan. And while Trump has yet to weigh in on the race, Rogers earlier this year hired veteran Republican strategist and 2024 Trump co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita as a senior advisor.

Mike Rogers, right, speaks alongside former President Donald Trump during a campaign event hosted by Trump at the Falk Productions manufacturing facility in Walker, Michigan, on Sept. 27, 2024.( Scott Olson/Getty Images) Asked about his relationship with Trump, Huizenga called it \"very good\" and claimed that \"there is one elected official that has spoken at all three of his last rallies [in Michigan], in 2016, 2020 and 2024, and that's me.\" As for his timetable, Huizenga said: \"I'm still going to do my evaluation here, and need to kind of push through on the fundraising and need to make sure that I'm able to get the support that I really need to have to be able to do this kind of run.\" \"We're still more than a year out from the filing deadline, and so there's a lot of runway here, and so I'm not in a huge hurry,\" he added. \"It needs to be done soon. But it would seem to me, sometime this summer or right after Labor Day, is more than enough time to make sure that we got the right candidate.\" THIS CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR IS MULLING 2026 STATEWIDE RUN IN KEY BATTLEGROUND And in what appeared to be a comment directed at Rogers, Huizenga added that \"it's better to have the right person at the right time, rather than somebody early on.\" Besides Rogers and Huizenga, business executive, conservative commentator and 2022 Republican gubernatorial nomineeTudor Dixonhas said she's seriously mulling another run for governor, or for the Senate, in 2026. And Republican businessman and auto dealership executive Kevin Rinke, who ran for governor in 2022, is also thought to be considering another statewide run next year.

(Credit: Nicholas Ballasy) California has a $6.2 billion budget deficit for Medicaid services, and Democratic Gov.Gavin Newsom'slatest budget proposal projects the state will spend a staggering $8.4 billion to cover Medi-Cal, the state's version of Medicaid, for illegal immigrants in 2024-2025. Two new reports by the Bureau of Economic Analysis found the U.S. economy has become increasingly reliant on government handouts. Entitlements are growing faster than tax receipts and wages.Private wages grewby $67 billion in early 2025, while government payments to recipients surged by $162 billion. In North Carolina and California, growth in Medicaid benefits wasthe leading contributorto increased personal income. Coverage for undocumented immigrants under California's $6.2 billion budget gap for Medi-Cal is contributing to the surge in personal income. Fox News Digital asked lawmakers on Capitol Hill if taxpayers should have to pick up the Medicaid tab for illegal immigrants. Popular progressive senators Adam Schiff, D-Calif.; Michael Bennett, D-Colo.; and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., refused to say whether illegal immigrants are entitled to Medicaid benefits funded by U.S. taxpayers. NEWSOM ASKS FOR NEARLY ANOTHER $3B FOR STATE HEALTH PROGRAM OVERWHELMED BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS Popular progressives, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., right, refused to say whether illegal immigrants are entitled to Medicaid benefits funded by U.S. taxpayers when asked by Fox News Digital.(Fox News Digital ) Sen. Jon Husted, R-Ohio, who was tapped by moderate Republican Gov. Mike DeWine to replace Vice PresidentJD Vancein the Senate this year, told Fox News Digital it should be illegal for Americans to fund healthcare for illegal immigrants. NEWSOM CONCEDES SKYROCKETING HEALTHCARE COSTS FOR ILLEGALS ARE 'PARTIAL' CONTRIBUTOR TO MEDICAID PROBLEM \"That cost should be transferred back to the state of California if that's the decision that they made. If people are here illegally, the taxpayers of this country should not be footing the bill for their healthcare when we can barely pay our own bills here in this country and people are going without. So, this is an astonishing thing that California would decide to do. Clearly, the leaders of that state are tone deaf because that's not what the American public wants,\" Husted said. Rep. Maria Salazar, R-Fla., who serves on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and on Small Business, said she doesn't support any federal funding for federal programs for illegal immigrants. \"We need to see those numbers,\" Salazar said. \"I'm not in favor of any undocumented migrants in the United States using any type of federal funding or federal programs, because if you are not documented, you cannot be using any of the government or the federal government services. \"But I need to know what are the numbers. I do believe that in construction, hospitality and agriculture, the illegals, the undocumented are giving a lot to the economy.\" Sen.

And this is costing the American people a lot of money. So, yeah, that is a problem, and it's one we need to fix,\" Lee said. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said he has questions about the policy and wants to know more about the substance of Medicaid benefits for undocumented immigrants and \"whether it applies in emergency situations where somebody's life may be at stake.\" Another Northeast Democrat, Sen. Andy Kim, D-N.J., said he is more concerned \"we're not taking away Medicaid from people with disabilities, seniors that need long-term care\" before discussions begin on expanding resources. Sen.

Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., a Trump loyalist, said California made a \"conscious decision\" to allow taxpayers to pick up the tab on healthcare forillegal immigrants. \"They fully realize and appreciate that the federal government does not have one single penny to spend until the taxpayer sends that penny into the treasury,\" Blackburn said. Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., said California needs to realize the impact its policies have on other states. Democratic California Gov.

They're struggling to pay for things they used to be able to take for granted, like food and gasoline. And it's absolutely wrong that one state can expand its benefits to illegals, and my state has to pay for it,\" Lummis said. \"Cost increases to the Medicaid program are driven by multiple factors, including expansion, increased enrollment for all populations and pharmacy costs,\" a spokesperson for Newsom said when reached by Fox News Digital for comment. Newsom's office emphasized thatMedi-Cal coversapproximately 15 million Californians, which accounts for more than one-third of the state's population. Program costs have more than doubled in the past decade, according to the governor's office. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Given Medi-Cal's size, Newsom's office said even a 1-2% increase in drug prices or hospital visits could mean billions of dollars in additional costs for the program, and states across the country and political spectrum are facing their own rising Medicaid expenses, specifically Pennsylvania and Indiana.

    "article_text": "Fox News correspondent Danamarie McNicholl reports on how local law enforcement in Florida is helping with deportations on ‘Special Report.’ A federal judge has upheld aTrump administrationpolicy that allows U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to carry out enforcement operations at churches and other places of worship despite lawsuits against it from faith-based groups. U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich, appointed by Trump during his first term, denied a request from more than two dozen Christian and Jewish organizations to block the policy. The groups said it infringeson religious freedomsand is causing drops in attendance, especially among immigrants worried about being detained by ICE. The court found little evidence that ICE is targeting churches or that the change in policy is solely to blame for fewer people attending services. Friedrich noted that only a few enforcement actions have actually taken place at or near religious sites. MARYLAND IMMIGRANT WRONGLY DEPORTED TO EL SALVADOR MUST RETURN TO US, SUPREME COURT RULES A sign that prohibits the entrance of ICE or Homeland Security is posted at a church in New York.(AP Photo/Seth Wenig) \"That evidence suggests that congregants are staying home to avoid encountering ICE in their own neighborhoods, not because churches or synagogues are locations of elevated risk,\" Friedrich wrote in her opinion. The policy at the center of the lawsuit took effect Jan. 20, Trump’s first day back in office. On that day, the Department of Homeland Security rescinded an Obama-era guideline that had discouraged ICE agents from making arrests in \"sensitive locations,\" including schools, hospitals and places of worship. Under the new rule, ICE officers no longer need special approval to act at these locations as long as they apply \"common sense\" and \"discretion.\" Religious leaders said that change went against more than three decades of precedent, whichaimed to protect immigrantsand other vulnerable populations from being targeted at sacred or essential community spaces. TRUMP THREATENS TO CUT ALL FEDERAL FUNDING TO SANCTUARY CITIES: 'DISGRACING OUR COUNTRY' The court found little evidence that ICE is targeting churches.(ICE) The judge, however, said bringing back the old policy might not change attendance numbers, since broader immigration enforcement actions could still keep people away. Other legal challenges to immigration enforcement in sensitive locations are also making their way through the courts. A federal judge in Maryland temporarily blocked operations at religious sites for some groups, including Quakers. But a judge in Colorado ruled in the administration’s favor in a similar case involving enforcement at schools.

    "title": "Genetic cholesterol eliminated by new drug, reducing heart attack risk, study finds",
    "article_text": "Dr. Nick Norwitz, a study leader and independent researcher at the University of Oxford, discusses the surprising findings of a new study on the link between ketogenic diets and heart disease risk. Researchers have discovered an experimental medication that significantly reduces a cholesterol-like particle that can increase the risk ofheart attacks and strokes. Many Americans are unaware that elevated levels of this particle — known as lipoprotein(a) or Lp(a) — are circulating in their blood. Elevated Lp(a) cannot be modified with lifestyle changes, and has been called \"one of the last untreatable frontiers of cardiovascular risk\" by Cleveland Clinic, who led the study. LOW-CARB KETO DIET MAY NOT RAISE HEART DISEASE RISK, NEW STUDY SUGGESTS This new research confirmed earlier findings showing that theexperimental drug— lepodisiran, made by Eli Lilly, who funded the study — can \"silence\" the main gene responsible for synthesizing Lp(a). (Other experimental gene therapies with a similar mechanism of action are also in development, according to Cleveland Clinic.) Researchers have discovered an experimental medication that significantly reduces a cholesterol-like particle that can increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes.(iStock) The findings were published in The New England Journal of Medicine and were also presented at the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology on March 30. Lipoprotein(a) levels are elevated in approximately 20-25% of people worldwide, according to the American Heart Association. This equates to approximately 64 million people in the U.S. and 1.4 billion people globally. Lp(a) shares similarities with another lipoprotein that doctors target to reduce the risk of heart disease, known as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) – often referred to as \"bad cholesterol.\" HEART DISEASE RISK HIGHER FOR WOMEN WHO HAVE THESE UNHEALTHY LIFESTYLE HABITS But lipoprotein(a) is more prone to plaque buildup and clots in the arteries than LDL, according to lead author Steven Nissen, M.D., chief academic officer of the Heart, Vascular & Thoracic Institute at Cleveland Clinic. \"Lipoprotein(a) is an independent risk factor for heart disease that is largelydetermined by genetics— that is, it is inherited,\" added Dr. Deepak L. Bhatt, director of Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital and a professor of cardiovascular medicine at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, told Fox News Digital. (He was not part of the study.) Lipoprotein(a) levels are elevated in approximately 20-25% of people worldwide, according to the American Heart Association.(iStock) Lp(a) is primarily determined by differences in one gene, while LDL cholesterol levels are influenced by multiple genes. \"That's a very big difference, and LDL has a much larger environmental component,\" Nissen noted. \"Lp(a) is an independent risk factor for heart disease that is largely determined by genetics.\" Diet, exercise and weight losscan help decrease LDL levels, but they do not have an impact on Lp(a) levels, experts say. And unlike LDL, which can be reduced with medications like statins, there are currently no approved drug treatments that lower Lp(a). \"There is no approved pharmacotherapy for lipoprotein(a) by regulatory authorities in any country in the world,\" Nissen confirmed. The researchers performed a clinical trial of 320 individuals from Argentina, China, Denmark, Germany, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Romania, Spain and the U.S. from Nov. 11, 2022, to April 17, 2023. The participants were randomly assigned to receive either a placebo or one or two subcutaneous injections of lepodisiran. Diet, exercise and weight loss can help decrease LDL levels, but they do not have an impact on Lp(a) levels, experts say.(iStock) The normal level of Lp(a) is less than 75 nanomoles per liter and the average level forpeople in the trialwas about 250 nanomoles per liter, Nissen told Fox News Digital. \"They were very high — more than three times the upper limit of normal,\" he added. WHEN MEASURING HEART ATTACK RISK, ONE IMPORTANT RED FLAG IS OFTEN OVERLOOKED, DOCTORS SAY After one injection of the highest dose, participants showed a nearly 100% reduction in levels of lipoprotein(a) at six months. Those who received a second dose at six months maintained an almost 100% reduction at the one-year mark. In other words, the therapy removed virtually all lipoprotein(a) from the blood, according to Nissen. Unlike traditional cholesterol, which doctors typically monitor over time, lipoprotein(a) only needs to be checked once in a lifetime.(iStock) Cardiologists say these findings may ultimatelyhelp treatmillions of Americans who have elevated levels of Lp(a). \"The results are very impressive,\" Bhatt said. The researchers noted that there were no majorsafety concerns, but 12% of participants reported mild reactions at the injection site. The study had only a few Black participants — a population that needs more research, as they are more likely to have elevated lipoprotein(a) concentrations than White persons, according to previous studies. (To address this concern, the researchers are enrolling many more Black patients in their larger phase 3 clinical trial.) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Another limitation was that only two doses of lepodisiran were administered in the trial, so the effect of more doses is not known. The study also did not show that reducing Lp(a) levels also reduces the risk ofheart attacks and strokes, outside experts noted. The European Society of Cardiology and the National Lipid Association in the U.S. both recommend that all adults check their Lp(a) levels.(iStock) \"A phase 3 trial testing the clinical impact of this drug is needed to see if the large reduction of Lp(a) translates into lower rates of heart attack,\" Bhatt said. Nissen confirmed that the phase 3 trial to address this question is already underway. \"Whatever your level is when you're 24 years old is the level when you're 64 years old – it doesn't change, because it's genetic.\" The European Society of Cardiology and the National Lipid Association in the U.S. both recommend that all adults check their Lp(a) levels.

As four-time MVP quarterbackAaron Rodgersremains in the free agency pool, another potential option may have opened up for him in the NFL. The New Orleans Saints could be desperate for a veteran option at the position after news that Derek Carr’s 2025 season could be in jeopardy due to a shoulder injury. NFL Network reports that surgery could be an option for Carr, which \"threatens his availability for this season.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers speaks at a news conference after an NFL football game against the Los Angeles Rams in East Rutherford, N.J., Sunday, Dec. 22, 2024.(AP Photo/Seth Wenig) Injury was a theme in Carr’s second year inNew Orleanslast season, as he missed seven games last year due to a concussion and fractured hand. Now, with his season in jeopardy, perhaps the Saints could tap into Rodgers to see if the Big Easy is somewhere he’d want to star next year. SAINTS' DEREK CARR'S SEASON IN JEOPARDY DUE TO NEW SHOULDER INJURY: REPORT \"Expect to see a report, sooner [rather] than later, that the Saints have reached out,\"Pro Football Talk’s Mike Florio said on Friday. \"Whether it goes anywhere remains to be seen. However, New Orleans becomes another option for Rodgers.\" The New York Giants and Pittsburgh Steelers were the other two frontrunners for Rodgers, but the former is out of that running after signing Russell Wilson, the Steelers’ starting quarterback, last season, as well as Jameis Winston this free agency period. New Orleans Saints quarterback Derek Carr reacts after their loss against the Carolina Panthers in an NFL football game on Sunday, Nov. 3, 2024, in Charlotte, N.C.(AP Photo/Jacob Kupferman) It was expected, then, that Rodgers would be heading to the Steel City, but he hasn’t made his intentions known just yet. The Minnesota Vikings continue to remain an option, but the organization is adamant that J.J. McCarthy, their first-round pick last season who had to miss the whole year due to injury, is their starter heading into camp. As for the Saints, Carr’s absence for the season would leave the quarterback position up to Spencer Rattler or Jake Haener, as the depth chart reads. Rattler filled in for Carr during his injuries last year, and it didn’t work out for the 2024 fifth-round pick, as he went 0-6 in his six starts. While Rodgers may be an option, the ninth overall pick belongs to the Saints this year, and they will be an interesting team to watch.

    "title": "Hackers find a way around built-in Windows protections",
    "article_text": "Tech expert Kurt ‘CyberGuy’ Knutsson says a tech support scam used a fake Windows Defender pop-up, tricking the victim to call and download software. All Windows PCs come with a built-in security feature calledWindows Defender Application Control(WDAC), which helps prevent unauthorized software from running by allowing only trusted applications. However, despite its purpose, hackers have discovered several ways to bypass WDAC, exposing systems to malware, ransomware and other cyber threats. As a result, what was once considered a strong layer of defense may now serve as a potential vulnerability if not properly managed. STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS — SIGN UP FOR KURT’S THE CYBERGUY REPORT NOW Image of a Windows laptop.(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) is asecurity feature in Windowsthat enforces strict rules about which applications can run. It helps block unauthorized software, but researchers have found ways to bypass these protections. Bobby Cooke, a red team operator at IBM X-Force Red,confirmedthat Microsoft Teams could be used as a WDAC bypass. He explained that during Red Team Operations, they were able to get around WDAC and execute their Stage 2 Command and Control payload. GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE To find and fix these security gaps, Microsoft runs a bug bounty program that rewards researchers for reporting vulnerabilities in WDAC and other security components. However, some bypass techniques go unpatched for long periods. Teams Electron API Surface revealed.(IBM) DOUBLECLICKJACKING HACK TURNS DOUBLE-CLICKS INTO ACCOUNT TAKEOVERS One of the key ways attackers get around WDAC is by using Living-off-the-Land Binaries, or LOLBins. These are legitimate system tools that come pre-installed with Windows, buthackers can repurpose themto execute unauthorized code while avoiding security detection. Since these tools are trusted by the system, they provide an easy way to slip past defenses. Some bypass techniques involve DLL sideloading, where attackers trick legitimate applications into loading malicious DLLs instead of the intended ones. Additionally, if WDAC policies are not enforced properly, attackers can modify execution rules to allow unauthorized software to run. Hackers also use unsigned or loosely signed binaries. WDAC relies on code signing to verify an application’s authenticity. However, attackers sometimes exploit misconfigurations where loosely signed or unsigned binaries are mistakenly allowed, letting them execute malicious payloads. Once an attacker bypasses WDAC, they can execute payloads without being flagged by traditional security solutions. This means they can deploy ransomware, install backdoors, or move laterally within a network without triggering immediate suspicion. Since many of these attacks use built-in Windows tools, detecting malicious activity becomes even more difficult. WINDOWS DEFENDER VS ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE: FREE PROTECTION FALLS SHORT Image of a Windows laptop.(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) RELENTLESS HACKERS ABANDON WINDOWS TO TARGET YOUR APPLE ID Since this attack exploits a vulnerability within WDAC, there is little you can do to fully protect yourself. It is up to Microsoft to fix the issue. However, here are three best practices you can follow to reduce your risk. 1. Keep Windows updated:Microsoft regularly releases security updates that patch vulnerabilities, including those related to WDAC. Keeping Windows and Microsoft Defender up to date ensures you have the latest protection against known threats. If you’re not sure how to do that, see myguide on how to keep all your devices and apps updated. 2. Be cautious with software downloads:Only install applications from trusted sources like the Microsoft Store or official vendor websites. Avoid pirated software, as it can come bundled with malicious code that bypasses security protections like WDAC. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? 3. Use strong antivirus software:Based on the report, it does not appear that hackers require user interaction to bypass WDAC. The methods described suggest that an attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities without direct user input, especially if they already have some level of access to the system. However, in real-world scenarios, attackers often combine such exploits with social engineering or phishing to gain initial access. For example, if an attacker gains access through a phishing attack, they might then use WDAC bypass methods to execute further malicious payloads.

    "title": "DAVID MARCUS: Sorry Dems, literally nobody believes married women can’t get IDs",
    "article_text": "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt outlines President Donald Trump's response to foreign conflict on 'Hannity.' The latest ridiculous lie from Democrats about how Republicans are driving the country towards fascism is out, and it is a doozy. This time, we are meant to believe that Trump and the GOP are banning married women from voting. Spoiler Alert: They aren’t. REAL ID DEADLINE FOR TRAVELERS, SOME FEDERAL BUILDING ACCESS QUICKLY APPROACHING Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., and others took to video this week to make the nonsensical and logically tortured claim, saying, \"House Republicans’ so-called ‘SAVE Act’ blocks nearly 70 million women from registering to vote—just because they changed their name after marriage.\" Here is what failed glass-ceiling breakerHillary Clintonhad to say: \"The House just passed the Republican voter suppression measure that threatens voting access for millions of Americans, including 69 million women whose married names don’t match their birth certificates.\" Miami, Florida, Miami International Airport, TSA checkpoint security screening, Real ID sign.(Jeffrey Greenberg/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) The Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act requires prrof of citizenship to cast a vote in federal elections. Among the acceptable documents for demonstrating proof of citizenship are: A REAL ID-compliant driver’s license, a valid U.S. passport, and a military ID. You would think the driver's license requirement would be simple enough, but then again, blue-state Democrats screwed that up when they insisted on giving driver's licenses to illegal immigrants whose supporting documents could not be verified. Now, the rest of us have to get extra verification for our driver's licenses so they can be distinguished from the ones handed out like candy to illegal aliens. So now, Democrats are seriously suggesting that married women in our country are all but incapable of obtaining verified identification and therefore will be disenfranchised by Republicans, presumably while they twist their handlebar mustaches and kick some puppies. I’d like to ask Rep. Swalwell, if married women are incapable of getting IDs such as a driver's license, then why is there an almost endless line of them in cars in front of me at the school pick-up line? Furthermore, I am given to understand that married women quite regularly travel abroad. If they can’t get a passport, then how is this happening? Are their husbands bribing border officials? … there are approximately 70 million married women in the United States who may have taken their spouse's last name, which means there are 70 million Americans who know damn well how easily they can obtain valid ID. If, in fact, there is some intractable issue preventing married women from getting ID, then we should fix it. But given that nobody had ever heard of this \"major problem\" until Republicans brought up a voter ID law, it is, well, suspicious. This is especially true, given that up to 80% of Americans support showing valid ID to vote, yet instead of honoring the will of the people, the left, once again, goes charging towards facile identity politics. You have to hand it to the Democrats. When they latch onto a message, they immediately start yelling it in unison with all the subtlety of a sky-writing competition, like last month, when they all started cursing like Andrew Dice Clay one day. As cosmically stupid and demonstrably false as it is, this claim that married women will be disparately impacted, or uniquely disadvantaged by the voter ID law is par for a very dangerous course that the Democrats run over and over. According to the Democrats, we can’t have safer streets because minorities or the poor will be arrested more often, we can’t protect women in sports because that violates trans rights and now we can’t secure the vote because married women don’t know how to get IDs. This is all \"disparate impact ad absurdum.\" if there is one non-white, non-straight, non-cis person in America who faces a negative consequence from legislation, then the whole thing has to be tanked. Meanwhile, Democrats push policies like student debt relief that clearly disadvantages Americans who never went to college, but in this case somehow the discrimination is enlightened. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The final nail in the coffin of this insane notion that the GOP wants to disenfranchise everyone with \"Mrs.\" in front of her name, or in Democrats opinion, his or her name, is that married women lean Republican in their voting. In fact, recent polling has shown that with full voter participation, the Republicans and Trump would have won by even more in 2024, so why on earth would the GOP want to leave those votes on the table? CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Ultimately, what the Democrats have here is a reality problem. As Swalwell pointed out, there are approximately 70 million married women in the United States who may have taken their spouse's last name, which means there are 70 million Americans who know damn well how easily they can obtain valid ID. So get out there and vote, married ladies. There is literally nothing stopping you.

    "title": "Microdosing spirituality: How our everyday attachments connect us to the divine",
    "article_text": "‘Fox News Sunday’ host Shannon Bream visits the Museum of the Bible to talk with Torah scribe Rabbi Moshe Englander about biblical history and the museum’s collection of Judaic artifacts. In the course of reviewing social science literature in conjunction with my forthcoming book, \"God Was Right: How Modern Social Science Proves the Torah is True,\" I have come across a strange subgenre of research. It is in the use of hallucinogens forspiritual growth. This practice happens often at festivals (such as Burning Man), but elsewhere as well, and not just at annual occasions. Indeed, the practice of \"microdosing\" has people take \"small\" doses of psychedelic substances frequently. A major purpose of this practice is to enable people to have\"spiritual\" experiences. It is popular. According to a 2022 study from Columbia University (using data from 2019), 5.5 million Americans use hallucinogens a year. This number is surely greater now, especially given the significant number of popular television shows that now celebrate the use of psychedelics and that they are legal in some states. The Torahwantsus to microdose spirituality – through properly conceiving our all-day/everyday activities.(Fox) What wouldthe Torah– which, of course, has a lot to convey about spirituality (often referred to as \"holiness\") – say about this practice? TEN COMMANDMENTS ARE IMPORTANT FOR CHILDREN TO LEARN FROM, NOT JUST SEE The first answer comes from Deuteronomy 4:9, where we are instructed to \"guard yourself very well.\" This is an imperative to be healthy. The use of hallucinogens is certainly not that. Numerous studies have demonstrated that \"bad trips\" are common – with, often, severe outcomes. These include self-harm, harming others, paranoia, fear, anxiety, convulsions, seizures, alienation from loved ones and flashbacks that can occur at any time in the future. The secondanswer from the Torahmay be gleaned from an unlikely source – Numbers 6, where God speaks with Moses about people who choose to take \"a Nazirite vow of abstinence.\" One who takes a Nazarite vow, the text explains, abstains from a variety of things: drinking wine, shaving and coming near a dead person (including parents and siblings). He is the ascetic par excellence. At the conclusion of this period, he must bring a sin-offering to the temple. The sin-offering indicates that the person who took the vow of abstinence did something wrong. THE DESTRUCTIVE POLITICS OF HATE VS. THE POWER OF FAITH What could it be? It is, it seems, the same thing that the users of hallucinogens do. They look for spirituality bydetachingfrom the world. The Nazarite does so by remaining in the society – but by forbidding himself otherwise permissible things, in order to achieve a higher sense of spirituality. The hallucinogen user goes even further, and detaches himself from the world by taking substances whose entire purpose is to transport him to another plane. What is the problem with this? Again, theTorah has the answer. In Exodus 25:8, God tells the newly freed Jewish ex-slaves to build a sanctuary. The wording of his command is deeply instructive. God says: \"They shall make a Sanctuary for me – so that I may dwell among them…\" Not, as we might expect, \"dwell in it\" – but \"dwell among them.\" God is teaching us that he wants to dwell – he wants spirituality to be identified and experienced – in between people, in the real world of daily activities. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION This message is reinforced throughout the Torah. In Exodus 31:5, God fills the artisan Betzalel with \"a divine\" spirit to do his labors – showing that stonecutting, woodworking and weaving can be sacred activities. Time and again, the Torah is clear: We don’t find God or achieve spiritual heights bydetachingfrom the world.(iStock) In Leviticus 19, God issues a lot ofethical principles and moral laws(such as not cursing the deaf, placing a stumbling block before the blind and gossiping). He punctuates each one by saying, \"I am Hashem\" – showing that our daily interactions are spiritually important. In Deuteronomy 14:23, God tells the people to \"tithe the crop of your planting\" and then \"eat before Hashem\" – showing that the simple act of eating after giving is a moment for spiritual celebration. And in Exodus and Deuteronomy, we are commanded to \"sanctify the Sabbath day\" – teaching us that we can create a day of spiritual magnitude every week. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Time and again, theTorah is clear: We don’t find God or achieve spiritual heights bydetachingfrom the world. We do so byattachingto the world. The Torahwantsus to microdose spirituality – through properly conceiving our all-day/everyday activities. If we see every action, meal, conversation, decision and interaction as an opportunity to do something holy – to, as Leviticus 19:2 instructs, \"Beholy\" – our days will be full of profound spiritual experiences. And we’ll experience these spiritual highs much more frequently, dependably, meaningfully and safely than any drug microdoser – and enjoy the social joys and benefits that the escapist cannot experience.

    "title": "BROADCAST BIAS: Networks go full negative spin over tariff turbulence, steer clear of good economic news",
    "article_text": "In a press gaggle outside the White House on Thursday, Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins lauded President Trump's tariffs strategy and shared updates on wholesale egg prices. (Credit: AP) Economic indicators in PresidentDonald Trump’sfirst term presented hard facts for a lot of positive reporting before the COVID pandemic lockdowns, but that’s not what the broadcast networks presented to America. Thirty-oneDow Jonesrecords were set between January 1, 2017 and January, 26, 2018. Overall, in 2017, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose more than 25%. The networks routinely ignored the records. But when the market went down in that year, they pounced. NBC’s Lester Holt warned \"Is the so-called Trump bump over?\" So, it’s not surprising that in the currenttariff turbulence, the broadcast networks are accentuating the negative. On April 4, the Bureau of Labor Statistics found the economy added a stronger-than-expected 228,000 jobs in March. The \"CBS Evening News\" didn’t report it. ABC’s \"World News Tonight\" gave it 14 seconds. On \"NBC Nightly News,\" anchorman Lester Holt dramatically demonstrated the commitment to negative spin, given the bad day on the stock market. TRUMP 'OPTIMISTIC' CHINA WILL MAKE TARIFF DEAL, WHITE HOUSE SAYS \"The breathtaking fall stripping $5 trillion in wealth from U.S. markets in just two days. Squeezing personal savings, leaving companies scrambling to adjust. Many signaling they will have to raise consumer prices on their imported products, big and small,\" he warned. \"Not even a surprisingly strong jobs report – 228,000 jobs added in March – was enough to stem today's market slide.\" Behind Holt, a graphic screamed: \"Markets Lose $5 Trillion+ In Trump Tariff Meltdown.\" Nobody thinks a dark day on the stock market isn’t headline news. But theanti-Trump energyis always present. On April 9, when stocks skyrocketed back after President Trump put a 90-day pause on new tariffs (except for China), NBC anchor Tom Llamas reported the good news, but then hit the brakes. \"There are big questions hanging all over this,\" he said. Business correspondent Christine Romans acknowledged the gains, adding: \"But consumers still facing higher prices on steep tariffs with China and small businesses wondering where things will stand in 90 days.\" Llamas then turned to playing up the China angle: \"That new 125% tariff on China is expected to make everything from clothing to electronics to furniture even more expensive here in the U.S. Brian Cheung now on the prices you may be soon paying.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION These same networks constantlydownplayed inflationunder Biden. In November of 2021, Stephanie Ruhle went on \"Sunday Today\" and claimed we could handle higher prices. \"The dirty little secret here….while nobody likes to pay more, on average we have the money to do so. Household savings hit a record high over the pandemic. We didn’t have anywhere to go out and spend….So, we need to put all of this in perspective.\" Today, they are playing up the prospects of inflated prices in the future. Not only that, but they’re also not interested in the actual inflation news in the present. On April 10, the consumer price index actually declined 0.1 percent, for a year-over-year inflation rate of 2.4 percent. Once again, on the nightly newscasts, it received short shrift. On NBC, Christine Romans gave it eight seconds: \"That bright spot, consumer prices fell in March from the month before, bringing the inflation rate to 2.4 percent.\" That’s eight seconds in a doom-and-gloom report that aired for two minutes and 44 seconds. On CBS, anchor John Dickerson mentioned in passing: \"Falling gasoline prices are helping to bring inflation down. The government reported today that consumer prices fell a tenth of a percent in March.\" That was almost nine seconds out of CBS pushing five minutes of tariff anxiety. ABC skipped it entirely. They found time to report that China was restricting the importation of American movies – bad news for their Disney overlords – but not the current inflation rate. The \"PBS News Hour\" added insult to injury, preceding 15 words on the inflation statistic with economic mockery from Team Biden: \"On CNN, former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said President Trump took a wrecking ball to the economy.\" Yellen claimed \"This is the worst self-inflicted wound that I have ever seen an administration impose.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP PBS reporter John Yang added, \"The consumer price index data was collected before the president's toughest tariffs. But economists warn that higher prices as a result of the tariffs could emerge in a matter of months.\" They always display a big \"But.\" When it comes to Trump, on any issue, the broadcast network \"news\" shows seem designed to push a 100-percent negative narrative – or if they manage ten seconds of good news, it’s 95 percent negative. This illustrates how they could be denounced as making \"fake news\" – the facts may be accurate, but the spin makes it look like a Democrat campaign commercial instead of straight-ahead journalism.

    "article_text": "Fox News legal editor Kerri Urbahn discusses the upcoming ruling on the case of anti-Israel activist Mahmoud Khalil on ‘America Reports.’ Visiting America is not an entitlement. It is a privilege extended to those who respect our laws and values. And, asSecretary of State, I will never forget that. U.S. law lays out clear rules about who can and cannot come to the United States. The State Department’s consular officers are required to apply these rules to each of the millions of visa applicants around the world each year. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), aliens who endorse or espouse terrorist activity or persuade others to endorse or espouse terrorist activity or support a terrorist organization – such as Hamas – are ineligible for U.S. visas. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTER MAHMOUD KHALIL CAN BE DEPORTED, JUDGE RULES What’s more, the INA gives us broad authority to revoke a visa. This authority is fundamental to safeguarding our national security, as well as protecting Americans and lawful visitors within our borders. The Trump administration’s commitment to security and the enforcement of our immigration laws is unprecedented and unwavering. We expect – and the law requires – all visa holders to demonstrate their eligibility every day their visa is valid. This includes respecting our laws, behaving appropriately according to their visa type, and continuing to meet these standards throughout their stay in our country. U.S. visa holders should know in no uncertain terms that the U.S. government’s rigorous security vetting does not end once a visa is granted. U.S. visa holders should know in no uncertain terms that the U.S. government’s rigorous security vetting does not end once a visa is granted. Working together with DHS and other law-enforcement and security agencies, we continuously monitor and review these cases. This vigilance is essential because circumstances can and do change. For example, visas may be revoked if the visa holder has engaged in violent crime or drunk driving, supporting terrorism, overstaying the time permitted for their visit, performing illegal work -- or anything else that violates the terms on which we granted them this privilege or compromises the safety of our fellow Americans. When information about such activities comes to the department’s attention, our expert staff review it and assess whether revocation is appropriate. Columbia University student Mahmoud Khalil, who served as a spokesman for anti-Israel protesters at Columbia University, now faces deportation.(Selcuk Acar/Anadolu via Getty Images) Recent events have underscored why our commitment to enforcing the INA and protecting public safety is particularly vital today. There are over 1.1 million foreign students in the United States, including at our nation’s most elite universities. In the aftermath of theOctober 7, 2023 terrorist attacks against Israel, some of these foreign student visitors engaged inantisemitic activitiesand intimidation of Americans, many who happened to be of the Jewish faith. These foreigners shut down college campuses for American citizens, harassed Jewish students, blocked highways, and stormed buildings. The Trump administration is committed to taking the necessary steps to stop these activities at American universities. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION As Secretary of State, I will continue exercising my authority to support President Trump’s zero-tolerance approach to foreign nationals who abet terrorist organizations or participate in activities that threaten our national security or compromise a compelling foreign policy interest. The Supreme Court has made clear for decades that visa holders or other aliens cannot use the First Amendment to shield otherwise impermissible actions taken to support designated foreign terrorist organizations like Hamas, Hizballah, or the Houthis, or violate other U.S. laws. They will continue to face consequences – including visa denial, revocation, or deportation. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Our first responsibility is to keep the American public safe. While I am Secretary, we will never hesitate to act decisively – and in close coordination with our U.S. government partners – when information indicates a visa holder could compromise our security, has violated U.S. law, or visa revocation is otherwise warranted. U.S. visas are a privilege, rather than a right, reserved for those who make the United States better, not seek to destroy it from the inside.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us In recent years, focus on career and delayed marriage age is driving some women to consider preserving their fertility through egg freezing. But the steep cost of the procedure,estimated at $10,000 to $15,000per attempt, means many women can’t afford it during their most fertile years: 20s and early 30s. Cofertility, a startup founded by former Uber executive Lauren Makler and health tech angel investor Halle Tecco, offers women no-cost egg freezing in exchange for donating half the retrieved eggs to those unable to conceive. The three-year-old startup just raised a $7.25 million Series A round led by Next Ventures and Offline Ventures, with participation from Initialized, Gaingels, and several other investors. This financing round brings Cofertility’s total funding to $16 million. The idea for Cofertility stems from Makler’s fertility and health scare. A 2018 diagnosis of a rare abdominal disease led to multiple surgeries that threatened the loss of her ovaries. In such situations, doctors sometimes suggest egg freezing for young women who want to have children, but that was not an option for Makler. So, she started to learn as much as possible about egg donation. Makler knew donors were compensated for their eggs, but she was shocked to learn how expensive the eggs could be. If she wanted an egg from a Jewish donor to match her background, it would cost more. The price increased further if she sought an egg from an educated woman. “It felt sort of like surge pricing for egg donors, which felt icky to me,” she said, referring to Uber’s approach for charging for rides during peak-demand times. Luckily, Makler ended up conceiving a child naturally, but that experience led her to want to build a business that matches young women who wish to preserve their fertility with people who need a donor egg. While the concept of egg sharing is not new, Makler claims that Cofertility is the only company that offers eggs at scale through its “Split” program. “At any given time, we have hundreds of donors that are available for intended parents,” Makler said, adding that most clinics will have only a handful of donors, which is unlikely to result in a match. Makler says that Cofertility’s egg donors come from diverse backgrounds and that about 55% of them have graduate degrees. Intended parents cover the egg retrieval costs and Cofertility’s coordination fee, similar to standard egg donation. However, they don’t have to compensate the donor, lowering their out-of-pocket expenses. While Makler doesn’t want to call Cofertility a marketplace, she agrees that it works like one and that her company is solving a big structural problem. “The big vision and the goal is removing the taboo of egg donation,” she said, “There is zero shame in however you become a parent. Doing that with the help of a donor who’s also interested in freezing her own eggs is a really exciting option.” Topics Reporter, Venture The most interesting startups showcased at Google Cloud Next Hacked documents reveal guide to serving Elon Musk on private jets OpenAI will soon phase out GPT-4 from ChatGPT Fintech founder charged with fraud after ‘AI’ shopping app found to be powered by humans in the Philippines Mira Murati’s AI startup is reportedly aiming for a massive $2B seed round The US Secretary of Education referred to AI as ‘A1,’ like the steak sauce WhatsApp introduces new features across chats, calls, and channels © 2025 Yahoo.",

While President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he woulddelay many of the market-shaking tariffsthat he’d announced the previous week, he kept a universal baseline 10% tariff in place, while also increasing tariffs on Chinese goods to 125% (on top of a 20% tariff that he’d already imposed on goods from China). There’s been plenty of speculation aboutwhat the tariffs will mean for the tech industry, which manufactures many consumer electronics in China and elsewhere abroad. One of Trump’s stated goals is to bring manufacturing back to the United States, but others believethe dream of an American-made iPhone is a fantasy. Those debates may be paused after Friday evening, when U.S. Customs and Border Protection posteda list of product categoriesthat are “excluded from the reciprocal tariffs imposed under Executive Order 14257,” with the exclusions backdated to April 5. Those categories appear to include smartphones, laptops, hard drives, and semiconductors. Those products will all be exempt from both the 125% tariff on goods from China, as well as the universal baseline tariff. (Other tariffs, such as the previous 20% tariff on Chinese goods, would presumably still apply.) Notable Silicon Valley figuresled by Elon Muskhave joined the Trump administration, while other tech CEOs have been courting Trump, most visibly with millions of dollars donated to his inauguration. Those efforts seemed tobear little fruit— until last night’s announcement, which Daniel Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities,describedas “a dream scenario for tech investors.” Tech giants like Apple and Nvidia are likely celebrating the news, as are U.S. consumers who will avoid a big markup on their next iPhone.

    "title": "The xAI–X merger is a good deal — if you’re betting on Musk’s empire",
    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us When Elon Musk announced that his AI startup, xAI, had acquired his social media company, X (formerly known as Twitter), in anall-stock deal, it raised some eyebrows. But in many ways, the deal made sense. xAI’s chatbot, Grok, was already deeply integrated with X,X was floundering financially, and Musk needed a way to make his $44 billion Twitter acquisition look less like an impulsive takeover and more like a strategic play forAGIdominance. It also pointed to something deeper about how Musk’s empire works: investing in any one of his companies isn’t about a quick return on investment. It’s about buying into the mysticism around Musk and swallowing whole a narrative of success that outpaces the actual numbers. Some call it agrift, pointing to Musk’s history ofoverpromising and underdelivering. But the market is increasingly more tolerant – welcoming, even – of narrative-led investments, particularly when the thread that ties the tale together is one of the president’s right-hand men. “All of Elon’s companies today are basically one company,” Yoni Rechtman, a principal at Slow Ventures, told TechCrunch. “It’s all already Elon, Inc. There are people who work across multiple companies simultaneously. They share a web of capital connections. They do business with one another, and he treats them all effectively as one company. So [the xAI-X merger] just ends some of the fiction that the two businesses were separate.” The thinking among Musk bulls like Ron Baron, the founder of investment management firm Baron Capital, is that “every single thing [Musk] does is helping everything else he does,” as Baronphrased it. Other businesses under Musk’s control include Tesla, SpaceX, The Boring Company, and Neuralink – some of whichreportedly share resources. “When [Musk] bought Twitter, did he have in his mind that there’s an opportunity to have this data, a tremendous value for licensing? When he decided he wanted to go to Mars with SpaceX, did he really think initially that there’s a real opportunity here for the internet around the world, and there’s gonna be hundreds of billions of dollars of revenue opportunity? When he started off with EVs for Tesla, did he really think that this is gonna merge into self-driving, where you can make hundreds of billions of dollars a year of extra profits, and Grok […] and you’re gonna have connected cars all around the world? […] All these businesses link up. It’s the ecosystem. It’s the Elon ecosystem, and I think it’s really interesting when you look at it that way.” Baron Capital has invested across Musk’s ecosystem, an example of the investor crossover between the billionaire’s various companies. Firms like 8VC, Andreessen Horowitz, DFJ Growth, Fidelity Investments, Manhattan Venture Partners, Saudi Arabia’s PIF, Sequoia Capital, Vy Capital, and others also hold positions throughout Musk’s corporate web. That brings us back to the xAI-X deal. Pundits questioned how the acquisition could value X at $33 billion,more than triple its valuationjust a few months ago, and how it could value xAI at $80 billion considering the AI companyreportedlyhas little in the way of revenue. But valuations aren’t always based on what exists today. Rather, they take into account what investors are hoping for – and that’s particularly true when it comes to Musk’s ventures. Just look at Tesla. The electric vehicle maker has been treated like a tech stock for years despite the fact that it hasautomaker margins, based largely on the belief that Tesla will one day unlock groundbreaking autonomy in the form of self-driving cars and humanoid robots. “The reason why [Tesla’s] stock trades at 80 times earnings and the comp group trades at 25 times earnings is that people are making a bet on the long term, and it’s not about what happens to numbers this year,” Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, told TechCrunch. “That’s one of Elon’s superpowers, this ability to keep investors engaged for the long term.” Munster’s firm has invested in X, xAI, and Tesla. It’s exactly the type of all-in Musk backer that stands to benefit the most from a deal like xAI buying X, assuming Musk can indeed deliver on his pledge of marrying X’s real-time data trove and distribution platform with xAI’s infrastructure and AI expertise. Of course, consolidated value also comes with increased risk. Dan Wang, a professor at Columbia Business School whose research lies at the intersection of business and society, told TechCrunch that the biggest immediate risk factor for investors is the ongoing lawsuit that X is facing from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The suit accuses Musk of misleading investors by delaying the disclosure of his previous investments in Twitter. The SEC has argued that this allowed Musk to buy more Twitter shares at artificially low prices. Wang listed a few other risk considerations, such as anticompetition and user privacy concerns, particularly regarding how X quietly opted all users into data collection for AI model training. The opt-in change has already raised the ire of one regulator,Ireland’s DPC, which recently began investigating it as a potential breach of Europe’s GDPR law. “Another kind of risk here is that there isn’t a consensus framework for how the AI market is going to be regulated, but you’re already seeing traces of this in Europe and, up until recently, in California,” Wang said. “A lot of these frameworks have to do with how AI models are deployed in terms of distributing information […] They ascribe responsibility to the companies that are creating AI models, as well as providing access to those models.” Musk might also simply lose interest in a project, Rechtman said. “I think that is what a lot of Tesla shareholders are feeling right now,” he said, “where for the last several months, Elon’s number one company has been the Trump campaign, and his other projects have languished.” When asked about some of these risk factors, Munster appeared nonplussed. He suggested they’re inconsequential given the enormity of, for example, xAI’s value proposition and potential to become a dominant player in AI. “We’re betting the firm on the belief that AI is going to be more transformative than what people think,” he said. “What is the value […] of one of the four brains that the world is going to run on?” Rechtman said that Musk bulls aren’t blindly loyal, per se, but simply trust in Musk’s superpower to “bend capital markets to his will” in a way that allows him to do things and build businesses that nobody else can. “The people who are in these businesses have just gone long Elon, and they will continue to go long Elon,” Rechtman said. “So it’s not surprising to me that they will just continue to tell you that the emperor is wearing clothes.” Not for nothing, buying into Musk’s more speculative bets, like X, is one way to potentially unlock more investment opportunities in the Muskverse, Rechtman said. “SpaceX is a real thing, and it will never go public,” he said. “So the only way to invest in SpaceX is to get access to the tenders. And the only way to get access to the tenders is to be in Elon’s good graces.” Topics Senior Reporter Rebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch, where she covers Tesla and Elon Musk’s broader empire, autonomy, AI, electrification, gig work platforms, Big Tech regulatory scrutiny, and more.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Thirteen years ago,Forerunner Venturesbegan helping to usher in a new era of consumer startups, including Warby Parker, Bonobos, and Glossier. None has gone through a traditional IPO process. Warby Parker wastaken publicthrough a special purpose acquisition vehicle. Bonoboswas acquiredby Walmart. Glossier is still privately held, along with many other design-forward brands in Forerunner’s portfolio. That’s not a failure, according to Forerunner founder Kirsten Green. In today’s landscape, nearly every alternative to the traditional IPO has become the new norm. Consider that companies like fintech Chime and smart ring outfit Ōura, founded in 2012 and 2013, respectively, were also early bets for Forerunner and have achieved valuations north of $5 billion, proving their staying power in crowded markets. But whileChime has confidentially filed to go public, Ōura’s CEO has said there areno immediate plans for an IPO. AtTechCrunch’s StrictlyVC eveninglate last week, Green made it clear she doesn’t mind. Asked specifically whether she is bothered by Ōura’s CEO, Tom Hale, repeatedly telling the media the company isnot preparing an IPOanytime soon despite strong sales, she called the outfit an “off-the-charts phenomenal company,” adding that “we haven’t even gotten to the thought around our table about selling, because we’re here for the growth that’s happening.” She suggested instead that investors long ago adapted to a world with fewer conventional public offerings, including by turning increasingly to the once-secondary secondary market to manage liquidity and exposure. “We’re engaged in the secondary market, buying and selling,” Green said of Forerunner’s team, characterizing the shift as both practical and strategic. “Companies are waiting so long to go public. The venture model is generally 10-year fund lifecycles. If you now need to be a double-digit billion-dollar company to [stage] a successful IPO or [become traded] in the public markets, it takes time to get there.” The secondary market is “continuing to drive the industry” and allowing “people to unlock returns and liquidity.” For longtime industry watchers, it’s a remarkable shift. In the past, firms could expect a major liquidity event within a few years: an acquisition, a classic stock market debut. Yet the growing reliance on the secondary market isn’t just a response to public markets that reward scale and favor already high-performing companies. Another major benefit, Green suggested last week, is that price discovery is more efficient when there are more participants involved — even if it ultimately means a discount to one of her deals. Green addressed, for example, Chime, the neobank that became a household name during the fintech boom. Its valuation haszigzaggedwildly in recent years, from $25 billion in 2021 when it last closed a primary round of funding from a small group of venture investors, down to a reported $6 billion valuation last year on the secondary market, which typically features many more participants. More recently, it reportedly climbed again to $11 billion. “In terms of the prices,” Green said, “if you think about it, the round that gets done, the Series D, that was a negotiation between the company andaninvestor. With the secondary market, you’ve got more people in the mix, right? And then when you [eventually] go to the public markets, you’ve got everybody” setting the price for what they perceive to be the value of a company. Green can afford to be a little less invested, so to speak, in those later valuations. While it’s always nice to be associated with eye-popping numbers, the firm’s strategy of getting in at the ground floor gives it more wiggle room than other venture firms might enjoy. “We try to be early,” Green said, pointing to the firm’s framework of identifying major shifts in consumer behavior and pairing them with emerging business models. It worked in the early 2010s, when DTC brands like Bonobos and Glossier rode the mobile-social wave to breakout success. It worked again with subscription-first plays like another Forerunner company, The Farmer’s Dog, which sells gourmet dog food and is reportedly both profitable and seeing$1 billion in annualized revenue. And it’s what the firm is betting on now, with a focus on the intersection of invention and culture, as Green describes it. Great companies, Green noted, need time to develop and not all growth paths look the same. Venture capital, once eager for exits, is learning to wait and, when necessary, get creative.

    "title": "Manchester Arena bomber attacks prison officers",
    "article_text": "Counter-terrorism police are leading the investigation into an attack on three prison officers by Hashem Abedi, one of the men responsible for the Manchester Arena bombing. The officers sustained life-threatening injuries on Saturday including burns, scalds and stab wounds in the attack at HMP Frankland in County Durham, the Prison Officers' Association said. Abedi, 28, who was jailed for life for helping his brother carry out the 2017 suicide bombing, threw hot cooking oil over the officers and used \"home made weapons\" to stab them, the organisation said. The Prison Service confirmed three officers have been treated in hospital after an attack by a prisoner. Counter-terrorism policing (CTP)'s Cdr Dom Murphy said: \"Given the nature of the incident, it has been agreed that CTP North East will lead the investigation, supported by Durham Constabulary. \"This is an ongoing investigation which is in its early stages, and we are working hard to establish the facts. Therefore, we are unable to comment further at this time.\" Two men and a woman were injured, with the latter since discharged from hospital. A prison officer at HMP Frankland told BBC News \"staff are shaken by what's happened\". \"It's a difficult day at the prison when colleagues are seriously hurt. You can't help asking yourself why you do this job when something like this happens,\" they added. Abedi's brother Salman Abedi carried out the Manchester Arena bombing which killed 22 people. After Hashem Abedi was named by the Prison Officers' Association as being involved in the attack, a government source confirmed to the BBC he was the prisoner involved. He was found guilty in 2020 of 22 counts of murder, attempted murder and conspiracy to cause an explosion likely to endanger life and sentenced to a minimum term of at least 55 years before he could be considered for parole. The sentence was a record for a determinate prison term. In 2022, Abedi, along with two others, was found guilty of a previous \"vicious attack\" on two prison officers at Belmarsh Prison in south-east London. For this attack he received a sentence of three years and 10 months - which was added to his previous minimum term. Saturday's attack took place in a separation centre at Frankland used to hold the country's most dangerous and influential extremist prisoners. The centre holds less than 10 inmates. Abedi has been a long-term resident. Following the incident, the chair of the Prison Officers' Association, Mark Fairhurst, said the freedoms given to prisoners in these centres should be reviewed. \"I am of the opinion that allowing access to cooking facilities and items that can threaten the lives of staff should be removed immediately,\" Mr Fairhurst said. \"These prisoners need only receive their basic entitlements and we should concentrate on control and containment instead of attempting to appease them. Things have to change.\" Former prison governor John Podmore told the BBC this incident was a \"catastrophic security failure\" as he underlined this unit holds the \"most violent and dangerous\" offenders. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood said: \"I am appalled by the attack of three brave officers at HMP Frankland today. My thoughts are with them and their families. \"The police are now investigating. I will be pushing for the strongest possible punishment. Violence against our staff will never be tolerated.\" Shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick called the attack \"extremely concerning\". \"There are serious concerns about the prison leadership's ability to contain the threat from Islamist extremist inmates,\" he said. \"This deeply serious security failure must be a turning point,\" he added as he referenced a previous social media post of his titled \"Britain's prisons are being overrun by Islamist gangs\". A spokesperson for the Prison Service said violence in prisons \"will not be tolerated\". \"We will always push for the strongest punishment for attacks on our hardworking staff.\" Additional reporting by Cachella Smith A watchdog says despite some \"negative findings\", staff are committed to meeting standards. NHS bosses say they need to focus on making improvements following the Nottingham attacks. Simon Woodall and Josh Morris smuggled items such as phones, drugs and tobacco into prisons. Children at Wetherby Young Offender Institution are locked up \"for hours on end\", campaigners say. The 143-year-old Glasgow jail which is due to be replaced in 2028 is operating at 30% over capacity.",

    "title": "Chris Mason: British Steel law rushed through Parliament but it is just a stop gap",
    "article_text": "There was a moment where all they could do was wait. Government officials were holed up in a Premier Inn down the road from British Steel's steelworks in Scunthorpe and parliament's work to change the law to allow them to take control of the Chinese-owned company was complete. But they couldn't move yet. All they could do – along with all the politicians 200 miles south in Westminster - was wait. They were waiting for Royal Assent, the formality in the legislative process when the King formally agrees to make a bill an act of parliament, and so the law. Not that this was snail's pace law-making, far from it. This was a legislative sprint, the timeline from First Reading to Royal Assent measured in hours, not the months it would normally take. That moment of Royal Assent happened at around 18:00 on Saturday night and with that those officials could head into the plant. The after emergency legislation was rushed through Parliament in a single day. There were concerns in government about the prospect of unrest. Around 40% of the workforce there are Chinese, 60% are British. Many of the Chinese staff have worked for British Steel's parent company, Jingye, all of their working lives. Some have parents or grandparents who worked for the firm too. Most are now leaving. A new management structure has been put in place, with the professional services firm EY having been hired by the government to assist with this. There is an optimism among ministers that with the law changed they can secure the necessary raw materials to keep the two working blast furnaces in Scunthorpe doing just that - working. Jingye had been seeking to sell off to other buyers raw materials already en route to Lincolnshire, which is what convinced the government it had to act and act quickly. Others, not least the Conservatives, wonder if it really did need to be so last minute and whether some of these problems could have been anticipated much sooner. And some within the industry say the moment of jeopardy has not yet passed. Securing the necessary materials to keep blast furnaces up and running isn't like ordering something online via click and collect - these are highly complex international supply chains with long time lags and at a time of trading turmoil with President Trump's tariffs. And remember all of this, for all of the Westminster drama of a weekend sitting, is just a stop gap. Nationalisation, the government taking on full ownership of British Steel, looks increasingly likely. If the Chinese parent company don't quibble with this desire, if it comes about, it could happen without further legislation. But if they did, another new law would be needed. The prime minister has described leading what he claims is a \"government of industry\". He emailed Labour Party supporters on Saturday night about the new law, and the subject line was \"British Steel. British jobs\". Another case study, reckon some who know the Prime Minister's mind, of an instinct for a sliver of economic nativism. A muscular government intervention in an era dominated by President Trump's guiding principle of \"America First\". There are big questions and big numbers attached to this path – and so potentially big budgetary implications too down the track. Those officials in Scunthorpe won't have to hang around in their hotel rooms any longer. But they have plenty to do. SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn challenged the UK government over similarities to the closure of the Scottish oil refinery Officers also seized £70,000 of cash and identity papers. BBC News finds Scunthorpe residents digging in to protect its steelmaking industry. A source said the issues being discussed by government officials and the firm remain unresolved. British Steel has warned materials needed to keep blast furnaces operational in Scunthorpe are running out.",

    "title": "Lib Dem MP refused entry to Hong Kong",
    "article_text": "A Liberal Democrat MP has spoken of her \"shock\" after being barred from entering Hong Kong this week. Wera Hobhouse said she flew to the Chinese region with her husband on Thursday to visit their newborn grandson but she was detained at the airport, questioned, and then deported on the first flight home. The MP for Bath, who is one of more than 40 parliamentarians on the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China that scrutinises Beijing's human rights record, told the Sunday Times she had been given no reason as to why she was refused entry. Foreign Secretary David Lammy said: \"We will urgently raise this with the authorities in Hong Kong and Beijing to demand an explanation.\" He added, it would be \"unacceptable for an MP to be denied entry for simply expressing their views as a parliamentarian\". In a letter to Mr Lammy, Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey asked him to summon the Chinese Ambassador. \"We are sure you will agree that this is a deeply concerning situation,\" Sir Ed wrote in the letter seen by BBC News. \"The UK cannot allow the Chinese government to attempt to undermine our democracy by intimidating our parliamentarians.\" The Sunday Times reported that Ms Hobhouse's husband was allowed to enter but decided to return to the UK. The couple had travelled to visit their son who has lived in Hong Kong since 2019. Sir Ed said the bar was \"apparently simply because she is a British Member of Parliament\". It comes after aftertwo Labour MPs, Abtisam Mohamed and Yuan Yang, were refused entry to Israelwhile on a trip to the occupied West Bank this month. Ms Hobhouse's treatment is likely to raise further questions about the government's engagement with China. In 2021,Beijing sanctioned five MPs who had been critical of China. Ms Hobhouse, 65, told the Sunday Times: \"My son was waiting at the other end at arrivals... \"I couldn't even see him and give him a hug and I hadn't seen him in a year. \"When I was given the decision my voice was shaking and I was just saying: 'Why, please explain to me?'\" She added that she was not given an explanation - something she described as \"cruel\". \"I am obviously devastated. I was obviously looking forward to holding [my grandson] and cuddling him and... establishing a relationship,\" Ms Hobhouse continued. \"They are obviously quite a long way away, so each month you lose is a bit of a loss for the relationship I will have with my grandson. Having to fly back, it was so hard. I didn't cry but I was very close to tears.\" In a statement, the foreign secretary said it was \"deeply concerning to hear that an MP on a personal trip has been refused entry to Hong Kong\". Mr Lammy said: \"Unjustified restrictions on freedom of movement can only serve to further undermine Hong Kong's international reputation.\" The Chinese Embassy have been approached for comment. The 5 live host considers what's at stake on a trip to the heart of some of the big battles on 1 May. Oli Henman is the Liberal Democrat candidate for the West of England Combined Authority election. Oxfordshire County Council is holding what will probably be its last ever election. The party wants a government campaign to encourage people to buy UK-made products to support firms. Welsh Lib Dem leader Jane Dodds claims her party will \"have gold everywhere\" at the Senedd election.",

    "article_text": "The rail minister has admitted using his mobile phone while driving a vintage double-decker bus through London at rush hour. Lord Peter Hendy was behind the wheel of the old Routemaster for a charity event when he was spotted texting a friend, as firstreported by the Sunday Times. A spokesperson for Lord Hendy said: \"Last month Peter Hendy used his phone while driving. He has apologised in full for this error of judgement and has contacted the police.\" A source close to Lord Hendy said he would accept the sanction, which is likely to be six points on his licence and a fine. The incident took place on 28 March during the evening rush hour. Lord Hendy was texting a friend about a prostate cancer test. He had been giving a tour in the bus, which he owns, as part of a fundraiser for the charity Railway Benefit Fund, of which he is patron. The charity works to support railway workers and their families. But he was reported to police just days later by one of the passengers. In a statement, the organisers of the Railway Family Fundraiser said: \"None of us would advocate or condone unsafe practices. However, we reiterate that we are not aware of the whole situation, and affirm our hope that any investigation is able to be conducted fairly. \"The organisers regret that a positive and enjoyable event ended in this way and would once again like to express our thanks to Lord Hendy for his support for our event and fundraising.\" It is not the first time a government minister has been caught using his phone while driving. The then security minister and Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat was banned from driving for six months in 2022 after he was caught using his device while behind the wheel. He received six points on his licence for the offence, added to the six he already had for two previous driving offences. He was also ordered to pay a £1,000 fine, a surcharge of £100 and costs of £110. The BBC has contacted the Metropolitan Police for comment.",

    "title": "Queen Camilla says King's work 'keeps him going'",
    "article_text": "Queen Camilla says that King Charles \"loves his work and it keeps him going\" and that as his health is \"getting better… now he wants to do more and more\". The King has been receiving cancer treatment for over a year, but this week he successfully completed an intensive schedule of public events on a four-day state visit to Italy. The Queen's comments were made to the UK press on the trip that also coincided with the royal couple's 20th wedding anniversary. She said \"dream on\" to suggestions that the King might take it easier with his workload. \"I think he loves his work and it keeps him going. And I think it's wonderful, you know, if you've been ill and you are recovering, you're getting better and now he wants to do more and more and more. That's the problem,\" said the Queen. \"That's what he's driven by - helping others,\" she said, while on the tour of Italy. Royal sources have echoed that the King's treatment has been going well, reflected in how his doctors have let him continue with his work and travels, with more overseas trips expected this year. \"He knows he is fortunate to be in a position to make a difference, and is determined to do just that,\" said a senior Palace official about the 76-year-old King's determination to keep working. In terms of getting him to slow down, the official added: \"We've all tried! But as people will have seen the King enjoys his work, he enjoys engaging with as many people as possible.\" A recent adverse side effect to the cancer treatment saw the King have a brief hospital stay, but that was described as a minor setback in a bigger picture of positive progress. On his Italian visit he managed a busy schedule of ceremonies and events. It included a private meeting with Pope Francis in the Vatican, where the pontiff, who has been seriously ill, gave them his best wishes for their 20th wedding anniversary. This was said to have been one of the highlights of the trip for the royal couple, with a senior Palace official saying they \"both came away feeling that it had been a very significant and special moment\". \"Who could believe it was 20 years,\" the Queen said of their marriage. \"What is the secret? I don't know, well, I suppose it's just the sort of friendship really, laughing at the same things, getting on with life,\" she said. She said that much of their time was taken up with official duties. \"We are always going in different directions, like ships that pass in the night really. We whizz past each other.\" The King and Queen had been given a warm welcome by Italy's public and politicians - and Buckingham Palace officials seemed delighted with how the state visit had gone. \"It really showed soft power at its best,\" said a senior Palace official. There were enthusiastic crowds in Ravenna to see the royal couple on the final engagement of the trip, where they attended a festival celebrating local food. The King received a standing ovation after a speech in Italy's Parliament, where he called for Italy and the UK to stand together to defend democratic values. He praised how the UK and Italy \"stood by Ukraine in her hour of need\". One of the personal highlights for the King was seeing the stunning Byzantine mosaics in the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna, a church dating to the 6th Century. The King had been \"genuinely deeply moved by what he had seen\", said a senior official. They added: \"I think the King and Queen also loved the final engagement in Ravenna - including, you may be surprised to hear, the huge crush of the crowds.\" Such state visits are carried out on behalf of the government and the backdrop to this trip to Italy had been a wave of international economic and diplomatic turmoil. The UK government has been keen for a post-Brexit \"reset\" with its European partners and the visit saw multiple references to the military links between the UK and Italy. \"We are living in a very precarious and fragile world,\" the King had told the state banquet.

    "title": "Ambassador does not deny Russia is tracking UK nuclear subs with sensors",
    "article_text": "Russia's ambassador to the UK has not denied allegations that Russian sensors have been hidden in seas around Great Britain in an attempt to track UK nuclear submarines. Andrei Kelin said that while he did not deny Russia was attempting to track British submarines, he rejected the idea that such activities presented a threat to the UK. Asked on BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg whether he objected to the claims, Kelin said: \"No\". \"I am not going to deny it, but I wonder whether we really have an interest in following all the British submarine with very old outdated nuclear warheads... all these threats are extremely exaggerated,\" he said. Pressed further by Kuenssberg, the ambassador added: \"I'm denying existence of threats for the United Kingdom. This threat has been invented, absolutely, there is no threat at all from Russia to the UK.\" Kelin's admission followsan investigation published by the Sunday Timesearlier this month, detailing the discovery of alleged Russian sensors in seas around Britain. In its investigation, the Sunday Times said the devices are believed to have been planted by Moscow to try to gather intelligence on the UK's four Vanguard submarines, which carry nuclear missiles. The British military discovered the existence of the devices and deemed them a potential threat to national security, the paper reported. The devices have been characterised as being part of a hybrid - or \"grey zone\" - war being fought by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Other activities of such warfare could include doing damage to infrastructure assets, such as energy pipelines. The accusations come afterthe Royal Navy released images in Marchof a Russian warship that it tracked sailing near British waters. Named Boikiy, it is one of several Russian vessels to have been tracked sailing near the British coast in recent months. Defence Secretary John Healey told MPsin January that the Royal Navy had monitored a Russian spy ship after it was spotted around UK waters - accusing the vessel, called Yantar, of being used to gather intelligence and map the UK's underwater infrastructure. Former Conservative defence and Foreign Office minister Tobias Ellwood has warned that the UK is \"behind the curve\" in tracking Russia's deep-sea operations. Ellwoodtold the Guardianearlier this month the use of sensors was \"only half the story\", claiming that Russia has established \"remote seabed platforms\" off the UK coast that act as recharging stations for dozens of mini-submarines \"to map our undersea cable networks for potential sabotage\". A Ministry of Defence spokesperson told BBC News: \"We are committed to maintaining and enhancing the security and resilience of critical undersea infrastructure. \"Just as the defence secretary called out the activities of the Russian spy ship Yantar hovering over our undersea cables, let those who threaten the UK or our allies be in no doubt that we will defend our undersea infrastructure.\" Responding to the Sunday Times investigation into the sensors, an MoD spokesman said: \"Alongside our NATO and Joint Expeditionary Force allies, we are strengthening our response to ensure that Russian ships and aircraft cannot operate in secrecy near the UK or near NATO territory, harnessing new technologies like AI and coordinating patrols with our allies. \"And our continuous-at-sea nuclear deterrent continues to patrol the world's oceans undetected as it has done for 56 years.\" Ukrainians in Russian-held land tell the BBC about the difficulties of life under occupation. Steve Witkoff held talks with the Russian president, meanwhile Moscow's ambassador to the UK told the BBC the US is not Russia's ally. Europe's defence ministers said they saw no sign of an end to the war. The Russian-American citizen was released in a prisoner swap between Moscow and Washington. The package includes funding for radar systems, anti-tank mines and hundreds of thousands of drones.",

    "title": "US and Iran hold 'constructive' first round of nuclear talks",
    "article_text": "Iran and the UShave concluded a first round of talks in Oman over Tehran's nuclear programme - the highest-level meeting between the two nations since 2018. Both countries described the meeting as \"constructive\" and confirmed a second round of discussions will take place next week - with the US hailing the \"direct communication\" as being key to striking a possible deal. President Donald Trump pulled the US out of a previous nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers in 2018, and has long said he would make a \"better\" deal. The talks are seen as an important first step in establishing whether a deal can be done. At two-and-a-half hours, the first meeting was brief, reportedly respectful - and set the stage for a second round. That was probably as good as it could get when Iranian and US officials sat down in Muscat, the capital of Oman - whose top diplomat mediated the primarily indirect negotiations. They were the most significant talks since Trump pulled the US out of the Iran nuclear deal of 2015 during his first term in office. The verdict of Iran's lead negotiator, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, was positive. \"In my opinion, as the first meeting, it was a constructive meeting held in a very peaceful and respectful environment, because no inappropriate language was used,\" he told Iranian state TV. His diplomatic tone suggests the US team led by Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff did not reiterate some of the president's threats that Iran would face \"great danger\" if this dialogue did not succeed. He has repeatedly warned of possible military strikes. This meeting ran with the delegations in separate rooms, relaying messages through Oman's foreign minister, Badr bin Hamad al-Busaidi. Witkoff, who is leading the US delegation, had previously only spoken of meeting face-to-face. But Araghchi and Witkoff did speak for a few minutes in the presence of Busaidi – not the direct talks US officials said would happen but what could be a small but significant opening. Iran, mindful of pressure from hardliners at home, underlined how limited their face-to-face exchange was, with no photographs taken. In a statement following the talks, the White House said the discussions \"were very positive and constructive\", noting that Witkoff had emphasised to Iran that he had instructions to resolve the adversaries' \"differences through dialogue and diplomacy, if that is possible\". \"These issues are very complicated, and special envoy Witkoff's direct communication today was a step forward in achieving a mutually beneficial outcome,\" the statement added. Araghchi had said ahead of the discussions that his country wanted a \"fair agreement\". After the talks concluded, he said discussions next week may not happen in Oman, but would still be mediated by the Middle Eastern nation. The White House said they would take place next Saturday. \"Neither we, nor the other party, want fruitless negotiations, discussions for discussions' sake, time wasting or talks that drag on forever,\" Araghchi told Iranian state television. The most important issue at stake is what kind of deal each side would be willing to accept. Trump sent a letter to Iran's supreme leader via the United Arab Emirates last month, saying he wanted a deal to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons and to avert possible military strikes by the US and Israel. Iran hopes for a deal to limit, but not dismantle, its nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief. An unnamed source in Oman told news agency Reuters that the talks would seek to de-escalate regional tensions and secure prisoner exchanges. Trump revealed the talks would take place during a visit by Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House on Monday. The Israeli prime minister said on Tuesday that both leaders had agreed that Iran \"will not have nuclear weapons\". Netanyahu has called for a \"Libya-style deal\", referring to the north African nation completely dismantling its weapons programme in an agreement reached with Western powers in 2003. That would be completely unacceptable to Iran. Iran insists its nuclear activities are entirely peaceful and that it will never seek to develop or acquire nuclear weapons. Iranian officials have made it clear the negotiations will focus only on its nuclear programme, not its broader defence capability, such as its ballistic missile programme. Ahead of the talks, Trump said on Friday that he wanted Iran \"to be a wonderful, great, happy country - but they can't have nuclear weapons\". Trump has warned that the US would use military force if a deal was not reached, and Iran has repeatedly said it will not negotiate under pressure. But this process is taking place under immense pressure. Even as preparations were under way to arrange this first meeting, the US moved more warships and stealth bombers to the region and imposed more sanctions. The US president told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday it would \"be a very bad day for Iran\" if the talks were unsuccessful. Iran insists its nuclear activities are entirely peaceful and that it will never seek to develop or acquire nuclear weapons. However, since Trump pulled out of the 2015 agreement - which expires later this year - Iran has increasingly breached restrictions imposed by the existing nuclear deal in retaliation for crippling US sanctions reinstated seven years ago, and has stockpiled enough highly-enriched uranium to make several bombs. Under the terms of the 2015 deal, Iran agreed to only enrich uranium up to 3.67% purity for the next 15 years. In February, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) nuclear watchdog reported that Tehran had stockpiled uranium enriched to 60% purity and could swiftly move to 90%, which would be weapons-grade. The 2015 nuclear deal took nearly two years of intensive negotiations. At the start of this new effort to reach an agreement, Iran's programme is far more developed and complex, and the wider region is far more volatile. It follows concerns that tech prices could skyrocket, as many gadgets are made in China, with the US president saying he will give more detail on Monday.

    "title": "Israel says it will expand its offensive across most of Gaza",
    "article_text": "Israel's defence minister has announced its military will soon \"vigorously\" expand its offensive throughout most of Gaza. Israel Katz also said the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had completed the takeover of a \"security zone\" in the southern part of the Gaza Strip, separating the cities of Rafah and Khan Younis. Israel's military also issued evacuation orders for Khan Younis and its surrounding areas, saying it was preparing to carry out strikes in response to the launch of projectiles from Gaza, which Hamas has claimed responsibility for. Israel resumed its offensive against Hamas on 18 March following the collapse of a two-month ceasefire. Since then, it has seized large areas of Gaza, displacing hundreds of thousands of Gazans once more. The military has already seized land running along the entirety of the Palestinian territory's borders, which it has characterised as a buffer zone to prevent attacks. Israeli officials have said the ongoing offensive aims to pressure Hamas into freeing the 59 remaining hostages being held in Gaza - 24 of whom are believed to be alive. On Saturday, Katz said the IDF had completed the takeover of the \"Morag axis\" - a reference to a former Jewish settlement located between Rafah and Khan Younis. He said this \"makes the entire area between the Philadelphia axis and Morag part of the Israeli security zone\". The takeover of the corridor effectively cuts the southern city of Rafah off from Khan Younis. Rafah makes up almost one fifth of Gaza. Katz also warned that \"IDF activity will soon expand vigorously to additional locations throughout most of Gaza\" and people in these areas \"will have to evacuate the fighting zones\". \"This is the last moment to remove Hamas and release the hostages, and bring about an end to the war,\" he said. He added that areas of northern Gaza, including the city of Beit Hanoun and in the Netzarim Corridor - which cuts through central Gaza - were also being evacuated so that a \"security zone\" could be expanded there too. \"In northern Gaza as well - in Beit Hanoun and other neighbourhoods - residents are evacuating, the area is being taken over and the security zone is being expanded, including in the Netzarim corridor,\" Katz said. When approached for comment, the IDF referred the BBC to the defence ministry's remarks. Hamas said, in quotes cited by the news agency AFP, that the offensive not only \"kills defenceless civilians\" but also makes the fate of hostages \"uncertain\". The UN's human rights office warned last month that the evacuation orders failed to comply with international law, accusing Israel of not taking any measures to provide accommodation for those affected, or ensuring satisfactory hygiene, health, safety and nutrition conditions. Israel's government said it was evacuating civilians to protect them from harm and from being used by Hamas as \"human shields\" in violation of international law. Following Katz's announcement, the Israeli military issued an evacuation order for residents of the southern city of Khan Younis and its surrounding areas, saying it was preparing to respond to projectiles launched from Gaza earlier on Saturday. The IDF said its air defences had intercepted three projectiles launched from Gaza towards Israeli territory. Hamas's military wing later claimed responsibility for the attack. No injuries were reported. In Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry said as of 13:00 local time (11:00 BST) on Saturday, 21 people had been killed in the previous 24 hours, and a further 64 injured. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 50,933 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Of those, 1,563 have been killed since 18 March, when Israel restarted its offensive in the Gaza Strip, the ministry said. Donald Trump has suggested Iran could face military action if it does not agree to a new nuclear deal. Mahmoud Khalil was arrested in March for his role in pro-Palestinian protests at  Columbia University. \"No state... can be exempt from the obligation not to commit war crimes, not to commit genocide, not to commit ethnic cleansing,\" Mirjana Spoljaric tells the BBC. The mother of a Palestinian killed in an IDF attack on emergency vehicles tells the BBC of her loss. Students, staff, and parents alike are traumatised by what has happened and the destruction that surrounds them.",

    "title": "Mickey Rourke leaves Big Brother after 'unacceptable behaviour'",
    "article_text": "Hollywood actor Mickey Rourke has left Celebrity Big Brother after \"further use of inappropriate language\" and \"instances of unacceptable behaviour\", ITV has said. On Saturday, Rourke, 72, used behaviour and language considered to be threatening and aggressive towards fellow housemate Chris Hughes, the BBC understands. No physical altercation took place between the pair. Just days ago, the Bafta-winning star of The Wrestlerreceived a formal warningfrom Big Brother for \"unacceptable language and behaviour\" directed at another housemate, JoJo Siwa. Siwa accused Rourke of being \"homophobic\" for saying he was \"going to vote the lesbian out real quick\" and making other comments about her sexuality. Love Island star Hughes, 32, had comforted Siwa, 21, in Wednesday's episode after Rourke's comments. A spokesperson for the ITV show said: \"Mickey Rourke has agreed to leave the Celebrity Big Brother House this evening following a discussion with Big Brother regarding further use of inappropriate language and instances of unacceptable behaviour.\" The Oscar-nominated star entered the ITV reality show on Monday alongside TV and social media personality Siwa, Hughes and 10 other celebrities. According to atranscript released by ITV ahead of Wednesday evening's episode, Rourke first asked Siwa if she liked boys or girls. She replied: \"Girls. My partner is non-binary.\" He then told her: \"If I stay longer than four days, you won't be gay any more.\" She responded: \"I can guarantee I'll still be gay and I'll still be in a very happy relationship.\" He then made the comment about voting her out, and apparently referred to an earlier conversation about the smoking area when he said: \"I need a fag,\" before gesturing to Siwa and adding: \"I'm not talking to you.\" After being told he couldn't say that by Hughes, Rourke claimed: \"I know. I was talking about a cigarette.\" Rourke was called into the diary room, where Big Brother told him his \"language was offensive and unacceptable\" and gave him the formal warning. He responded: \"I apologise. I don't have dishonourable intentions - I'm just talking smack, you know. I wasn't taking it all so serious. I didn't mean in it any bad intentions and if I did, sorry.\" After going back into the main house, Hughes told him Siwa \"was very upset earlier\", and she informed Rourke it was \"not an acceptable word\". He told her: \"I want to apologise. I've got a habit of having a short fuse. And I don't mean nothing by it. I do mean it [sorry]. If I didn't, I wouldn't say it to you.\" Siwa replied: \"I appreciate your apology.\" Sir Michael is a former Conservative MP in Staffordshire, and has been voted out by the public. Actor Mickey Rourke gets a formal warning for \"offensive and unacceptable\" language about JoJo Siwa. Sir Michael Fabricant was booed by crowds gathered outside the Big Brother house on Monday.

The 35-year-old from Northern Ireland carded a six-under 66 - featuring two eagles - to head a star-stacked leaderboard with a score of 12 under after 54 holes. McIlroy's advantage looked destined to be bigger but the complexion of the task ahead changed whenBryson DeChambeaunarrowed the gap with three birdies in his final four holes - including a 50-foot putt from the fringe of the 18th green. The American maverick, who beat McIlroy to last year's US Open title in a dramatic finish, set up a tantalising Masters Sunday with a three-under 69 to close on 10 under. McIlroy has already landed four majors - the US Open, The Open and two US PGA Championships, the last of which was in 2014 - but has fallen short at Augusta National on several occasions. The most infamous instance came in 2011. Then, aged 21, he blew a four-shot lead as he took 80 shots on a haunting final day and finished in a tie for 15th. Now, after a display which showed his ever-increasing maturity, the world number two holds another golden opportunity to become only the sixth man to complete the career Grand Slam of winning all four majors. Canada'sCorey Connersis eight under after a 70, while 2018 championPatrick Reedand last year's runner-upLudvig Abergare six under. English veteranJustin Rose,who led at the halfway stage,dropped off the pace and is five under after a 75. The former world number one is alongside defending championScottie Scheffler, Ireland's 2019 Open championShane Lowryand Australia'sJason Day. Masters tee-times for round four at Augusta National The Masters round three recap - McIlroy leads DeChambeau by two heading into Sunday 'We need the Masters' - Augusta's adversity after Hurricane Helene This video can not be played Best shots from Masters day three As Augusta founding father Bobby Jones famously said, the toughest distance in golf is the five inches between a player's ears. Controlling the mind has been a key part of McIlroy's work this week as he tries to finally land the Green Jacket on his 17th appearance at this pristine plot of land in Georgia â and his 11th attempt to complete the career Grand Slam. Consulting renowned sports psychologist Bob Rotella has been helping provide perception and patience. That enabled McIlroy to compartmentalise the two late double bogeys which ruined his opening round and bounce back with a six-under 66 on Friday which thrust him into contention. Before starting his third round in the penultimate group, McIlroy talked about following the same principle on Saturday. The pair discussed \"letting the score come\" to McIlroy, who was hellbent on not trying to \"force the issue\" as he chased down Rose. The scores not only came to McIlroy - they sprinted towards him from the start. Wearing a solemn and focused expression throughout, McIlroy refused to get carried away with the highs of his round, or too disheartened by stickier patches. \"You have to try to ride that momentum as much as you can but then also temper it with a little bit of rationale and logic,\" he said. \"It's a fine dance. I certainly don't want to be a robot out there, but at the same time I don't want to be too animated, either.\" This video can not be played McIlroy makes incredible start with eagle on second McIlroy opened with a birdie after a monster 371-yard drive on the first, then magnificently chipped in for an eagle on the par-five second to quickly move into the outright lead. The dream start continued with birdies on three and five as McIlroy became the first player to start a Masters round with six successive threes. A minor blip came when McIlroy pushed his tee shot on the seventh into the pine trees on the right, but his lucid thinking was evident again as he punched out to left of the green. Confidence flowing, he showed a piece of real quality - beautifully-judging a tricky chip on a devilish green â to set up a par-saving putt. The quality of McIlroy's touch was emphasised minutes later by Rose â from a similar angle - splashing out of the bunker and running 27 feet past the pin to the fringe of the green. As McIlroy knows too well, Augusta has the propensity to bite back quickly. He dropped a shot on the long eighth and, after scrambling to save par on the ninth, the rocky patch resulted in a three-putt bogey on the 10th. In contrast, Conners birdied the same three holes. The level-headed Canadian moved alongside DeChambeau and a shot behind McIlroy. Now it felt like a true test of McIlroy's resilience. Saving par on 11 from eight feet steadied him and a par followed on the treacherous 12th before a welcome birdie on the 13th. With Conners missing a birdie putt on 14 providing more encouragement, McIlroy turned on the style again. An outstanding second shot to eight feet on the par-five 15th led to another eagle â the first time he had ever converted two in the same round at a major â before rounding off with three pars. This video can not be played McIlroy extends Masters lead with eagle on 15 McIlroy, though, watched what could have been a more comfortable advantage disappear thanks to DeChambeau's defiance. The big-hitting American has changed tack at Augusta National, softening the hubristic approach he showed in 2020 - when he claimed it was effectively a \"par 67\" which he could drive through - and now treating the course with more respect. However, he lacked feel with his irons for large parts on Saturday, only to find his touch at the right time with a strong finish. Backed by a supportive Augusta crowd which has warmed to his unique approach to the game, DeChambeau looks the likeliest to deny McIlroy. The pair will go out in the last group at 19:30 BST on Sunday. \"It's always important in a major championship to try and be in the final group or close to the final group,\" said DeChambeau. \"It was definitely fun knowing that it was Rory and knowing that we could have a good matchup. \"We're not the only players out there. There's still a lot of great players. But it's going to be a fun test.\" This video can not be played DeChambeau holes 'impossible' putt on 18th The penultimate round of a major is known as 'Moving Day' and an electric start saw Rose, DeChambeau and McIlroy each hold a slice of the early lead. Rose, bidding to become the oldest first-time champion since Mark O'Meara in 1998, was unable to get going as his rivals rallied. The 44-year-old former world number one was one over at the turn before fading further on the second nine. It was also a day where Scheffler - the tournament favourite alongside McIlroy - got left behind. The current world number one could not find top gear as he shot a level-par 72. \"At times I felt good. At times I felt bad. I just couldn't really get anything going,\" the 28-year-old American said. \"I ended up with even, which felt like I had to scramble a lot actually.\" Follow all the action of the final round with live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app from 18:00 BST.

    "title": "Universal theme park is coming to the UK - so what could it look like?",
    "article_text": "A new Universal theme park near Bedford - the first in Europe - was announced to much fanfare earlier this week. Set to open in 2031, construction is to begin at the 476-acre site, where attractions are likely to feature James Bond, Paddington and The Lord of the Rings. But from deciding how many loops to include on a coaster, to making sure even the trees blend in seamlessly with an area's design, building a dream world is a painstaking task. To find out what planning lies behind the thrills, and what sort of things we could expect when the new Universal park finally arrives, BBC News spoke to some real-life rollercoaster experts. Of course, any good theme park needs some good rides - but maybe it's an understatement to say that's a tall order. While \"at least two or three iconic rides\" are needed, these need not necessarily be the fastest, tallest or most innovative to stand out, explains Andy Sinclair-Harris, creative director at Katapult, which has designed attractions for the likes of Legoland and Alton Towers. \"What is more important is the depth of storytelling,\" he says, so that you're fully immersed in the experience of the ride. A good example, he says, is a Harry-Potter-themed rollercoaster called Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure, located at The Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Universal's Orlando resort. Riders sit in replicas of Hagrid's motorbike and zoom through recreations of settings from the popular film series. \"There's nothing particularly brand new or absolutely amazing about that ride, other than it tells a story amazingly well,\" he adds. If the rumours that there's going to be a Back to the Future ride at Universal's UK venture are true, those behind it will be ensuring that the DeLorean time machine is included, he says. During the brainstorming part of building a resort, rides are often \"developed as storytelling tools\" in a \"specific genre or world,\" says Joseph Bright, CEO at Scruffy Dog, which provides creative project management for theme parks. While an iconic ride might help to \"anchor\" a zone of a park, \"it's never developed in isolation\" - rather \"cohesion is critical [and] every element...must serve the wider guest story\". Dennis Speigel, founder of International Theme Park Services, says meticulous planning goes into the most immersive rides. He adds that the size of a rollercoaster is partly dictated by the number of guests its designers hope to get on board - \"between 1,500 and 2,000 an hour\" at popular parks. Usually, that means a coaster that is over 3,000ft (914m) long, with the first dip \"somewhere in the 150ft (45m) range\". Mr Speigel says that while an upcoming coaster at Six Flags Qiddiya in Saudi Arabia is set to break records when it sends riders speeding at over 150mph around the tracks, most coasters today reach between 70-90mph on their first drop. Once the larger rides are planned out, theme park designers then consider what he describes as \"flat rides\", which cater to less thrill-seeking crowds. \"Those are your smaller rides that take people around and around, like a merry-go-round or a monster,\" he says. \"[They're] rides that can often be bought off the shelf from a manufacturer\". When you step foot in a theme park, you're probably thinking about the rides you'll be going on - but you might think less about how you get there. During the design phase, you have to let your imagination run wild, says Mr Sinclair-Harris. \"Budget is a thing, but when you have those first initial discussions, you shouldn't be tempered by anything,\" he says. The \"story\" of your park is crucial, he adds. \"It's knowing the story, the characters and being true to that world.\" Of course, discussions about details like potential ride dimensions and manufacturers soon follow, as well as a masterplan, which configures how attractions, pathways and amenities would all fit into the space - and often determines how long people will end up queuing for. An artist's conception of the Universal UK park depicts a huge lake in middle of what appears to be different themed areas. Far from just looking pretty, it can allow crowds to fan out to multiple rides without congestion forming around one. At Alton Towers, theme park vlogger and fanatic Charlotte Branford - known as Diary of a RollerCoaster Girl - believes it means other visitors often choose to go left around the lake (to the Wicker Man ride), or right around it (towards the Smiler), so she heads to the back of the park to try to avoid the crowds. It's here at the back of parks designed in this way, that you'll often find a show with set times \"to try and stop people running around to the back of the park to get to some big attraction,\" says Justin Garvanovic, founder of the European Coaster Club, who has been involved in rollercoaster designs. \"Without realising it, they're trying to make you do roughly what they want you to do when you're in the park.\" Another tried and tested layout is the \"hub and spoke\" often seen at Disneyland resorts, says Robbie Jones, insights director at Katapult. \"In a sense you've got that central gathering point...like the castle in the Magic Kingdom...with different lands like spokes on a wheel, radiating out.\" Universal's new Epic Universe theme park in Orlando will follow a version of this - allowing you to venture into different lands through portals. So the stories behind the rollercoasters are intertwined with the story of the theme park layout itself. Then come the finishing touches - to maintain your sense of being in a futuristic or fantasy world while you're there. Trees, artificial rock or even other buildings are often used to obscure unsightly but necessary objects, Mr Sinclair-Harris says. \"If you're in an amazing world with castles and dragons, seeing a telephone pole removes you from that story\". Even the audio playing out, scent of a park and queue lines are considered because they \"play a role in that illusion,\" says Mr Bright. As Mr Garvanovic puts it, \"there's tons of subtle stuff going on in the background\" in a well thought-out theme park. The sign of success, perhaps, is when you barely even notice it.",

    "title": "'Russians are even trying to ban our holidays' - life in occupied Ukraine",
    "article_text": "\"Russians are trying to ban everything Ukrainian here: language, and also traditions. Even Ukrainian holidays are forbidden.\" This is the sorrow and fear of a rarely heard voice from within Ukraine - that of someone living in one of the Russian-occupied areas of the country. We are calling her Maria. As the US leads efforts to negotiate peace in Ukraine, those living under Russian occupation face a brutal, repressive future. Already, the Kremlin has put in place severe restrictions designed to stamp out Ukrainian identity, including harsh punishments for anyone who dares to disagree. Now, there are fears that Kyiv could be forced to give up at least some of the territory occupied by Russia as part of a potential ceasefire or peace deal. Ukrainian officials reject this, but Moscow says that at the very least it wants to fully capture four Ukrainian regions it partly controls - Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia - in addition to Crimea, which it annexed in 2014. Due to repression by the Russian authorities, speaking to the media and even your own relatives in occupied territories can be fraught with danger. The Kremlin has also launched a wide-ranging campaign to force Ukrainians in occupied territories to take Russian passports.Evidence suggeststhat Ukrainians are being denied healthcare and free movement unless they take up Russian citizenship. Maria (not her real name) said she was a member of an all-female underground resistance group waging a campaign of peaceful resistance in those territories, mainly by distributing leaflets and newsletters. In an interview with the BBC's Today programme, she used a Ukrainian proverb to describe the danger she is facing: \"You have fear in your eyes, but your hands are still doing it. Of course it's scary.\" The BBC cannot reveal her real name or location so as not to put her in danger. The atmosphere of fear and suspicion is such that when I was trying to contact residents of occupied Mariupol, I was accused of being a Russian journalist. \"You won't like what I've got to say. People like you kill if you tell them the truth,\" one person told me via direct message on social media. They claimed to be from the port city, captured by the Russians in May 2022 after a bloody siege that left it in ruins. Later, I asked some Ukrainian friends if I could speak to their relatives living in occupied areas. All said no - that would be too dangerous. Sofia (also not her real name) is from a village in Ukraine's southern Zaporizhzhia region. It was occupied on day five of the full-scale invasion of 2022, and it is an hour's drive south of Zaporizhzhia city, a major regional centre still under Ukrainian control. Sofia is now in the UK but her parents are still in her village and she told me about the care she needs to take when talking to them. \"About a year ago, my parents were searched by the [Russian security service] FSB. They confiscated their phones, accusing them of telling the Ukrainian army about where Russian troops were stationed. That wasn't true, and later the Russian military told my parents that they had been reported by their neighbours. That's why I try not to provoke anything like that,\" Sofia tells me. \"I have to read between the lines when they tell me about what's going on.\" And just speaking to them at all is becoming more difficult. Sofia says that her parents are unable even to top up their mobile phones or insure their car because they refuse to take Russian passports. \"It's getting really awkward living without Russian IDs,\" she says. Yeva, whose name we have also changed, has a sister working at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station. \"Whenever we move from the weather or our children on to our subjects, her tone changes,\" Yeva says. \"She tells me: 'You don't understand!'\" \"What I do understand is that being a nuclear power plant worker, her phone is likely to be bugged,\" Yeva tells me. She also says that her sister often repeats pro-Russian narratives when speaking to her. Another friend, Kateryna, tells me that someone she knows in the occupied part of Kherson region was thrown into a punishment cellar for talking to her brother who had been helping the Ukrainian army. \"I can't put them at risk,\" Kateryna told me when I asked to be put in touch with her friend. According to Maria, Russian administrations have been installing surveillance systems to monitor any manifestations of dissent. \"They are putting up a lot of CCTV cameras to control everybody, to find all the activists,\" she says. Numerous Ukrainian activists have been killed or disappeared under Russian occupation.According to the Ukrainian rights group Zmina, at least 121 activists, volunteers and journalists have been killed during the full-scale invasion, most of them during its first year. Prior to the invasion, Russia had drawn up lists of activists to be arrested or killed, the group says. More recently, Russia-installed authorities have been applyinga host of repressive lawsagainst dissenters. They can be penalised for alleged transgressions such as spreading \"false information\", \"discrediting\" the Russian army or supporting \"extremism\". In Crimea alone, 1,279 cases have been launched so far on charges of \"discrediting\" the Russian armed forces,says the Ukrainian government office for Crimea. According to it, 224 people have been jailed in the occupied Ukrainian region for expressing dissent, most of them members of the indigenous Crimean Tatar community. Despite the dangers, a number of underground resistance groups are active in occupied parts of Ukraine. Zla Mavka, which takes its name from a Ukrainian mythical creature, is a non-violent all-female movement mostly focused on distributing posters and leaflets across occupied regions. In Melitopol, Zaporizhzhia region, partisans have been targeting occupation troops and their transport while the Crimean Tatar group Ateshhas been involved in reconnaissance and subversion. Meanwhile, the Yellow Ribbon movement distributes Ukrainian symbols in occupied territories. Because of the absence of independent media in occupied parts of Ukraine, it is hard to verify the impact of such activities. There is no evidence, however, to suggest that they have caused significant disruption for occupation forces. Maria says whole streets are lined with Russian propaganda. \"In city centres, everything is covered with Russian propaganda: billboards with Putin's face, Putin's quotes, people they call heroes of the special military operation. There are flags everywhere,\" she tells the BBC. The Kremlin has banned Ukrainian and independent media including the BBC, and propagandists have been despatched from Russia to set up friendly media in the occupied territories. After many professional journalists fled, they have been forced to employ local teenagers to spread Moscow's narratives. Pro-Russian propaganda starts early at school, where children are forced to attend classes glorifying the Russian army and join quasi-military groups such as Yunarmia (Youth Army). One Russian schoolbook even justifies the invasion of Ukraine by falsely portraying it as an aggressive state run by nationalist extremists and manipulated by the West. Andrei Kelin tells the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg he does not deny accusations of attempting to spy on UK nuclear submarine fleet. The Russian-American citizen was released in a prisoner swap between Moscow and Washington. Russian-American Ksenia Karelina was released by Moscow in return for the freeing of Russian-German Arthur Petrov. The Duke of Sussex visits an orthopaedic clinic in the western city of Lviv. It follows Beijing's denial that many of its citizens are involved in the conflict.",

    "title": "Criminals selling fake vintage fashion online",
    "article_text": "When influencer Torbian Dennis bought a £150 pair of trainers on a popular online marketplace, he was told by the seller they were genuine. But when he got them through the post he wasn't sure and checked them on a specialist app - only to discover they were knock-offs. The pre-loved clothing market is booming and is expected to be worth almost £300bn by 2029, as people shop sustainably or search for bargains in the Cost of Living crisis. But bargain-hunters are now being warned that criminals could be profiting by selling fake versions of designer clothes, handbags, shoes and even football shirts for prices that suggest they are real. \"The sellers assured me they were authentic,\" said Torbian, a 23-year-old fashion influencer from Cardiff who uses online second-hand platforms to find bargain brands. \"I've been caught out multiple times when buying Nike trainers online.\" Torbian was able to get a refund because he paid using PayPal. He thinks some sellers believe they are marketing the real deal - but not everyone is genuine. People buying second-hand fashion have been urged to be aware of counterfeit pre-loved goods on sites such as eBay, Vinted, Depop and Facebook Marketplace as well as in high street vintage shops. \"The second hand market has become really popular and criminals will use that as an opportunity,\" said Helen Barnham of the Intellectual Property Office (IPO). The IPO has started looking into whether \"criminals are to trying infiltrate supply chains\" and is also concerned some fake goods could be \"unsafe or dangerous\". \"People are really interested in a bargain or finding a bespoke piece so we're researching whether people are coming across counterfeits or fake goods,\" she said. \"Consumers could be getting ripped off for something they think is genuine but find out it's actually fake and could cause them harm.\" Figures from Citizen's Advice show a 30% rise in complaints about counterfeit goods being sold online in the last year and people or businesses caught selling fakes can face unlimited fines or sentences of up to 10 years. Second-hand shop owner Jacob Knight says he has noticed a rise in counterfeit goods and feels it should be up to sellers to ensure what they sell is genuine. \"You've got to do your research and really study and master the craft of telling which is which, as it's such a big problem now,\" said Jacob, who runs Knight Vintage in Cardiff. He said some of the brands most commonly faked are Stone Island, Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Prada. The 26-year-old from Cardiff only buys from certain trusted collectors. \"Unfortunately, when someone gets burnt once they're always going to have that same feeling towards other products and are always going to be that extra bit cautious about buying designer products,\" he said. Jacob worries that with a rise in counterfeits, shoppers might lose faith in vintage shops. \"The businesses will suffer and you won't see them on the high street anymore,\" added Ms Barnham of the IPO. It is also a concern for online marketplaces, many of which are increasingly promoting themselves as destinations for luxury shopping. In March, Vinted launched its own collection, House of Vinted, promoting second-hand bags, shoes and clothes from brands like Prada, Gucci and Jimmy Choo, some setting customers back thousands of pounds. The platform, eBay and others have now launched authentication services for high end and expensive goods. An eBay boss told the BBC they have authenticated 10 million luxury items so buyers can \"be confident\" they're not getting a fake. Kirsty Keoghan, eBay's global general manager of fashion, said the market for designer second-hand fashion from brands such as Nike Air Jordan trainers, Rolex watches and Hermes Kelly handbags is \"growing exponentially\". \"When things are on trend, or there's a rise in demand unfortunately there will be fraudsters out there who will be trying to create inauthentic items,\" she said. \"We do a lot in the background to make sure those listings don't end up on eBay.\" It's not just designer handbags and trainers in demand but the retro sports kits market is booming too. Daniel Rees buys and sells items including American Football, basketball, rugby and football shirts. \"If you go to say a Wales football game, you'll see hundreds of 1994 shirts and 95% of those are going to be fake,\" said Wales footy fan Daniel, who runs of Cardiff Classic Shirts. He said while some are clearly counterfeit, others are being sold online are \"marketed at the prices they would be if they were genuine\". Daniel uses product codes, his knowledge of where legitimate shirts are made and what tags should look like to spot the real items. Online marketplaces are not always legally responsible for fake goods sold on their platforms but the Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CTSI) wants that to change as it has \"serious concerns\" about unsafe or counterfeit goods. It is calling for online marketplaces to be made responsible for all products sold on their platforms and wants amendments to the Product Regulation and Metrology Bill, which is currently making its way through Parliament, to \"make companies responsible if unsafe counterfeit goods are sold on their sites\". \"The CTSI has serious concerns relating to the flood of unsafe or counterfeit products being sold by third parties on online marketplaces in recent years,\" said David MacKenzie of the CTSI. Vinted, Depop and eBay have said they would suspend or ban users if they're caught selling counterfeit goods. Meta, which owns Facebook Marketplace, said it works closely with law enforcement to support investigations and keep scammers off the platform. It encourages users to check warning signs that sellers could be scammers, for example by checking if their profiles are new or incomplete, look at reviews and meet up in public spaces. eBay also said it works with police and regulators to help lower the risk of fakes ending up on its as it wants users to have a \"safe and trusted\" shop. Ayr Racecourse basked in sunshine ahead of the biggest day in the Scottish racing calendar Dorchester's South Street reopens four months after fire tore through the Gorge Cafe. The deal to unite the two Italian brands has an estimated value of $1.36bn (£1.06bn). Online apps are posing a threat to physical stores, but their presence so far is limited to big cities. Residents and businesses in Devizes are concerned after a series of shop closures in the town.",

    "title": "Three million child deaths linked to drug resistance, study shows",
    "article_text": "More than three million children around the world are thought to have died in 2022 as a result of infections that are resistant to antibiotics, according to a study by two leading experts in child health. Children in Africa and South East Asia were found to be most at risk. Antimicrobial resistance - known as AMR - develops when the microbes that cause infections evolve in such a way that antibiotic drugs no longer work. It has been identified as one of the biggest public health threats facing the world's population. A new study now reveals the toll that AMR is taking on children. Using data from multiple sources, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank, the report's authors have calculated there were more than three million child deaths in 2022 linked to drug-resistant infections. Experts say this new study highlights a more than tenfold increase in AMR-related infections in children in just three years. The number could have been made worse by the impact of the Covid pandemic. Antibiotics are used to treat or prevent a huge range of bacterial infections - everything from skin infections to pneumonia. They are also sometimes given as a precaution to prevent, rather than treat, an infection - for example if someone is having an operation or receiving chemotherapy treatment for cancer. Antibiotics have no impact on viral infections, though - illnesses such as the common cold, flu or Covid. But some bacteria have now evolved resistance to some drugs, due to their overuse and inappropriate use, while the production of new antibiotics  - a lengthy and costly process - has slowed right down. The report's lead authors, Doctor Yanhong Jessika Hu of Murdoch Children's Research Institute in Australia and Professor Herb Harwell of the Clinton Health Access Initiative, point to a significant growth in the use of antibiotics that are meant to only be held back for the most serious infections. Between 2019 and 2021 the use of \"watch antibiotics\", drugs with a high risk of resistance, increased by 160% in South East Asia and 126% in Africa. Over the same period, \"reserve antibiotics\" -  last-resort treatments for severe, multidrug-resistant infections - rose by 45% in South East Asia and 125% in Africa. The authors warn that if bacteria develop resistance to these antibiotics, there will be few, if any, alternatives for treating multidrug-resistant infections. Prof Harwell is presenting the findings at the Congress of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases in Vienna later this month. \"AMR is a global problem. It affects everyone. We did this work really to focus on the disproportionate way in which AMR affects children,\" he said ahead of the event. \"We estimate three million deaths of children worldwide associated with antimicrobial resistance.\" The WHO describes AMR as one of the most serious global health threatswe face, but speaking from Vienna, Prof Harwell warns that there are no easy answers. \"It's a multi-faceted problem that extends into all aspects of medicine and really, human life,\" he said. \"Antibiotics are ubiquitous around us, they end up in our food and the environment and so coming up with a single solution is not easy.\" The best way to avoid a resistant infection is to avoid infection altogether, which means higher levels of immunisation, water sanitation and hygiene are needed, he adds. \"There's going to be more antibiotics use because there's more people who need them, but we need to make sure that they are used appropriately and the correct medicines are used.\" Dr Lindsey Edwards, a senior lecturer in microbiology at King's College London, said the new study \"marks a significant and alarming increase compared to previous data\". \"These findings should serve as a wake-up call for global health leaders. Without decisive action, AMR could undermine decades of progress in child health, particularly in the world's most vulnerable regions.\"",

    "article_text": "Warning: This article contains spoilers The winners of Gladiators 2025 have been crowned after Saturday night's final on BBC One. Gym owner Amanda Wah and gymnastics coach Joe Fishburn were the victors - beating fellow contestants Aneila Afsar, a supply teacher from Manchester, and Mus Dumbuya, a youth worker from east London. Wah, a gym owner from Warrington, beat her fellow North-West contender despite Afsar having a 1.5-second head start in the final challenge, the Eliminator. Fishburn, a gymnastics coach from Scarborough, had a six-second head start on his fellow finalist and finished the course in a record-breaking 0.55 seconds, according to the programme. The 24-year-old Team GB gymnast paid tribute to his grandmother, Christine, who brought him up after his mother died when he was two. \"I never had a father figure present and she's done everything for me. I hope you're proud,\" he said. Despite Afsar's advantage, Wah managed to catch up, and she dedicated her victory minutes to her late mother. Speaking to co-host Bradley Walsh, Wah said: \"That one's for you, Mum. This has been the best experience of my life – unbelievable.\" She said \"everyone has been exceptional, especially Aneila who was a great contender\". Wah added that it was mentally challenging for her rival \"to come in as the fastest runner-up\" following the withdrawal of Zavia Hill, a personal trainer from Manchester, who had to leave before the final due to an injury. Afsar previously said she had broken barriers by being the first Muslim woman on the show. Wah said that the 11 weeks of being tackled and pushed by the \"superhuman\" gladiators was like being on \"work experience\". She called them the \"biggest, fiercest, strongest people but also extremely supportive\". She added: \"They are professionals and they don't want to hurt anyone. They care and it's amazing.\" Fishburn said he would put the trophy on his \"grandmother Christine's mantelpiece\" and called the experience \"definitely the best thing I've ever done\". He added: \"We were in an amazing final, and I felt like I already won coming into this process but obviously it's always nice to complete the whole thing and take the win. \"Mus is an amazing opponent, contender, friend, everything he does is so amazing and it was an honour to be in the final with him.\" Cheering on Fishburn was Roddy Mackay, a contender from 1993, and his family, while Wah on was her girlfriend, two children, friends and family. Gladiators was revived last year on the BBC, with Army officer Finlay Anderson and personal trainer Marie-Louise Nicholson crowned 2024 champions. The show ran on ITV for eight years until 2000 before it was axed, and was then on Sky for a short run from 2008 to 2009. This year, the Gladiators Live Tour will make its global debut across UK arenas. Listen to highlights fromNorth Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latestepisode of Look North. Millions watch Warrington trainer Amanda Wah and Manchester teacher Aneila Afsar battle it out on TV Proposals to renovate newer parts of concert venue, which dates back to 1858. Joe Fishburn says people have been messaging him after learning about his 'adverse' life story. The band's new track references a legendary gig by the Madchester pioneers in Cheshire in 1990. Kieron Goodwin, 33, is on trial accused of murdering his partner, 29-year-old Olivia Wood.",

    "article_text": "Eddie Howe is \"conscious and talking with his family\", the club said Newcastle manager Eddie Howe has been admitted to hospital and will miss the club's Premier League fixture with Manchester United on Sunday. The 47-year-old went to hospital late on Friday, having \"felt unwell for a number of days\", the club said. A statement said: \"Medical staff kept Eddie in hospital overnight for further tests, which are ongoing. \"He is conscious and talking with his family, and is continuing to receive expert medical care.\" The club added: \"Everyone at Newcastle United extends their best wishes to Eddie for a speedy recovery, and further updates will follow in due course.\" The statement did not give any further details of his illness or condition. In Howe's absence, assistant managers Jason Tindall and Graeme Jones will lead Newcastle for the visit of Ruben Amorim's side to St James' Park. Tindall stood in for Howe at a pre-match news conference on Friday. Last month, Howe guided Newcastle to their first domestic trophy for 70 years with adeserved Carabao Cup finalwin over Liverpool at Wembley. Newcastle are currently seventh in the Premier League table. Amersham-born Howe hasbeen in charge of the Magpiessince November 2021, when he succeeded Steve Bruce as the club's head coach. Newcastle have finished 11th, fourth and seventh in the past three seasons. Howe has taken charge of 165 matches in all competitions for Newcastle, winning 84 drawing 36 and losing 45 of them. Under Howe, the Magpies memorably beat Paris St-Germain in the Champions League group stage in the 2023-24 campaign but failed to make it to the knockout stage. He previously had two spells in charge of Bournemouth either side of a brief stint at Burnley, and has been talked of as a future England manager. However, he said he was not interviewed by the Football Association to replace Gareth Southgate, with Thomas Tuchel appointed Three Lions boss last October.

The 35-year-old from Northern Ireland carded a six-under 66 - featuring two eagles - to head a star-stacked leaderboard with a score of 12 under after 54 holes. McIlroy's advantage looked destined to be bigger but the complexion of the task ahead changed whenBryson DeChambeaunarrowed the gap with three birdies in his final four holes - including a 50-foot putt from the fringe of the 18th green. The American maverick, who beat McIlroy to last year's US Open title in a dramatic finish, set up a tantalising Masters Sunday with a three-under 69 to close on 10 under. McIlroy has already landed four majors - the US Open, The Open and two US PGA Championships, the last of which was in 2014 - but has fallen short at Augusta National on several occasions. The most infamous instance came in 2011. Then, aged 21, he blew a four-shot lead as he took 80 shots on a haunting final day and finished in a tie for 15th. Now, after a display which showed his ever-increasing maturity, the world number two holds another golden opportunity to become only the sixth man to complete the career Grand Slam of winning all four majors. Canada'sCorey Connersis eight under after a 70, while 2018 championPatrick Reedand last year's runner-upLudvig Abergare six under. English veteranJustin Rose,who led at the halfway stage,dropped off the pace and is five under after a 75. The former world number one is alongside defending championScottie Scheffler, Ireland's 2019 Open championShane Lowryand Australia'sJason Day. Masters tee-times for round four at Augusta National The Masters round three recap - McIlroy leads DeChambeau by two heading into Sunday 'We need the Masters' - Augusta's adversity after Hurricane Helene This video can not be played Best shots from Masters day three As Augusta founding father Bobby Jones famously said, the toughest distance in golf is the five inches between a player's ears. Controlling the mind has been a key part of McIlroy's work this week as he tries to finally land the Green Jacket on his 17th appearance at this pristine plot of land in Georgia â and his 11th attempt to complete the career Grand Slam. Consulting renowned sports psychologist Bob Rotella has been helping provide perception and patience. That enabled McIlroy to compartmentalise the two late double bogeys which ruined his opening round and bounce back with a six-under 66 on Friday which thrust him into contention. Before starting his third round in the penultimate group, McIlroy talked about following the same principle on Saturday. The pair discussed \"letting the score come\" to McIlroy, who was hellbent on not trying to \"force the issue\" as he chased down Rose. The scores not only came to McIlroy - they sprinted towards him from the start. Wearing a solemn and focused expression throughout, McIlroy refused to get carried away with the highs of his round, or too disheartened by stickier patches. \"You have to try to ride that momentum as much as you can but then also temper it with a little bit of rationale and logic,\" he said. \"It's a fine dance. I certainly don't want to be a robot out there, but at the same time I don't want to be too animated, either.\" This video can not be played McIlroy makes incredible start with eagle on second McIlroy opened with a birdie after a monster 371-yard drive on the first, then magnificently chipped in for an eagle on the par-five second to quickly move into the outright lead. The dream start continued with birdies on three and five as McIlroy became the first player to start a Masters round with six successive threes. A minor blip came when McIlroy pushed his tee shot on the seventh into the pine trees on the right, but his lucid thinking was evident again as he punched out to left of the green. Confidence flowing, he showed a piece of real quality - beautifully-judging a tricky chip on a devilish green â to set up a par-saving putt. The quality of McIlroy's touch was emphasised minutes later by Rose â from a similar angle - splashing out of the bunker and running 27 feet past the pin to the fringe of the green. As McIlroy knows too well, Augusta has the propensity to bite back quickly. He dropped a shot on the long eighth and, after scrambling to save par on the ninth, the rocky patch resulted in a three-putt bogey on the 10th. In contrast, Conners birdied the same three holes. The level-headed Canadian moved alongside DeChambeau and a shot behind McIlroy. Now it felt like a true test of McIlroy's resilience. Saving par on 11 from eight feet steadied him and a par followed on the treacherous 12th before a welcome birdie on the 13th. With Conners missing a birdie putt on 14 providing more encouragement, McIlroy turned on the style again. An outstanding second shot to eight feet on the par-five 15th led to another eagle â the first time he had ever converted two in the same round at a major â before rounding off with three pars. This video can not be played McIlroy extends Masters lead with eagle on 15 McIlroy, though, watched what could have been a more comfortable advantage disappear thanks to DeChambeau's defiance. The big-hitting American has changed tack at Augusta National, softening the hubristic approach he showed in 2020 - when he claimed it was effectively a \"par 67\" which he could drive through - and now treating the course with more respect. However, he lacked feel with his irons for large parts on Saturday, only to find his touch at the right time with a strong finish. Backed by a supportive Augusta crowd which has warmed to his unique approach to the game, DeChambeau looks the likeliest to deny McIlroy. The pair will go out in the last group at 19:30 BST on Sunday. \"It's always important in a major championship to try and be in the final group or close to the final group,\" said DeChambeau. \"It was definitely fun knowing that it was Rory and knowing that we could have a good matchup. \"We're not the only players out there. There's still a lot of great players. But it's going to be a fun test.\" This video can not be played DeChambeau holes 'impossible' putt on 18th The penultimate round of a major is known as 'Moving Day' and an electric start saw Rose, DeChambeau and McIlroy each hold a slice of the early lead. Rose, bidding to become the oldest first-time champion since Mark O'Meara in 1998, was unable to get going as his rivals rallied. The 44-year-old former world number one was one over at the turn before fading further on the second nine. It was also a day where Scheffler - the tournament favourite alongside McIlroy - got left behind. The current world number one could not find top gear as he shot a level-par 72. \"At times I felt good. At times I felt bad. I just couldn't really get anything going,\" the 28-year-old American said. \"I ended up with even, which felt like I had to scramble a lot actually.\" Follow all the action of the final round with live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app from 18:00 BST.

    "article_text": "This video can not be played Women's Six Nations highlights: Ireland 5-49 England While the crowd in Cork rose to their feet to clap off an Ireland side who were only 7-5 down against the favourites for the Rugby World Cup, England's leaders blocked out all the noise and gathered in a huddle. Captain Zoe Aldcroft led the discussion with lock Abbie Ward, fly-half Zoe Harrison, scrum-half Natasha Hunt and centre Meg Jones. All the remaining players were off down the tunnel, but the Red Roses' leadership team - like they did at the Principality Stadium in round two - took time to debrief before hearing from head coach John Mitchell and his assistants in the changing room. Ireland had frustrated Mitchell's side for large parts of the first half, and took a deserved lead through a try by wing Amee-Leigh Costigan. However, Morwenna Talling's score helped the visitors to a narrow half-time lead, andsix unanswered second-half triesemphatically ended any possibility of a shock defeat. \"The half-time dressing room was calm,\" Harrison told BBC Sport. \"It was all about how we could take pressure off ourselves and to just work on the successes we were getting.\" The Red Roses have not lost since their World Cup final defeat by New Zealand in 2022, with Mitchell's side rarely even close to defeat in their incredible 23-game winning run. Their most recent proper challenge came back in October against Canada at WXV1, where again they only held a 7-5 lead at half-time before eventuallywinning 21-12to retain their title. Cork provided a similar exercise, which is exactly what England want before a home World Cup kicks off in August. \"We actually really enjoyed that test. We needed that and it's good for the game to have a first half like that,\" England attack coach Lou Meadows told BBC Sport. \"It was a physical battle and all about winning the collision and we just didn't do that in the first half. \"They fixed it in the changing room themselves. It was about the collision and winning the carry, they spoke about the one action they needed to achieve that. \"We wanted to keep it simple, clear that up and then we can play fast.\" Womenâs Six Nations: Wins for England and France Women's Six Nations: England dominate second half to beat Ireland - reaction Matching England 'possible' for improving Ireland This video can not be played Ireland's Costigan scores opening try against England The message about winning the collision from the leadership team quickly came to fruition when Jess Breach burst down the wing to score a disallowed try just over 30 seconds into the second half. It was the start of a free-flowing half of rugby from the Red Roses, led by fly-half Harrison, who despite being known for her strong kicking game was lively with ball in hand. \"I really enjoyed Zoe's running game today, we know she can kick and distribute but I just liked how she got her head up early and saw space,\" former England fly-half and 2014 World Cup-winner Katy Daley-Mclean toldBBC's Rugby Union Weekly. \"She was solving the problems in front of her, she is starting to develop into a really well-rounded 10 and coming into form at exactly the right time.\" The biggest swing came when Mitchell unloaded his bench, which saw replacement prop Sarah Bern score twice and Kelsey Clifford grab her first international try. Mitchell made 13 changes to his starting XV from the opening win over Italy to the hammering of Wales in Cardiff as he aims to build\"two teams\"before the World Cup. \"One thing England have is a massively good bench, Sarah Bern came on and was outstanding,\" added Mclean. \"Kelsey Clifford and Maddie Feaunati were brilliant, the list is endless. They all came on and added. \"It is great for England as it is competition but they know that very few teams in the world can live with you for 80 minutes and your bench.\" England, who next face Scotland in Leicester next Saturday, are chasing a seventh Women's Six Nations title in a row and a fourth successive Grand Slam. France are the last team to beat the Red Roses in the Six Nations back in 2018 and, aftera convincing win over Wales,remain on course to set up a potential Grand Slam-decider at Allianz Stadium on 26 April. Former Red Roses head coach Simon Middleton says England need to address how they begin games. \"They need to look at how they start the game, they struggled last week in the start against Wales and again this week,\" Middleton told BBC Sport. \"What they do have is a great capacity to regroup themselves and that strength in depth, but against better sides they won't get presented with as many opportunities. \"Other sides will not fall away as much as Ireland did.\" Come World Cup time - in front of what are likely to be record-breaking crowds - being calm and regrouping under pressure is certainly a handy skill to call upon.

    "article_text": "Norris leads Max Verstappen in the drivers' title by one point going in to Sunday's race Bahrain Grand Prix Venue:SakhirDates:11-13 AprilRace start:16:00 BST on Sunday Coverage:Race live on BBC Radio 5 Live. Live text updates on the BBC Sport website and app Lando Norris said he felt \"clueless\" and \"like I have never driven a Formula 1 car before\" after qualifying sixth for the Bahrain Grand Prix. The Briton's McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri took pole position, while Norris was 0.426 seconds slower than the Australian. Norris said: \"No big complaints. The car's amazing. The car's as good as it has been all season, which is strong. \"Just I've been off it all weekend. I don't know why. Just clueless on track at the minute. I don't know. I just need a big reset, that's all.\" The 25-year-old leads the world championship by one point from Red Bull's Max Verstappen and is 13 ahead of Piastri before Sunday's race. Verstappen qualified seventh, while Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, Mercedes' George Russell, Pierre Gasly's Alpine and the second Mercedes of Andrea Kimi Antonelli are between Norris and Piastri on the grid. Norris said: \"I just don't know how to approach it. I can't figure it out. Every time I try something, it's good for one session and then it's the wrong thing for the next session because the wind's changed, and I just can't flow with the car. And when I can't flow, I'm just not very quick. \"I've just got to work on myself. I can't fault the team and the car is the best by a long way. But clearly I'm just not clicking at the minute.\" McLaren team principal Andrea Stella said Norris had suffered from a weakness that has been afflicting him since the start of the season, in that he is struggling to extrapolate the best from the car in qualifying because of certain handling characteristics it has. Stella said: \"Lando is a very fast driver, a naturally fast driver with an incredible race-craft. It's more a phase, I think, when it comes to Q3, putting together the lap, that hasn't worked very well recently, but this is a short phase. \"He is just now in this temporary phase in which, while pushing the car to the limit, there's a few things that don't go exactly as he expects, and when you go for the extra 0.1secs in Q3, this becomes more visible. \"We understand what it is. It will just require a bit of adaptation from Lando himself, and some adaptations from the team. But I think the understanding is good, and we are very optimistic that this will be resolved.\" Stella said that the issue does not manifest itself in races, when drivers are not pushing as hard. \"This doesn't affect the race pace,\" Stella said. \"Already in practice Lando has shown a very strong lap in the race run simulations, so I'm really looking forward to seeing Lando finding his way back tomorrow to the front of the pack.\" This video can not be played McLaren mistakes & Tsunoda vindication: What to know ahead of the Bahrain Grand Prix Lewis Hamilton was another driver struggling to explain his deficit to his team-mate. The seven-time champion qualified ninth, six places and 0.597secs behind team-mate Charles Leclerc, who was promoted to second on the grid because of a penalty for Mercedes' George Russell. Hamilton said: \"Not much to say. I'm just not doing a good enough job. Have to keep improving. I will try and see if I can get in the top five. We will see. Clearly the car is good enough. Certainly not a good feeling, for sure.\" Pressed for how he will improve in qualifying, he said: \"I really don't know. I really don't have a lot of answers for you guys. Just wasn't quick today.\" Ferrari have been disappointed by the pace of their car so far this season, notwithstanding Hamilton's victory in the sprint race in China at the second grand prix. Leclerc said he had been trying \"extreme\" car set-ups in trying to find more pace. \"At the beginning of the season, we obviously weren't where we wanted to be,\" Leclerc said, \"and since two or three races I've gone in an interesting direction setup-wise, which seems to help me to extract a bit more out of the car. That's what I'm trying to do every weekend. For now, it seems to be better and better, which is a good sign for the future.\" Ferrari have a new floor on the car in Bahrain, which Leclerc said had worked as intended but should prove a bigger advantage at other races to come. \"The team has done a really, really good job. We've all pushed quite a lot in the last few weeks because we've been struggling with performance. \"I know that at the factory they've been pushing like crazy to try and bring this floor a bit earlier on, and that definitely made the difference. \"Because if I look at the gap with P4, it's not that much and I'm pretty sure that without the floor I wouldn't be P3. So that's already one position won. \"I'm curious to see what it will do tomorrow [in the race]. However, it's probably not the best track to extract the maximum out of this new upgrade, but in the next few weekends we shall see more of it.\" Verstappen, who suffered a problem with the braking system on his Red Bull as well as inconsistent grip, said he was hopeful of being able to fight with the cars behind the McLarens in the race. \"In the past, high-deg tracks have been good for us,\" Verstappen said, \"but with the balance we had today it will be very difficult. But of course I am only looking forward. The McLarens will be too quick but the others we can follow.\" Piastri takes Bahrain pole, Norris in sixth F1 bosses reject V10 engine return Andrew Benson Q&A: Send us your questions Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "Boulter & Burrage secure GB's BJK Cup Finals place",
    "article_text": "This video can not be played Boulter and Burrage qualify for BJK Cup Finals Katie Boulter and Jodie Burrage produced a superb doubles performance to help Great Britain beat the Netherlands 2-1 and seal their place in September's Billie Jean King Cup Finals. Boulter and Burrage, a late switch for doubles specialist Olivia Nicholls and Harriet Dart, beat Demi Schuurs and Suzan Lamens 6-2 6-2 on the clay. Boulter had earlier suffered a 6-4 6-3 loss to Lamens, while Sonay Kartal won her singles match 6-4 4-6 6-1 against Eva Vedder. Boulter jumped into the air after a Burrage ace confirmed their doubles victory, with the pair congratulating their opponents before heading over to celebrate with the team. \"Every captain wants a Katie Boulter on their team,\" GB captain Anne Keothavong told BBC Sport. \"Katie, after the disappointment of her singles, responded remarkably well. It was always an option for us and they went out there and did the job. \"We knew doubles was going to be important this week - and I don't think Katie has ever done so much doubles practice in her life.\" Relive how GB beat Netherlands to qualify for BJK Cup Finals Boulter fights back to help GB beat Germany in BJK Cup Raducanu discussing coaching job with Petchey Boulter and Burrage were playing together for only the second time, having practised as a partnership in the build-up to the competition. \"We went out there and we gave it our all. We swung and that is what we wanted to do,\" Burrage said. \"It was great to step on the court with Katie - good friends and good partners, I think.\" It is a credit to Boulter that she came out after a disappointing loss to world number 70 Lamens in the singles. She and Burrage claimed an excellent win against the formidable Dutch pairing - Lamens was on a 13-match unbeaten run at the BJK Cup while veteran Schuurs had not lost a match for her country since 2022. Boulter and Burrage played with aggression, targeting Schuurs' serve in particular. They hit 26 winners to 10 from the Netherlands, with Boulter cranking up her forehand in the deciding moments. Schuurs was left in tears after the match, with her side now needing to compete in the play-offs to secure a place in the 2026 qualifiers. Britain go on to compete at the eight-team Finals in Shenzhen, China from 16-21 September. This video can not be played Best shots of Kartal's victory against Vedder Kartal had earlier put Britain in a fine position with a gritty win over Vedder. She came back from an early break down in the first set and should have done similar at the start of the second. The Briton missed three break points against the world number 265 Vedder and was on the wrong end of an incorrect overrule of an out call by umpire Eva Asderaki-Moore at 4-3. Had it not been overruled, Kartal would have had a break point. Instead, the point was replayed, Vedder held serve and then broke Kartal in the next game. Vedder played her best tennis in the final two games of the second set, drawing errors out of Kartal before wrapping up the set with an ace. The Briton put her frustration aside for the third set, quickly going a break up and putting her heavy forehand to good use to win the final five games in a row. Victory for Boulter would have wrapped up the tie for GB, and the world number 40 was the favourite on paper. However, it was Dutchwoman Lamens who looked more comfortable in sliding and moving around on the clay. Boulter was always behind in the match, saving break points in the first game before going a double break down as her forehand misfired. When Boulter connected, her power was too much for Lamens, but she could not consistently find her range, despite briefly threatening a comeback after rescuing one of the breaks in the opening set. The Briton broke first in the second set, a nicely angled backhand forcing the error from Lamens, but she immediately surrendered the break with a wayward service game. Lamens did not look back, reeling off three games in a row to complete victory. Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "Jamaican reggae artist Max Romeo dies aged 80",
    "article_text": "Max Romeo, the influential Jamaican reggae artist best known for tracks such as Chase the Devil and War Ina Babylon, has died at the age of 80. The singer, known to his family and friends as Maxie Smith, died after heart complications in Saint Andrew Parish, Jamaica, on Friday. Romeo rose to fame in the late 1960s with his provocative hit Wet Dream. Despite being banned by the BBC, the song became a UK Top 10 single and spent 25 weeks in the charts, cementing his legacy as one of the world’s most recognisable reggae voices. “To hear of his passing is quite shocking,” said Max Romeo’s lawyer, Errol Michael Henry. “He was a perfect gentleman, and a gentle soul. He had great love for his family, and he was a legend in his own right. You couldn’t meet a nicer person – which makes the loss more difficult.” Romeo began his career in 1965 as the lead vocalist for the Emotions, before his music became synonymous with the Jamaican social democracy movement of the 1970s. His song Let the Power Fall on I became a ballad for Jamaica’s People’s National party during its successful 1972 election campaign. His 1976 album War Ina Babylon, released on Island Records and backed by Jamaican band the Upsetters, is widely regarded as a classic of the roots reggae era. It featured Chase the Devil, a song that has since been sampled by artists across genres, including the Prodigy and Kanye West. Romeo later moved to New York in 1978, where he co-wrote and starred in the musicalReggae, while he went on to perform backing vocals on the Rolling Stones’ track Dance on their Emotional Rescue album.",

    "title": "Ted Kotcheff, director of First Blood, Weekend at Bernie’s and Wake in Fright, dies aged 94",
    "article_text": "Ted Kotcheff, the prolific Canadian director of films including First Blood, Weekend at Bernie’s, Wake in Fright and The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz, has died aged 94. His daughter Kate Kotchefftold the Canadian Pressthat he had died of heart failure on Thursday in Nuevo Vallarta, Mexico, where he lived.His son Thomas said: “He died of old age, peacefully, and surrounded by loved ones.” In an amazingly varied career, Kotcheff’s work ranged from hardhitting TV plays and low-budget features in the UK, to hit Hollywood comedies and prestige-laden award-winners and cult films. Kate Kotcheff said: “He was an amazing storyteller. He was an incredible, larger than life character [and] he was a director who could turn his hand to anything.” The son of Bulgarian/Macedonian immigrants to Canada, Kotcheff was born in 1931 in Toronto, and raised in the city’sCabbagetowndistrict. After earning a degree in English literature from Toronto University, Kotcheff joined the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) in the early 1950s, part of a remarkable generation that includedNorman Jewison,Arthur Hiller, Sidney J Furie andAlvin Rakoff. Like them, he felt he had to move away to further his career, and Kotcheff came to London in 1957 and began making TV plays for strands including Hour of Mystery, Armchair Theatre and ITV Playhouse. These included an adaptation of Eugene O’Neill’s Emperor Jones in 1958, written by Terry Southern and starring Kenneth Spencer and Harry H Corbett, No Trams to Lime Street in 1959, written by Alun Owen, and – infamously – Underground in 1958, in which actor Gareth Jones collapsed and died during a live transmission. Kotcheff moved into features in the early 60s, making his debut with the 1962 comedy TiaraTahiti, starring James Mason and John Mills, following it up with Life at the Top, the sequel to hit kitchen sink drama Room at the Top, in 1965, and the race-issue drama Two Gentlemen Sharing in 1969. In the same period Kotcheff also directed the original production of Lionel Bart’s celebrated musical Maggie May,which premiered in 1964. Kotcheff continued to work in TV, directing Ingrid Bergman in an adaptation ofJean Cocteau’s La Voix Humainein 1967, and achieving perhaps his high point with a contribution to Play for Today in 1971: Edna the Inebriate Woman, starring Patricia Hayes as a homeless alcoholic. However his career had taken an unexpected detour in the same year with the cult Australian film Wake in Fright, for whichhe was offered the job to directdespite never having visited the country. Despite being poorly received in its home country due to its uncompromising depiction of a brutally cruel Australian outback, including notorious scenes of a kangaroo hunt, Wake in Fright was selected for the Cannes film festival and went on to becomecelebrated as a landmark film, both as part of theAustralian new wave of the 1970sand as a pioneering entry inthe “Ozploitation” subgenre. In 1974 Kotcheff finally realised his ambition of makinga successful Canadian feature film with The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz; starring Richard Dreyfuss, it was adapted from a novel by his friend (and former housemate in London) Mordecai Richler, with whom he had worked on a string of British productions – including an Armchair Theatre adaptation of Duddy Kravitz in 1961. The film won the Golden Bear at the Berlin film festival and was a major commercial success in Canada. As a result, Hollywood took notice and Kotcheff was hired to make satirical comedy Fun with Dick and Jane, starring George Segal and Jane Fonda as a successful married couple who turn to crime after Segal is fired. It was a hit on its release in 1977, and Kotcheff followed it up with another Segal comedy Who Is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe? and Nick Nolte American football film North Dallas Forty. Kotcheff then released arguably his most influential film: theSylvester Stalloneaction film First Blood, which had numerous directors and lead actors attached to it before Kotcheff offered the role to Stallone and production got underway in 1981. A depiction of an emotionally embattled Vietnam veteran, First Blood was a sizeable hit and spawned two sequels, including Rambo: First Blood Part II which became a career-defining success for Stallone in 1985. Kotcheff had another big success at the end of the decade: the dead-body comedy Weekend at Bernie’s, starring Andrew McCarthy. After the failure of the Tom Selleck comedy Folks! in 1992, Kotcheff returned to TV, and in 2000 joined the long running crime show Law & Order: Special Victims Unit as executive producer and occasional director, where he remained for 12 seasons. Kotcheff was married twice, to Sylvia Kay between 1962 and 1972, and to Laifun Chung, who survives him.",

    "title": "Panama opposition party accuses US of ‘camouflaged invasion’",
    "article_text": "Panamanianopposition politicians have accused the US of launching a “camouflaged invasion” of the country, amid simmering discontent over the government’s handling of the diplomatic crisis. After a three-day visit by the US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth,Donald Trumpappeared to confirm that US military personnel had been deployed to the Central American country on Thursday, telling reporters: “We’ve moved a lot of troops toPanama.” Hegseth said that the US wouldincrease its military presenceat three former US bases in the country to “secure the Panama canal from Chinese influence”. The last US military bases in Panama were vacated in 1999 as a condition of the 1977 Torrijos-Carter treaties to hand the canal to Panamanian ownership. Under the canal’sneutrality treaty, no foreign power can “maintain military forces, defense sites and military installations within its national territory”, and the US comments have prompted outrage in Panama. “This is a camouflaged invasion,” said Ricardo Lombana, the leader of the opposition Other Way Movement.“An invasion without firing a shot, but with a cudgel and threats.” At a Wednesday press conference to announce the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the US, Panama’s minister of public security, Frank Abrego, said the agreement would not impinge on his nation’s sovereignty and that the country would not accept military bases. However, a full text of the MOUincluded aerial photosof Fort Sherman, Rodman naval base and Howard air force base, with areas outlined for “training”, “humanitarian activities” and the “installation of US property”. The Panamanian government says they are not “military bases” and that the deal is temporary, but opposition parties have rejected such claims. “If you have an installation which is for use of foreign soldiers and they have control over what happens inside – and Panama has to ask in advance to enter – that’s a military base,” said Lombana. For many Panamanians, the return of US armed forces – even for supposed “joint operations” – will bring back uncomfortable memories of 1989’s Operation Just Cause, whenAmerican troops killed thousands of civilians. A second agreement allows US navy ships to be reimbursed for the fees they pay to the canal. That preferential treatment would appear to violate the neutrality treatment and could open the door to further attempts to negotiate down the fees charged by the canal. On Thursday a local lawyer filed a legal case against the Panamanian president, José Raúl Mulino, accusing him of “crimes against the international personality of the state”. Frustration is growing over the government’s handling of the diplomatic crisis. Since Trump declared his plan to “take back” the Panama canal on his 20 January inauguration speech, all communication on the topic has been through Mulino and the details of negotiations kept largely secret. This has led to serious differences in the US and Panamanian accounts of those negotiations. When the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, visited in early February, Mulino told press that the meeting had been “very cordial” and that the canal was not under threat. Later, however, Rubio said the situation around the canal was “unacceptable” and Trump continued to call for the return of the canal. The latest example came on Tuesday when two different statements concerning Hegseth’s meeting with Mulino were published. In the Panamanian version, Hegseth was said to have recognized Panama’s “inalienable sovereignty” over the canal, but those words were absent from the secretary of defense’s statement and Hegseth refused to acknowledge Panamanian ownership of the canal at Wednesday’s press conference. Panama says thatthe US omitted the phrasefrom the agreed joint statement. Mulino has also opted to avoid engaging with other countries – such as Canada and Mexico – to gain international support for his country’s cause. On Thursday the local chapter of Transparency Internationalrequested on Xthat Mulino “inform the country of all the details of what is happening, the agreements in process and the pressures he is receiving if that is the case. The country requires transparency in order to achieve unity against this threat to our sovereignty.” Even before Hegseth’s visit, Mulino had faced heavy local criticism for offering concessions to the US without gaining firm assurances over the future of the canal. Two-thirds of Panamanians disapproveof the way he is running the country. In addition to the diplomatic crisis he has passed an unpopular social security reform and angered environmentalists by opening talks with a copper mine closed down in 2023 due to popular protest. He lacks the backing of many of his party’s deputies in congress who are loyal to his political patron, Ricardo Martinelli, who has been residing in the Nicaraguan embassy to escape corruption charges and recently saw his attempt to gain exile in that country rejected. Popular demonstrations against US policy and the handling of the government are expected on Saturday.",

    "title": "Japan’s World Expo: a positive vision of the future for our divided world?",
    "article_text": "As clunky as it sounds, “designing a future society for our lives” isn’t a bad ambition for the world in these troubled times. From this Sunday, organisers of the2025 Expositionin Osaka will be hoping that appeal will put the event’s unsettled preparations in the shade for a six-month celebration of our common humanity. The westernJapancity is preparing to host its second World Expo, 55 years after the first was held in a country eager to capitalise on fading memories of the second world war as it embarked on its postwar journey to become an industrial and technological powerhouse. Then, 64 million people descended on Osaka’s northern suburbs to view theTower of the Sun– still a popular site in the commemorative park – and a moon rock retrieved by Apollo 12. The 2025 version opens under a geopolitical cloud dark enough to cast a shadow over the 960-acre grounds on the reclaimed Yumeshima (“Dream Island”), a former dumping ground for industrial waste and, for successive Osaka governments, a plot of land in perennial need of a purpose. The expo is the most convincing attempt yet to make use of the unloved island, until now a blot on the landscape, with Osaka’s industrial skyline on one side and the busy shipping lanes of the Seto inland sea on the other. In its mission to bring people together, 150 countries and regions will showcase the best of their culture and technology, albeit with an acknowledgment that humanity is more divided than at any time most of the millions of expected visitors can recall. They should, though, marvel at a Martian meteorite discovered by Japanese scientists in Antarctica in 2000, interact with androids that could one day live in their homes, view a beating artificial heart made of stem cells and – not for the ­faint-hearted – stare back at an image of what they might look like in 25 years’ time. Viewed from the grand ring – a 2km (1.24 mile) wooden promenade that encircles the waterfront site – there is an incongruity to the 150 pavilions, from the flamboyance of Turkmenistan to the neat wooden contours of Japan. And all separated by lots of Tarmac and concrete. The earthquake-resistant wooden “skywalk”, though, is a feat of craftsmanship, built with a traditional joinery method used in the construction of ancient shrines and temples, its network of cypress, cedar and pine beams destined to become a shady oasis when Japan unleashes its brutal summer heat midway through the  event. The expo theme’s tagline – “towards a brighter future for all” – feels laughably elusive, but credit should go to the organisers for addressing the harsh realities of the world outside. The blue and yellow sign over Ukraine’s booth states that the country is “not for sale”, echoing comments from the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Russia has chosen not to take part. In August visitors will be able to take part in a virtual reality experience corner for conflict zones in Gaza, in a space currently devoted to 80 years of the United Nations and its constituent departments and agencies, including Unrwa. Palestine’s space is to be found in the far corner of a shared pavilion, although its organisers claim the shipment of several planned exhibits has been delayed by Israeli authorities, which is denied by Israel, whose pavilion includes a stone from the Western Wall in Jerusalem. The reported delay is in keeping with Osaka’sbumpy road to Expo 2025. Construction was hit by labour shortages and the soaring cost of building materials – the project’s initial price tag of ¥125bn has soared to ¥235bn (from £666m to £1.25bn) – while interest among the Japanese public has so far been lukewarm. The 1970 Osaka Expo’s 64 million visitors was a record until Shanghai in 2010. So far, only 8.7m advance tickets have been sold for 2025, well below the pre-sales target of 14m. Last week, as TV crews swarmed around the site, workers were still flattening strips of tactile paving for visitors with visual ­impairments, while activity around incomplete pavilions gave them the feel of a supermarket entrance. The 1,500 trees comprising the Forest of Tranquillity will need time to bed in. Organisers have been given last-minute jitters by the discovery of potentially explosive concentrations ofmethane gas, as well as concern about overcrowding at the new subway station serving the site and, on social media, disbelief at the lack of cubicle walls in thechildren’s lavatories. The host nation, though, has deployed its soft power to good effect: the world’s longest conveyor belt sushi, a giantGundamrobot, 32 sculptures ofHello Kittydressed as different types of algae to symbolise the plant’s versatility, and an upgraded version of a “human washing machine” that proved a hit at the 1970 event. In a country addicted toyuru-kyara[mascot characters], the biggest attraction could turn out to be Myaku-Myaku, a red and blue figure with five googly eyes that was ridiculed when it was selected as the expo’sofficial mascot. Since then, the mysterious creature, purportedly “born from the fusion of cells and water”, has won over the Japanese public and is now the centre of a large merchandise empire … and the face ofmanhole coversacross Osaka. Sou Fujimoto, the exposition’s architectural mastermind, conceded the event was opening at a time when minds are focused on wars, real and commercial. “The whole global ­situation is very unstable,” he told CNN. But he added: “I believe this is a really precious opportunity to show so many countries can come together in one place and think about our future together.” That lofty vision will be fleeting, however. The pavilions – and Fujimoto’s “sustainable” edifice – will be dismantled later this year to make way for Japan’sfirst casino. But as gambles go, the longer odds could be on selling the idea that the expo movement’s bricks-and-­mortar appeal for global unity will strike a chord in a hyper-connected, but fractured, world.",

    "article_text": "Strong winds caused havoc in Beijing and parts of northernChinaon Saturday, forcing hundreds of flights to be cancelled, attractions to close and rail lines to be suspended, state media said. The powerful winds stemmed mainly from a cold vortex system formed over Mongolia that was moving east and south, sweeping across northern China from Friday and through the weekend, the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) said. Temperatures in the capital were set to fall by 12 degrees Celsius on Saturday, and meteorologists warned that wind speeds could rival or exceed April records dating back to 1951. State-run news agency Xinhua reported that gusts of up to 150km/h (93mph) were forecast. Beijing earlier issued its first orange alert – the second-highest tier – for strong winds in a decade for this weekend. As of Saturday morning, 413 flights at Beijing’s Capital international airport had been cancelled, state broadcaster CCTV said. Train services including the airport’s express subway line and some high-speed rail lines had also been suspended, CCTV added. Tourist attractions including the Summer Palace, Temple of Heaven, Beijing zoo and the Universal Studios theme park were also temporarily closed on Saturday. Almost 300 trees in the Chinese capital had toppled and 19 vehicles had been damaged, CCTV said, adding that no injuries due to the strong winds had been reported in Beijing yet. China is the world’s biggest emitter of the greenhouse gases that scientists say are driving climate change and making extreme weather more frequent and intense. Dozens of people were killedand thousands evacuated during storms that caused severe flooding around the country last year. In May, a highway in southern China collapsed after days of rain, killing 48 people.",

    "title": "Did Trump’s tariffs kill economic populism?",
    "article_text": "At the beginning of this helter-skelter week, Downing Street was declaring globalisation not only dead but a failure. Now, only five trading days later, the autopsy is still under way but the victim may instead be economic populism, strangled by Wall Street, the citadel of globalisation. Donald Trump’s so-called liberation day may in fact have been theanti-globalist’s entombment day. In an effort to deny even a tactical retreat, Trump’s aides insist the White House goal all along was not to weaken globalism, or even to protect theUS economywith tariffs, but instead to get into a negotiation to lower tariffs around the world and to punish China. As cover stories go, it is hardly credible, partly because the tariffs were repeatedly lauded by Trump as a macroeconomic revenue-raising measure, or a means to bolster US manufacturing. The reality is that when faced by an attempt to remake the world trading system overnight, or what the former UK Treasury minister Jim O’Neill describes as “a full-on Kamikaze mission”, the markets revolted. But the retreat caused by the sell-off of US Treasury bonds has been only partial, with tariffs set at 10% universally, except for parts of trade with Mexico and Canada. Washington’s all-out trade spat with China, meanwhile, still leaves the average effective tariff rate at 27%, the highest since 1903, according to theYale Budget Lab. Amid the chaos, significant long-term damage has been done not only to Trump’s political credibility but also to the resilience of globalisation as a system. Trust, agreed rules and a degree of political stability are the underpinnings of globalisation. They are the prerequisite for specialised and highly extended trade supply lines across political borders to function.Globalisation, after all, is not just about the trade in goods or free markets, it is a set of interconnected ideas and institutions underpinning wealth creation that has dominated political thinking since the end of the second world war. The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, was not alone in arguing that Trump’s liberation day and its aftermath marked the end of an era. In a warning that holds true even after Trump’s retreat, Mark Carney, the Canadian prime minister and a former governor of the Bank of England, said: “The global economy is fundamentally different today than it was yesterday. The system of global trade anchored on the United States that Canada has relied on since the end of second world war, a system that while not perfect helped deliver prosperity for Canada for decades, is over. “The 80-year period when the US embraced the mantle of global economic leadership, when it forged alliances rooted in trust and mutual respect and championed the free exchange of goods and services, is over. While this is a tragedy, it is also the new reality.” In short, this is not a phase, however the trade war withChinais resolved. The legacy of liberation day will linger for generations. Paul Krugman, the Nobel prize-winning economist, largely agreed that the US was committing an act of abdication. “The rules governing tariffs and the negotiating process that brought those tariffs down over time grew out of theReciprocal Trade Agreements Act, devised by Roosevelt in 1934 … It was, in fact, one of America’s greatest policy achievements. Donald Trump burned it all down,” hewrote. When the man elected to lead the country that invented globalisation places the rejection of globalism at his ideological core, even if it means alienating the US’s closest allies, a fundamental reordering is under way. A key difficulty is that Trump, 78, has shown no sign of wanting to learn from this debacle. As far back as September 1987 he spent $95,000 to publish an “open letter to the American people” in three newspapers. “For years, Japan and other wealthy nations have been taking advantage of the US,” he wrote. “It is time to end our vast deficits by making Japan, and others who can afford it, pay.” While his target may have shifted from Japan to China, Trump’s sense of resentment and betrayal, coupled with an aversion to trade deficits, has never left him. His election in 2016, alongside Brexit, merely confirmed to him how his message resonated. In fairness to Trump, analysis showed that US voting districts with industries vulnerable to Chinese imports tended to elect representatives with more polarised stances. The vote gave him a mandate to end what he described as the US carnage of “rusted-out factories, scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation”. Many in theDavos establishmentacknowledged that he had seen something they had not – globalism had left too many behind, not just in poor countries but among a previously middle-class group in western economies. Trump’s first term would probably have seen a version of this week’s debacle if he had chosen different advisers, and if he had not later been knocked off course by Covid. For the first two years of his first term, in 2017-18, his instincts were largely kept in check by his economic adviser Gary Cohn, a former chief operating officer at Goldman Sachs, who dampened Trump’s determination to use tariffs to end trade deficits. Cohn engaged in a two-year running argument, compiling a mass of statistics designed to convince a sceptical Trump that the decline of US manufacturing and its replacement by a service economy was largely benign. He set out how blanket tariffs rebound on American consumers. He explained the link between consumer uncertainty and the stock market. He challenged Trump to explain why he thought tariffs would not be counterproductive. Trump replied that he did not know, but he just did and it was what he had thought for 30 years. At one point, exasperated, Cohn accused Trump of a dangerous nostalgia, saying: “You have a Norman Rockwell view of America” – the artist remembered for hisidealised portrait of American workers. In the end, Cohn found Trump – who once scrawled “trade is bad” as the summation of his thinking for a keynote speech – so immune to evidence, and so determined to impose steel and aluminium tariffs,that he quit, leaving Peter Navarro, a man Cohn regarded as a tariffflat earther, to take the reins. Vestiges of opposition to Trump’s tactics remained inside the Republican party. Ben Sasse, a Nebraska senator, tweeted a now familiar criticism in 2018: “About those new tariffs: Europe, Canada & Mexico aren’t China. You don’t treat allies the same way you treat opponents. Blanket protectionism is a big part of why we had a Great Depression. ‘Make America Great Again’ shouldn’t mean ‘Make America 1929 Again’.” But Trump largely ignored the critics inside his own party. Re-elected in 2024, with Navarro and other tariff supporters reappointed to lead his trade team, Trump was convinced that his key mistake in the first term had been taking any notice of those advising him that globalisation had brought the US unparalleled wealth. The path was clear for Trump’s headlong assault on tariffs, in part because in the four years out of office the anti-globalist tide had appeared to be heading in his direction. Many on the centre left bought the argument that hyperglobalisation did not suit an era of geopolitical conflict. The Biden administration, for instance, in the name of reindustrialisation and national security, retained many Trump-era tariffs, especially on China, a decision seen as a mistake by a study published this week by Harvard Kennedy School. In the study, Joe Biden’s economic advisers Adam Posen and Jonas Nahm argued that the protectionism was excessive. Since the 2007-08 financial crisis, there has been a steady increase in trade-restricting measures – such as tariffs, non-tariff measures, export controls and investment restrictions – contributing to growing trade fragmentation. In 2024 alone, more than 3,000 trade restrictions were implemented globally. Some arose from legitimate concern about unfair competition, but much was being driven by deepening geopolitical competition. Countries of all politics have resorted to ever-expanding definitions of national security to screen foreign investment and trade. New language has entered the vocabulary such as “friend or near-shoring”, a term to encourage companies to align their supply chains with the geopolitical interests of their countries. The call for resilient supply chains was given a spur by the vulnerabilities exposed by Covid, including the west’s dependence on asmall number of vaccine suppliers. After the invasion of Ukraine, Russia further exposed the west’s supply chain vulnerability byexploiting Europe’s dependence on its gas pipelines. Interconnectors designed to bring countries closer, such as undersea data cables,have become targets– from the Baltic Sea to the Taiwan Strait. The war also blew apart the myth that trade brought peace. As a result, investment screening measures were introduced by governments all over the west empowering them to block takeovers and investments by foreign firms, mainly Chinese in strategic industries. Rachel Reeves endorsed the trend in a speech in Washington as the UK’s shadow chancellor in May 2023. “Globalisation as we know it is dead. Supply chains that prioritise only what is cheapest and fastest struggle when a crisis strikes, be that PPE during Covid or energy following the war in Ukraine.” In a diagnosis similar to Trump’s, Reeves claimed that a globalised system “can be gamed by countries like China who have undercut and ignored the international trading rules and made it impossible for our own to compete”. Rajan Raghuram, the former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund and ex-governor of India’s central bank, has argued that friend-shoring is “resurgent protectionism, cloaked and augmented by new geopolitical rivalries”. He also criticised the initiative as “concentrating production within the gated community of advanced communities”. Even so, trade as a proportion of GDP – the best measure of economic openness – has not as yet collapsed. In its 2023 report titled Re-globalisation, the World Trade Organization (WTO) said there had been a slowdown in world trade after the financial crash and Covid, but the change may as much be to do with the growth of services, as opposed to goods, in the world economy. Countervailing trends such as digital trade have kept globalisation alive. The issue now is what can be preserved from the wreckage of the past week, and whether a new coalition of the willing – this time of free traders – can be assembled, if necessary. There is talk of a G6 – the G7 minus the US – going to China to see if an agreement can be found to reduce its trade imbalances, and distorting subsidies, a subject of complaint to the WTO not just by the west but by emerging markets. But this will require the UK’s Labour party to stop briefing that globalisation has failed. In the current context there is no room for nuance, and it risks sounding as if Labour shares Trump’s utterly chaotic prescription. This is the time to declare economic populism, and not free trade, dead.",

    "title": "Rightwing lobby group Advance says it makes ‘no apology’ for support given to anti-Greens groups",
    "article_text": "The rightwing advocacy group Advance has acknowledged it is paying for election materials attacking the Greens to be used by third-party groups during the election campaign. “Advance is working with hundreds of volunteers from dozens of community groups to defeat Greens candidates and we make no apology,” a spokesperson said. The spokesperson said Advance did not fund groups directly but “we absolutely pay for anti-Greens campaign material to be at the disposal of volunteers”. “This includes 2m flyers and thousands of T-shirts and corflutes. “Again, we make no apologies.” The group’s plan to focus its election campaign onreducing the Greens votehas been no secret. Advance’s executive director, Matthew Sheahan, claimed in a February email to supporters it had already raised $7.6m to “smash the Greens” and about $2m to target Labor. The group has spent more than $200,000 in the past week to promote posts from Facebook pages with names such as “Greens Truth”. But it has not previously talked publicly about the extent of its support for other groups hostile to the Greens, including those that take exception to the party’s position on the Israel-Gaza war or on renewable energy. The type of assistance Advance has on offer was revealed by two Jewish advocacy groups at a forum hosted by the Australian Jewish Association (AJA). Simonne Whine of J-United, which campaigned against the Greens in the recent Prahran byelection in Victoria, said her group had reached out to Advance to get its campaign started. “They were fantastic, efficient, strategic, well resourced,” she said. “They supplied the flyers, the T-shirts and the corflutes, and shipped everything to Melbourne, helping us hit the ground running.” Advance even paid for a picnic to thank volunteers, Whine said. During last year’s Queensland state election, the Queensland Jewish Collective (QJC) also focused on the Greens vote in Brisbane seats such as Maiwar and Moggill. One of the group’s directors, Roz Mendelle, told the AJA forum QJC had spoken with Advance after seeing its work during the campaign against the Indigenous voice to parliament. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter “When time came … to do something against the Greens here in Brisbane, I knew who to turn to,” Mendelle said, claiming that Advance kept “a healthy distance” while the campaign was under way. According to an event invitation seen by Guardian Australia, QJC held a volunteer event with Advance in February. Mendelle is a co-director of a new group, Minority Impact Coalition (MIC), which hasstarted a billboard campaignagainst Labor and the Greens in multiple states. During the AJA briefing, Mendelle showed an image of a billboard paid for by QJC that read: “The Greens: They’ve changed for the worse.” “This is also inspired by the Advance messaging,” she said. “But from there, we gained our footing, and we decided to just speak our truth.” MIC is using the same mobile billboard provider as Advance in Queensland, NSW and Victoria – STT Advertising. In return, Advance has also used content from groups such as J-United on social media, sharing pictures of its“local grassroots community members”on its Greens Truth Facebook page. The likely electoral impact of the anti-Greens strategy remains somewhat elusive. The Greens hold only four seats in the lower house, of whichthe three they won in Brisbane at the last election appear vulnerable. They have six senators up for re-election. By contrast, six new teal independent MPs were elected in 2022 – if they hold those seats or even increase their numbers, they might be expected to have a greater say in the event of a hung parliament. Sign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025 Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion “They’ve clearly worked out how to get conservative people fired up enough to throw money at them, and the way to do that is by attacking the Greens,” said Peter Lewis, the executive director of Essential, which is conducting qualitative research for the ALP. “But it’s not going to do anything to help the Liberals win back teal seats.” The Advance spokesperson said: “Our campaign against the Greens won’t defeat teals because it was never meant to. We have been crystal clear for the past 18 months that our focus is on the Greens this election.” Sheahan told an Australian Jewish Association forum in 2024: “Our goal is to just expose the Greens policies so that people don’t vote for them … A partial benefit will be that we think that will also reduce the teal vote.” His logic for that claim was unclear. Advance has also focused on the anti-renewables movement, appearing at “energy forums” across the country and events held by groups set up to oppose the roll-out of offshore wind and solar energy. As Guardian Australiahas previously documented, the Facebook account for Advance spokesperson Sandra Bourke is active in dozens of local Facebook groups and pages opposing renewable projects in places such as Lake Borumba and Mount Fox in Queensland, regularly sharing Advance content. Bourke is a regular speaker at these rallies and events – unusually for the outfit, which generally avoids a public-facing presence. Grant Piper is the former chair of the National Rational Energy Network (NRen), which brought together community groups opposed to renewable energy projects and hosted events includingthe Reckless Renewables rallyin Canberra last year. That’s where Piper first met Advance. “We didn’t tie any formal knots, but we could tell we were pushing after the same thing when it comes to renewables,” Piper said. NRen, which has rebranded as Let’s Rethink Renewables, has had discussions with Advance “all the way through”, he said, although it has remained independent. Bourke, one of NRen’s original members, is now Advance’s spokesperson and the face of its campaign against the Greens. According to Piper – who appeared in Advance’s anti-renewablesDollars & Destructionvideo series – the organisation is a natural ally for groups that feel they are mostly excluded from the conversation taking place in parliament and the media. “Advance is helping get publicity for the grassroots people who have been shut out of everything,” he said. Others who have teamed up for the Greens Truth campaign include groups that emerged from the anti-lockdown movement, the Freedom party and Reignite Democracy Australia – whichmakes clear to prospective volunteersthat their details will be shared with Advance. Another NRen member and former One Nation candidate,Katy McCallum, was the MC at a “Goodbye Greens Rally” in Brisbane in late March, where QJC also appeared. Along with other event backers such as the Libertarian candidate Jim Willmott, she thanked Bourke and Advance for their help at the event. “If our other good mate Sandra Bourke … from Advance hadn’t have jumped on, this would not be happening today,” she said.

    "title": "‘Ghost stores’: the online retailers promoting closing-down sales for physical shops that don’t exist",
    "article_text": "“With tears in our eyes, we must share the news with you,” the ads, which have been sponsored to appear on people’s social media feeds, begin. “After so many years of love and dedication to our Maison Canberra boutique, the time has come to say goodbye.” The world is changing, and the “boutique” can no longer keep up, the ad says. Its owners have become grandmothers, and want to spend more time with their families. To “close this chapter” they are holding a “big sale”. But there is no bricks-and-mortar Maison Canberra store. A domain search shows the website was only registered on 21 March. Two Maison Canberra Facebook pages were created on 23 March. Another, called Maison Canberra Boutique, was set up on 1 April. There is no ABN or registered company name on the website. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter Experts say Maison Canberra is an example of an online-only “ghost” store, claiming to be Australian despite having no local shopfront, telling a false story to entice customers into shopping their closing down sales. Ghost stores are online businesses that only exist in a digital sense and do not have a physical storefront. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission says the products are typically shipped from overseas warehouses. A spokesperson for the ACCC says it is investigating the issue after an increase in complaints about online retailers operating ghost stores. Guardian Australia has identified several other e-commerce sites which appear to be advertising as ghost stores: Cooper&Ellis, Molly-Smith, Julie Melbourne, and Syd Collective. They are running social media ads that tug on the heartstrings about “closing down” sales after many years in business – despite only being registered recently. The chief executive of the Consumer Policy Research Centre, Erin Turner, says that if these sites are making false claims then they could risk breaching Australian consumer law. “Companies cannot lie to their customers,” she says. “This includes lying about the location of their operations, fake closing-down sales or using images of fake owners to create a sense that the business is legitimate”. Turner says search engines and social media platforms should be doing more to confirm if the businesses advertising on their sites are legitimate. As for where the clothes come from? Maison Canberra is selling what it calls the “Andrine™ Casual Sweatshirt and Dress Set” for $79.95. It claims the original price was $269.95. A reverse image search shows you can buy what appears to be an identical item on the Chinese marketplace AliExpress for just $14.99. Prof Jeannie Paterson, the co-director of the University of Melbourne’s Centre for AI and Digital Ethics, says the fact that you can buy similar or identical clothing for cheaper elsewhere doesn’t mean the sites are engaging in misleading conduct. “The issue is that they’re saying they’re discounting it from a storefront, and there is no storefront, which means there is no real discount,” she says. “This is close to a scam.” Paterson says the sites should be subject to Australian consumer law because they are advertising on social media here, but it will be difficult to enforce any breaches if they are run from overseas. “The ACCC can, in theory, seek to find the company,” he says. “It’s just difficult because it’s unclear that you can even identify the real seller.” Paterson says social media platforms should take more responsibility for advertising on their platforms. The online retailer Molly-Smith claims to be a “family-run business” based in Sydney and owned by “Molly and Peter Smith” which has been a “well-known name in the local fashion scene since 2012”. The domain name was registered last year. “Over the years, we’ve faced unsold stock, financial difficulties, the impact of Covid, and even competitors copying our designs and leaving unfair reviews,” the website says. “Saying goodbye is never easy, but we hope you’ll understand and support our decision.” The exact same copy appears on the Facebook page of an apparently UK-based label called Taylor London, although that post is signed off from “Edward & Margaret Taylor”. The Cooper&Ellis website features an image of a couple standing smiling outside a Cooper&Ellis shopfront. The file name begins with “a-realistic-photo-of-an-australian-coupl_Ai”. The company claims to be a clothing label founded by two people called Cooper and Ellis “in the heart of Byron Bay”, a well-known tourist destination in the New South Wales northern rivers. But the store does not exist. After “16 wonderful years”, “Cooper and Ellis” are “retiring” and are offering an “exclusive 80% discount”, according to the site. But a domain search shows the website was only registered on 13 February. The Cooper&Ellis Facebook page wasn’t created until 20 February. The Byron Bay Chamber of Commerce president, Matt Williamson, believes Cooper&Ellis is the latest example of an e-commerce site capitalising on the beach town’s popularity by pretending to be a local brand. “We’re pretty pissed off, to be frank,” he says. “What it does is it undermines all of those local businesses who legitimately are here and employ local people and go to the expense of having a shopfront and do everything by the rules.” Williamson says the chamber had researched adifferent online store after fielding complaints from locals, which turned out to be a “Chinese-based company with absolutely no local representation”. “The articles of clothing looked really nice but when they arrived they weren’t even remotely close to what was online,” he says. “I imagine it’s very easy to replicate versions of the same thing.” Meta, which owns the Facebook and Instagram platforms where the sponsored ads appeared, said it was investigating the pages. The photographs purporting to be of real people outside physical shops on the online store “closing down sale” ads appear to be AI generated or manipulated with AI tools. If they are images of actual persons, the Guardian does not suggest they are aware their likeness is being used in this way. Maison Canberra, Cooper&Ellis, Molly-Smith, Julie Melbourne, Syd Collective and Taylor London have not responded to requests for comment.",

    "title": "Community groups furious Coalition nuclear plan would go ahead even if locals oppose it",
    "article_text": "There is a “growing backlash” to the Coalition’s nuclear plan, with community groups furious at the lack of consultation and angered that the policy would not give local communities the power of veto and that nuclear plants would be built regardless of local opposition. Opponents say pro-nuclear lobby group Nuclear for Australia has been hosting information sessions but that they make it overly difficult for people to attend, make it hard to ask questions, and are not able to answer those questions that are posed. Wendy Farmer, who has formed an alliance of the seven regions affected by the Coalition’s pledge to build nuclear reactors on the site of coal-fired power stations, says Australians should be “very angry” that they will not be able to veto any planned nuclear generators in their towns despite the Coalition’s promise to carry out a two-and-a-half-year consultation. She refuses to call the policy a “plan” because of that lack of consultation. “They haven’t even looked at these sites,” she said. Dave Sweeney, the Australian Conservation Foundation’s nuclear free campaigner, says it is “more con than consultation”. And he says in his many years in nuclear free campaigns he has never seen so many sectors – including unions, state leaders, energy producers, businesses and protest groups – aligned against nuclear. The Coalition has pinpointed Tarong and Callide in Queensland, Liddell and Mount Piper in NSW, Loy Yang in Victoria, and small modular reactors (SMRs) in Port Augusta in South Australia and Muja, near Collie in Western Australia. It says the $331bn nuclear plan will make electricity cheaper, while critics have called its costings a “fantasy”. TheLiberal partydid not respond to questions about the lack of consultation and lack of veto power. The alliance said there “has been no consultation or free prior and informed consent from traditional custodians”. “You never asked locals if they want nuclear reactors in their back yards, instead you threaten compulsory acquisition and federal overrides with no right to veto,” it saidin a petition to the Coalition. It said the plan was a “distraction” designed to “create false debate” when communities are already transitioning away from fossil fuels to renewable energy. Collie resident Jayla Parkin, a community organiser for Climate Justice Union, said pro-nuclear information sessions had not provided any answers and had tried to stop First Nations people from entering. Nuclear for Australia has held two information sessions with “expert speakers” in the town. One elder was “devastated” after initially being refused entrance to a meeting last year, Parkin said. “She wanted to get the information,” Parkin said. “Not everyone is simply for nuclear or against. We are for being informed on what’s going to happen.” At a January meeting, elders were told they couldn’t go in because of something wrong with their registrations, which Parkin then sorted out. Once inside, she said questions had to be submitted via an app. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter “Not a single question could be answered … like ‘where is the water coming from?’, ‘how will this benefit Collie?’, and ‘where are you going to store the radioactive waste?’,” she said. Since then, the community had heard nothing, she said. Nuclear for Australia, founded by Will Shackel and boasting entrepreneur Dick Smith as a patron, describes itself as a grassroots organisation with no political affiliation. Information sessions have featured Grace Stanke, a nuclear fuels engineer and former Miss America who says being called “Barbenheimer” was one of her favourite compliments. Shackel told SBS that Nuclear for AustraliaGoogle peoplewhen they try to register for the sessions. “If we believe that someone is a known protester … someone who could cause a physical threat to people in there, we will not allow them in,” he said. Farmer, also the president of Voices of the Valley, said Nuclear for Australia was “silencing people” by only allowing questions through an app and filtering them. Sign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025 Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Nuclear for Australia has also taken out ads in local newspapers claiming 77% of coal jobs are transferable to nuclear plants and that nuclear workers are paid 50% more than other power generation-related jobs. The fine print shows those claims come from a US nuclear industry lobby organisation and refer to the situation in the US. Farmer said that, “adding insult to injury”, the advertisements misspell Latrobe Valley as La Trobe Valley, and in one case, an ad aimed at Latrobe was put in an SA newspaper. “Regional communities are desperate for jobs now,” Farmer said. “Nuclear is not the answer.” Protesters heckled the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, for not meeting with the community when he visited Collie in October last year. “Collie doesn’t like it when people like that come to our town and hide,” Parkin said. “People have questions … at least openly answer them.” In Perth last week, Dutton was asked about criticism from Collie residents that he hadn’t heard their concerns about nuclear power and whether he would commit to visiting Collie during the election campaign. “I’ve been to Collie before,” he said. “There are seven locations around the country, and I won’t be able to get to all of them.” Those communities know the Coalition is offering them “the ability to transform”, he said. Greg Bannon is from the Flinders Local Action Group (Flag), which was formed to oppose plans tobuild a nuclear waste dumpin SA. He said the community had not heard much apart from a February information session held by Nuclear for Australia. He said there were concerns about the safety of any power plant and the impact on the local environment. “Port Augusta … is probably the most stupid place to put a nuclear power station in the world,” he said, pointing to the unique nature of Spencer Gulf and its very flat“dodge” tides. “Any leakage … the water would end up in the top end of the gulf, with only one place to go, through Port Lincoln, the fish nurseries, the mangroves … only 50km further south is Point Lowly near Whyalla, where the annual migration of thesouthern giant cuttlefishoccurs, which is a unique event in the world,” he said. The other point, Bannon said, was that the region had already transitioned away from baseload power to renewables. Guardian Australia has approached the Coalition and Nuclear for Australia for a response. Tom Venning was preselected to replace retiring MP Rowan Ramsey in Grey, the federal electorate that Port Augusta sits within. He said he supported the policy as part of a “credible path to net zero” and that if the Coalition formed government there would be a two-and-a-half-year community consultation and an independent feasibility study. “I’m committed to keeping my community fully informed and involved,” he said, adding that he would take any concerns seriously and would work with local leaders and the energy minister to address them. Sweeney said the Coalition already appeared to be backing away from its commitment to nuclear and appeared reluctant to bring it up. On Friday, Dutton said people would flock to nuclear if they subsidised it but that they could “subsidise all sorts of energies”. “I don’t carry a candle for nuclear or any other technology,” he said. “There is a growing backlash,” Farmer said. “We are keeping it as a hot topic – because the Coalition doesn’t want to talk about nuclear, we will.”",

    "title": "Torrie Lewis and Rohan Browning edge out rising stars in dramatic 100m finals",
    "article_text": "Rohan Browning and Torrie Lewis upstaged the flashy upstarts of Australian sprinting, claiming their respective 100m national titles in two split-second victories in Perth on Saturday. The women’s final was decided by a three-way photo-finish between Lewis, Bree Rizzo and Leah O’Brien. The national record-holder stopped the clock at 11.24s, edging 17-year-old O’Brien by just four thousandths of a second, with Rizzo one hundredth of a second back. Browning beat Lachie Kennedy in the men’s race by five thousandths of a second. Both were given a time of 10.01s, equalling Browning’s personal best from four years ago. It was a dramatic return to the summit of Australian sprinting by the 27-year-old. His emerging rivals, 21-year-old Kennedy and 17-year-old Gout Gout – who chose to run the under-20 100m category in Perth rather than opens – have dominated the limelight as they near a legal sub-10 second performance. Browning joked afterwards that his victory was “all about experience” and he wanted to remind the others “who their dad is”, but also reflected on his recovery from a knee injury that has hampered him since his 10.01s at the Tokyo Olympics. “I knew not to get sucked into running Lachie’s race, because he’s going to get out well. I just had to focus on myself, and there might have only been a handful of people in the stadium tonight to believe that was possible, but you only need to believe in yourself,” he said, taking the opportunity to address doubts over his future that had rippled around the athletics community. “There’s a lot of short memories in this sport, but I really couldn’t believe how many people came out of the woodwork to knock me last year, off the back of a really tough year,” Browning added. “But I’m fully healthy now, really confident in my knee and just really keen for the year ahead.” Kennedy was just one hundredth of a secondoutside his personal best, set in his heat, but paid credit to Browning who caught him at the line. “I missed my start a bit, my transition wasn’t as good as what I liked it – but credit to Rohan, he ran a great race, he put his PB. It just goes to show the amount of talent we’ve got here in the sport sport right now.” Lewis said her victory felt “amazing”, after she jumped into the air and performed a pirouette when the result was confirmed. A disappointing result in the 200m at the Maurie Plant meet two weeks ago – where she finished fifth – had given her cause for concern. “I’m so happy. After Maurie [Plant], I just did not want to run, like, ‘This is going to be horrible,’” she said. “But I’m just really glad I was able to find something.” Rizzo dipped at the line but tumbled, leaving her shoulder grazed, and was edged out by O’Brien who has emerged as one of the stars of the meet. The teenager admitted afterwards she felt nervous before the race. “I’m so grateful to be here, because last year I came eighth in the final, or ninth actually, so to improve by that much is just insane,” she said. Sign up toAustralia Sport Get a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports desk after newsletter promotion The Paris silver medallist Jess Hull held off Sarah Billings to win the 1500m, despite facing doubts through a race that lacked pace in the early stages. “I was like, ‘No, I just got to back my speed.’ My speed is better than I think it is, and I just had to hold my nerve out there,” Hull said afterwards. Eighteen-year-old Cameron Myers held off Adam Spencer and Olli Hoare in the men’s event, with all three finishing within a second of each other. “I got to 500 to go, and I didn’t quite have the gap that I knew I probably needed to have,” Myers said. “Dick [Telford], my coach, said I’ve got to have a gap on the field by about two, three meters with 300 to go, because these guys can kick pretty hard. I knew I didn’t have that, but I was able to hold on.” Ellie Beer and Cooper Sherman won the 400m titles, and Olivia Gross claimed the women’s pole vault in the absence of the Paris gold medallist Nina Kennedy, who missed the meet due to hamstring surgery. The Australian athletics championships wrap up tomorrow with a busy daytime program including the 200m event, featuring Gout.",

    "title": "Voters want Keir Starmer to focus on rebuilding trade ties with EU, poll reveals",
    "article_text": "A clear majority of UK voters want the government to concentrate on rebuilding trade ties with the EU over forging a new economic deal with the US, according to research published this weekend. The study, based on analy­sis of polling that used new methods of questioning participants, suggests people of voting age now see their economic interests, and the UK’s, as far more closely linked to open trade relations with our EU neighbours than any deals that Keir Starmer might or might not strike with the US. The analysis shows how far the UK public has turned back in favour of the EU since the Brexit referendum, and it indicates the trend could be strengthened as a result of the economic turmoil unleashed by US president Donald Trump’s tariff announcements and resulting global financial panic over recent days. Commissioned by the internationalist thinktank Best for Britain, the research found that 53% of voters now believe a closer relationship with the EU will have a positive effect on the UK economy, against just 13% who said the effect would be negative. In turn, 68% believed better relations with the EU would boost UK/EU trade in a clearly positive way. Asked what they believed Keir Starmer’s priorities should be for a UK-EU summit in May, at which the prime minister and EU leaders will discuss moves to increase post-Brexit cooperation, the most popular answer was “trade between the UK and the EU”, which came out narrowly ahead of “illegal immigration across the channel” and, in third place, “improving the UK’s and EU’s defence and security”. Even among people who said they would consider voting for Reform UK at the next election, half (48%) said closer EU ties would have a positive impact on trade, with the same number saying it would make travel for Britons easier acrossEurope. This compares with one in 10 (11%) potential Reform voters who said it would have a negative impact on either. When voters were given 20 options and asked to choose four that the government should focus on improving, “the UK’s ability to sign new trade deals with the USA” came 17th. The cost of living came top, followed by immigration and asylum, the UK economy and economic growth, energy costs, UK defence, and trade between the UK and was EU in sixth place. The study also found that a majority (62%) understand that the government is seeking a closer relationship with the EU. Far more people also thought the government was not going far enough to rebuild ties (35%) than those who thought the current approach was correct (15%). Among Labour’s winning coalition at the last election, a clear majority believed the government was not going far enough (54%). A sample of 4,703 people responded to YouGov between 31 March and 2 April, just as Trump was beginning to unveil his tariff plans, which have panicked the global final financial markets and opened the prospect of a bitter and prolonged trade war between the world’s two biggest economies, the US and China. Last week, Trump was forced by the meltdown on the financial markets to announce a 90-day pause in the introduction of his higher “reciprocal” tariffs imposed on dozens of countries – with the notable exception of China. Keir Starmer’s public line is that he still hopes to gain an exemption from the 10% base tariffs imposed on the UK by signing a wider UK/US economic deal in the coming weeks. Recentindependent economic analysisby Frontier Economics found that even in the face of Trump’s trade war, acommonsense dealwith the EU that included deeper alignment on goods and services would secure economic growth of up to 1.5% to UK GDP, offsetting the impact of US tariffs completely for the UK and by a third for the EU. Naomi Smith, chief executive of Best for Britain, said: “Voters expect the prime minister to come away with more than just a defence pact when he hosts EU leaders in May and want him to prioritise removing trade barriers in the interests of bringing costs down and getting growth. They want trade before defence, trade before Channel crossings, and definitely trade with the EU before trade with Donald Trump.” Much of the analysis was based on the “Max-Diff” method, which is regarded as suitable when a range of options need to be put to respondents in order to gain a full and meaningful set of responses. Under this methodology, priorities are scored by asking people to choose their top three preferred options and their bottom three to provide a representative result. Peter Norris, chair of Virgin Group said: “As the last week has so painfully demonstrated, Trump is bad for business, consumers and savers. He has wreaked havoc in international markets and left us all on the precipice of a global recession that would mean real pain for people in the UK. “It is of the utmost urgency that our UK government work with our reliable partners in the EU to remove the artificial trade barriers between us so that both British and European businesses are in the best position to succeed in these extremely challenging conditions and so shield consumers from the worst effects.” Former British ambassador to the US Kim (now Lord) Darroch said: “Under the current administration at least, the US has shown little interest in doing favours for anyone, friend or foe. “The global order which has been in place for almost 80 years is changing by the hour and it makes sense for the UK to find stability through deeper cooperation with our allies in Europe while maintaining good relations with Washington.”",

    "title": "US ‘demands control’ from Ukraine of key pipeline carrying Russian gas",
    "article_text": "The US has demanded control of a crucial pipeline inUkraineused to send Russian gas to Europe, according to reports, in a move described as a colonial shakedown. US and Ukrainian officials met on Friday to discuss White House proposals fora minerals deal. Donald Trump wants Kyiv to hand over its natural resources as “payback” in return for weapons delivered by the previous Biden administration. Talks have become increasingly acrimonious, Reuters said. The latest US draft is more “maximalist” than the original version from February,which proposed giving Washington $500bn worthof rare metals, as well as oil and gas. Citing a source close to the talks, the news agency said the most recent document includes a demand that the US government’s International Development Finance Corporation take control of the natural gas pipeline. It runs from the town of Sudzha in westernRussiato the Ukrainian city of Uzhhorod, about 750 miles (1,200km) away, on the border with the EU and Slovakia. Built in Soviet times, the pipeline is a key piece of national infrastructure and a major energy route. On 1 January, Ukrainecut off the supply of gaswhen its five-year contract with the Russian state energy company Gazprom expired. Both countries had previously earned hundreds of millions of euros in transit fees, including during the first three years of full-scale war. Volodymyr Landa, a senior economist with the Centre for Economic Strategy, a Kyiv thinktank, said the Americans were out for “all they can get”. Theirbullying “colonial-type” demandshad little chance of being accepted by Kyiv, he predicted. Last autumn, Volodymyr Zelenskyy proposed giving the US access to Ukraine’s underdeveloped mineral sector. He envisaged a deal that would see the incoming Trump administration supply Ukraine with weapons, in return for future profits from joint investments. Instead, Trump has refused to give security commitments or military support but wants the minerals anyway. Last week he complained Zelenskyy was trying to “back out of an agreement” and said Ukraine’s president would have “big problems” if he failed to sign. Speaking to journalists on Thursday, Zelenskyy said he was ready to do a deal to modernise his country but that Ukraine could only agree if there was “parity” between the two sides, with revenues split “50-50”. “I am just defending what belongs to Ukraine. It should be beneficial for both the United States and Ukraine. This is the right thing to do,” Zelenskyy said. The US Treasury confirmed “technical” talks were ongoing. Meanwhile, the US special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said hisremarks over a possible partition of Ukrainehad been misinterpreted. In an interview with the Times, Kellogg said the country could be divided “almost like the Berlin after world war two” as part of a peace deal. Writing on X, Kellogg said he was referring to “a post-cease fire resiliency force in support of Ukraine’s sovereignty”. Under this plan, Russian troops would remain in territory already seized by Moscow, with British and French forces stationed in Kyiv and in other parts of the country. On Friday, Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff held talks with Vladimir Putin in St Petersburg. Witkoff’s reported solution to the conflict was to give Russia the four Ukrainian provinces it is demanding – including territory that Ukraine controls, and which is home to 1 million people. Meanwhile, at a meeting of the Ukraine defence contact group on Friday, Kyiv’s alliesannounced a record €21bn (£18.2bn) in additional militaryhelp. They accused Putin of dragging his feet over a 30-day ceasefire deal which Ukraine has accepted. Early on Saturday, Russia carried out further air attacks against Ukrainian civilian targets.Three warehouses were destroyed in Kyiv, with two people injured. The Kremlin has fired 70 missiles and 2,200 drones at Ukraine since the 11 March US ceasefire proposal, Ukrainian officials said. Zelenskyypaid tributeon Saturday to a 26-year-old pilot, captain Pavlo Ivanov, who was killed during an F-16 combat mission. Ukraine’s small air force “heroically” defends the country from Russian missiles and drones, and supported ground operations, he said.",

    "title": "Travellers arriving in Great Britain face import ban on EU meat and dairy",
    "article_text": "Tourists from Great Britain who travel to the continent to satisfy their epicurean desires for cured meats and fragrant cheeses will be frustrated in their attempts to bring home some of their favourite foods after a ban on meat and dairy imports from EU countries came into force this weekend. From Saturday, holidaymakers will no longer be able to bring meat from cattle, sheep, goats or pigs, or dairy products, from EU countries into Great Britain for personal use, in a move aimed at preventing the spread of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) after a rise in cases acrossEurope. Even those attempting to bring sandwiches with offending items such as cheese and ham will be stopped by customs and excise. Cured meats, raw meats and milk are off limits regardless of whether they are packed, packaged or have been bought at duty-free. FMD does not directly affect humans, but it can be devastating to cattle, and while there are no cases in the UK at present, the government wants to keep it that way. FMD is a highly contagious viral disease that affects cattle, sheep, pigs, and other cloven-hoofed animals such as wild boars and deer. In a statement, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said the outbreak in Europe “presents a significant risk to farm businesses and livestock”. The disease can cause “significant economic losses due to production shortfalls in the affected animals, as well as loss of access to foreign markets for animals, meat and dairy”, it added. Earlier this year, the government placedbans on imports of cattle, sheep, other ruminants, pig meat and dairy products from Germany, Hungary, Slovakia and Austriain response to outbreaks of FMD in those countries. The new restrictions apply only to travellers arriving in Great Britain and will not be imposed on personal imports arriving in Northern Ireland, Jersey, Guernsey or the Isle of Man. The minister for food security and rural affairs, Daniel Zeichner, said: “This government will do whatever it takes to protect British farmers from foot-and-mouth. That is why we are further strengthening protections by introducing restrictions on personal meat and dairy imports to prevent the spread of the disease and protect Britain’s food security.” The UK deputy chief veterinary officer for international and trade affairs, Jorge Martin-Almagro, said: “Robust contingency plans are already in place to manage the risk of this disease to protect farmers and Britain’s food security. This biosecurity measure, combined with all others we have implemented, are critical to limit the risk of FMD incursion.” Martin-Almagro urged livestock keepers to keep an eye out for signs of disease, maintain biosecurity, and immediately report any suspicion of disease to the Animal and Plant Health Agency. There are exemptions from the new rules, including a limited amount of infant milk, medical foods, and certain composite products such as chocolate, confectionery, bread, cakes, biscuits and pasta. The government said: “Those found with these items will need to either surrender them at the border or will have them seized and destroyed. In serious cases, those found with these items run the risk of incurring fines of up to £5,000 inEngland.”",

    "title": "Greek vase ‘looted’ in Italy removed from sale by London gallery",
    "article_text": "A London antiquities dealer has withdrawn an ancient Greek amphora from sale after evidence arose that links it to a notorious smuggler. The Kallos Gallery in Mayfair, London, has removed a black-figure amphora – a jar with two handles and a narrow neck made around 550BC – from sale after theObservercontacted it about concerns raised by an expert in the illegal trade of antiquities. Dr Christos Tsirogiannis, an archaeologist and leading expert in looted antiquities and trafficking networks, found evidence that led him to conclude the amphora probably came from an illicit excavation inItaly. He spotted the amphora when the gallery offered it last month at Tefaf Maastricht, one of the world’s foremost art and antiques fairs, and matched it to a Polaroid photograph that appears to show the same object in the hands of Giacomo Medici, who was convicted in Italy in 2004 of dealing instolen artefacts. That photograph was part of an archive seized from him by police and was on the website of the Italian Carabinieri. The Dutch police have been notified. The object’s value is believed to be about £50,000. The Kallos Gallery, which specialises in ancient art, was founded in 2014 by Baron Lorne Thyssen-Bornemisza, son of the lateBaron Hans Heinrich von Thyssen Bornemisza, the Swiss billionaire who built up what was regarded as the greatest art collection in private hands in the world. Measuring 23.6cm in height, the amphora is decorated with sphinxes, a ram and a lion. It is attributed to the artist known only as the Phineus Painter, named after a cup he decorated with the myth of Phineus, the blind king plagued by harpies and saved byJason and the Argonauts. The collecting history given by the gallery online only dated back to 1986. This raised Tsirogiannis’s suspicions that the jar could have been part of an illicit excavation, he said: “These are immediate red flags.” He added that the provenance details included a gallery that had belonged to a dealer who was himself convicted for receiving stolen antiquities from Italy in the 1970s. Tsirogiannis, an affiliated archaeology lecturer at the University of Cambridge, heads illicit antiquities trafficking research for the Unesco chair on threats to cultural heritage at the Ionian University in Corfu. The late Paolo Giorgio Ferri, the Italian public prosecutor who pursued and prosecuted traffickers in looted antiquities, gave Tsirogiannis access to tens of thousands of images and other archival material seized in police raids from traffickers and other individuals involved in the illicit trade. Over 19 years, Tsirogiannis has identified more than 1,700 looted antiquities, alerting police and playing a role in their repatriation to 15 countries. The finds include an ancient Greek bronze horse that Sotheby’s New York intended to auction in 2018 until Tsirogiannis notified the authorities of its links to theBritish antiquities dealer Robin Symes. Greece claimed the horse as its national property, and in 2020 Sotheby’s lost its legal challenge, prompting the Greek culture minister to welcome the court’s ruling as a victory for countries seeking to reclaim their antiquities. Last year,Christie’s withdrew ancient Greek vasesfrom auction after Tsirogiannis discovered their link to another convicted antiquities trafficker. He criticised the auctioneer’s failure to reveal that the objects could be traced to Gianfranco Becchina, who was convicted in 2011 of illegally dealing in antiquities. Christie’s said at the time that it withdrew the works once it was made aware of the connection. Tsirogiannis has identified many other Medici objects, which have been repatriated to Italy over the years. “Medici was receiving objects looted from tombs in Italy,” he said, adding that he believes the amphora came from Etruscan tombs in Italy. He has repeatedly argued that auction houses and dealers do not make adequate checks with Greek and Italian authorities, and has criticised their failure to disclose objects’ full collecting history. Madeleine Perridge, director of the Kallos Gallery, said: “We make every effort to do our due diligence and publish all collection and publication history known to us … The artwork in question has been immediately removed from sale pending advice from the relevant authorities. We have absolutely no interest in handling tainted artworks and welcome an opportunity to find practical and productive solutions to these complex issues.”",

    "title": "‘Fika has become more expensive’: rising coffee prices affect a Swedish tradition",
    "article_text": "Nursing an iced chai latte in a Stockholm department store, Emma Tomth says she has cut down her cafe coffee consumption considerably. The 28-year-old social media manager used to buy a latte most days, but with prices having gone up by about 15-20 kronor (about £1-£1.50), she has cut down to two or three times a week. But it is not just about coffee. The economy also extends tofika– the historically hardwiredSwedish traditionof meeting for a catch-up over a coffee and a biscuit or cake. “Many I know are abstaining from meeting forfikato save money. So we do something else instead,” Tomth says. Low-cost alternatives include meeting at home or going on walks, but it is not quite the same asfika, which plays a key social role in an otherwise often introverted society. “To take afikawith somebody is such a simple and short meeting, but even so, it’s so big because you go through what has happened since you last saw them, what’s important, or just sit down with someone you like,” says Tomth. Coffee shortages area global issue, caused by a combination of poor harvests as a result of the climate crisis and extreme weather, increased demand and rising transport costs. But the problems – the price of unroasted coffee beans has risen by over 100% in the last six months – are having a very specific impact infika-loving Sweden. Amid significant price rises – the cost of a packet of coffee has breached the 100 kronor mark in some shops for a 500g packet – and another increase to come, some Swedes are stockpiling coffee before it goes up again, resulting in empty supermarket shelves. Ulf Mazur, the chief executive of Matpriskollen Sverige (Food Price Survey Sweden), says on Monday there will be the “largest price increase ever in coffee prices at once”. Although some stores may wait until after Easter to put prices up, he expects prices to rise by up to 25 kronor a packet – as much as 40%. Already sales of ground coffee or coffee beans for use at home have decreased in recent years amid food inflation and changing habits. With many workplaces offering free coffee to their employees, people may be increasing their coffee intake at work, where sitting down forfikawith colleagues alsoplays a central role. “Coffee is sacred in Sweden, but coffee consumption has declined quite significantly in recent years in volume,” Mazur says. “People now brew less coffee at home, they reduce waste by being more careful with the dosage, and many probably drink more coffee at work, where it is free. This reduces home consumption.” But the ethnologist Richard Tellström, an associate professor in food and meal science at Stockholm University, is not concerned about the survival of Swedishfikaculture. “Both coffee and fika culture are a central part of how Swedes develop both personal and work relationships, so the cost of coffee is a high priority. If you visit somebody you will always be offered coffee and to decline a cup of coffee can be impolite,” he says. While individual coffee consumption at chain coffee shops could go down, he believes people will not cut down on “coffee drinking that creates social relationships”. Sign up toThis is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion But, he says, coffee culture is changing among younger generations, who are instead drinking energy drinks and other soft drinks. “Drinking coffee is also not – as it used to be – a symbol of having become an adult,” he adds. Sitting in the coffee shop of Kulturhuset, Stockholm’s culture house, one 21-year-old student says she has cut down how many times she goes out tofikaand study, saving her coffees out for “special occasions”. “I usually take tea with me to the library because it gets so expensive to buy coffee out,” she says. Long term, she thinksfikaculture could be under threat – particularly among younger people who may not be able to afford to hang out in coffee shops, instead opting for libraries and shopping malls. “Overallfikahas become more expensive. It’s very hard to get away from that,” she says.",

    "title": "Erdoğan lambasts Israel for undermining stability in Syria",
    "article_text": "The Turkish presidentRecep Tayyip Erdoğanhas lambasted Israel for undermining stability in neighbouring Syria during a diplomatic forum, days after the two countries held talks aimed at defusing an escalating conflict between them on Syrian soil. “Turkey will not allow Syria to be dragged into a new vortex of instability,” Erdoğan told attendees at the Antalya diplomacy forum on the southern Turkish coast, accusing Israel of “trying to undermine the 8 December revolution”, in reference to the insurgency thattoppled the former Syrian president Bashar al-Assadafter decades in power. “We are in close dialogue and in common understanding with all influential actors in the region, especially Mr Trump and Mr Putin, regarding the preservation of Syria’s territorial integrity and stability,” he added. Attendees at the forum included the Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov as well as Syrian president Ahmed al-Sharaa, who met Erdoğan on the sidelines of the conference in Antalya. The Turkish presidency said Erdoğan reiterated Ankara’s efforts to lift sanctions on Syria, and told Sharaa thatTurkey“welcomes the fact that those who want chaos in Syria to occur again are not given an opportunity”. Tensions betweenIsraeland Turkey have grown since Assad’s overthrow, peaking after Israeli forces pounded three military bases across Syria with airstrikes earlier this month. Reuters reported that Turkish military teams had scoped out the main airport in Hama province as well as the T4 and Palmyra air bases in Homs, assessing the runways, hangars and infrastructure to see if forces and military hardware could be deployed there as part of a planned joint defence pact between Ankara and Damascus. The defence minister Israel Katz called airstrikes “a clear message and warning for the future”. Israel has struck military sites in Syria hundreds of timessince Assad fled to Moscow four months ago, destroying military assets including missile systems and air defences that the transitional government in Damascus had hoped to inherit. Assad’s overthrow marked the end of over 50 years of dictatorial rule by his family, as well as a halt to a decade-long civil war that became a frozen proxy conflict. The former autocrat’s backers Russia and Iran faced off against forces supported by Ankara in northern Syria, and an American military presence in the east and south. After an insurgency spearheaded by Sharaa’s forces took power in Damascus, Ankara emerged as the most significant regional backer of Syria’s nascent transitional government. Turkish officials have established fast ties with Damascus, while negotiating a reported defence pact that could see Turkish forces using Syrian airspace and establishing bases on the ground. Israel meanwhile moved to expand its decades-old occupation of the Golan Heights into a designated buffer zone following Assad’s departure. “Assad had Russia as his protector in the second half of the Syrian civil war. If Turkey comes in and begins installing air defence systems or introducing jets into Syrian airspace, that limits Israel’s freedom of action significantly,” said Aron Lund, an analyst with the New York thinktank Century International. “For Turkey, the problem now is not just Israel objecting to their military presence but doing things that by design or default are weakening or preventing the emergence of a functioning government in Syria, such as saying the new Sharaa government can’t have forces south of Damascus,” he said. Israeli military forces infiltrated a remote town in the Daraa countryside south of Damascus earlier this month, with Syrian state media saying nine civilians were killed in shelling during the deepest Israeli incursion into Syria. Amid few signs that Israeli forces intend to leave the area around Mount Hermon, an Israeli tour company hasreportedlybegun offering twice-daily hiking tours of the area in cooperation with troops stationed there. Less than a week after Israel struck three airbases in Syria, the two sides held talks in Azerbaijan aimed at finding ways to defuse growing tensions in Syria. The office of the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said a delegation composed of top security and diplomatic officials met their Turkish counterparts, with the two sides agreeing “to continue on the path of dialogue in order to maintain regional stability.” The Turkish foreign minister Hakan Fidan told local broadcaster CNN Türk that “while we are conducting certain operations in Syria, there needs to be a deconfliction mechanism with Israel, which flies aircraft in that region, similar to mechanisms we have with the US and Russia.” Fidan added that technical teams from both sides are in contact “when needed”, in order “to prevent combat elements from misunderstanding each other”. Lund labelled the talks “a very positive thing”, given the risk of a clash between the two powers in Syria, amid regional conflict including Israel’s 18-month assault on Gaza. “They will be both be military involved in Syria, and this could spiral in a number of different ways. So some form of red lines or communication channels are essential to managing that tension, and this seems to be a step in that direction,” he said.",

    "title": "Iran and US agree to continue nuclear talks after first indirect round",
    "article_text": "Iran and the US completed a successful opening round of indirect talks inOmandesigned to prevent the weaponisation of Iran’s nuclear programme. In a sign the talks over a joint agenda had gone well, they agreed to meet again on 19 April. A breakdown would have come if Donald Trump had demanded the complete dismantling of Iran’s civil nuclear programme, something thatIranis not prepared to contemplate. Iran insists it is pursuing only a civil nuclear programme, but Donald Trump took the US out of the previous nuclear deal claiming Tehran’s regime was seeking a nuclear weapon. It appears he is resolved to pursue an updated version of the deal. The Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said the talks had been “constructive”, and held in a “calm and respectful environment” with “no sharp words exchanged”. “Both sides don’t want to talk for sake of talking and wasting time, and want to reach a deal as quickly as possible. Both sides showed commitment to take these talks forward until we reach a favourable deal,” he added. Oman’s foreign minister acted as the mediator in the talks in Muscat, shuttling between Araghchi and Trump’s diplomatic envoy Steve Witkoff. Witkoff has admitted he does not have technical expertise about civil nuclear disarmament programmes, but Trump implicitly trusts his judgment. Witkoff also said the discussions had been held in a positive and constructive atmosphere. It is likely the next set of talks will not be held in Muscat, but Oman will retain the role of shuttling between the two negotiating teams in separate rooms. It is understood that the two diplomats did have a brief exchange at the end of the process, but it was described as not a fully fledged negotiation. An Iranian condition for the talks wasthere would be no direct talks with the USwhile Iran is under US economic sanctions. But what was more important to the Iranian side was whether Witkoff would demand Iran stop uranium enrichment altogether and end its civil nuclear programme. There was also concern Trump might table demands that Iran stop backing militant groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas. Witkoff mapped out an agenda apparently similar to the intent behind the 2015 nuclear deal, but that will also have to address the fact that since 2018 Iran has amassed a large stockpile of uranium enriched to 60%, a purity greater than what is required for a civil nuclear programme. The next round of talks will have to agree how to dispense with this stockpile and how Iran will allow the reintroduction of an independent inspection regime. The UN nuclear weapon inspectorate, the IAEA, has seen its cameras switched off in Iran’s key nuclear sites on successive occasions, making it next to impossible to know what Iran is producing. Rafael Grossi, the IAEA director general, is due in Iran next week, but it is not clear whether he is yet working in tandem with the small and relatively inexperienced US negotiating team. Oman’s foreign minister, Badr al-Busaidi, said he was proud to have hosted the talks in Muscat and to have mediated. He said the goal was “a process of dialogue and negotiations with the shared aim of concluding a fair and binding agreement.” “I would like to thank my two colleagues for this engagement which took place in a friendly atmosphere conducive to bridging viewpoints and ultimately achieving regional and global peace, security and stability. We will continue to work together and put further efforts to assist in arriving at this goal,” he added. Sina Toossi, a senior fellow at the Center for International Policy, said “the outcome signals progress. A likely framework is likely now on the table, centred on no weaponisation and sanctions relief.” Toosi added: “Both sides were likely to sound positive today – even with talks focused on format and agenda – because they currently need the negotiations to continue.“But without real progress, this dynamic – sustainable in past talks – is unlikely to hold as long this time.” Ryan Costello, policy director with the National Iranian American Council, said the parties had cleared a low bar today. He said: “Now, it is important for both the US and Iran to insulate the apparent positive environment of negotiations from those who want to sabotage a move toward a deal. “Each side should exercise restraint. For the US, this could mean dialling back the military threats. President Trump will also have to make sure that Israel does not go behind the administration’s back and undertake provocative steps that could derail negotiations, including sabotage, as we saw in 2021. “For Iran, signalling more openness to direct negotiations and ceasing warnings of weaponisation options can help build momentum toward and put a breakthrough in reach.” With the Iranian economy in freefall, and Iranians suffering energy blackouts, the country’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, has always favoured talks with the US as the way to escape “the cage of sanctions”, but he has faced resistance from parliamentary hardliners and parts of the group around the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. On 7 February, Khamenei said experience showed it was “not rational, intelligent or honourable” to hold talks with Trump, a judgment that Pezeshkian said he had no option but to accept. But the Iranian foreign ministry – supportive of talks – persuaded Khamenei that his regime, already weakened by reverses in Syria, Lebanon and Gaza, might crumble unless he negotiated. Trump also threatened to give Israel the freedom to bomb Iran’s nuclear sites. To preserve Iran’s dignity, Khamenei insisted the initial talks at least be indirect, but there will be pressure from the US side to allow direct talks. The two countries broke off formal diplomatic relations after the 1979 Iranian revolution. Pezeshkian, in an effort to talk Trump’s transactional language, said this week: “His excellency [Khamenei] has no opposition to investment by American investors in Iran. American investors: come and invest.” Trump, too, has relented both in his rhetoric and possibly his demands, saying on Friday: “I’m not asking for much; they can’t have a nuclear weapon,” adding: “I want them to thrive. I want Iran to be a great, wonderful, happy country.” Trump and Witkoff also badly need a diplomatic breakthrough since their peace efforts in Gaza and Ukraine have so far been abject flops. A further war in the Middle East is fiercely resisted by the Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia. Netanyahu said this week that a deal would only work if Iran’s nuclear facilities were blown up, “under American supervision with American execution”. He also called for a “Libya-style agreement”, a reference to Muammar Gaddafi’s voluntary dismantlement of his nuclear programme under international supervision. But Iran senses that Netanyahu is losing influence with Trump over the nuclear file. Iran’s deputy foreign minister for political affairs, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, who is involved in parallel talks with European leaders, said: “If the American side does not raise irrelevant issues and demands and puts aside threats and intimidation, there is a good possibility of reaching an agreement. The Islamic republic of Iran believes in dialogue and interaction based on mutual respect, and any bullying and coercion is unacceptable in our view.” Araghchi, a veteran of the 2015 talks who holds a PhD in political thought from the University of Kent, is accompanied by a technical team. Iran, which has a reputation for being an exhaustive and exhausting negotiator, knows it is working against a deadline of two months, European officials say, because the UK, Germany and France must signal by the end of July whether they will reimpose punishing UN sanctions against Tehran. The option to reimpose those sanctions, which were lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal, will expire on 18 October.",

    "title": "IDF unit involved in Gaza paramedics’ killing was under command of brigade led by notorious Israeli general",
    "article_text": "The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) unit involved in the killings of15 Palestinian paramedics and rescue workersin the Gaza Strip last month was under the command of a brigade led by a notorious Israeli general previously accused by some of his own troops of having “contempt for human life”. The IDF has confirmed that troops from Golani, one of the army’s five infantry brigades, opened fire on two convoys of ambulances in Rafah on 23 March and dug a mass grave to cover the bodies of those killed until the corpses could be retrieved by a UN team six days later. It has disputed allegations from two witnesses who exhumed the bodies and newly releasedpostmortem resultsthat found several of those killed had close-range gunshot wounds to the head and chest and were discovered with their hands or legs tied. Field operatives from Unit 504, a military intelligence unit with a reputation forcruelty and reckless behaviour, including torture, were also present during the attack, a senior military intelligence source with knowledge of recent IDF deployments in southern Gaza told the Guardian. The Israeli military declined to comment on whether 504 was involved. During the Rafah attack, the Golani troops were under the command of the reservist Armoured 14th Brigade. The 14th Brigade is part of a division led by Brig Gen Yehuda Vach, who former officers say designated an unofficial “kill zone” elsewhere in the strip which resulted in the arbitrary killings of Palestinian civilians. Soldiers also alleged Vach’s “lack of operational discipline” endangered soldiers’ lives. Vach has also told troops “there are no innocents in Gaza”, according to an investigation by the Israeli daily Haaretz. In a video of Golani troops being briefed before their redeployment toGazaearlier this month, aired by Israel’s Channel 14, a battalion commander appeared to endorse an open-fire policy, telling the soldiers: “Anyone you encounter there is an enemy. You identify anyone, you eliminate him.” Golani soldiers have previously been accused of war crimes in the conflict, including killing civilians, degrading treatment of bodies, needless destruction of civilian infrastructure, and incitement to genocide. A song written by a member of the brigade’s 51st Battalion in the aftermath of the Hamas 7 October 2023 attack on Israel that ignited the war has become an unofficial anthem for many soldiers. The chorus’s lyrics include: “For what you did to the nation of Israel, Golani is coming with gasoline … Gaza will burn.” The accompanying music video features footage from Golani operations in Gaza in which the brigade’s yellow and green standard can clearly be seen. Many of the allegations against Golani troops were compiled from social media photo and video footage posted online by the soldiers themselves and cited in legal filings by theHind Rajab Foundation, a non-profit that aims to hold Israeli military personnel accountable for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza. Israeli officials say the two founders of the Belgium-based organisation have ahistory of extremist views. The presence of Unit 504 was also backed up by the account of the sole survivor of the massacre, the Red Crescent volunteer Munther Abed, and official photos and video of recent IDF operations in Rafah. The unit has conducted thousands of interrogations of captives from Gaza during the war, and differs from other Israeli military intelligence outfits in that the soldiers are combat troops, operating at a battalion level, who speak fluent Arabic. According to Abed, a 27-year-old ambulance service volunteer, troops he described as looking like “special forces … armed with rifles, green lasers, and night-vision goggles” dragged him out of the emergency vehicle after it was shot at continuously for five minutes, killing the driver and paramedic he was travelling with. The uniform description could match either Golani commandos or that of Unit 504 field operatives. Abed said he was then stripped to his underwear, with his hands bound behind his back, and threatened, suffocated and beaten during several hours of interrogation. Last week, the Israeli military backtracked on its account of the killings of the paramedics afterfootage emergedwhich contradicted its claims that the Red Crescent vehicles were not marked as emergency vehicles and were not using headlights or flashing lights when troops opened fire. The IDF has said that between six and nine of the medics had links to Hamas, without providing evidence. None of those killed – eight Red Crescent staff, six members of the Gaza civil defence agency and one employee of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees – were armed. One Red Crescent employee is still missing. The Israeli army chief, Lt Gen Eyal Zamir, has since ordered a second, more in-depth investigation into the attack. Over 18 months of war Israeli forces have killed hundreds of medical workers and the staff of aid agencies and UN organisations in Gaza.In April last year, seven members of the charity World Central Kitchen died in a sustained Israeli attack on their clearly marked vehicles. Human rights organisations have long accused the Israeli military of a culture of impunity, with few soldiers ever facing justice. In 2023, fewer than 1% of complaints made against Israeli troops’ actions in the occupiedPalestinian territoriesended in a conviction, according to the latest US state department annual human rights report. Earlier this week, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society called for an international investigation into the incident, which was the deadliest for members of the International Committee of the Red Cross since six workers were shot and killed in 2017 in an Islamic State ambush in Afghanistan.",

    "title": "Court ruling saying Mahmoud Khalil can be deported condemned as ‘unjust and alarming’ – as it happened",
    "article_text": "This live blog is now closed AUS immigrationjudge in Louisiana has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with the deportation of Columbia University activistMahmoud Khalil, who was arrested in New York City last month, Reuters reports. We’ll bring you more on this as we get it. Our live coverage is ending now. In the meantime, you can find all of our live US politics coveragehere. Here is a summary of the key developments from today: Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University graduate and Palestinian organizer, is eligible to be deported from the United States, an immigration judge ruled on Friday during a contentious hearing at a remote court in central Louisiana.The decision sides with theTrump administration’s claim that a short memo written by secretary of stateMarco Rubio, which stated Khalil’s “beliefs and associations” were counter to foreign policy interests, is sufficient evidence to remove a lawful permanent resident from the United States.Khalil will appeal his case to the board of immigration appeals, his attorney said at a New Jersey hearing later in the day. A federal judge said it is “extremely troubling” that the Trump administrationfailed on Friday to complywitha court order to provide details on the statusof Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whom it illegally deported to El Salvador in March.The governments of the United States and El Salvador have subjected more than 200 Venezuelan nationals to enforced disappearances and arbitrary detention,according to Human Rights Watch. The Department of Homeland Security ended temporary protected status for about 9,000 Afghans living in the United States.In a statement released today, the agency said secretaryKristi Noemhad decided to terminate the protected status, usually granted to people from countries affected by war or disasters, because she believed the conditions in Afghanistan no longer met that definition. Democratic senators have called for an investigation to determine whether Donald Trump, any members of his cabinet, or other donors, insiders, and administration officials engaged ininsider trading, market manipulation, or other securities laws violations.Elizabeth Warren, minority leader Chuck Schumer and colleagues sent a letter to the chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asking its chair to find out. The US president posted on social media that it was “a great time to buy” just hours before abruptly pausing his tariff impositions for most countries on Wednesday. Trump’s justice department has upended a historic civil rights case into environmental racism against a majority-Black community in Alabama,on the grounds that it violates an executive order banning federal agencies from pursuing programs or initiatives related todiversity, equity and inclusion(DEI), including those relating to environmental justice. Luigi Mangione’s lawyers asked a judge to prevent the US government from seeking the death penalty, calling it “politically motivated”.Mangione is accused of shooting and killing the CEO of UnitedHealth Group’s insurance division, in New York last year. The Trump administration is planning to slash budgets at both the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency (Noaa) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa),according to internal budget documents, taking aim specifically at programs that study impacts from the climate crisis. The state department is ordering staff to report colleagues for instances of “anti-Christian bias” during the Biden administration, part ofTrump’s aggressive push to reshape government policy on religious expression in his first months back in office. A federal judge ruled in favor of the Trump administration, allowing immigration agents to continue entering houses of worship for now.The decision came as part of a lawsuit over a new Department of Homeland Security policy allowing agents access to “sensitive areas” like schools and churches. In related news,Los Angelesunified school district superintendent, Alberto Carvalho, has confirmed that immigration officials attempted to enter twoLos Angeleselementary schools this week. The Social Security Administration has called earlier reporting that it will transition all of its public communication exclusively to X “false”.The agency shared a two sentence statement on X in response to a Wired magazine article which broke the news of the planned changes at the administration. “This is false. Social Security will continue to communicate through any and all mediums,” it said. Defense contractors have proposed a plan to the White House to transport immigrants to a maximum security prison in El Salvador where part of the prison will be designated as US territory,Politicoreports.The proposal is being spearheaded by former Blackwater executive Erik Prince who has suggested it as a way to skirt US immigration laws. The outlet adds that it’s unclear how seriously the White House is considering the plan. As Veterans Affairs employees prepare toreturn-to-officeas early as Monday,NPRreports that therapists have been told to tell patients they “cannot guarantee complete confidentiality” due to office sharing requirements. Many of the department’s therapists were hired during the pandemic to provide telehealth services, meaning there is not sufficient office space for their mandatory return-to-office. Speaking at the Food and Drug Administration’s headquarters today, health secretary Robert FKennedy Jrcalled the agency a “sock puppet” for industry and warned of a “deep state”.A week after cutting 10,000 jobs from the Department of Health and Human Services, he added that his aim was to support FDA employees. “I really want to empower you,” Kennedy said, adding that public health requires “an inspired and engaged workforce. And you’re the leaders in that workforce.” Three more international students have had their visas revoked, this time at Montana State University.The news comes as the American Immigration Lawyers Association reports that the Department of Homeland Security has terminated the academic records ofat least 4,700international students and scholars. In an email to the student body today, Montana State University president Waded Cruzado wrote that Homeland Security had revoked the visas of three students enrolled there,KBZKreports. Citing incoming American Immigration Lawyers Association president Jeff Joseph,the Washington Postreports that more than 4,700 international students or scholars have had their records deleted in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (Sevis). The system flags students who are not in compliance with their student visa requirements to Immigrations and Customs Enforcement and could put them at risk for detention or deportation. Donald Trump has issued a national security memo directing the secretary of defense and other cabinet officials to launch a military mission aimed at “sealing the southern border of the United States and repelling invasions”. The memo, which is addressed to the secretaries of defense, interior, agriculture and homeland security, directs the interior department to allow the defense department to construct military installations and perform other military activities on the Roosevelt Reservation, a 60-ft wide strip of land along the US side of the US-Mexico border. A federal judge has temporarilyblockedthe Trump administration from freezing federal funds for the state of Maine in response to the state’s policies allowing transgender girls to compete in school sports. In a 70-page order, US district judge John A Woodcock ordered the US Department of Agriculture to “immediately unfreeze and release to the state of Maine any federal funding that they have frozen or failed or refused to pay because of the State’s alleged failure to comply with the requirements of Title IX”. Last week, agriculture secretary Brooke Rollins senta letterto Maine governor Janet Mills “freezing Maine’s federal funds for certain administrative and technological functions in schools”, saying the state had violated the Trump-administration’s Title IX guidance on transgender students. Trump’s justice department has upended a historic civil rights case intoenvironmental racismagainst amajority-Black community in Alabama, on the grounds that it violates an executive order banning federal agencies from pursuing programs or initiatives related todiversity, equityand inclusion(DEI), including those relating to environmental justice. The DoJ announced on Friday that it is terminating the environmental justice settlement dealreached in 2023, requiring Alabama’s health agencies to provide Lowndes county residents withadequate sanitation and wastewater disposal facilities – after decades of unlawful and discriminatory neglect which had led to multiple generations dealing with raw sewage, infectious diseases and other public health hazards. “The DOJ will no longer push ‘environmental justice’ as viewed through a distorting, DEI lens,” said assistant attorney generalHarmeet KDhillonof the justice department’s civil rights division. “President Trump made it clear: Americans deserve a government committed to serving every individual with dignity and respect, and to expending taxpayer resources in accordance with the national interest, not arbitrary criteria.” In fact, environmental justice is about how ecological hazards and deadly pollutants like lead, emissions from heavy manufacturing plants and highways aredisproportionately located in communities of color, on Indigenous lands and low-income neighborhoods. Environmental justice work is not about DEI, it is about tackling systemic racism and other structural inequalities that have done untold health harms to Black, brown and Indigenous communities in the US. The Social Security Administration will transition all of its public communication exclusively to X, the Elon Musk-owned social media platform formerly known as Twitter. Facing significant staffing cuts, the administration will cease issuing press releases or communicating with journalists. “The agency will be using X to communicate to the press and the public,” Linda Kerr-Davis, SSA midwest-west regional commissioner told employees in a call Thursday, according toFederal News Network (FNN). “If you’re used to getting press releases and Dear Colleague letters, you might want to subscribe to the official SSA X account, so you can stay up to date with agency news.” “I know this probably sounds very foreign to you – it did to me as well – and not what we are used to, but we are in different times now,” she added. The decision comes as federal agencies have significantly reduced their staffing, following the directives of the Musk-led “department of government efficiency”, and as the Trump administration is limiting its contact with reporters. In February, the administration barred the Associated Press from the Oval Office over the outlets decision to use the term “Gulf of Mexico” instead of Trump’s preferred “Gulf of America”. The Associated Press sued to regain access to the White House press pool and a federal judge ruled in its favor this week. A federal judge has ruled in favor of the Trump administration, allowing immigration agents to continue entering houses of worship for now. US district judge Dabney Friedrich declined to grant a preliminary injunction to a coalition of Christian and Jewish groups that had sued over a new Department of Homeland Security policy allowing agents access to “sensitive areas” like schools and churches. The judge found that the groups lack standing since few immigration enforcement actions have occurred at houses of worship to date. In related news,Los Angelesunified school district superintendent, Alberto Carvalho, has confirmed that immigration officials attempted to enter twoLos Angeleselementary schools this week:",

    "title": "US judge rules Mahmoud Khalil can be deported for his views",
    "article_text": "Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University graduate and Palestinian organizer, is eligible to be deported from the United States, an immigration judge ruled on Friday during a contentious hearing at a remote court in central Louisiana. The decision sides with theTrump administration’s claim that a short memo written by the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, which stated Khalil’s “current or expected beliefs, statements or associations” were counter to foreign policy interests, is sufficient evidence to remove a lawful permanent resident from the United States. The undated memo, the main piece of evidence submitted by the government, contained no allegations of criminal conduct. During a tense hearing on Friday afternoon, Khalil’s attorneys made an array of unsuccessful arguments attempting to both delay a ruling on his eligibility for removal and to terminate proceedings entirely. They argued the broad allegations contained in Rubio’s memo gave them a right to directly cross-examine him. Khalil held prayer beads as three attorneys for the Department of Homeland Security presented arguments for his removal. Judge Jamee Comans ruled that Rubio’s determination was “presumptive and sufficient evidence” and that she had no power to rule on concerns over free speech. “There is no indication that Congress contemplated an immigration judge or even the attorney general overruling the secretary of state on matters of foreign policy,” Comans said. A supporter who was in tears sat on the crowded public benches as the ruling was delivered. Following the ruling, Khalil, who had remained silent throughout proceedings, requested permission to speak before the court. Addressing the judge directly, he said: “I would like to quote what you said last time, that ‘there’s nothing that’s more important to this court than due process rights and fundamental fairness’.” He continued: “Clearly what we witnessed today, neither of these principles were present today or in this whole process. “This is exactly why theTrump administrationhas sent me to this court, 1,000 miles away from my family. I just hope that the urgency that you deemed fit for me is afforded to the hundreds of others who have been here without hearing for months.” Khalil, 30, helped lead pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia last year. Hewas arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officers in New York on 8 March and transferred to a detention facility in Jena, Louisiana, where he has been detained for over a month. His case was the first in a string of Ice arrests instigated by the Trump administration targeting pro-Palestinian students and scholars present in the US on visas or green cards. The ruling means that Khalil’s removal proceedings will continue to move forward in Jena, while a separate case being heard in federal court in New Jersey examines the legality of his detention and questions surrounding the constitutionality of the government’s claims it can deport people for first amendment-protected speech if they are deemed adverse to US foreign policy. Khalil’s legal team is asking the New Jersey judge to release him on bail so that he can reunite with his wife, who is due to give birth to their first child this month. His lawyers slammed the decision, which they said appeared to be prewritten. “Today, we saw our worst fears play out: Mahmoud was subject to a charade of due process, a flagrant violation of his right to a fair hearing, and a weaponization of immigration law to suppress dissent. This is not over, and our fight continues,” said Marc van der Hout, Khalil’s immigration lawyer. “If Mahmoud can be targeted in this way, simply for speaking out for Palestinians and exercising his constitutionally protected right to free speech, this can happen to anyone over any issue the Trump administration dislikes. We will continue working tirelessly until Mahmoud is free and rightfully returned home to his family and community.” Van der Hout told a federal judge that Khalil will file the appeal after the immigration judge who ruled him “removable” issues the final written ruling. Van der Hout added that Khalil’s legal team may also pursue an asylum case. “So nothing is going to happen quickly in the immigration proceeding even though she’s found him removable on the foreign policy grounds,” he said. The judge gave lawyers for Khalil until 23 April to seek a waiver. During a short prayer vigil held outside the detention centre on Friday afternoon, a group of interfaith clergy read messages of support. A short statement from Khalil’s wife,Noor Abdalla, who is due to give birth this month, was also delivered in front of reporters. “Today’s decision feels like a devastating blow to our family. No person should be deemed ‘removable’ from their home for speaking out against the killing of Palestinian families, doctors, and journalists,” the statement read. It continued: “In less than a month, Mahmoud and I will welcome our first child. Until we are reunited, I will not stop advocating for my husband’s safe return home.” The New Jersey judge has ordered the government not to remove Khalil as his case plays out in federal court. A hearing in that case is set for later on Friday.",

    "article_text": "Counter-terrorism police are leading the investigation into an attack on three prison officers by the brother of theManchesterArena bomber. Hashem Abedi, who ploted the 2017 bombing, attacked three prison officers with hot cooking oil at a high-security prison, the Prison Officers’ Association (POA) said. The Prison Service confirmed Abedi carried out the “unprovoked” and “vicious” assault on Saturday at HMP Frankland inCounty Durham. He is reported to have thrown boiling oil at the officers before stabbing them with “homemade weapons”. The POA said they had sustained life-threatening injuries including burns, scalds and stab wounds. All three officers were treated in hospital, with one female officer discharged by 4pm on Saturday. Abedi was jailed for life in August 2020 for assisting his brother, Salman Abedi, in carrying out the suicide bombing at Manchester Arena in 2017. The attack killed 22 people and injured hundreds more. Responding to the assault, the secretary of state for justice,Shabana Mahmood, wrote on X: “I am appalled by the attack of three brave officers at HMP Frankland today. My thoughts are with them and their families. “The police are now investigating. I will be pushing for the strongest possible punishment. Violence against our staff will never be tolerated.” HMP Frankland is a category A prison, the highest level of security. It is understood the incident took place inside a separation centre – a special facility that aims to isolate prisoners with extreme views. Mark Fairhurst, national chair of the POA, said: “Separation centres hold the most dangerous terrorist offenders who simply do not wish to alter their ideology, and, as this event confirms, are determined to inflict violence on those who hold them securely.” He called for an urgent review of the privileges available to terrorist offenders in custody: “We must now review the freedoms we allow separation centre prisoners to have.” “I am of the opinion that allowing access to cooking facilities and items that can threaten the lives of staff should be removed immediately. “These prisoners need only receive their basic entitlements and we should concentrate on control and containment instead of attempting to appease them. Things have to change.” A spokesperson for the Prison Service said: “Three prison officers have been treated in hospital after an attack by a prisoner at HMP Frankland. Police are now investigating so it would be inappropriate to comment further. “Violence in prison will not be tolerated, and we will always push for the strongest punishment for attacks on our hard-working staff.”",

    "article_text": "The rail minister, Lord Peter Hendy, has reported himself to the police after he was spotted using a mobile phone while driving a vintage Routemaster bus in London during a charity tour. The former Transport for London commissioner apologised for what has been described as an “error of judgment” after a passenger saw him texting behind the wheel of the double-decker last month. He was reported to the Metropolitan police on 31 March by the passenger who had taken part in the tour three days earlier. It is understood the peer had been contacting a friend about a prostate cancer test during an event to support the Railway Family charity. A spokesperson for Hendy said: “Last month Peter Hendy used his phone while driving. He has apologised in full for this error of judgment and has contacted the police.” The Metropolitan police confirmed the case had initially been closed due to lack of evidence but was later reopened after Lord Hendy admitted to using his phone behind the wheel. He is expected to receive six points on his driving licence and a fine. The organisers of the Railway Family fundraiser said they had not received any formal complaint at the time of the incident. They said: “Since then, the organisers have only had one conversation from the complainant in the form of a text message, which he sent on 2 April, where he informed us that he’d reported Lord Hendy to the Metropolitan police. “The Railway Family fundraiser is run by railway professionals, all of whom work with safe systems of work and rules and regulations about safe practice. None of us would advocate or condone unsafe practices. However, we reiterate that we are not aware of the whole situation, and affirm our hope that any investigation is able to be conducted fairly. “The organisers regret that a positive and enjoyable event ended in this way and would once again like to express our thanks to Lord Hendy for his support for our event and fundraising.”",

    "title": "Big brands send out barrage of junk food ads before obesity rules bite",
    "article_text": "Big food brands dramatically increased their spending on advertising last year, months before new junk food regulations aiming to curb Britain’s obesity crisis are due to come into force, theObservercan reveal. Food companies spent an extra £420m in 2024, an increase of 26% year on year that coincided with a bumper 12 months for sales of snack foods. Shoppers bought an extra 45.4m packs of chocolate, cakes and crisps from the top-selling brands. The spending bonanza came as campaigners said food corporations were switching tactics to circumvent the impact of the upcoming regulations, which will bring in a 9pm watershed for TV commercials showing unhealthy food products, and ban them online from October, after five years of delays. Outdoor posters, audio advertising on podcasts and streaming services such as Spotify, and partnerships with social media influencers are not covered by the regulations. The increase in spending and the suggestion it may have led to an increase in sales may fuel calls for further restrictions. James McDonald, the director of data, intelligence and forecasting at WARC Media, which monitors ad spend and recorded the 26% increase, said it was “not surprising that we saw sales lift in line with spend”. He added: “I think the timing is interesting, given the introduction of HFSS [foods high in fat, salt or sugar] regulation this year.” New unpublished data analysed by academics at University College London and the Pan American Health Organization, including Chris van Tulleken, the NHS doctor and broadcaster, and shared with theObserver, found that the junk food ad regulations would only cover less than two-thirds of foods that could be considered unhealthy according to government nutrition guidelines. Health campaigners say food companies are adopting tactics similar to those used by the tobacco industry in the battle over cigarette advertising, by focusing on brands and logos rather than products. The advertising industry has argued that uncertainty over regulations threatens the sector and said ministers should legislate to exempt brand-only ads from the regulations. A battleground has opened up over whether the rules should cover adverts that only feature a brand name such as McDonald’s or Cadbury without showing an “identifiable” product. Allowing brand ads would mean that Cadbury could run its memorable drumming gorilla ad, for example, before the watershed so long as there were no images of chocolate bars. TheAdvertisingStandards Authority (ASA) is about to issue guidelines for advertisers clarifying issues like this, after suggesting that it would examine adverts on a case-by-case basis. Ahead of this crucial decision, both sides have ramped up their messaging. Archie Norman, the Marks and Spencer chair,told theFinancial Timesearlier this month that the regulations would “stop people talking about mince pies” and threaten future Christmas ads. Bite Back 2030, a youth activist group fighting the influence of junk food, surveyed 859 poster sites in Liverpool, Birmingham, Newcastle and Southwark in London and found nearly half were for food and drink. They also found that 44% of all HFSS food ads were in the most deprived areas, while only 4% were in the least deprived. The government appeared to come down on the side of advertisers last week. Ashley Dalton, a junior health minister, issued astatementsaying “pure brand advertising” should not be restricted, and that the government did “not expect the perception or association of a corporate brand with less healthy products to automatically bring an advert into scope of the restrictions”. Last week an investigation by theBMJfound that local authorities were shelving restrictions on junk-food poster adverts in their areas after warnings from ad companies that they would lose revenue. “The only foods that are marketed in this country, almost without exception, are high in fat, salt or sugar,” Van Tulleken told theObserver. He said there were “no really functional marketing restrictions” for children on harmful food brands. “And I’m not enormously optimistic that anything that’s going to happen in October will significantly change that, because companies advertise on bus tickets … they have billboards advertising the brand, if not the product, up and down the street,” he added. Van Tulleken said there was “saturation” of unhealthy food brands across the country. “They’re in every shop, at every convenience store, in every supermarket, at every petrol station. They have complete 360 degree coverage, and the alternatives are inaccessible and unavailable and unaffordable for many, many, many people.” Curbing advertising on less healthy food products has long been considered a key part of tackling the UK’s obesity crisis.In 1980, only 6% of men and 9% of women were obese, according to theNational Heights and Weights Survey, while processed food made up 26% of kitchen groceries and families spent 57% of their food budgets on ingredients, according toresearchby the Institute for Fiscal Studies. By 2022, 28% of adults in England were classed as obese by the NHS, with two-thirds of all calories in UK diets coming from processed or ultra-processed food. The first government restrictions on ads for less healthy foods arrived in 2007, with some commercials banned during children’s TV shows. In 2018, after mounting evidence that children were still seeing junk food commercials, Theresa May bowed to pressure from campaigners such as Jamie Oliver to introduce a 9pm watershed for ads. Legislation was eventually passed in 2023 and the Advertising (Less Healthy Food Definitions and Exemptions) Regulations 2024 will come into effect on 1 October, with the aim, like thesoft drinks levy, of encouraging food brands to ­reformulate their products or introduce new ones. Rob Newman, the director of public affairs at ISBA, which represents brands advertising in the UK, said they were “extremely concerned” about the implications of the new restrictions and said the ASA was “caught on the horns of dilemma”. “The impact of brand ads being caught … could amount to hundreds of millions of pounds of lost revenue, redirection of spend outside the UK, or the inability to use ad campaigns which have already been prepared on the basis of what was understood to be the legislative position,” Newman said. Nicki Whiteman, Bite Back 2030’s chief brand officer, said: “The echoes of tobacco are everywhere. Instead of acknowledging and taking accountability for the extraordinary power these companies have over children’s health, what they do instead, just like Big Tobacco did, is look for ways around it. “Children across the world, all you [need] to do is show them a yellow M and they’ll know exactly what that stands for.” McDonald’s and Mondelez, which owns Cadbury, declined to comment. Katharine Jenner, director of theObesityHealth Alliance, said food companies use “sophisticated techniques to keep unhealthy products in the spotlight” and exposure to unhealthy food marketing influences children’s preferences. “We now appear to be witnessing a final surge in less healthy food advertising before the rules come in, underlining why voluntary approaches have repeatedly failed and will continue to do so,” she said. “These long-delayed restrictions are sensible, proportionate, and evidence-based. Most importantly, they are a crucial step towards protecting children’s health.”",

    "title": "Rachel Reeves calls for global free trade fightback to protect UK economy",
    "article_text": "The chancellor,Rachel Reeves, has set out the case for far-reaching changes to global trade and economic agreements, admitting that Donald Trump’s tariffs will have a “profound” effect on the UK and world economies that require a strong international response. In her first significant intervention since the US president caused chaos on the global financial markets byannouncing huge levies on imports to the US, Reeves says in a column for theObserverthat she is “under no illusion about the difficulties that lie ahead”. While not directly criticising Trump or his policies, Reeves is clear the effects will be economically damaging and says she is determined to act to ease the understandable insecurity about the cost of living felt by British families. Reeves makes clear that she will argue at a meeting of the International Monetary Fund later this month for a new “more balanced global economic and trading system” that “recognises the benefits of free trade” over the kind of nakedly protectionist strategies employed by Trump in recent weeks. While Reeves says the UK will continue to push for a good bilateral economic deal with the US, she also says it will be her aim to achieve “an ambitious new relationship with the EU” as well as a trade deal with India. Rejecting the ideas of protectionism – now being aggressively promoted by Trump as his core economic policy - and backing the free trade alternative, she adds: “The Labour party is an internationalist party. We understand the benefits of free and fair trade and collaboration. Now is not the time to turn our backs on the world.” Last week, the former prime ministerGordon Brown wrote in theGuardianthat leaders of other key trading nations needed to step up their collective response to the chaos unleashed by Trump, warning: “We are seeing a simultaneous breakdown in economic and geopolitical orders.” Brown said: “We need an economic coalition of the willing: like-minded global leaders who believe that, in an interdependent world, we have to coordinate economic policies across continents if we are to safeguard jobs and living standards.” Referring to the US under Trump, Brown said the “world is being brought to its knees by one economy, outside which live 96% of the population, who produce 84% of the world’s manufactured goods”. On Saturday, Trump announced thatsmartphones and computers would be exemptedfrom the 125% tariffs he has imposed on imports from China, as would electronics components such as memory cards and semiconductors. Experts had warned the tariffs could cause prices of electronic goods such as iPhones and laptops to dramatically spike for US customers. Support is growing among economists for a new layer of trade agreements between leading economic powers, under the auspices of theWorld Trade Organization, but excluding the US for as long as it follows the protectionist route. With both houses of parliament on Saturday On Sunday, in a further response to the uncertainties, ministers will announce that British businesses across the country will have access to new support through a multibillion-pound increase in government-backed financing. The new package will give UK Export Finance the power to expand financing support for British businesses by £20bn, with small businesses also able to access loans of up to £2m through the British Business Bank’s growth guarantee scheme. Thousands of companies are expected to benefit from the move, including those directly affected by tariffs. The business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, said: “Within a changing world, we need to adapt, and as part of our plan for change, this government is responding.” AnOpinium poll for theObserverfinds that 34% of adults now believe the US is more of a threat than an ally, up from 16% in November last year, while those who have confidence in the US as an ally are just 35%. Views of Trump are also becoming more negative. Although the president has said he has an affinity with the UK, the poll shows that more than half of adults believe he is not “a friend of Britain’s” – a 12% leap since January. And fewer people believe he has the best interests of the US at heart than do not. Only 16% of those polled believed he was trustworthy, against 64% who did not. Since becoming president, Trump has said the UK is “out of line” on trade, imposed a 10% tariff on all UK imports and a further 25% tariff on cars without warning Keir Starmer, and ordered Nato members to spend at least 5% of GDP on defence. His vice-president, JD Vance, also claimed at a conference in Munich in February that “in Britain and across Europe, free speech is in retreat”, and met leaders of the far-right Alternative für Deutschland party. Separately,research by a leading thinktankhas found that a majority of UK voters want the government to concentrate on rebuilding trade ties with the EU over forging a new economic deal with the US. Commissioned by the internationalist thinktank Best for Britain, the research found that 53% of voters now believe a closer relationship with the EU will have a positive effect on the UK economy, against just 13% who said the effect would be negative. In turn, 68% believed better relations with the EU would boost UK-EU trade in a clearly positive way.The analysis shows how far the UK public has turned back in favour of the EU since the Brexit referendum nine years ago.",

    "title": "Bill to save British Steel plant becomes law after king’s approval",
    "article_text": "Proposals to save British Steel’s Scunthorpe blast furnaces have been granted royal assent after an extraordinary parliament sitting on Saturday. Emergency legislation giving the government the power to instruct British Steel to keep the plant open passed the Commons and Lords in a single day unopposed. Ministers had taken the unusual step of recalling parliament from its Easter recess to sit on Saturday after negotiations with British Steel’s Chinese owners, Jingye, appeared to break down. The business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, accused the company of failing to negotiate “in good faith” after it decided to stop buying enough raw materials to keep the blast furnaces at Scunthorpe going. He told MPs: “We could not, will not and never will stand idly by while heat seeps from the UK’s remaining blast furnaces without any planning, any due process or any respect for the consequences. “And that is why I needed colleagues here today.” But the Conservatives said the government should have acted sooner, with the acting shadow leader of the House, Alex Burghart, accusing ministers of making “a total pig’s breakfast of this whole arrangement”. The shadow business secretary, Andrew Griffith, said the government was seeking a “blank cheque”, while the Tory leader, Kemi Badenoch, claimed Labour had “botched” a deal she had negotiated with British Steel while business secretary. But she was unable to provide details of the deal, saying negotiations were still under way when last year’s election was called, but adding it “would have succeeded better” than Reynolds’s plan. Opening Saturday’s debate, Reynolds said Labour had been engaged in negotiations with Jingye since the party came to power last July, and had offered “substantial” support. Most recently, the government had offered to buy the necessary raw materials for the blast furnaces, the last primary steel-making facilities in the UK, but this had been met with a counter-offer from Jingye demanding “an excessive amount” of support. Reynolds added: “Over the last few days, it became clear that the intention of Jingye was to refuse to purchase sufficient raw material to keep the blast furnaces running – in fact, their intention was to cancel and refuse to pay for existing orders. “The company would therefore have irrevocably and unilaterally closed down primary steel-making at British Steel.” While MPs debated the legislation, the Times reported that workers at the Scunthorpe plant had prevented Chinese executives from Jingye from gaining access to key areas of the steelworks. The steel industry bill published on Saturday gives the government the power to instruct steel companies in England to keep facilities open, with criminal penalties for executives if they fail to comply. Ministers said these measures were necessary to keep the Scunthorpe blast furnaces open and protect the UK’s primary steel-making capacity and the 3,500 jobs involved. Reynolds said the emergency legislation was a “proportionate and necessary step”, adding he wanted it to be a “temporary position” with the powers not lasting “any minute longer than is necessary”. Meanwhile, Keir Starmer met steelworkers near Scunthorpe to discuss his government’s plans for the plant. The prime minister told them: “You are the people who have kept this going. You and your colleagues for years have been the backbone of British Steel, and it’s really important that we recognise that.” Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Saturday’s emergency legislation stops short of full nationalisation of British Steel, and ministers remain hopeful that they can secure private investment to save the plant. But there is no private company willing to invest in British Steel, and the business secretary acknowledged to the Commons that public ownership remained the “likely option”. During Saturday’s debate, Reform UK’s deputy leader, Richard Tice, urged the government to “show your cojones” and go further by fully nationalising British Steel “this weekend”. Several Conservative MPs also spoke in favour of nationalisation, while the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper said recalling parliament had been “absolutely the right thing to do”. The government has been criticised for acting to save the Scunthorpe plant but not taking the same action when the Tata steelworks in Port Talbot was threatened with closure. The Liberal Democrats’ Wales spokesperson, David Chadwick, said workers in south Wales “will be asking themselves how this unjust situation was ever allowed to occur”. Earlier, the industry minister, Sarah Jones, said the different approach was due to Tata’s willingness to invest in Port Talbot, and the changed global circumstances making it necessary to protect the UK’s primary steel-making capacity. TUC general secretary Paul Nowak welcomed the bill but urged the government to go further. He said: “Today’s announcement is the first step towards ensuring we can modernise and decarbonise steel-making in this country – reducing our reliance on foreign imports and ensuring we stay competitive on the global stage. “But the government should not stop there. We need to ensure British Steel is used in British infrastructure projects to boost local economies up and down the country. “That’s how you protect steelworkers’ jobs through the transition, and put UK steel-making on a firm footing for the future.”",

    "article_text": "The Trump administration on Saturday confirmed to a federal judge that a Maryland man who was wrongly deported last month remains confined in a notorious prison in El Salvador. However, the White House filing did not address the judge’s demands that the administration detail the steps it was taking to return Kilmar Abrego García to the United States. The White House only confirmed that García was under the authority of the El Salvador government. The administration’s confirmation of García’s location was confirmed to the court by Michael G Kozak, who identified himself in the filing as a “Senior Bureau Official” in the state department’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs. The filing comes one day after a US government attorney struggled in a hearing to provide the US district judge Paula Xinis with any information about García’s whereabouts. Xinis issued an order after Friday’s hearing requiring the administration to disclose García’s “current physical location and custodial status” and “what steps, if any, Defendants have taken (and) will take, and when, to facilitate” his return. “It is my understanding based on official reporting from our Embassy in San Salvador that Abrego García is currently being held in the Terrorism Confinement Center in El Salvador,” Kozak’s statement said. “He is alive and secure in that facility. He is detained pursuant to the sovereign, domestic authority of El Salvador.” Kozak’s statement did not address the judge’s latter requirements. Xinis was exasperated Friday with the government’s lack of information. “Where is he and under whose authority?” the judge asked in the hearing. “I’m not asking for state secrets. All I know is that he’s not here. The government was prohibited from sending him to El Salvador, and now I’m asking a very simple question: Where is he?” The US supreme court on Thursdayupheldthe judge’s order to facilitate Abrego García’s return to the US, after Abrego García and his family filed a lawsuit challenging the legality of his summary deportation on 15 March. Abrego García has had a US work permit since 2019 but was stopped and detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officers on 12 March and questioned about alleged gang affiliation. He was deported on one of three high-profile deportation flights to El Salvador made up chiefly of Venezuelans whom the government accuses of being gang members and whom it assumed special powers to expel without a hearing. Abrego García’s wife, US citizen Jennifer Vásquez Sura, has not been able to speak to him since he was flown to his native El Salvador last month and imprisoned. She has beenrallying outside courtand has urged their supporters to keep fighting for him “and all the Kilmars out there whose stories are still waiting to be heard”.",

    "title": "Trump administration to exempt smartphones and computers from tariffs",
    "article_text": "Donald Trump’s presidential administration has exempted smartphones and computers from the 125% levies imposed on imports from China as well as other “reciprocal”tariffs, which experts had cautioned might cause electronic consumer prices to spike dramatically in the US. The announcement was made late on Friday in a US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) notice that said the devices would be excluded from the 10% global tariff thatTrumprecently imposed on most countries, along with the much heftier import tax on China. The CBP’s notice follows concerns from tech companies that the price of electronics for US consumers might surge with many of them manufactured inChina. The notice also contained exemptions for additional electronics and components, such as memory cards, solar cells and semiconductors. The exclusions were applied retroactively to the products under the reciprocal tariffs beginning at 12.01am ET on 5 April,according tothe notice. “Importers may request a refund by filing a post summary correction for unliquidated entries, or by filing a protest for entries that have liquidated but where the liquidation is not final because the protest period has not expired,” the CBP said. On Saturday, Trump released astatementof “clarification of exceptions” pertaining to the previous evening’s announcement. Speaking toCNBC, Dan Ives, the global head of technology research at the Los Angeles-based financial services firm Wedbush Securities, said on Saturday: “This is the dream scenario for tech investors … Smartphones, chips being excluded is a game-changer scenario when it comes to China tariffs.” Ives added: “I think ultimately big tech CEOs spoke loudly, and the White House had to understand and listen to the situation that this would have been Armageddon for big tech if it were implemented.” Similarly, Paul Ashworth, Capital Economics’ chief north America economist, said that the tariff exceptions “represent a partial de-escalation of president Trump’s trade war with China”. “There were even bigger winners in Asia, however, since the exemptions apply to all countries – not only China. At a stroke, 64% of US imports from Taiwan are now exempt from the 10% reciprocal tariff, 44% from Malaysia, and almost 30% from both Vietnam and Thailand. Ten to 12% of imports from India, Korea and Mexico will also now be exempt,” Ashworth added. “These exemptions will presumably not be the last either, with the success of Apple’s Tim Cook in getting its smartphones exempted likely to boost the lobbying by firms in other sectors.” Since Trump announced his tariffs, Apple was among the hardest-hit tech companies, as 90% of its iPhones arereportedly assembledin China. Invoking imagery associated with the strongest classification for hurricanes, Ives had previously described the Chinese tariffs as a “category 5 price storm for the US consumer”. He added in a note to investors: “The reality is it would take three years and $30bn in our estimation to move even 10% of its supply chain from Asia to the US with major disruption in the process … For US consumers, the reality of a $1,000iPhonebeing one of the best-made consumer products on the planet would disappear.” According to analysts at the investment bank UBS, costs of iPhones would rise exponentially under Trump’s Chinese tariffs. The price of an iPhone 16 Pro Max (with 256GB of storage) could rise by 79% from $1,199 (£915) to about $2,150 (£1,600), the Guardianreportedearlier. In attempts to mitigate the blow of Trump’s tariffs, Apple reportedlycharteredcargo flights to transport iPhones from its Indian factories, with Reuters reporting the company having flown 600 tons of iPhones – or approximately 1.5m devices – to the US since March. Meanwhile, China’s Semiconductor Industry Association (CSIA) announced that the country’s “retaliatory” tariffs on US imports were limited to chips made in the US. Chips manufactured in Taiwan and South Korea remain unaffected. According to the CSIA, the “country of origin” for integrated circuits would be determined by the location of the manufacturing facility, not the final packaging or design location, CGTNreported. In other words, US chipmakers that outsource manufacturing to other parts of the world are exempt from China’s “retaliatory” tariffs. The latest announcement from the CSIA came as China slapped 125% tariffs on US productson Fridayas part of the latest trade-war escalation between the two trade giants.",

    "title": "Police searching for man who allegedly sexually abused corpse on New York subway",
    "article_text": "A man sexually violated a corpse on aNew York Citysubway train after stealing from the body, becoming the second of two people to rob that particular dead person, authorities said recently. One of the more grotesqueUS crimestories of late unfolded on a southbound R train near the Whitehall Street station in Manhattan at about 12.20am on Wednesday, when “an unidentified individual had sexual contact with an unconscious and unresponsive adult male” in plain view of surveillance cameras, according to a police statement. The statement did not elaborate and did not identify the attacker or the victim, though they released surveillance photos of a suspect carrying a black backpack and wearing a blue baseball cap, a black hooded jacket, a yellow hooded sweatshirt, blue jeans and red-and-white sneakers. Nonetheless, a poster distributed to transit workers alleged that the man wanted in the case had engaged in sexual intercourse with “a dead human body”, as the New York City news websiteGothamistreported. The poster, which was reviewed by the Guardian as well, alleged that investigators had probable cause to arrest a 51-year-old man identified as Carlos Garcia – whose last known address is in the Bronx – on a count of sexual misconduct of a dead human body. Gothamist, citing police, also reported that the man identified in the wanted poster as Garcia could be seen on surveillance footage taking items from the pockets of the dead person before violating the corpse and fleeing. That attack marked the second time the dead person – who was described as a man – had been stolen from in less than an hour. At about 10.48pm on Tuesday, police said a woman approached the late man, removed unspecified property from him and then left. Police released surveillance images of a suspect in that initial robbery, which showed a woman wearing a yellow hooded sweatshirt, black pants and a black baseball cap. A police spokesperson would not comment on the allegations of the wanted poster first reported on by Gothamist and later seen by the Guardian. Another official on Saturday morning said there had not been any arrests made in the case. Police said anyone with useful information can submit it to New York City’sCrimestopperswebsite. Police said it appeared the victim had died of natural causes before both crimes. Wednesday morning’s case of necrophilia on the subway not only provided a graphically documented instance of a sexual disorder psychiatrists assume to be among the rarest. It also reignited a discussion about the safety of theNew YorkCity subway system that in some quarters is ongoing. Statistics generally show violence on the subway is relatively rare, though high-profile cases have the tendency to unnerve the public. For instance, in December, a 57-year-old woman namedDebrina Kawamdied after being set on fire while sleeping on a train at the Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue station in Brooklyn. Days later, 45-year-old Joseph Lynskey was pushed in front of an oncoming train at Manhattan’s 18th Street station but survived.",

    "title": "‘I’m super worried’: fewer UK tourists visiting US amid Trump’s policies and rhetoric",
    "article_text": "After backpacker Rebecca Burke was arrested andlocked up for nearly three weeksby US immigration ­officials, she started urging people not to travel to America. Britons seem to have listened: the number of UK residents visiting the US was down 14.3% in March compared with the same month in 2024, official figures show. Analysts believe that Donald Trump’s claims that other countries were “cheating” Americans, and reports of deportations, may have had a chilling effect on travel to the US. But the March dip may be simply an early warning of a bigger fall in the summer, because tourists typically book holidays months in advance. “Once we get into July, August, September, most of those trips will have been booked,” said David Edwards, founder of the Scattered Clouds travel consultancy. “But if there is less global trade, there will be less international business travel. Business travel is booked with a much shorter lead time so if there is uncertainty, business travel could take a swifter hit.” Spring is difficult for travel companies to analyse because Easter moves in the calendar. So could the comparative drop simply be the effect of the Easter school holidays falling in March 2024? It seems unlikely, Edwards said, because the figures from the USNational Travel and Tourism Officeshow an even bigger drop, of 16%, compared with March 2019 when Easter was on 21 April and Trump was nearing the end of his first term. Travellers from other countries also seemed to avoid the US in March – visitors from western Europe who stayed at least one night in the US were down 17% in March, year-on-year. German visitors were down 28.2% and Spanish ones down 24.6% compared with 2024. Overall, global travel to the US was down 11.6%. UK residents make up the largest number of overseas visitors to the US, with 3.9 million a year. TTG, the travel industry magazine, published a poll last week showing that two-thirds of travel agents it contacted believed there had been a downturn in bookings, while only 12% of operators said their business had not been affected. Demand for hotel rooms in the US may also be falling. Jan Freitag, national director of hospitality ­analytics at CoStar, which tracks hotel room occupancy, said that the strong dollar had led to an 8% fall in visitors in 2024. “So now with the rhetoric that’s going on, I’m super worried that we’re going to continue to see travel numbers below 2019, maybe even decelerating from 2024,” he said. “Saying ‘you’re cheating us, you have a ­surplus, so we’re going to put a ­tariff on you’ – that rhetoric is not very welcoming.” Research by VisitBritain in 2022 showed that international ­travellers ranked“destination is a ­welcoming place to visit”as the second most important factor in choosing a holiday. After publicity around deportations of tourists, including Germans and Australians, the UK and German governments have updated their travel advice to warn citizens of the risk. The incidents may also harm the appeal of the 2026 World Cup – currently due to take place in the US, Canada and Mexico, with the later knockout stages entirely in the US – and the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028, Freitag said. “Next year will be very big … If I’m a German father with two boys and I want to show them the World Cup, am I really going to spend $1,000 a pop on an airfare, plus hotel, plus the ticket, if there’s even a remote chance that I will not be able to make it into the country? I’m not going to take that risk. Not everyone will think that, but probably some people will.” Clare Collins, co-founder and chief operations officer for CT Business Travel, said that she expected there would be a decline in leisure travel to the US in the summer, but had not yet seen an impact on business travel. “We’re not seeing any dramatic effects yet for business travel, but that could change in two weeks,” she said. “I think [in] the long-term leisure market, people will choose to spend their money elsewhere.” If the March dip turns into a major fall in travellers from the UK, some airlines may start cutting routes, Edwards said, and that could have an impact on the British economy. The UK travel industry recovered from the Covid pandemic mostly because American tourists flocked to Europe, buoyed by a strong dollar that made hotels more affordable in London and Paris. “Europeans may be thinking ‘I’m not so sure that the US is a welcoming place to visit’,” Edwards said. “Equally, it might be that Americans are thinking ‘how welcome would I be if I go to Europe this year?’”",

    "title": "‘A new golden age’: how rightwing media stuck by Trump as global markets collapsed",
    "article_text": "WhileDonald Trumprecently instituted and paused hefty tariffs, sparking a trade war and chaos in financial markets, most of the country’s conservative media either applauded the US president or critiqued the policy but not the person behind it, according to journalists and observers of conservative media. Meanwhile, economists, business leaders, Democrats and even some Republicans warned that the tariffs, which prompted the largestAmerican stock market dropsince the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, could cause a recession. “News is what impacts the greatest number of people,” like tariffs and “the evaporation of wealth and the ripple effect on not just the US economy, but the global economy”, said Howard Polskin, president ofThe Righting, a newsletter and website that monitors conservative media. “By any stretch of imagination, that should be a lead story.” But the chaos of last week posed a serious challenge to many aspects of rightwing US media, which often acts as a largely unquestioning cheerleader for Trump and his Maga movement. The story was sometimes played down, sometimes cheered but rarely seriously questioned – even amid warnings of price rises, recession and cratering investments, especially precious 401(k) retirement accounts. The most popular conservative news source in the United States is Fox News, which has amuch larger audiencethan CNN and the leftwing MSNBC network. Its hosts, such as Sean Hannity and Jesse Watters, consistently praise Trumpand bolsterhisinaccurate claims. But Fox News has faced new competition from Newsmax and One American News Network (OANN), networks that positioned themselves as even more reliable Trump supporters. The Wall Street Journal, which has the same owner as Fox News, features a right-leaning opinion section, but also has done lengthy investigations intoTrumpandJoe Bidenand is a favorite among people in the financial sector. Rightwing commentators such as Tucker Carlson and Ben Shapiro also command a large audience through podcasts and social media. After Trump declared 2 April “liberation day” and announced that the country would on 5 April institute a 10% universal tariff on all imported goods and on 9 April start “reciprocal tariffs” on some of its largest trading partners, including a 34% tariff on imports from China and a 20% tariff on goods from the European Union,Hannity describedit as “a day that will be remembered as a turning point and the start, I hope for every American, of a new golden age”. China retaliated with a 34% tariff. Global stock markets fell sharply; the Dow Jones industrial average declined more than 2,000 points over the next two days. Economists and leaders of financial institutions said that the tariffsincreased the likelihoodof a recession and inflation. Most Republican lawmakers stood behind the president; a minority, like SenatorsTed CruzandRand Paul, expressed opposition and said the tariffs amounted to atax increasefor Americans. While Fox Business, a sibling network,had guestswhocriticized the tariffs, Fox News personalities told viewers nervous about their investments that everything would work out well. A Fox News spokesperson did not respond to the Guardian’s requests for an interview. “I don’t really care about my 401(k) today,”Jeanine Pirrosaid on 3 April on the show The Five. “We’ve got to have manufacturing in this country … and Donald Trump is the only one who could do it because he’s got the biggest consumer base in the world. He’s not afraid of anybody.” Despite the market upheaval, theFox Newscommentators were “in too deep” to break with Trump, said Matt Gertz, a senior fellow at Media Matters for America, a leftwing advocacy group. “They have, for nearly a decade now, sold their audience on the sense thatDonald Trumpwould be a good president,” Gertz said 7 April. “Now he is single-handedly causing a worldwide market collapse,” but “they can’t abandon him”. Other conservative news organizations opted to focus on other issues. At one point on 8 April, the only story on tariffs on theOANN frontpageconcerned the former speaker of the US House of RepresentativesNancy Pelosiand her comments on tariffs in 1996. The network did interview Arthur Laffer, a conservative economist who Trump awarded thePresidential Medal of Freedom. Laffer said that if Trump kept the tariffs, he didn’t see how the country could avoid a recession, but he still “could not think of one person on Earth that I would prefer more to be president”. On 9 April at Newsmax, the headline of their main story read, “Trump: Tariffs Bring in $2 Billion a Day.” The actual number this month was about $200m,Reuters reported. “A lot of times it feels more like propaganda,” Polskin said of the cable networks’ coverage. “I find it all extremely alarming, the stock market and that consumers of rightwing media could be misled so egregiously.” Newsmax did not respond to the Guardian’s request for an interview. There are exceptions in the conservative media sphere. The Journal has criticized Trump and his tariff policy. Sign up toThis Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration after newsletter promotion “Trump Owns the Economy Now. He can try to blame the Fed, but the tariff blunder is his alone,” was the headline of arecent editorial. Their editorial pages have been “characterized through the years as sort of the bastion of conservatism”, said Rick Edmonds, media business analyst for the Poynter Institute. “They are not at all sympathetic to the tariff actions.” Shapiro, the rightwing pundit and a founder of the Daily Wire, devoted much of his podcasts after “liberation day” to scrutinizing thetariffs and questionedwhether they could actually bring manufacturers back to the United States. But Shapiro reassured listeners that he supported the president. “What exactly is this designed to do?” Shapiro said of the tariffs during a 3 April episode of his podcast. “It is predicated on a bad idea of how international trade works. I’ve said this a thousand times: this is not coming from a place of I want Trump to fail.” Shapiro called for Trump tofire Peter Navarro, the White House trade adviser who reportedlyshaped the tariffs strategy. But, of course, it was Trump who instituted them. “In general, the rightwing media, they are like Republican politicians. They don’t want to cross Trump,” Edmonds said. Still,Aaron Rupar, a journalist who tracks speeches and interviews Trump and his officials give to conservative media, thought their coverage of the tariffs was “a little more honest” than their coverage of events like the January 6 attack on the Capitol or the trials Trump faced when he was out of office. “With financial data, it’s a little harder to gaslight people,” he said. Ultimately, hours after the reciprocal tariffs took effect, Trumpannounced a 90-day pauseon them, except for China, whose tariff he increased to 125%. “Many of you in the media clearly missed The Art of the Deal,” the White House press secretary,Karoline Leavitt, saidafterwards, referring to Trump’s book. “You clearly failed to see what President Trump is doing here.” A day later, with stocks still down significantly from before “liberation day”, Ainsley Earhardt, a Fox News host,reiterated Leavitt’s point. “This is the art of the deal,” she said. “This shows how strong our president is.”",

    "article_text": "Tanzania’s electoral commission has barred the main opposition party, Chadema, from contesting presidential and parliamentary elections due to take place later this year. The Independent National Elections Commission (INEC) announced the decision on Saturday, stating that the party failed to sign a mandatory code of conduct agreement by the required deadline for the polls expected to take place in October. “Any party that did not sign the code of conduct will not participate in the general election,” said Ramadhani Kailima, the commission’s director of elections, adding that the disqualification extends to all by-elections until 2030. There was no immediate response from Chadema. The announcement comes days after Chadema leader Tundu Lissu wascharged with treason, accused of inciting rebellion and attempting to stop the elections from going ahead. Prosecutors claimed he urged the public to take action against the vote, though he was not permitted to enter a plea. The charge carries the possibility of a death sentence. Lissu, a former presidential candidate, has long been a vocal critic of the governing Chama cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party and its leader, President Samia Suluhu Hassan, who is seeking a second term. Chadema had already warned it would boycott the polls unless meaningful electoral reforms were introduced. Earlier on Saturday, the party confirmed it would not attend the signing ceremony for the electoral code of conduct, describing the move as part of its broader campaign to push for changes in how elections are conducted. The disqualification of Chadema and the treason case against its leader are expected to raise new questions about the state of democracy in the East African nation. Human rights organisations and opposition groups have accused the government of clamping down on dissent, citing a pattern of unexplained abductions and killings of political activists. President Hassan’s government has denied any role in these alleged abuses and maintains it is committed to upholding human rights. CCM has repeatedly rejected accusations of undermining the opposition or manipulating the electoral process.",

    "article_text": "The Sudanese paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has carried out a two-day attack on famine-hit camps for displaced people in the Darfur region that killed more than 100 people, including 20 children and nine aid workers, according to the United Nations. Clementine Nkweta-Salami, the UN resident and humanitarian coordinator in Sudan, on Saturday said the RSF and allied militias launched an offensive on the Zamzam and Abu Shorouk camps and the nearby city of el-Fasher, the provincial capital of North Darfur province. The camps were attacked on Friday and again on Saturday, Nkweta-Salami said in a statement, and nine aid workers were killed “while operating one of the very few remaining health posts” in Zamzam camp. Zamzam and Abu Shouk shelter more than 700,000 people who have been forced to flee their homes across Darfur during past bouts of fighting in the region, according to UN figures. “This represents yet another deadly and unacceptable escalation in a series of brutal attacks on displaced people and aid workers in Sudan since the onset of this conflict nearly two years ago,” she said. “I strongly urge those committing such acts to immediately desist.” The UN official didn’t identify the aid workers, but Sudan’s Doctors’ Union said in a statement that six medical workers with the Relief International group were killed when their hospital in Zamzam came under attack on Friday. They include Mahmoud Babaker Idris, a physician at the hospital, and Adam Babaker Abdallah, head of the group in the region, the union said. It blamed the RSF for “this criminal and barbaric act”. Relief International confirmed the death of its nine workers, saying they were killed in a “targeted attack on all health infrastructure in the region”, including the group’s clinic. The group said the central market in Zamzam and hundreds of makeshift homes in the camp were destroyed in the attack. Zamzam and Abu Shouk are among five areas in Sudan where famine was detected by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, IPC, a global hunger monitoring group. The war has created the world’s largest humanitarian crisis, with about 25 million people – half of Sudan’s population – facing extreme hunger. In recent weeks, the paramilitaries have stepped up their attacks on el-Fasher – the only state capital in Darfur still outside their control – after the army recaptured the national capital Khartoum last month. Amnesty International published areportearlier this month accusing the RSF of subjecting women and girls to “horrific” sexual violence and gang rape, as part of their strategy in the country’s civil war.",

    "title": "Liverpool vs West Ham: Premier League – team news, how to follow, stream",
    "article_text": "Who:Liverpool vs West Ham UnitedWhat:English Premier LeagueWhere:Anfield, Liverpool, United KingdomWhen:Sunday at 2pm (13:00 GMT) FollowAl Jazeera Sport‘s live text and photo commentary stream. Liverpool entertain West Ham United in the Premier League with the chance to move 13 points clear at the top of the table. Second-placed Arsenal’s 1-1 home draw with Brentford on Saturday means the Reds could secure the title with two more wins, should the Gunners lose their next match. Al Jazeera Sport takes a closer look at the match after an eventful few days for Arne Slot’s club. With Mohamed Salah havingsigned a contract extension at Liverpoolon Friday, manager Arne Slot now wants to tie up the future of defenders Virgil van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold to help the Premier League leaders finish the season strong. The club said forward Salah, whose deal was set to expire in June, has signed a new extension that would keep him at Anfield for another two years. While fans were thrilled by the news, anticipation is building over Liverpool captain van Dijk, who is out of contract at the end of the season and is tipped to extend his stay, while full-backAlexander-Arnold has been linked with Real Madrid. “If you want to sign players or keep players, it is always a positive one of our star players has made the choice to extend,” Slot told a news conference before Sunday’s game. “In general, people see me as relaxed and that has all to do with the trust I have in the quality of the players and the quality of leadership in [club owners] FSG. That is why I am indeed calm. “They will do what is best for the club. If that is extending, then it is, if not, they will find a solution. “I have also spoken to Mo and followed the process. It gave me confidence. Sorting them before the end of the season would be useful.” Today's results in the top six... 🏆 Arsenal miss the chance to close the gap on Liverpool to 8 points🌳 Nott'm Forest lose at home for the first time since November🔵 Man City beat Crystal Palace 5-2 to boost their Champions League hopes🟣 Aston Villa's good form continues…pic.twitter.com/K3oHunOWJL — Premier League (@premierleague)April 12, 2025 Slot added that Salah’s decision proved that the Egyptian believes the club can compete for more trophies as they close in on the Premier League title this season with a 10-point lead at the top of the standings. “He has always been judged as a player, but I also see him as a human being and he is humble, works hard and puts so much effort into becoming the player he is. He keeps up that effort every single day,” Slot said. “Salah can score goals if he is not in the best half hour or 15 minutes, and that is why he is mentally so strong. He has to be strong mentally, and apart from the other things, that is probably what stands out for me. “What it might tell you is that it is not only a good season now, we want more next season and Mo is convinced we can do so. So that is positive for us.” West Ham are 16th in the table – just two places above the relegation zone – having only won nine of their 31 games. The Hammers do have a 15-point cushion to the bottom three, virtually assuring their top-flight status for next season. This is the 152nd meeting between the clubs with Liverpool winning 83 matches and West Ham winning 29. The first meeting between the sides was in 1914 with the side’s sharing a 1-1 draw in the FA Cup in London. Liverpool won the replay 5-1 on Merseyside. Their first league meeting came in 1923 with Liverpool winning 2-0 at home. Liverpool have won both previous meetings this season – netting 10 goals in the process. These sides met in the League Cup in September, with Liverpool winning 5-1 at Anfield. The Reds then won 5-0 in London in December in the reverse fixture in the league. Slot confirmed goalkeeper Alisson Becker is available for Sunday’s game after undergoing concussion protocols after suffering a head injury while on international duty with Brazil. Conor Bradley is in line for his first start – and only his third of the season – following his return from injury. Joe Gomez and Trent Alexander-Arnold remain out. Niclas Fullkrug came on as a sub to score in the 2-2 with Bournemouth and could make his first start since January. Michail Antonio and Crysencio Summerville remain sidelined by long-term injuries.",

    "title": "UK steps in to save British Steel as nationalisation looms",
    "article_text": "The UK government has taken effective control of British Steel in order to keep its blast furnaces running, after lawmakers approved an emergency rescue. With 3,500 jobs hanging in the balance, British ministers rushed to push through legislation on Saturday to allow the state to temporarily assume operational control. The intervention follows a breakdown in talks between the UK government and British Steel’s Chinese owner, Jingye Group, over plans to transition the firm to greener production methods. After the vote, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer travelled to the site, warning that the blast furnaces – losing $915,600 (700,000 pounds) a day – were on the brink of closure. “You and your colleagues for years have been the backbone of British Steel, and it’s really important that we recognize that,” Starmer said. “It’s your jobs, your lives, your communities, your families.” Lawmakers had been recalled from their Easter recess for the emergency Saturday sitting. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told MPs that the new law would give the government power to manage operations, ensure workers are paid, and secure vital raw materials to keep the furnaces going. Reynolds said a full state takeover was “increasingly likely” given the conduct of the firm’s current owners. “A failure to act today would prevent any more desirable outcome from even being considered,” he said. The bill passed the House of Commons unopposed. If nationalised, British Steel would become the UK’s largest state rescue since the 2008 banking crisis. The collapse of its Scunthorpe operations would leave the UK as the only G7 nation unable to produce virgin steel – made directly from raw materials like iron ore and coke. Already under pressure from a global supply glut and soaring energy prices, the company was further hit by new US tariffs of 25 percent, affecting 5 percent of its annual steel exports worth approximately $520m. Reynolds stressed that reliance on foreign steel would grow if the furnaces shutdown, and pledged to fight for their future while also pushing to lift US trade restrictions. The government has already pledged $3.2bn to support the steel sector and aims to unveil a long-term strategy in the coming months.",

    "title": "Israel cuts off Rafah, issues new forced displacement orders for Gaza",
    "article_text": "The Israeli military has said it completed the construction of what it calls the Morag Corridor, whichcuts off the city of Rafahfrom the rest of Gaza, as it expanded its attacks on the southern part of the Strip. The Israeli army’s Arabic language spokesperson on Saturday issued new forced displacement orders for several neighbourhoods in Khan Younis, warning of an imminent attack “with great force” in response to alleged Hamas rockets fired at Israel from this area. Residents in Qizan an-Najjar, Qizan Abu Rashwan, al-Salam, al-Manara, al-Qurain, Maen, al-Batn al-Sameen, Jurt al-Lot, al-Fakhari and the southern neighbourhoods of Bani Suheila were ordered to leave their homes and proceed to al-Mawasi, on Gaza’s sea coast. The announcement came amid a barrage of drone attacks and artillery shelling on Khan Younis that killed at least two people. Israel’s Defence Minister Israel Katz said the Morag Corridor effectively turned Rafah into an “Israeli security zone” and added that the Netzarim Corridor, which divides the Strip in two, would also be expanded. “Willful passage” will be granted for Palestinians who wish to flee Gaza, Katz said in a statement, mentioning againUS President Trump’s planto remove Palestinians from Gaza. Katz told Gaza’s besieged population he was offering them the “last chance to banish Hamas and release all hostages, stopping the war,” or else Israeli operations will spread to “most of Gaza’s territory”. Hamas issued a statement accusing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of prolonging the war despite repeatedcalls from within Israeli society to halt the conflict. “The equation is clear: the release of captives in exchange for a cessation of the war. The world accepts it, but Netanyahu rejects it,” it said. “The blood of Gaza’s children and the occupation’s prisoners are victims of Netanyahu’s ambitions to remain in power and to escape prosecution”. Al Jazeera’s Nour Odeh, reporting from Jordan’s capital Amman, said the Israeli defence minister had given Palestinians an ultimatum. “Topple Hamas and deliver the Israeli captives, Katz said, that’s the only way to end the war,” Odeh said. About 2.1 million Palestinians are now squeezed into about one-third of Gaza and no trucks carrying aid, food, cooking gas, or fuel have entered the Strip since Israel reimposed a blockade last month. Katz has publicly stated that, since breaking the ceasefire with Hamas on March 18, Israel’s goal has been to apply pressure on the civilian population, the correspondent added. Robert Geist Pinfold, a lecturer in international security at King’s College London, told Al Jazeera that while Israel says the creation of the Morag Corridor is purely operational and meant to constrain Hamas, it appears to be part of a longer-term Israeli strategy to control Gaza from afar. “Israel has always sought to control the Gaza Strip, particularly to oversee what comes in and what comes out and ‘security’ over the territories, as Israel would call it,” he said. “These [Morag, Netzarim and Philadelphi] corridors are named after settlements, and the settlements did not appear there randomly. They were put there for this specific purpose: to cut off Gaza’s urban areas and give Israel the ability to squeeze the territory when and if it desires.”",

    "title": "Trump exempts smartphones, computers from ‘reciprocal’ tariffs",
    "article_text": "Smartphones, laptops and a host of other tech components will be spared from the Trump administration’s so-called “reciprocal tariffs”, including steep 125 percent duties on imports from China, according to a notice issued by US Customs and Border Protection. The US CBP on Friday listed 20 product categories, including the very broad 8471 code for all computers, laptops, disc drives and automatic data processing. It also included semiconductor devices, equipment, memory chips and flat panel displays. The exclusions provide welcome relief to major US technology firms, including Apple and many other importers, which rely on Chinese manufacturing. There was no immediate comment from the White House on the exemptions. But the exemptions suggest an increasing awareness within the Trump administration of the pain that his tariffs had in store for US consumers, especially on popular products such as smartphones, laptops and other electronics. Daniel Ives, senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities, called the US exemptions “the best news possible for tech investors”. “US tariff exclusions will apply to computers, smartphones, and chip-making equipment which takes [away] a huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector,” he said in a note cited by the AFP news agency. Without these exemptions, he said, “the US Tech industry would be taken back a decade and the AI Revolution thesis would have been slowed significantly.” The move came as retaliatory Chinese import tariffs of 125 percent on US goods took effect on Saturday, with Beijing standing defiant against its primary trade competitor. Earlier in the week, Trump officials announced a 90-day reprieve on “reciprocal” tariffs for most countries, introducing instead a flat 10-percent rate, though China remained excluded from the revised scheme.",

    "title": "Man City survive Crystal Palace scare to climb into Premier League top four",
    "article_text": "Manchester City stormed back from two goals down to thrash Crystal Palace 5-2 as Kevin De Bruyne’s masterclass kept alive their top-five challenge. Pep Guardiola’s side were in danger of suffering a major setback in their bid to reach the Champions League after goals from Eberechi Eze and Chris Richards put Palace in control at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday. But, in his first home match since announcing he would leave at the end of the season, De Bruyne stole the show with the kind of dynamic display that made him one of the Premier League’s all-time greats before his recent injury-plagued decline. The Belgian midfielder, who has been at City since 2015, netted to prompt the revival before Omar Marmoush equalised late in the first half. Mateo Kovacic converted De Bruyne’s assist to put City ahead after the interval and goals from youngsters James McAtee and Nico O’Reilly sealed the stirring escape act. The only concern for Guardiola was an injury to Ederson that forced the City keeper to come off in the second half. Guardiola said this week he was optimistic City would qualify for the Champions League because their “spirit” is back after a troubled campaign. City had dropped out of the top five after Newcastle’s win at Leicester on Monday, but this much-needed victory lifted them into fourth place. Although City are back in the Champions League places, they are still not in control of their destiny. Fifth-placed Chelsea will go back above them if they beat struggling Ipswich on Sunday, while sixth-placed Newcastle are only two points behind and have two games in hand. Guardiola could have been in an even worse position, however, after his creaky defence was ruthlessly exposed in the sixth minute. Daniel Munoz’s pass sent Ismaila Sarr racing down the flank to deliver a low cross that Eze finished with ease at the far post. City were in disarray at the back and Oliver Glasner’s men punished them again in the 21st minute. Ederson failed to make contact in his attempt to punch clear from Adam Wharton’s corner and Richards muscled in front of Ruben Dias to head home from close range. Semi-automated offside technology – being used in the Premier League for the first time this weekend – disallowed a third goal for Palace after Eze had finished another flowing move. De Bruyne is a shadow of the player who was so instrumental in City’s run of six titles in seven seasons. But the 33-year-old rolled back the years to inspire City’s fight back, serving notice with a ferocious 25-yard strike that cannoned back off the post. Unlucky not to score minutes earlier, De Bruyne reduced the deficit in the 33rd minute, lashing a thunderous free kick past Henderson via the post. City suddenly had all the momentum and Marmoush hauled them level in the 36th minute. De Bruyne’s header from McAtee’s cross reached Ilkay Gundogan, whose sliced effort led Marmoush to drive in his seventh goal since arriving from Eintracht Frankfurt in the January transfer window. City’s comeback was complete two minutes into the second half as Kovacic capped a swaggering raid. Gundogan and O’Reilly combined to find De Bruyne and his pass was perfectly weighted for Kovacic to drill past Henderson from 20 yards. After 12 substitute appearances, McAtee marked his first Premier League start for City with a goal in the 56th minute. Ederson launched a high punt downfield and McAtee sprinted through the statuesque Palace defence, rounded Henderson and tapped into the empty net. O’Reilly capped the demolition with his first league goal for City in the 79th minute as the 20-year-old volleyed home from the edge of the arena.",

    "title": "‘Camouflaged invasion’: Panama opposition slams security pact with the US",
    "article_text": "Opposition politicians in Panama have accused the United States of launching a “camouflaged invasion” of the country after President Donald Trump confirmed the deployment of US soldiers days after the two countries signed a security pact. US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Thursday confirmed that deals, including a memorandum of understanding, were reached between the US and Panamanian authorities in efforts to secure “the Panama Canal from Chinese influence”. “The Panama Canal is key terrain that must be secured by Panama, with America, and not China,” Hegseth said in a statement on Wednesday during his three-day trip to Panama. Hegseth said a deal with the Panama Canal Authority would allow US warships and auxiliary ships “first and free” passage through the canal that connects the Pacific Ocean with the Atlantic and is a chief conduit for global trade. He added that US troops would be deployed at three former military bases – Fort Sherman, Rodman Naval Base and Howard Air Force Base – as part of a deal signed with Panama’s Ministry of Public Security, raising concerns in Panama. The last US troops were pulled out from the country in 1999. In a video posted on social media on Friday, Ricardo Lombana, the leader of the opposition Another Way Movement, called the memorandum of understanding reached between the US and Panamanian governments days earlier “an invasion without firing a shot”. The agreement was reached after a three-day visit by US Defense Secretary Hegseth. On Thursday, President Trump confirmed that US soldiers and military personnel were deployed to Panama as part of the deal, telling reporters, “We’ve moved a lot of troops to Panama.” Despite an insistence by the Panamanian government that these are not “military bases” and that the deal is temporary, the opposition believes the US has re-established its military presence in the country. “No matter what you want to call it, what we’ve read in this memo is the establishment of military bases,” said Lombana, the opposition leader. He added that the “firm step” slogan that the government has been using in its political messaging now “limps and kneels under pressure”. The last US military bases in Panama were evacuated in 1999 as part of the Torrijos-Carter Treaties signed in 1977 with the aim of handing control over the canal to Panama. The US also invaded Panama in 1989 as part of what it called “Operation Just Cause” to depose leader Manuel Noriega. US troops were accused of killing thousands of civilians and destroying homes and infrastructure during the operation, leaving a controversial legacy. That is partly why frustration has been growing in Panama over Trump’s declaration that he intends to “take back” the Panama Canal. The US has refused to acknowledge Panama’s ownership over the canal as part of the negotiations that led to the defence pact signed earlier this week. The Panamanian opposition, along with the local chapter of Transparency International, which works to promote more responsible governance practices, have called on the government to inform the country about the precise contents of the agreement with the US. China has heavilycriticised the agreement, maintaining that it views the Panama Canal as a permanently neutral international passageway. The canal handles about 40 percent of US container traffic and 5 percent of global trade.",

    "article_text": "Hundreds of flights have been cancelled and public parks are closed in Beijing, as strong winds driven by a cold vortex from neighbouring Mongolia felled hundreds of trees and crushed cars across the Chinese capital. Beijing issued its second-highest gale alert on Saturday, the first time in a decade, warning 22 million residents to avoid non-essential travel as winds could potentially break April records dating from 1951. The city’s two vast international airports, Beijing Capital and Daxing, cancelled 693 flights on Saturday afternoon with warnings of more violent weather on its way, especially in the country’s north and along coastal areas. More flights and trains were also cancelled as some parts of the country recorded their most powerful winds in more than 75 years, registering at up to 148km/h (92mph). The winds brought late snowfalls in Inner Mongolia and hailstones in southern China. In Beijing, the Universal Studios theme park was forced to shut operations at least through Sunday, while historic sites such as Beijing’s Forbidden City, Summer Palace and Temple of Heaven were closed. Football matches and other outdoor events have also been suspended. A half-marathon set for Sunday featuring humanoid robots competing with humans in a bid to showcase China’s technological advances was also cancelled. The winds dominated social media chats, with many people expressing concern for food delivery workers braving the conditions. “In weather like this, we can choose not to order delivery – it’s too hard for them,” one Weibo user wrote. Sandstorms raging over a stretch from Inner Mongolia to the Yangtze river region also crippled road travel in eight other provinces, Xinhua and state broadcaster CCTV said. Sandstorms were also expected to affect Shanghai from Saturday afternoon through to Sunday morning. High winds and sandstorms are generated in China’s dry north, where the Gobi and Taklamakan deserts sit surrounded by grasslands and, mountains and forests. China has fought a decades-long battle to lessen the impact of sandstorms, especially in Beijing, which sits on the edge of an arid region, and where such storms can reduce visibility to practically zero, send sand into buildings and clothing and cause severe discomfort to the eyes, nose and ears.",

    "article_text": "At least three suspected rebel fighters and one Indian soldier have been killed in separate firefights inIndian-administered Kashmirless than a week after Interior Minister Amit Shah visited the disputed territory. The Indian army said on Saturday that Indian soldiers killed three fighters in a gun battle that began on Wednesday in a remote forest in Kishtwar in southern Kashmir. Senior Indian army official Brigadier JBS Rathi said troops had displayed “great tactical acumen”. “In the gun battle, three terrorists were neutralised,” he told reporters on Saturday in a commonly used term for rebels opposed to Indian rule in Kashmir. Weapons and “war-like stores” were recovered from the site, the army’s White Knight Corps posted on social media platform X. A soldier was killed in a separate incident late on Friday night in Sunderbani district along the Line of Control (LoC), the de facto border that cuts Indian-administered Kashmir into two. The White Knight Corps said on X troops had “foiled an infiltration attempt” there. Muslim-majority Kashmir has been divided between nuclear-armed rivals India and Pakistan since their independence in 1947, with both claiming the territory in full but governing only part of it. India has an estimated 500,000 soldiers deployed in the territory after an armed uprising against Indian rule in the late 1980s. Thousands of people, most of them Kashmir civilians, have been killed as rebel groups have fought Indian forces, seeking independence for Kashmir or its merger with Pakistan. In 2019,a reportby the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights accused India of human rights violations in Kashmir and called for a commission of inquiry into the allegations. The report came nearly a year after the then UN human rights chief Zeid Ra’ad Al Husseincalled for an international investigationinto abuses in the Muslim-majority region. Last month,four police officersand two suspected rebels were killed in the region in a clash that also wounded several police officers. The territory has simmered in anger since 2019 when Prime Minister Narendra Modi ended the region’s semi-autonomy and drastically curbed dissent, civil liberties and media freedoms while intensifying military operations. Thousands of additional troops, including special forces, were deployed across southern mountainous areas last year following a series of deadly rebel attacks that killed more than 50 soldiers over three years. India regularly blames Pakistan for pushing rebels across the LoC to launch attacks on Indian forces. Islamabad denies the allegation, saying it only supports Kashmir’s struggle for self-determination.",

    "title": "Africa doesn’t need aid. It needs control over its critical minerals",
    "article_text": "The decision of US President Donald Trump’s administration to suspend foreign aid and shut down the USAID agency has sent shockwaves across the development industry. In 2024, nearly a third of the $41bn in US foreign aid went to Africa, helping support various sectors from healthcare to education and sanitation. But as aid organisations sound alarm bells and government officials wring their hands over suspended programmes, we are missing the bigger picture: Africa’s continued dependence on foreign aid is a choice, not a necessity. Our continent sits atop some of the world’s largest reserves of the very minerals that will power the future, yet we remain trapped in cycles of aid dependency. It is time to change that. Let us be clear about what is at stake. The Democratic Republic of the Congo supplies 70 percent of the world’s cobalt – the essential ingredient in electric vehicle batteries. South Africa produces 75 percent of the world’s platinum and 50 percent of palladium. Mozambique and Madagascar possess some of the largest graphite deposits globally. Zimbabwe has the largest deposits of caesium, a critical metal used in GPS and 5G systems. More than just rocks and metals, these are the keys to the global clean energy transition. Every electric vehicle, solar panel, and wind turbine depends on minerals that Africa has in abundance. Yet here we are, still exporting raw materials like colonial-era vassals while begging for aid from the same countries that profit from our resources. The math is infuriating: We sell raw cobalt for $26-30 per kg (2.2lb), while battery-grade processed materials fetch $150-200. We’re giving away more than 80 percent of the value chain to foreign processors and manufacturers. This isn’t just bad business – it’s economic malpractice. The global battery market alone will reach $250bn by 2030. The renewable energy sector is growing at breakneck speed, with solar installations increasing 26 percent annually. Clearly, Africa’s mineral riches represent the greatest economic opportunity of our generation. But instead of positioning ourselves to capture this value, we are debating how to patch the holes left by suspended aid programmes. Critics will say we lack the infrastructure, expertise, and capital to process these minerals ourselves. They are right – for now. But this is precisely where we should be investing our resources and focusing our political will. The Chinese understood this decades ago, which is why they have poured nearly $58bn into securing control of critical mineral supply chains across Africa. They saw the future while we were busy filling out aid application forms. The solution is not complicated, though it is challenging. We need to build processing facilities, not just extraction sites. We need to establish special economic zones focused on mineral beneficiation, not merely export terminals. We need to invest in research and development facilities that can adapt and improve processing technologies. Most importantly, we need to think and act regionally. Imagine a Southern African Development Community Battery Materials Initiative, where countries pool resources and expertise to build integrated value chains. Picture an East African Rare Earth Elements Cooperation Framework that turns our mineral wealth into high-tech manufacturing capabilities. These are not pipe dreams – they are missed opportunities every day we continue business as usual. The environmental critics will say mining is dirty and destructive. They’re not wrong about the risks, but they’re wrong about the solution. The answer isn’t to leave our minerals in the ground; it’s to set our own high standards for sustainable extraction and processing. We can build a mining and processing industry that protects our environment and benefits our communities. We must, because the alternative is watching foreign companies do it their way while we deal with the consequences. The aid suspension has created human suffering that cannot be ignored. HIV treatment programmes, educational initiatives, and food security projects are all at risk. But if these programmes are essential – and many of them are – why should we depend on the political whims of foreign governments to fund them? Our minerals would pay for these programmes many times over once we capture their full value. What we need now is political courage and unity of purpose. We need leaders who can look beyond the next election cycle and envision an Africa that finances its own development. We need business leaders who can build processing facilities instead of export terminals. We need educational institutions that train chemical engineers and metallurgists instead of aid programme administrators. The current crisis must serve as our catalyst for transformation. Every suspended aid dollar should drive us to capture tenfold value from our minerals, and every diplomatic slight should strengthen our resolve to build African solutions. The choice is clear: We can spend the coming decades haggling over aid budgets, or we can finally take control of our destiny through the strategic development of our mineral wealth. It’s time for Africa to transform from the world’s raw materials store into its manufacturing powerhouse.

    "title": "Gabon votes in first presidential election since the 2023 coup",
    "article_text": "Votersin Gabon have cast their ballots in the presidential election, as military leader Brice Oligui Nguema looks to cement his grip on power in the first election since he led the 2023 coup. Polls closed at 6pm (17:00 GMT) on Saturday and counting was under way, with interim results expected overnight or on Sunday. Nearly one million people, including some 28,000 overseas, are registered to vote in this oil-rich but poor African nation of 2.3 million people. Al Jazeera’s Ali Hashem, reporting from Libreville, said that many voters were “stuck between hope and fear”. Nguema, who had been instrumental in ending 55 years of iron-fisted dynastic rule of the Bongo family led by former leader Ali Bongo, has been leading in opinion polls. Bongo family members were accused of looting Gabon’s wealth. Aurele Ossantanga Mouila, 30, voted for the first time ever after finishing his shift as a croupier in a casino. “I did not have confidence in the earlier regime,” he said. Nguema took the role of transitional president while overseeing the formation of a government that includes civilians, tasked with drawing up a new constitution after the 2023 coup. The election comes at a time of high unemployment, regular power and water shortages, a lack of infrastructure and heavy government debt. Nguema ditched his military uniform as he campaigned for a seven-year term against seven rivals, including Alain-Claude Bilie By Nze, who served as prime minister underAli Bongobefore the coup. He has predicted an “historic victory” in the election. “The builder is here, the special candidate, the one you called,” Nguema said on Thursday, amid the music and dancing at his closing rally in the capital, Libreville. But critics accuse Nguema, who had promised to hand power back to civilians, of failing to move on from the years of plunder of the country’s vast mineral wealth under the Bongos, under whom he served for years. Bilie By Nze, Nguema’s main opponent, has cast himself as the candidate for a “complete rupture”. “In reality, it’s an election of total change. It’s a challenge and we are at a crossroads,” he told Al Jazeera. He has accused Nguema, who led the Republican Guard in the Bongo years, of representing a continuity of the old system. Nguema formerly served as an aide-de-camp to Omar Bongo before becoming chief of the presidential guard under his son Ali Bongo. Whoever wins will have to meet the high hopes of a country where one in three people lives below the poverty line despite its vast resource wealth, according to the World Bank. Gabon’s debt rose to 73.3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) last year and is projected to reach 80 percent this year.",

    "title": "Argentina secures $42bn from IMF, others as it lifts currency controls",
    "article_text": "Argentina has clinched $42bn in medium-term funding from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and two other financial institutions as it announced it is abandoning most of its tight currency controls. The IMF’s executive board late on Friday approved a $20bn bailout package that will be doled out over the next four years, with an immediate disbursement of $12bn and another $2bn available after a review planned for June. The World Bank also announced a $12bn support package for Argentina, and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) said it will provide up to $10bn in financing for the public and private sectors. Both are three-year plans. PresidentJavier Mileiannounced on Friday that he will – starting on Monday – lift most of Argentina’s strict capital and currency controls as part of agreements that secured the huge funding deals. “Today we are breaking the cycle of disillusionment and disenchantment and are beginning to move forward for the first time,” he said on national television while flanked by his ministers. “We have eliminated the exchange rate controls on the Argentine economy for good.” The capital controls, known in Argentina as “el cepo” or “the clamp”, were imposed by a previous administration in 2019 with the aim of preventing further financial downfall and capital flight that the country has been dealing with for years. The controls clamped down on individuals’ ability to buy US dollars, giving rise to a black market that is widely used by citizens. They also restricted companies’ access to dollars, discouraging foreign investment that Milei needs. The Argentinian central bank now aims to allow the peso to trade within a so-called currency band instead of firmly pegging the beleaguered currency to the dollar. The band ranges from 1,000 to 1,400 pesos per greenback and will expand by 1 percent each month, according to the central bank. In announcing itslatest support package, the IMF said the programme is “expected to catalyse further official financing from multilateral sources” and “seeks to facilitate a timely return to international capital markets”. “The program supports a path toward entrenching macroeconomic stability, strengthening external sustainability, and laying the foundation for stronger and more resilient growth,” it said, adding that its key pillars include “maintaining a strong fiscal anchor, transitioning towards a more robust monetary and FX regime”. The organisation praised Argentinian authorities’ new commitment to a zero-deficit budget target, which has delivered the first fiscal surplus in almost two decades. But to achieve the surplus, Milei has fired tens of thousands of state workers, with hisoverhauls hitting the population hard,including by raising poverty levels.",

    "title": "Brazil’s Bolsonaro ‘stable’ after being hospitalised with abdominal pain",
    "article_text": "Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s former far-right president, has been declared stable and without symptoms but remains in hospital, after complaining of abdominal pain, forcing him to break off a regional tour in northeast Brazil aimed at drumming up political support. The latest health complication on Friday comes six years after Bolsonaro wasstabbed in the stomachjust weeks before the 2018 presidential elections, which he later won. The 70-year-old, who is seeking to make a political comeback even as he faces a criminal trial, started feeling “unbearable abdominal pain” at a political event in the northeastern state of Rio Grande do Norte, a senior member of his Liberal Party said. “After so many similar episodes over the past few years, I had gotten used to the pain and discomfort. But this time, even the doctors were surprised,” Bolsonaro said in a social media post Saturday. Bolsonaro also said he would likely undergo another surgery. Earlier, doctors at Rio Grande Hospital told journalists he was stable and not in need of emergency surgery. They said further procedures would depend on his recovery. In July 2023, a Brazilian courtbarredBolsonaro from holding public office until 2030 after convicting him of abuse of power in his push to cast doubt on the South American country’s electronic voting system. Bolsonaro, who served as president from 2019 to 2022, lost to President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. He has been hoping the ban will be overturned to give him a shot at a return to power in the style of his idol, United States President Donald Trump. But those plans were dimmed last month when Bolsonaro was ordered by the Supreme Court in March to stand trial on charges ofplotting a coup against Lula. If convicted, the former army captain risks a jail term of more than 40 years, and political banishment. Dubbed the “Trump of the Tropics”, Bolsonaro has been the target of multiple investigations since his turbulent years as leader of Latin America’s biggest economy. Bolsonaro, who is hoping to make a comeback in the 2026 presidential elections, was set to start a political tour of Rio Grande do Norte on Friday. The former president has undergone at least four surgeries since his stabbing, including the placement and subsequent removal of a colostomy bag, which made him prone to intestinal disorders.",

    "title": "Over 1,560 killed since Israel broke Gaza truce",
    "article_text": "The number of people killed in Israeli attacks on the Gaza since Israelbroke a ceasefirewith the Palestinian armed group Hamas last month has now exceeded 1,560, according to health officials. In a new statement on Saturday, the Health Ministry in Gaza said Israeli attacks had killed at least 21 people in the latest 24-hour reporting period, bringing the overall number of fatalities since Israel resumed its bombardment of Gaza on March 18 to 1,563. Hundreds of them were children, according to rescuers. A total of 50,933 people have been killed and 116,045 wounded since the start of the war in October 2023, the ministry added in its latest daily update. On Saturday, an Israeli attack on Gaza’s Tuffah neighbourhood killed at least people and wounded two children. Two other Palestinians were killed in al-Atatra district of Beit Lahiya, in the northern part of Gaza, with another killed in an Israeli drone attack on the Qizan an-Najjar area, south of Khan Younis. Several casualties were also reported following Israeli air raids on the tent shelters of civilians in the al-Mawasi area, west of Khan Younis, which Israel had designated a so-called “safe zone”. Reporting from outside al-Ahli Hospital in Deir el-Balah, central Gaza, Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary said a newborn named Sham had succumbed to her wounds after her family was hit in an attack. “She was in very critical condition where her arm was amputated and she died a couple of hours later, because her injury was very critical and doctors were unable to help her situation,” she said. Khoudary reported that the ambulances arriving daily to the hospital have mostly been carrying children and women. “Due to the lack of medical supplies, most of these Palestinian children and women are witnessing a very deteriorating situation,” she added. On Friday, Ravina Shamdasani, spokeswoman for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, reported that 36 of the 224 documented Israeli strikes in Gaza, between March 18 and April 9, involved killings of women and children. In a statement, the Palestinian rights group Al-Haq said thefindings by the UNfurther confirmed a pattern it previously identified. “Such a calculated effort to exterminate women, boys, girls & even infants, has not been witnessed in any other modern conflict,” Al-Haq said in a post on social media. In an interview with Al Jazeera’sUpfront, UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) chief Philippe Lazzarini described the situation in Gaza as a “post-apocalyptic” killing zone. Speaking at the Antalya Diplomacy Forum in Turkiye on Friday, Lazzarini also reiterated that Israel has been preventing the entry of food, fuel, medicine and other vital humanitarian supplies into Gaza since early March, contravening international law. In a separate post on X on Saturday, UNRWA Director of Communications Juliette Touma warned that all basic supplies “are running out” in Gaza. “It means babies, children are going to bed hungry.” Israel has pledged to press on with its military offensive, with officials in recent days outlining plans to seize new swaths of territory in southern Gaza and issuing a series of forced displacement orders. “Palestinians do not know where to go,” Khoudary said, after the latest Israeli orders on Saturday for Shujayea and Khan Younis. According to UNRWA, some 400,000 Palestinians have been forcibly displaced across Gaza since the fragile ceasefire that took effect in January collapsed almost a month ago.",

    "title": "Iran, US conclude ‘constructive’ nuclear talks in Oman, agree to meet again",
    "article_text": "Tehran, Iran –Delegates from the United States and Iran agreed to hold more talks next week after concluding “indirect”nuclear negotiationsin the Omani capital, Muscat. Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs described Saturday’s talks as having been conducted in a “constructive atmosphere and based on mutual respect”, and said chief negotiators “spoke for several minutes in the presence of the Omani Foreign Minister while leaving the negotiations venue”. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff headed the US delegation, while the Iranians were led by Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. He was accompanied by his deputy for political affairs Majid Takht-Ravanchi, deputy for international affairs Kazem Gharibabadi, and Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei. Omani Foreign Minister Badr bin Hamad al-Busaidi acted as chief mediator, taking messages between the delegations who were sitting in separate rooms. The White House issued a statement saying the talks were “positive and constructive”. “These issues are very complicated, and Special Envoy Witkoff’s direct communication today was a step forward in achieving a mutually beneficial outcome,” it said, adding the sides agreed to “meet again next Saturday.” While Trump and his officials had insistedthe talks would be “direct”and “in the same room”, Tehran had stressed that the negotiations would be indirect. Al Jazeera’s diplomatic editor James Bays quoted a source close to the negotiations that both sides were asked to produce a position paper, laying out the areas they think are important for the discussion and their red lines. Iran has emphasised that the talks will solely be focused on its nuclear programme, and not its military capabilities or its“axis of resistance” of aligned forcesacross the region. Shortly before the talks, US President Donald Trump again warned Tehran of military action if a deal is not reached. “I want them not to have a nuclear weapon. I want Iran to be a wonderful, great, happy country, but they can’t have a nuclear weapon,” Trump told reporters on board Air Force One on his way to Florida on Friday night. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt also reiterated a refrain favoured by the Trump administration, saying “there will be all hell to pay” if the president’s demands are not met. “We’ve been very clear that Iran is never going to have a nuclear weapon, and I think that’s what led to this meeting,” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Thursday. Iran and its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have emphasised that theUS cannot be trustedand Iran would not sit down with US officials directly, because Trump unilaterally withdrew from Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers in 2018 during his first term as president. It remains unclear whether the second round of the talks will be direct or carried out similarly to Saturday’s mediated negotiations. Before the talks, a senior aide to Supreme Leader Khamenei said Tehran is seeking a “real and fair” agreement with Washington. “Far from putting up a show and merely talking in front of the cameras, Tehran is seeking a real and fair agreement, important and implementable proposals are ready,” Ali Shamkhani posted on X on Friday. The 2015 accord put stringent limits on Iran’s enrichment of uranium, stockpiles of nuclear material, and research and development in exchange for lifting United Nations sanctions. The US had imposed its harshest sanctions yet after reneging on the deal in 2018. Those sanctions were only exacerbated by Trump’s successor Joe Biden,dealing heavy blows to the economyand 90 million Iranians. Iran’s currency continues to hover around all-time low rates as a result of external pressure and local mismanagement, but it regained some lost ground after the talks concluded without collapsing, showing market eagerness for a deal. The European powers party to the 2015 accord, namely France, the United Kingdom and Germany, have also been imposing sanctions on Iran, both due to its nuclear advances in the aftermath of Trump’s withdrawal and because of tensions over the Russia-Ukraine war. The European Union on Friday said there was “no alternative to diplomacy” while Germany urged both sides to reach a “diplomatic solution”. China and Russia, the other signatories of the deal, have opposed Western efforts to pressure Iran through passing censure resolutions at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). They have forged closer political and military ties with Tehran. Iran has warned it would abandon the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) andexpel all remaining IAEA nuclear inspectorsif the Western powers make good on their threats. Trump and his officials, along with top Israeli leaders, have repeatedly warned that Iran would be extensively bombed if it fails to agree to their demands over its nuclear programme. Israel remains the biggest opponent of any prospective Iran-US agreement. US and Israeli leaders have suggested main nuclear facilities, refineries and civilian infrastructure like power plants would be attacked if negotiations fail. On Thursday, Washington imposed additional sanctions on Iran, targeting its oil network and nuclear programme. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has discussed with Trump the so-called “Libyan model” to deal with Iran’s nuclear programme, meaning he is seeking a full dismantlement and surrender of all nuclear capabilities. But Tehran has remained defiant, arguing nuclear knowledge and development gained over decades cannot be bombed or destroyed. It has maintained that its nuclear programme is strictly peaceful and for civilian use, such as for power generation and manufacturing of radiopharmaceuticals, but senior officials have signalled the Iranian establishmentcould go for a bombif facing an “existential threat”. Iran’s army and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) have also beenholding large-scale exercisesand testing a variety of defensive and offensive weapons in an attempt to signal strength and readiness for a prolonged conflict if necessary.",

    "title": "Gabon’s first election after collapse of Bongo dynasty: What’s at stake?",
    "article_text": "The African nation of Gabon is voting in its first executive elections since amilitary coup in 2023ended the 50-year dynastic rule of the Bongo political family. Polls opened in the country at 7am (06:00 GMT) on Saturday, with reports of thousands of people queuing outside polling stations across Libreville, the seaside capital. Nearly one million people, including some 28,000 overseas, are registered to vote. Brice Clotaite Oligui Nguema, coup leader-turned-transition president, is the main candidate among four competitors and is widely expected to win the elections, despite controversial reforms he has put into place that experts say were tailored to make him eligible for the vote. Located in West-central Africa, on the Atlantic coast, Gabon is rich in extractives like crude oil. The country, with a population of 2.2 million, is also part of the vital Congo Basin and boasts millions of acres of rainforest replete with varieties of plant and animal species. However, those natural resources have not translated into any meaningful distribution of wealth, as one family and a small political elite have ruled the country for the past five decades. The opposition is weak, experts say; the press is largely toothless; and Gabonese are distrustful of politicians. Located right on the equator, Gabon’s lingua franca is French, and local languages include Fang, Mbere and several others. The capital Libreville is the country’s largest city, followed by the port town of Port-Gentil. Here’s what to know about the vote: Four candidates, all male, have been approved by the electoral college. All are running independently. That’s because the candidates want to distance themselves from the former governing Gabonese Democratic Party (PDG), Douglas Yates, a professor at the American Graduate School in Paris, told Al Jazeera. The PDG has been in power since 1967 with little opposition and represents the only truly established party. Brice Clotaire Oligui Nguema (50):As head of the Royal Guard, Nguema led the coup that overthrew former President Ali Bongo, who is also his cousin, on August 30, 2023. The military general previously served as aide-de-camp to Omar Bongo before he was posted overseas to the embassies in Morocco and Senegal. He thereafter returned to lead the elite Royal Guard that protects the president, a post he kept until seizing power. Following the coup, Nguema promised to hand over to a civilian government within two years. He has been praised for moving rapidly towards that transition as opposed to military government counterparts in the West African countries of Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso and Guinea. He’s also managed to maintain ties with Gabon’s former colonial leader, France, while the others haveactivelycut ties with France. A new constitution affirming strict two-term limits was passed following a November referendum. Nguema is promising to “lift” and transform Gabon economically. He has cleaned up his military image since the coup, sporting suave suits and T-shirts in his packed, colourful campaign rallies. In one, he was seen moonwalking on stage to loud applause from his supporters. Alain Claude Bilie-By-Nze (57):In a country where the opposition has historically been weak due to decades of elections widely viewed as rigged, Bilie-By-Nze poses the biggest challenge to Nguema. The career politician, unlike many of his more elite counterparts, comes from a low-income background. In 2015, he entered politics and went on to serve in several ministerial positions under Ali Bongo. He was prime minister until the 2023 coup. Backed by his Together for Gabon political group, Bilie-By-Nze has chosen a low-key door-to-door campaign in the lead-up to the election. He has tried to underplay his role in the previous government  – even criticising the former ruling PDG party, which he was a part of until 2023. His promises of “another Gabon” include a focus on urban renewal, better health insurance and overall economic growth. However, experts say it is tough for many voters to trust him. “Despite his efforts to distance himself from his past, everybody knows that he was the last prime minister of Ali Bongo, and therefore is tarnished,” Yates said. Stephane Germain Iloko Boussengui: The medical doctor, popularly known as Iloko, was once a spokesperson for the former ruling PDG party before its downfall in the coup. He formed the Together for Gabon group with By-Nze, but the two men clashed, leading to Iloko’s exit in March. His rallies are colourful: In one campaign event in Libreville, Iloko wore traditional wrappers and danced with his supporters, who sported T-shirts with his photos on them. Despite his political past, Iloko claimed to be a “candidate for the people oppressed for 56 years” in an interview with local publication L’Union. He claimed he tried to right things in the past government but was often shut down. Now, he is promising to provide jobs and build roads and schools, particularly in rural areas. He also wants to reduce government spending and increase teachers’ welfare. As a staunch critic of the military government, Iloko has called for the establishment of an independent electoral commission, saying the new constitution established in November grants the president too much power. Joseph Lapensee Essingone (53):A technocrat, Essingone is a director at the country’s Directorate of Taxes. Educated in Gabon and France, he has presented himself as a new face in politics with no ties to the tainted past administrations. Essingone says he wants to “rupture” the current political system and usher in economic reforms. He has promised an end to the mismanagement of resources and bad governance if elected. Nguema is poised to win the elections, analysts agree. His supporters have praised him for taking steps towards civilian rule, including: However, his critics are quick to point out that Nguema remains part of the same establishment that has ruled Gabon for decades and reportedly also reaped wealth from those ties. “As we’ve seen with other military seizures of power in Africa in recent years, these transitions are accompanied by declining levels of civil liberties, political participation and transparency,” analyst Hany Wahila of the United States-based Africa Center for Strategic Studies told Al Jazeera. “Those who’ve criticised the military regime in Gabon have been the target of intimidation. What we’re seeing, therefore, resembles more a continuation of the existing unequal process rather than progress,” she added. Still, the fact that Nguema has moved forward on his election promises and kickstarted infrastructure development is progress, Yates of the American Graduate School in Paris said. The alternative, Yates said, would have kept Gabon stuck. “His most evident quality is that, unlike the young man who was being groomed to inherit the Bongo dynastic fortune, Oligui Nguema actually lives in Gabon,” Yates said. He was referring to Ali Bongo’s London-based first son, 33-year-old Noureddin Bongo, who iscurrently under house arrestin Gabon on charges of treason and fraud, along with his mother and French national, Sylvia Bongo. Nguema’s new constitution has barred people of dual nationality from running for the presidency, a move many believe is aimed at the Bongo heir. Ali Bongo himself wasreleasedfrom detention shortly after the coup and remains in the capital. Gabon’s democracy may yet be young, but it is on its way, Yates added. “As far as being a ‘true democracy’, I prefer to measure that concept on an ordinal scale from ‘more’ to ‘less’ democracy. Here, the measurement has improved,” he said.",

    "title": "‘I didn’t go’: The last Muslim man in Indian town hit by religious strife",
    "article_text": "Nanda Nagar, Uttarakhand, India —Every morning at 8am, Ahamad Hasan pulls up the brown shutter of his dry-cleaning shop on the banks of the Nandakini river, which runs through the remote Himalayan town of Nanda Nagar in the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand. He neatly hangs dry-cleaned clothes in plastic covers on the pink walls of his shop. Then the 49-year-old waits for customers. Until September 2024, by lunchtime, he would have had between 20 and 25 customers come by, leaving their sherwanis, suits, coats, pants and winter wear. Some would sip a cup of tea with him while discussing politics and jokes, sharing their smiles and sorrows. Most of the customers were Hindu, a few, Muslim. But on this day, fewer than five Hindu customers visit his shop by noon. And he knows there’s no point waiting for a Muslim customer. Hasan is the last Muslim man in town. For generations, 15 Muslim families called Nanda Nagar home. It’s where Hasan was born and raised, where his family received invitations for Hindu festivals and hosted neighbours on Eid. He has collected wood for Hindu funeral pyres and shouldered the bodies of his Hindu friends. That all changed last September in an explosion of anti-Muslim violence triggered by a Hindu girl’s allegation of sexual harassment, but rooted in a broader shift in sentiment against the minority community that Hasan had noticed since COVID-19. Hate-filled slogans and marches culminated in physical assaults against Muslims, as their shops were destroyed. Fearing for their lives, the town’s small Muslim community fled in the cover of night. Only Hasan returned, with his wife, two daughters and two sons, adamant that they could make it work in the only place he knew as home. But the family lives in fear. Their Hindu neighbours don’t speak to them. He no longer goes for walks along the river like he used to every evening. He does not let his kids and wife meet anyone. And he worries about more violence breaking out. “I just go to my shop and come back home. This is our life now,” Hasan says. “After spending my whole life in this town, I feel like I am a ghost. I am completely invisible. Nobody is even talking to me.” Nanda Nagar is a 10-hour drive from India’s capital New Delhi. Located near the India-China border, the town is nestled at the confluence of the Nandakini’s tributaries, and has a population of about 2,000 people. The river Nandakini is one of the six tributaries of the Ganges river, and is considered holy by Hindus. After Hasan’s grandfather migrated from Najibabad, a town in Bijnor district of neighbouring Uttar Pradesh state in 1975, their family settled in town. Hasan was born a year later. Life was largely peaceful, he recalls, until 2021. During the coronavirus pandemic, Muslims across India were vilified because of conspiracy theories spread by the Hindu far-right groups that accused the community of deliberately spreading the virus through their religious practices and by holding large gatherings. The far-right called it “Corona jihad”. Suddenly, Hasan felt his Hindu friends grow distant. “Before COVID-19, there used to be so many people in our home on Eid, and on Diwali we used to get so many invites from our friends. But after COVID, this stopped,” he says. But the events of September 1, 2024, were a tipping point. A week earlier, on August 22, a young Hindu pupil accused a Muslim barber, Mohammad Arif, of sexual harassment while he was opening his salon. The barber soon fled the town. On September 1, the town’s shopkeepers’ association decided to rally to condemn the alleged harassment of the pupil and demand police action. Hasan, along with other Muslims in the town, participated in the protest. “We went because otherwise the Hindus would allege that we support crimes committed by Muslims,” he recalls. However, the crowd soon started chanting anti-Muslim slogans, threatening violence. “As we were walking along with protesters, anti-Muslim slogans were raised such as ‘Mullon ke dalaalon ko … Joote maaro saalon ko’ [the pimps of Muslims should be beaten by shoes],” he says. As the rally reached the police station in Nanda Nagar, a group of protesters grabbed a 30-year-old Muslim man, Harun Ansari, and started beating him. Hasan said many Hindus justified Ansari’s beating by alleging that Muslims in town had helped the accused barber, Arif, to flee. In a phone interview from Najibabad, where he moved after the assault, Ansari says that he received multiple injuries in his head. “I just remember being dragged by the crowd. After that nothing was visible to me,” he recalls. After Ansari was beaten, all the other Muslims, including Hasan, fled from the rally and locked themselves in their houses. A mob of hundreds of people came and started pelting their houses with stones. Hasan says the Muslim families kept calling the police for help. “But no one came.” He also called his Hindu friends. “They were not even picking up my call,” he says. The Muslim families stayed indoors until late evening when the mob went away. That night, as the clock crossed midnight, Hasan quietly made his way back to his shop, which is in front of his house. He saw that the shutter of his shop was broken and twisted. Dry-cleaned clothes were strewn across the street like confetti. The counter, a sturdy wooden table where he kept savings worth 400,000 rupees [$4,600] in a locked drawer, was shattered – the money stolen. He had saved that money for his children’s marriages. Fragments of the name board of his shop, The Hasan Drycleaners, were thrown like debris on the banks of the Nandakini. “I will never forget that day,” Hasan tells Al Jazeera, while showing photos of his vandalised shop. But the following day would be even worse. On September 2, an even bigger protest was organised by Hindu far-right groups, who called for people from other towns to also assemble in Nanda Nagar. “There were thousands of men and just 60 or 70 policemen,” says Harun, the man who was thrashed the previous day. “Despite our complaints, no extra police force was called.” Darshan Bharti, a Hindu far-right leader known for his hate speech against Muslims, also visited Nanda Nagar that day. After his speech, “the mob went on a rampage and vandalised our properties,” says Hasan. They destroyed a makeshift mosque and threw a Muslim resident’s car into the river. Bharti did not respond to Al Jazeera’s questions on his visit to Nanda Nagar and on the violence that followed. “All Muslim families of the town hid on the top floor of my house while the crowd was pelting stones. I still get shivers recalling that day,” Hasan says. His house has iron grills and a gate, and is a multistorey building, which made it a safer choice for the Muslim families to shelter in. Arif, the barber accused of sexual harassment, was arrested that day from Uttar Pradesh after police registered a formal complaint against him on September 1. Arif was remanded to police custody for a week and then released on bail. However, the police informed the Muslim families that they could not take responsibility for their safety any more. In the dark, officers escorted them into police vehicles and dropped them off in a nearby town. For most Muslim families, it was the end of life in Nanda Nagar. But not for Hasan. “This is my home. My birth and upbringing, everything about my life, including my identity, belong to Uttarakhand,” he says, adding that all his identity documents list Nanda Nagar as his address. “My entire family lives in Uttrakhand. “Where will I go now?” From the neighbouring town where the police left them, Hasan and his family made their way to Dehradun, the state capital situated 266km (165 miles) away. After a few days in Dehradun, Hasan and 48-year-old Mohammad Ayyum, who was also from Nanda Nagar, petitioned the Uttarakhand High Court on September 26, pleading for protection. The High Court ordered the senior superintendent of police (SSP) of Chamoli district, where Nanda Nagar is located, to “ensure that law and order is strictly enforced and no untoward incident occurs targeting any particular community”. The SSP is the most senior police officer of the district responsible for law and order. “After the High Court granted us protection, I thought I could now go to Nanda Nagar, but no other Muslim family was ready to accompany me out of fear,” Hasan recalls. Hasan’s brother used to run a salon in Nanda Nagar. “But his landlord threatened him that if he did not vacate his shop, he would throw his belongings out,” Hasan says. Other relatives who live in Gopeshwar, a larger town in Chamoli, did not offer his family any support, Hasan says. “After a lot of thought, I decided I must go back, as everything – including my house and shop, was in Nanda Nagar.” Hasan added that his wife was more courageous than he was. “She went to Nanda Nagar with our kids first. I came to town later. Despite fear, she told me if we do not go back, we would lose our livelihood.” To be sure, the family still faces a dilemma. Hasan has contemplated moving his family to Dehradun after their elder daughter — the eldest of the four children — completes school. However, his wife believes that if they move anywhere else, their house and shop will be taken by locals. Hasan finally reached Nanda Nagar on October 16, only to find a Hindu man had also opened a dry-cleaning shop facing his shop, as direct competition. He tried to get his shop repaired but no Hindu workers were willing to help. “It’s a total boycott of Muslims”, he says. “They have spread so much fear that no worker is ready to even repair our shop. The workers told me they have been instructed by the Hindutva groups not to help the Muslims.” Hindutva is the Hindu nationalist ideology of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a paramilitary organisation and leader of a large number of bodies including Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. Hasan eventually managed to open his shop after repairing it himself. But no customers would come. He dialled his previously regular Hindu clients, but they refused to come. Anyone who came would be threatened by “Hindutva goons”, he says, and told to instead go to the Hindu dry-cleaner. “That day I realised that even dry-cleaning has a religion.” Hasan’s family, too, has struggled in a new Nanda Nagar – one in which their religion makes them stand out. His 16-year-old elder daughter was bullied in school, he says, “because of her religion”. One of her classmates told her that she should be expelled from the school because she’s a Muslim. “It stopped when we reached out to the principal with a complaint.” Justice, for Hasan and the Muslims who fled the town, remains elusive. After the September 1 attack, Uttarakhand Police registered a formal complaint based on what Nanda Nagar police station chief Sanjay Singh Negi observed that day. “I saw that 250-300 people were loudly abusing ‘a specific community.’ When I tried to stop them, they pushed me aside. Then, I called my seniors and asked for additional police force,” Negi wrote in his complaint. He then wrote that the mob started vandalising shops of Muslims and also vandalised a mosque. “The agitated mob was targeting a specific community due to which the women and kids from these families started screaming in fear.” Negi wrote that members of the mob were carrying sticks, shovels and iron rods. Still, Uttarakhand Police have not arrested anyone so far. Al Jazeera reached out to the Chamoli district’s Superintendent of Police Sarvesh Panwar but has not received any response. In some ways, Nanda Nagar is a microcosm of a broader shift enveloping the state of Uttarakhand. Under Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami of Modi’s BJP, the state has witnessed a surge in hate crimes and discrimination against Muslims in multiple cities. In town after town, far-right groups have launched campaigns to pressure Muslims to leave, in many cases successfully. Shops belonging to Muslims are ransacked or burned. An economic boycott is unofficially instituted. And often, Muslims also face physical violence. Most recently, Dhami’s government notified the rules of a Uniform Civil Code (UCC) that stops Muslims and other religious minorities from pursuing religion-based personal laws in the state. Courts have stepped in on several occasions, but some activists believe they need to do more. “Courts of our country don’t realise the magnitude of oppression Muslims are currently facing,” says Khursheed Ahmed, an activist based in the state’s capital Dehradun who helped Hasan file a petition in the High Court. “The oppression is on all fronts – physical, emotional, financial.” Still, recently, Hasan has found a glimmer of hope. On February 19, more than five months after the September violence, one of the Hindu men who led the anti-Muslim protests came to Hasan’s shop. His wife was managing their shop at the time. The Hindu man had brought a coat and trousers and asked if they could be quickly dry-cleaned. Hasan’s wife then asked him, “You called me sister and you wanted Muslims to go?” The man replied: “Forget what happened. Your work is very good. That’s why I have come to you.” Hasan smiles as he recalls that incident. “I saw this day because I didn’t go and I put up a fight,” he says. The pain of broken friendships still hurts. “When Muslim families came back to take their belongings, the people with whom we used to sit and laugh were taunting us,” he says. “They questioned why we returned. It broke my heart. While physical violence has subsided, the silent social violence continues.” But Hasan refuses to give up on the future. Or, on Nanda Nagar.",

    "title": "Luisa Gonzalez wants to be Ecuador’s president. Will Correa weigh her down?",
    "article_text": "Quito, Ecuador –Ecuador is preparing for a high-stakes presidential run-off on April 13, as voters choose between two final candidates: leftist Luisa Gonzalez and centre-right incumbent Daniel Noboa. The election comes amid political unrest, economic turmoil and risinggang violence, with Ecuador now among the most violent countries in Latin America. Gonzalez, who is running on a progressive platform, could become Ecuador’s first elected female president — an historic milestone. But her candidacy has been plagued by questions about her longstanding ties to former PresidentRafael Correa, her political mentor. Correa is a polarising figure who continues to divide Ecuador. To his supporters, he was a charismatic champion of the working class who stood up to the foreign oil companies eager to exploit Ecuador's natural resources. To his detractors, he was a symbol of corruption and broken promises, forcedinto exileafter a court found him guilty of accepting bribes. Still, Gonzalez remains close to Correa, so much so that she even posted a video in honour of his birthday, during the final weekend before the run-off. \"Happy birthday, dear Rafael Correa,\" Gonzalezwrotein the caption, as the video showed the two laughing and hugging. \"May God bless you and guide you always.\" But experts say Gonzalez's tight bond with Correa could be a double-edged sword, generating allegiance in some voting blocs while alienating others. “She’s walking a tightrope,” said Caroline Avila, a political communications analyst and professor at the University of Cuenca. “Too close to Correa, she loses moderates. Too far, and she risks losing her base.”",

    "title": "Trump officials end ‘temporary protected status’ for Afghans, Cameroonians",
    "article_text": "The administration of President Donald Trump has moved to end legal protections for thousands of Afghans and Cameroonians legally living in the United States. On Friday, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security confirmed the decision, which will affect approximately 14,600 Afghans and 7,900 Cameroonians. Those individuals were able to live in the US under a designation called “temporary protected status” or TPS. The US government typically offers TPS to individuals already in the US for whom it may be unsafe to return, at least in the short term, due to conflict, natural disaster or other circumstances. But the Trump administration has attempted to sever TPS protections for multiple nationalities since taking office in January, as part of a broadercrackdownon immigration, both legal and otherwise. In a statement, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said that conditions in Afghanistan and Cameroon no longer met the criteria for TPS. But critics point out that fighting has raged in Cameroon between the government and separatists since 2017. And in Afghanistan, the Taliban has been in control of the government since the withdrawal of US and Western forces in 2021. Its leadership has been accused of perpetrating widespread human rights abuses, including arresting members of the previous US-backed government and banning women from many aspects of public life. Refugee groups quickly condemned the move. Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, the president of the nonprofit Global Refuge, called the revocation of the TPS for Afghans “a morally indefensible betrayal”. She warned they couldface persecutionif returned to Afghanistan. “Afghanistan today is still reeling from Taliban rule, economic collapse, and humanitarian disaster,” she said in a statement. “Nothing about that reality has changed.” While the US evacuated more than 82,000 Afghans to the US, the vast majority were granted temporary “parole” or other legal statuses based on their direct work with the US government. Still, the end of TPS would still affect a significant portion of that total group. Their TPS status will end in May. Veterans groups and politicians on both sides of the political spectrum have called for more legal avenues for Afghans to seek safety in the US, particularly if they worked alongside US troops or the US-backed government. Meanwhile, US lawmakers earlier this month urged the Trump administration to extend the status for Cameroonians, who face civilian attacks in their home country. They are now set to lose that protection in June. “The country’s worsening security situation, combined with its ongoing humanitarian cries and human rights abuses, makes return impossible for Cameroonian nationals,” the lawmakers wrote. Cameroon has seen clashes between Anglophone separatists and Francophone security forces that have resulted in extrajudicial killings, attacks on civilians and widespread displacement. The Trump administration has moved to close several avenues to temporarily stay in the US, arguing it was “restoring the rule of law”. But many of the moves target immigration categories established under Trump’s predecessor and political rival, former President Joe Biden. Trump has also sought to pursue a campaign of “mass deportation” during his second term. Removing legal protections from immigrants allows the government to potentially remove them from the country. This is not the first time Trump has targeted TPS, though. During his first term, from 2017 to 2021, he tried to end most TPS enrollment but was thwarted by federal courts. During his second term, Trump reembarked on a similar push. In February, he sought to strip nearly 300,000 Venezuelans of their TPS. But in late March, a US district judge blocked his attempt, saying that his government’s characterisation of the migrants as criminals “smacks of racism”. Trump has alsomoved to nixthe humanitarian parole programme that granted legal status to more than 500,000 Haitians, Venezuelans, Cubans and Nicaraguans under Biden. On Thursday, however, a federal judge blocked Trump from ending the programme, which would have stripped nearly half a million people of their legal status.",

    "article_text": "Updated US Customs and Border Protection guidance exempts popular consumer tech imports, including from China. Updated US Customs and Border Protection guidance exempts popular consumer tech imports, including from China. byWes Davis The Trump administration has excluded “smartphones, computers, and other electronics,” even those imported from China, from tariffs it levied last week,reportsBloomberg. The exemptions don’t free them from all tariffs, though, as the outlet says others from before Trump’s April 9th tariffs still apply. Late last night, US Customs and Border Protection (CBP)updated its guidanceto exempt smartphones, laptops, hard drives, computer processors, and memory chips from the 125 percent additional tariff Trump placed on Chinese goods and the base 10 percent global tariff on most other countries, according toBloomberg. The same goes for the machines used by companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to make semiconductors, the outlet writes. After this story was published,Bloombergupdated its story to add that the White Housepublished a memo“indicating that the exemptions also extend to changes in small-parcel shipping duties.” As the outlet notes, Trump’s tariff plans includedgetting rid of duty-free shippingon low-value packages. The President hadtripled the rates for such packagesin an executive order amendment published on Tuesday night. Bloombergalso says in its updated story that products excluded in the CBP’s update are still subject to “a 20% duty applied to pressure Beijing to crack down on fentanyl, including the shipment of precursor materials,” as well as other tariffs, “including those that predate Trump’s current term.” The news follows Trump’s decision to issue a“90-day pause”on higher tariff rates for most countries, while increasing the total rate for Chinese imports to 145 percent, the same day theywent into effect. It’s been expected that the tariffs — particularly those on China — would mean price hikes on the most popular tech products in the US. In some cases it already seemingly has, with Sony appearing tobake the tariffs into the US pricesfor its newest TVs and OnePlus raising the price of its new smartwatcheswithout saying why. Other companies have appeared reluctant to rock the boat while they wait for Trump’s chaotic trade war maneuvers to settle down. For instance, Nintendodelayed US preordersfor the Switch 2 but has stayed committed to its $449.99 launch price, while Apple reportedlyrushed to import 600 tons of iPhonesfrom India before the tariffs went into effect this week.

    "title": "Bungie’s slick-looking Marathon shooter arrives on September 23rd",
    "article_text": "The makers ofHaloandDestinyare holding a closed alpha test ofMarathonlater this month. The makers ofHaloandDestinyare holding a closed alpha test ofMarathonlater this month. byTom Warren The creators ofHaloandDestinyare finally ready to show off their next big project:Marathon. It’s a long-awaited title from Bungie and revives the classicMarathonIP in the form of a PvPvE extraction shooter. After ateaser nearly two years ago, the Sony-owned studio just spent an hour showing offMarathongameplay and game mechanics and revealed the game will launch on September 23rd on PS5, Xbox Series S / X, and PC, with full cross-play and cross-save. There’s even an alpha test for fans to try out the game later this month, ahead of its full debut this year. Marathonis set in a sci-fi universe in 2850, in the remains of Tau Ceti IV, which Bungie describes as a lost colony whose inhabitants disappeared without a trace. Rival factions have hired Runners to scavenge for what’s left behind, and anyone who signs up to be a Runner has given up their human form for a biosynthetic shell with unique abilities and stats. As a Runner, you fight in a crew of up to three players across a variety of zones and points of interest. You can face rival runners in maps of up to 18 players, so up to six teams, in a bid to grab as much loot as possible and get out. WhileMarathonis designed to be played in crews, with contextual pings and shared objectives, you can also play solo instead of having to form a dedicated three-person team. InMarathonruns, there will be what Bungie calls security forces, PvE enemies that roam the world. There are also creatures on these planets that are a threat when you’re navigating toward points on a map. You’ll have to choose whether it’s worth engaging with these enemies and risk revealing your location to rival teams or use a strategy of avoiding these threats in this PvPvE environment. The maps are filled with bold and vibrant artwork and weapons, materials, and equipment that can be scavenged. Before a run, you build a loadout and select the Runner that fits your play style. In the alpha test, which starts on April 23rd, there will be four runners to choose from, including the stealthy Void character that can go invisible much like a Hunter fromDestiny 2. There’s also a Glitch runner that has fast-paced abilities and, like its name implies, can glitch out enemies. If you’re more of a run-and-gun type of player, Locus has a shield ability and looks similar to the slide and shotgun play of a Titan fromDestiny 2. The final runner in the alpha test is Blackbird, designed for recon and scanning the area around you. While there are four runners in the alpha test, there will be six to choose from whenMarathonlaunches in September. During its livestream, Bungie published a nearly 20-minute video of highlights from 40 creators it says it recently invited to try the game. If you die, you’ll drop your gear. But if you survive, your loot moves with you to future runs so you get more powerful gear and level up. Teammates can also revive you if you fail a mission. Bungie isn’t putting a limit on team compositions, so that means everyone on a three-person team can select the same runner. There will be end-game challenges, ranked play, seasonal storytelling, community events, and more. Bungie has even produced an original short cinematic that’s set in theMarathonuniverse. Written and directed by Alberto Mielgo (Love, Death, and Robots), this nearly nine-minute short will have Bungie fans poring over it for days to discover every little detail about theMarathonuniverse. WhileMarathonis very slick-looking, there’s a lot riding on this game. It’s entering a crowded market of shooters and live-service games that have tried and failed to break through in recent years.Concord, also from a PlayStation studio, was the biggest example of ashooter that failed to take offrecently, forcing Sony to take the game offline less than a month after launch and eventually shut down the studio behind it. Spectre Divide, aValorant-like free-to-play shooter,also shut downjust months after its launch, with the developer behind the ambitious shooter shutting down, too. These high-profile failures add to the pressure thatMarathonis already under on the back of Bungie’s success withHaloandDestinyand Sony’s ambitious live-service game effort that it has beenscaling back recently. TheMarathonalpha test will be an opportunity for Bungie to show the world exactly how its latest game will stand out from the competition, and whether it does enough to tempt people away from hero shooters orCall of DutyandFortniteinto the extraction shooter genre thatEscape from Tarkovhas popularized. The big question left for Bungie to answer is how muchMarathonwill cost. It’s not a free-to-play game, but the studio isn’t ready to talk about exact pricing just yet.Destiny 2is technically free-to-play with an optional season pass, but a lot of additional content requires payment for access to raids, dungeons, and even some of the story content. It’s been a confusing model for new players over the years, so I’m hoping Bungie lands on a clear pricing structure forMarathon. Marathondebuts on PS5, Xbox Series S / X, and PC on September 23rd.

    "article_text": "Garmin may be best known for its hardcore fitness watches, but it’s got an extensive line of lifestyle offerings, too. Garmin may be best known for its hardcore fitness watches, but it’s got an extensive line of lifestyle offerings, too. byVictoria Song If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. Few brands are as synonymous with outdoor sports as Garmin. You’ll find these fitness trackers and smartwatches on dozens of wrists at any 5K, marathon, or Ironman. You’ll also find Garmin devotees among divers, thru-hikers, golfers, kiteboarders — you name it. But these devices aren’tjustfor athletes. The company’s made significant strides in its lifestyle offerings, so regardless of your fitness level, there’s a Garmin for everyone. If you’re coming from a more traditional smartwatch, Garmin’s core strengths lie in fitness, GPS, adventuring, and durability. These are hardy devices that are meant to withstand the elements and lastweekson a single charge. Several models come with offline maps, advanced navigational features, and more training metrics than any other platform. Garmin devices tend to be on the pricier side, however, andthe company recently announcedit would begin putting its newest features behind a paywall. That’s a bummer given Garmin spent years publicly stating it had no intention of charging its users extra. There are fitness trackers and smartwatches, and then there are Garmins. Depending on the type of Garmin — there aremany— we will tailor our benchmarks and experiential, real-life testing. If it’s a rugged Fenix model, we’ll go on extensive GPS activities, see how well it works as a navigation tool, and dive deep into training metrics. If it’s more lifestyle focused, like the Venu 3, we’ll put an added focus on how well smart features like voice assistant access, notifications, and style. Because people buy Garmins to last a long time, we also put special consideration on battery life testing. Some other factors we consider are durability, performance, ability to connect to gym equipment, and GPS accuracy. Garmins are known for extra long battery life. The question is, does it last days, weeks, or even a month? Garmin has so many training features that even the pros probably don’t use all of them. Do you get coaching programs and stamina graphs? Or are you sticking to the basics like steps, pace, and mileage? Same goes for navigational features. While Garmin is known for its GPS tech, there are multiple kinds of GPS tracking and satellite systems. We also look at whether these navigational features fit the use case. For example, do running watches haveback-to-start? Do offline maps come preloaded for thru-hikers? Do these watches hold up to intense activity? Are they discreet enough to wear to formal occasions without screaming “I love exercise!!!!!” Garmins are expensive. Does the price make sense for the intended user, feature set, and build quality? Garmins aren’t too shabby on smarts, either. While more fitness-focused than anything from Apple, Google, or Samsung, there’s enough to get you the basics like notifications and then some. For example, most Garmins have fall detection and safety features, andseveral of the latest Garminsrecently gotan FDA-cleared EKG feature. (You’ll need a phone on hand, however, as only one Garmin model has cellular connectivity.) Many Garmin devices also support offline music playback and come with a small third-party app ecosystem. There are alotof Garmin watches to choose from. No, seriously, there are six major lineups, and each has a multitude of models. But no worries — I test several Garmins every year and can help point you in the right direction. 9 Verge Score More intuitive menu navigationMultiband GPSLong battery life — even with AOD enabledAdds helpful training featuresOh, oh, it’s OLED, you know It’s $100 more than the 255OLED displays don’t cost $100 Sizes:42mm w/ 18mm straps; 46mm w/ 22mm straps /Weight:39g (42mm); 47g (46mm) /Battery life:Up to 15 days (42mm); 13 days (46mm) in smartwatch mode /Display type:OLED touchscreen /GPS:All-systems GNSS and dual-frequency GPS /Connectivity:Bluetooth, Ant Plus, Wi-Fi /Water resistance:5ATM /Music storage:8GB Garmin hasmanyrunning watches, and a lot of them are great. But the Forerunner 265 or 265S (if you have petite wrists) strikes an excellent balance between price, feature set, battery life, and a vibrant OLED display. That said, the Forerunner 265 / 265S is a bit of an odd duck. It comes a mere nine months after its predecessor, theForerunner 255, and is, in many ways, pretty much the same watch. The main difference is the 265 has an OLED display compared to the 255’s memory-in-pixel screen. Usually, that means worse battery life, but in this case, we got about a week on a single charge with the always-on display enabled. Without it, you can get up to 15 days. Given that OLED is easier to read and just, well, looks nicer, that gives the 265 lineup an edge over the 255. The 265 also has dual-frequency GPS (also known as multi-band). The gist is you get much more accurate maps in challenging environments like cities and dense forests because you can access both the L1 and L5 satellite frequencies. And even with dual-frequency GPS enabled, you still don’t lose a whole lot of battery life. I wore it during a half marathon with that and the AOD enabled, and I still had over 80 percent battery by the time I got home. This is also an excellent price, as the majority of multi-band GPS watches cost well over $600. My main complaint is that $450, while not bad for Garmin, is still a lot when you consider that’s the same price as smarter smartwatches with great running features. Some runners won’t care. But if you’re on a budget — or you’re new to running and feel iffy about spending that much — then consider theForerunner 165series. It starts at $250 (add another $50 for onboard music) and does almost everything the 265 series does. The main things you’re missing are dual-frequency GPS and a few more niche sport profiles. But if you’re mostly sticking to running, gym equipment, cycling, swimming, and hiking, you’re covered. The Garmin Forerunner 165 Music gets you in-depth training metrics but leaves out some of the more advanced features in exchange for a more palatable price. Neither has all of Garmin’s training features, but it’s got what you’ll need to run anything from a 5K to a full marathon. That includes a Race Predictor, which gives you an estimate of what your best time would be based on your actual training. You can also use PacePro to figure out your pacing strategy for a race. You also get Garmin’s Training Readiness feature to help gauge load and recovery, Garmin Coach plans, and a host of running form metrics. It also supports offline music and safety features like fall detection. The only thing they lack is advanced mapping. (They still have trackback, point-to-point navigation, and real-time breadcrumb trail support, however.) 8 Verge Score Now comes in multiple sizesHands-free flashlight is SO handyGreat battery lifeMultiband GPSUpgraded heart rate sensorStarting price hasn’t changed AOD zaps battery life to three to four daysLots of incremental changesIt’s a Garmin review, so once again, the app Sizes:42mm w/ 20mm straps; 47mm w/ 22mm straps; 51mm w/ 26mm straps /Weight:42mm: 63g stainless steel, 58g titanium; 47mm: 78g stainless steel, 70g titanium; 51mm: 98g stainless steel, 88g titanium /Battery life:42mm: up to 10 days (4 with AOD); 47mm: up to 16 days (6 with AOD); 51mm: up to 31 days (11 with AOD) /Display type:OLED /GPS:All-systems GNSS and dual-frequency GPS /Connectivity:Bluetooth, Ant Plus, Wi-Fi /Water resistance:10ATM /Music storage:Up to 32GB TheEpix Prowill get you every fitness feature that Garmin has to offer. And I meaneverything. It would frankly be easier to tell you what the Epix Pro does not have: things that are limited to LTE smartwatches and some of the new smart features on the Fenix 8, like an on-board voice assistant. Otherwise, you’ve got topographical maps, turn-by-turn navigation, and more training metrics than even a seasoned triathlete would know what to do with. The Pro is more size-inclusive than thestandard second-gen Epix, which only comes in 47mm. You can get the Pro in that size, too, but it also comes in 42mm and 51mm. This was a major complaint I had with the second-gen Epix, and you love to see companies actually take this sort of thing seriously. The best part is the Pro models start at the same price as the regular Epix did. You’ll have to pay $100 extra for materials like titanium and sapphire crystal, but that’s also true of the standard Epix. 7 Verge Score Smartens up Garmin’s flagship multisport watchExcellent battery and fitness trackingOffers MIP and OLED display optionsCondenses the Fenix and Epix lines into one The starting price is$350more than the Fenix 7!Smart features are less helpful without LTE That said, it muddies the waters if you’re trying to pick between the Epix Pro,Fenix 7,Fenix 7 Pro, and now, theFenix 8. The main difference is the Epix watches all have OLED displays. One reason I prefer OLED is that they’re much easier to read indoors — where most of us spend the majority of our time. The Fenix 7 series’ memory-in-pixel displays (plus solar charging if you opt for it) allow for weeks and weeks of charge, but the smallest Epix Pro can get around 10 days with normal usage. The 47mm and 51mm Pro models can go longer between charges due to bigger batteries, but I felt that the 42mm has enough juice to satisfy most use cases. Garmin also has so many battery-saving modes and options that I highly doubt this will ever be an issue. Not helping matters is the fact that the Fenix 8 lets you choose between an OLED or a MIP display. You also get smart features like an onboard voice assistant, the ability to take calls from the wrist, and the Garmin Messenger app. The main problem is the starting price is now $350 more than the standard Fenix 7 and right about on par with the Epix Pro. My personal feeling is the Fenix 8’s smart features are just okay and that you’re really not missing much by not having them. We also often see discounts on older models, so I would put on my bargain-hunting hat for a discounted Epix Pro or Fenix 7 Pro while inventory is still available. But really, the winning feature of the Epix Pro is the hands-free flashlight. It’s so useful in my day-to-day life, and all you have to do is double-press a button. It’s as bright as your smartphone, comes with a red light option if you want something easier on the eyes, and can act as a strobe in an emergency situation. The Fenix 7 Pro and 8 watches also have a flashlight, so a lot of this is going to come down to personal preference for the display, price, and whether you care about smart features. 8 Verge Score Hands-free flashlightLong battery lifeMultiband GPSUpgraded heart rate monitor The improved MIP display is still not the easiest to read in dim lightingToo similar to the standard Fenix 7 If you’re set on the most battery life possible, I recommend the Fenix 7 Pro over the standard 7 for a few reasons. Its MIP display is slightly brighter, all sizes have the flashlight, and, like the Epix Pro, it has an updated sensor array. I also recommend it over the MIP versions of the Fenix 8 because it comes in more sizes,andcosts around $300 less. Especially since the Fenix 8’s smart features are a bit half-baked. 8 Verge Score Aesthetically pleasing and accurate trackingGood for smaller wristsAffordable priceThe hidden OLED is cool The Garmin app is overly complicatedBattery life is shorter than other hybrids Sizes:40mm w/ 20mm straps /Weight:19g /Battery life:Up to 5 days /Display type:“Hidden” OLED touchscreen /GPS:Tethered GPS /Connectivity:Bluetooth, Ant Plus /Water resistance:5ATM /Music storage:N/A What I love most about the Vivomove Sport is that it doesn’t look like what most people expect from a Garmin. It’s a hybrid smartwatch, which means it looks like a regular watch but can track fitness and deliver notifications. Garmin’s hybrids are also unique in that they all use an OLED display that stays hidden until you need it. This is best suited for a casually active person who wants style and value in a lightweight package. Think wellness, more so than fitness. It gets you continuous heart rate monitoring and blood oxygen level monitoring, and can even provide abnormal heart rate alerts. You also get access to more in-depth metrics like respiration rate, fitness age, stress, and Body Battery, which is Garmin’s tool for visualizing how well-rested you are. For smart features, you get all the basics, like notifications, alarms, and timers. The Sport isn’t quite as full-featured as some other Garmin watches you’ll find on this list. For instance, you’re giving up built-in GPS in favor of tethered GPS through your phone. There are no contactless payments, nor is there a microphone or speaker for taking calls on the wrist. But thisisa budget pick, and you get a lot, considering this is an entry-level gadget that could pass for a Swatch at a glance. I don’t love that the battery life is short for a hybrid, at around three to four days. Even so, that’s still much better than what you’ll get on an Apple Watch or Wear OS 4 watch. If you’re willing to spend about $100 more, the $269.99Vivomove Trendhas more chic materials, gets you more screen real estate, and wireless Qi charging. Otherwise, this is a great lifestyle wearable that can serve as a classier alternative to your typical fitness band. The Garmin Lily 2 is a simple yet chic hybrid analog smartwatch that delivers basic fitness tracking, notifications, and up to five days of battery life. If you prefer something newer to the Sport that’s also stylish, theGarmin Lily 2is another good option, especially if you’ve got particularly small wrists or prefer something extremely lightweight. The swipe and tap gestures are still a little fiddly to use — which was also the case with the first-gen model — but the fresh design isa fun way to lightly monitor your fitnesswithout bogging yourself down with notifications. Garmin also offers theLily 2 Active, which adds a physical button, GPS, and support for more sports tracking for astarting price of $299.99. 8 Verge Score Bright displayLong battery lifeTons of training and health features Cluttered appProprietary USB-A charger Sizes:40mm w/ 20mm straps /Weight:38g /Battery life:Up to 11 days /Display type:OLED touchscreen /GPS:All-systems GNSS /Connectivity:Bluetooth, Ant Plus /Water resistance:5ATM /Music storage:4GB (for Music Edition) If you were disappointed by theFitbit Sense 2andVersa 4, the Venu Sq 2 is the next best thing (and, in some ways, better). At a glance, the Venu Sq 2 could easily be mistaken for an Apple Watch. On the wrist, you’ll notice it’s made of plastic, but it still looks quite chic and extremely lightweight. The screen is bright, easy to read, and looks better than any Versa or Sense ever did. The feature set is also great for the price, with built-in GPS, a ton of watch faces, emergency safety features, and contactless payments. If you pay $50 more for the Music Edition, you’ll also get about 500 songs worth of storage, but we wouldn’t recommend it. This doesn’t have cellular connectivity and, therefore, isn’t truly standalone. You’ll most likely be carrying your phone with you anyway. As for health features, the Venu Sq 2 basically has everything you’d get on a Versa or Sense smartwatch but with Garmin’s treasure trove of metrics as well. That includes heart rate tracking, blood oxygen tracking, intensity minutes (how much moderate exercise you get in a week), stress tracking, hydration tracking, respiratory rate, period tracking, and Garmin’s recovery feature, Body Battery. As far as fitness goes, you also get access to Garmin Coach, which provides free 5K, 10K, and half marathon training plans. You love to see it. Another big leg-up Garmin has over Fitbit? None of these features or metrics are locked behind a paywall, even if Garmin’s AI-powered insights and a few other expanded features will only be available as part of Garmin Connect Plus ($6.99 a month / $69.99 annually). 7 Verge Score Good battery lifeBetter sleep tracking and nap detectionEKG and AFib featuresCan take calls and use your phone’s voice assistantAudio meditation sessions done well Pricey compared to other lifestyle smartwatchesLimited third-party app ecosystemNo LTE capability Sizes:41mm w/ 18mm straps; 45mm w/ 22mm straps /Weight:40g for the 3S; 47g for the 3 /Battery life:Up to 10 days for 3S; 14 days for 3 /Display type:OLED touchscreen /GPS:GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO /Connectivity:Bluetooth, Ant Plus, Wi-Fi /Water resistance:5ATM /Music storage:8GB Garmin has shored up the smarts in its watches over the past several years, and the Venu 3 series is the smartest (and most affordable) of the bunch. The Venu 3 series comes in two sizes: 41mm and 45mm. Like theVenu 2 Plus, it has a microphone and speaker. You can take calls directly from the wrist and issue commands to your phone’s digital assistant via Bluetooth. It’s not the same as having Siri, Bixby, Amazon Alexa, or Google Assistant built directly into the watch, but it’s a clever workaround that works well for hands-free control. It also supports safety features like fall detection and live tracking, as well as contactless payments. Like other OLED Garmins, the display is both vibrant and easy to read. As for health and fitness, you get a nice mix of basic and more advanced features and metrics. It has Garmin’s latest heart rate sensor, which enables FDA-cleared EKG and AFib detection features. Overall, it leans a bit more on the wellness and health side of things, with intensity minutes, blood oxygen monitoring, sleep tracking, period tracking, abnormal heart rate alerts, and stress tracking. As for training, you still get built-in GPS, VO2 Max, heart rate zones, respiration rate, and downloadable training plans via Garmin Coach. New to the 3 and 3S is a sleep coach that factors in metrics like heart rate variability and recent activity to determine your sleep needs. It also finally adds nap detection, a feature that’s been long overdue for the Garmin platform. The Venu 3 series also adds audio-guided meditation sessions, and you can view how these sessions directly impact your metrics. From an accessibility standpoint, this also adds a new wheelchair mode. Technically, the new Fenix 8 is slightly smarter in that it adds an on-board voice assistant. However, it is also more than double the price and not what I’d consider a good value for the average athlete. It’s more for people who spend hours upon hours training every week. This is the Garmin for you if you want the platform’s in-depth training without sacrificing the productivity of a smartwatch. The main things it’s lacking are cellular options and a robust third-party app ecosystem. That said, it’s got Spotify, Amazon Music, and Deezer for offline listening. It’s also a good option if you’re fed up with MIP displays and want asmarterGarmin rather than a full-on smartwatch.

    "article_text": "Old tech finds a new life in wearable art. Old tech finds a new life in wearable art. byJasmine Ting In December 2024, actor and fashion icon Julia Foxstepped out on the streetwith a flip-phone buckle strapped across her chest, wires on her nails, and an old Discman-turned-compact mirror hanging from her wrist. Fox didn’t start the retro-tech fashion trend. Celebrities and internet fashionistas were already wearing iPod Shuffle Minis as hair clips and wired headphones as necklaces. But Fox did make waves online, showing off the Y2K-inspired collaboration from French Canadian artist Gab Bois and refurbished electronics marketplace Back Market — and plugging the Right to Repair movement — on her Instagram. Much of this fashion channels nostalgia over the nascent days of the digital age — both aesthetically and philosophically. Bois previously designedfine jewelryusing sim cards, acamcorder clutch, and aNintendo DS Lite makeup palette. “[Tech] was clunkier, slower, but also more tactile and charming,” Bois says. “There was this sense of optimism, too. Everything felt like a glimpse into the future.” Younger millennials and Gen Z latching on — largely online — seem to be yearning for those simpler times. Digicams from mid-aughts have already made asurprising cultural comeback. It seems only appropriate that classic gadgets that cannot be revived for their original purpose are still being transformed into wearables. Hundreds of vendors on Etsy are, as Bois puts it, “subverting function for aesthetic purposes.” They’re selling Tamagotchi necklaces, turning circuit boards and microchips into earrings, andcrocheting old floppy disks into purses. While old hardware might not be the easiest material to work with, New York-based designer Nicole McLaughlin finds that fashion is a medium that naturally lends itself to upcycling old tech. Avant-garde fashion, specifically, is about pushing boundaries and redefining what’s considered “wearable.” So why not transform aheadset into a bra? Make athong from an old keyboard? Achunky heel with a working mini PC monitorfrom eBay? “It’s fun. It’s lighthearted,” McLaughlin says of her work, adding that her audience is “not trying to take it too serious.” Because her creations are usually one-of-one conceptual art pieces — photographed and published for display on the internet rather than an actual product to be scaled and sold — she’s not so much focused on their practical use so much as how they change people’s perceptions about waste and sustainable design. Designer Myra Magdalen shares these sentiments. Finding old keyboards, TV remotes, flip phones, game console controls, and robot toys at the thrift store — she was drawn mainly to the idea that these discarded objects still had creative potential and didn’t have to end up in a landfill. “Older tech just has more personality,” Magdalen says, who has previously gone viral for her particularly maximalist outfits. Unlike the smooth and streamlined look of today’s devices, back then there were big buttons, small screens, and switches.“To me, it’s just a fun challenge. It’s sort of a puzzle,” Magdalen explains. “It usually starts with one word, like ‘computer,’ and then it’s like, ‘How can we do head to toe in that vein, in a way that feels like the most me?’” Jake Olshan, founder of Los Angeles-based streetwear brand Drought, creates sentimental designs that reflect remnants of his childhood, things that he’s sure were also core memories for other people in his generation. But he doesn’t incorporate physical relics from the 2000s into clothes and accessories, he instead pays homage to them with items like a Limewire pendant necklace, a Napster handbag (made in official collaboration with the company), and a giant iPod Nano-shaped mirror. “The basis of the brand has to do with holding on to that part of yourself,” Olshan says. “As a lot of people my age are growing into adults and getting full-time jobs, apartments … It’s about holding on to your childhood and your youth.” Retro-tech fashion may not send you back through time, but it certainly tries to capture a specific era before tech and the internet became a serious business.

    "title": "Blue Prince will steal your time just like Balatro",
    "article_text": "The game is an architectural puzzle mystery that is all-consuming. byAsh Parrish The game is an architectural puzzle mystery that is all-consuming. byAsh Parrish I know, I know. It’s become a bit of a faux pas to describe one game using another and yet I am compelled. After a few hours withBlue Prince, I realized this game elicits the same feelings in me asBalatro. Not because it has anything to do with cards or passive-aggressive clowns named Jimbo, but because those hours I played passed as breezily by completely unnoticed as they did when I was knee deep in the poker roguelike.Blue Princeis a time-stealer and as withBalatro, you will be happy to be robbed. Blue Princeis an architectural puzzle mystery game from developer Dogubomb. In it you play as a young man who inherits his uncle’s magical mansion. On your first day at the house you receive a note laying out the rules by which you will earn your inheritance. This house has 45 rooms. Find the secret 46th room that’s not displayed on any of the mansion’s blueprints (get it,Blue Prince/ blueprints) and the house is yours. To find the 46th room you must create or “draft” rooms one after the other connecting them via their doors. You start each day with 50 steps and passing into a room takes one step (or more depending on the type of room). When you run out of steps you are exhausted and forced to retire for the day. At the end of every day, the layout you drafted is reset and you must start all over again with a blank mansion. At its heart,Blue Princeis a roguelike puzzle game laid over an overarching narrative involving the secrets of your extended family. Its main mechanic is drafting rooms and laying them out over the mansion’s 5x9 grid. Each room comes with any number of doors that open in one of the four cardinal directions. You build your map each day by trying to connect as many rooms with as many doors while avoiding dead ends as much as possible. There are so many different types of rooms to draft with their own strengths and weaknesses. Bedrooms, for example, reward you with additional steps extending your day. Closets yield goodies like keys to unlock doors but are dead ends. Drafting a puzzle room early, like the billiard room or the parlor, rewards you with gems to draft higher quality rooms like the library or the laboratory. The more rooms you draft, the more likely you are to encounter rooms you haven’t seen before revealing secrets and clues that will help you in your journey. On top of trying to draft rooms that will yield you the most benefits, you’re also trying to draft rooms in the correct sequence. Tinkering with the breaker box in the circuit breaker room, will let you open the door in the garage, bringing you that much closer to finding the 46th room. It’s all an interconnected, incredibly dense puzzle game that makes use of every ounce of your brain power to solve and then some. Youwillneed to take notes – the game tells you as much. And any time I need to write stuff down to play a game effectively, it is cooking with the highest quality gas. Solving puzzles inBlue Princebrings all my powers of spatial, mathematical, narrative, and memory reasoning to bear. And the thing I love about it, something I don’t think I’ve ever said about a video game ever, is its pacing.Blue Princeunfolds almost infinitely — solving one puzzle leads to the next and on and on like a fractal of overlapping mysteries. Some of those mysteries are easy and satisfying to figure out. When I first encountered the darkroom, the lights went out. Not only could I not see what was in there, the darkness forced me to draft the next room without seeing what it was or if it was a dreaded dead end. But I remembered from the circuit room seeing a darkroom setting on the breaker box. On my next run, I made sure to draft the circuit room and flip on the power before drafting the darkroom. When I went in,voila, the power stayed on and I collected a treasure trove of new clues. But the game’s other mysteries are less intuitive and can lead to frustration that no amount of note taking can assuage. The dartboard in the billiard room is a mathematical puzzle with different colors on the board corresponding to different functions. At first it was easy enough to figure out: blue next to a number means addition, yellow is subtraction, pink is multiplication, and purple is division. Instead of recalling the elementary lesson of PEMDAS, order of operations is determined by working from the inside of the dartboard out. After about 20 or so days, when I had everything down pat, the dartboard began throwing new symbols and colors that were far less intuitive. I just could not figure out what to do and it got so frustrating that I avoided drafting the billiard room altogether, locking me out of obtaining valuable keys. (Author’s note: another extremely frustrating and frankly unacceptable thing about the billiard room is that solving the puzzle requires the ability to see in color and as of this writing there are no colorblind settings. From comments about this on social media,the developers are working on deploying colorblind options, hopefully soon.) There is a story inBlue Princebut from what I’ve seen so far, it has little bearing on the puzzles and isn’t all that interesting. There’s a mystery involving members of your family’s political leanings, a missing author, and a disgruntled employee, but I’m so hungry to figure out how to open the door to the basement that I don’t pay it much mind. I’m about 27 hours in, which feels pretty hefty for a puzzle game. And I feel with all that I’ve uncovered and all I think I have left to uncover, I could go 30 hours more and it would pass in the blink of an eye. Blue Princeis out now on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 12, 2025 / 6:50 PM EDT/ CBS/AP The Trump administration confirmed to a federal judge that the Maryland man mistakenly deported last month is \"alive and secure\" but remains confined in anotorious El Salvador prison. The filing by the U.S. State Department, however, did not address thejudge's demandsthat the administration detail what steps it was taking to returnKilmar Abrego Garciato the United States. \"It is my understanding based on official reporting from our Embassy in San Salvador that Abrego Garcia is currently being held in the Terrorism Confinement Center in El Salvador,\" Michael G. Kozak, a senior State Department official, said in the filing submitted minutes after a 5 p.m. deadline set by the judge. \"He is alive and secure in that facility. He is detained pursuant to the sovereign, domestic authority of El Salvador.\" Kozak identified himself in the filing as a \"Senior Bureau Official\" in the State Department's Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs. On Saturday, President Trump revealed he is set to meet with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele on Monday. \"Our Nations are working closely together to eradicate terrorist organizations, and build a future of Prosperity,\" he said in a post on Truth Social, adding: \"These barbarians are now in the sole custody of El Salvador, a proud and sovereign Nation, and their future is up to President B and his Government. They will never threaten or menace our Citizens again!\" The state department's filing comes one day after a U.S. government attorney struggled in a hearing to provideU.S. District Judge Paula Xiniswith any information about Garcia's whereabouts. Xinis issued an order after Friday's hearing requiring the administration to disclose Garcia's \"current physical location and custodial status\" and \"what steps, if any, Defendants have taken (and) will take, and when, to facilitate\" his return. Kozak's statement did not address the judge's latter requirements. Xinis was exasperated Friday with the government's lack of information. \"Where is he and under whose authority?\" the judge asked in the hearing. \"I'm not asking for state secrets. All I know is that he's not here. The government was prohibited from sending him to El Salvador, and now I'm asking a very simple question: Where is he?\" On Thursday, the U.S. Supreme Court said the Trumpadministration must facilitate Abrego Garcia's release. Abrego Garcia, who lives in Maryland with hiswife and children, was arrested and removed to El Salvador last month after Trump administration officials accused him of having ties to the MS-13 gang. His lawyers said he has no affiliation with MS-13, and has never been charged or convicted of any criminal offenses in the U.S. or El Salvador. The 29-year-old is being confined at the notorious Salvadoran prison known asCECOT, along withother migrantssent there by the administration as part of an agreement with Bukele. Under the deal, the U.S. government ispaying the Salvadoran government $6 millionto hold U.S. detainees. But Abrego Garica's case emerged as a flashpoint in Mr. Trump's immigration crackdown after a U.S. immigration officialacknowledged in a court filingthat his removal to El Salvador was an \"administrative error\" and \"oversight.\" Jacob  RosenandMelissa  Quinncontributed to this report. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 12, 2025 / 5:19 PM EDT/ CBS News President Trump on Friday night authorized the military to take control of a strip of public land along the southern border. The president justified the use of the military by saying the United States is \"under attack from a variety of threats.\" \"The complexity of the current situation requires that our military take a more direct role in securing our southern border than in the recent past,\" the order reads. A memorandum released by the White House directs the Secretaries of Defense, Interior, Agriculture and Homeland Security to transfer the jurisdiction of federal land along the southern border to the Department of Defense. The order details that the military will be tasked with building a border wall and implementing detection and monitoring equipment. But the military's mandate is broad and defined as activities that are \"reasonably necessary and appropriate to accomplish the mission.\" The order references the Roosevelt Reservation, a swath of land along the border that goes through California, New Mexico and Arizona. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth is directed to start with the phased implementation of the military on limited sections of public land. But Hegseth has the authority to expand beyond that to any of the public land on the southern border. During a cabinet meeting with Mr. Trump this week, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Kristi Noem touted low numbers of illegal crossings at the southern border. Noem said that for the second month in a row, the U.S. broke the record for the lowest number of encounters at the border. Mr. Trump issued a blitz ofexecutive actions, when he took office in January to start reshaping federal immigration and border policies. On his first day, hedeclared a national emergency at the southern border. In March, preliminary government data obtained by CBS News showed that the number of migrants crossing the U.S. southern border illegally in Mr. Trump's first full month in officeplunged to a level not seen in at least 25 years. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "title": "Boca Raton small plane crash kills 3 and injures 1, authorities say",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 12, 2025 / 4:47 PM EDT/ CBS Miami Three people are dead and another person was hospitalized after a small airplane crashed onto the Tri-Rail tracks near I-95 inBoca Ratonon Friday, authorities said. Around 10:20 a.m., a Cessna 310 carrying three people departed the Boca Raton Airport and was bound for Tallahassee International Airport before it crashed, the Federal Aviation Administration said. Michael LaSalle, the assistant chief of the Boca Raton Fire Department, confirmed that all three on board were killed in the crash. Meanwhile, another person was hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries after possibly driving through the fireball from the crash. The FAA said it and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) are investigating the circumstances surrounding the crash. In a statement released after the crash, Boca Raton Mayor Scott Singer expressed deep sorrow over the loss of life, offered condolences to the victims' families, and praised the swift response of first responders and partnering agencies. \"Our hearts are heavy today with this tragic loss of life. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and all affected. As every day, we are grateful for the swift action of our Boca Raton Fire Rescue Department and Boca Raton Police Department,\" Singer said. \"We are grateful for their continued work and our partnerships with other public safety agencies who have also responded. Our community is caring, strong, and resilient, and we will be there to help all affected.\" Boca Raton Policeshared on X that North Military Trail is closed between Northwest 19th Street and Butts Road due to the crash. \"We expect the road closures to remain into the foreseeable future,\" Boca Raton Police said on social media. The I-95 overpass at Glades Road was temporarily closed in east- and westbound directions, and police are asking everyone to avoid the area. Update 2:03pm : I-95 overpass at Glades Rd. is now open eastbound and westbound. N. Military Trail remains closed between NW 19th St. and Butts Rd. A public information officer for theTri-Railtold CBS News Miami that train traffic and service have been suspended in the area at this time and are setting up a bus bridge between the Deerfield Beach and Boca Raton stations for rail commuters. A spokesperson for Amtrak, which travels through the same corridors as Tri-Rail, said services have been impacted because of local municipal holds in the area. The rail service shared on X as of Friday afternoon,Train 41—  which departed from Chicago on Wednesday —  has canceled its trip between Tampa and Miami.Train 40—  which was scheduled to depart from Miami on Friday —  has also been canceled. Additionally,Train 97—  which departed New York City's Penn Station on Thursday —   has also canceled its trip between Orlando and Miami. \"We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause,\" the rail service said. Chopper 4 was over the scene, where debris from the plane crash was seen covering the Tri-Rail tracks with several emergency vehicles surrounding the crash site and what appears to be fire retardant splattered across the ground. A charred car wedged up alongside a nearby tree was also seen near the crash site. It is unconfirmed at this time whether this was the vehicle that LaSalle mentioned when addressing the media early Friday afternoon. Aviation expert and former U.S. Air Force combat pilot Willard Shepard told CBS News Miami that a witness saw the plane take off from the nearby airport and appeared to have \"some trouble\" and tried to return to the airfield before the crash. \"Obviously, something very catastrophic happened and the plane went down out there [Friday],\" he said. Flightradar24, an online flight tracker, showed the aircraft never left the airport area andjust flew in circles. Shepard said that the flight path may give some clues as a what happened. \"When he's making those left turns, it indicates that there was potentially some issue, flight control issue that he was trying to deal with, and ultimately, whatever that flight control issue was, it caused the aircraft to go down and him to lose control of the aircraft to no longer keep it airborne,\" he said. Cell phone video captured the seconds after the Cessna 310 crashed on the Tri-Rail tracks. When student pilot Jared Scarpato heard the call on the radio, he began watching the plane: \"I say out loud that, 'you know, he's way too low,' and it's incredibly unfortunate. And so he was turning his final leg, which is right near the airport.\" That's when the twin-engine plane went down, exploding and torching a car as well. \"He was coming in, trying to land again, and he was just too low,\" Scarpato added. \"Couldn't make it —   absolutely devastating.\" Dillon Smith, another witness, told CBS News Miami's crew on the scene that he was talking to a client at his corporate office when he saw the plane appear to almost skim the roof of a nearby building before dropping out of sight. \"I just saw it come down and basically just drop below the tree line,\" he said. Smith continued, saying that there was a \"loud boom\" right after the plane dropped: \"The windows shook and then you saw basically a mushroom cloud of smoke and fire.\" Smith added that his concern was immediate when he saw the plane fly by because he thought that the plane was flying \"too low\" and it was going to crash into his office building. \"You could tell that something was either up or it just wasn't right,\" he said. Other witnesses told CBS News Miami's crew that the crash felt like an earthquake because their buildings shook. Hunter Geisel is a digital producer at CBS Miami.

    "title": "At least 100 people killed in attacks in Sudan's Darfur, UN official says",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 12, 2025 / 4:38 PM EDT/ AP Sudan's notorious paramilitary group launched a two-day attack on famine-hit camps for displaced people that left more than 100 dead, including 20 children and nine aid workers, in the Darfur region, a U.N. official said Saturday. The Rapid Support Forces and allied militias launched an offensive on the Zamzam and Abu Shorouk camps and the nearby city of el-Fasher, the provincial capital of North Darfur province, on Friday, said U.N. Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan Clementine Nkweta-Salami. El-Fasher is under the control of the military, which has fought the RSF since Sudan descended into civil war two years ago, killing more than 24,000 people, according to the United Nations, though activists say the number is likely far higher. The camps were attacked again on Saturday, Nkweta-Salami said in a statement. She said that nine aid workers were killed \"while operating one of the very few remaining health posts still operational\" in Zamzam camp. \"This represents yet another deadly and unacceptable escalation in a series of brutal attacks on displaced people and aid workers in Sudan since the onset of this conflict nearly two years ago,\" she said. Nkweta-Salami didn't identify the aid workers but Sudan's Doctors' Union said in a statement that six medical workers with the Relief International were killed when their hospital in Zamzam came under attack on Friday. They include Dr. Mahmoud Babaker Idris, a physician at the hospital, and Adam Babaker Abdallah, head of the group in the region, the union said. It blamed the RSF for \"this criminal and barbaric act.\" In a statement Saturday evening, Relief International mourned the death of its nine workers, saying they were killed the previous day in a \"targeted attack on all health infrastructure in the region,\" including the group's clinic. The group said the central market in Zamzam along with hundreds of makeshift homes in the camp were destroyed in the attack. The offensive forced about 2,400 people to flee the camps and el-Fasher, according to the General Coordination for Displaced Persons and Refugees, a local group in Darfur. Zamzam and Abu Shouk shelter more than 700,000 people who have been forced to flee their homes across Darfur during past bouts of fighting in the region, Nkweta-Salami said. Late last month, the Sudanese militaryregained controlover Khartoum, a major symbolic victory in the war. But the RSF still controls most of Darfur and some other areas. The two camps are among five areas in Sudan where famine was detected by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, IPC, a global hunger monitoring group. The war has created the world's largest humanitarian crisis, with about 25 million people — half of Sudan's population —facing extreme hunger. © 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 12, 2025 / 4:25 PM EDT/ CBS/AP Victor Perez, a 17-year-old autistic teen with cerebral palsyshot nine timesby Pocatello police officers in Idaho,has died, his aunt, Ana Vazquez, confirmed to CBS News. The family said they had decided to take Perez off life support on Saturday after he was declared clinically brain dead. Vazquez said there will be a vigil for the teen Saturday evening outside the hospital. Pocatello Mayor Brian Blad saidin a statementon Friday that they were \"saddened to hear the news of Victor Perez's current condition.\" \"We recognize the pain and grief this incident has caused in our community,\" Blad said. Police said that on April 5, 2025, at 5:22 p.m., officers responded to an individual armed with a knife, in the area of North Harrison Avenue. During the encounter, officers used lethal force on the individual, the statement said. Video from a witness shows that police officers opened fire from behind a chain-link fence just seconds after exiting their patrol cars and critically wounded a teenage boy as he stepped toward them with a knife. The shooting outraged his family and community members viewers online who questioned why the officers opened fire within about 12 seconds of exiting their patrol cars while making no apparent effort to de-escalate the situation or use less lethal weapons. Pocatello Police Chief Roger Schei said ina video statementposted online: \"We are also aware of the video circulating online, which shows only one angle. The full picture requires careful review of all facts and evidence.\" An investigation is being conducted by the East Idaho Critical Incident Task Force. \"It's difficult for me to trust them again. And it's sad,\" Vazquez said in an interview Thursday with CBS News. \"It's sad because the police is the one that's supposed to help us, protect us, if they don't do it, who's going to do it?

    "title": "Bond market moves raise fears of growing bets against America",
    "article_text": "Government bonds have been selling off while stocks have plunged. That’s unusual, and it’s raising concerns that global investors are losing some of their long-standing confidence in America. Stocks are generally seen as a risky type of asset, while bonds are known as a “safe haven,” with the two typically moving in opposite directions. That’s because government bonds — a type of security sold to help finance expenditures, to be paid back to buyers with interest over a set period — are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. The same can’t be said for publicly traded companies and their share prices. So when stock markets are booming and investors are excited to bet on the performance of American businesses, demand for lower-risk bonds dries up. During times of turbulence, the reverse usually happens. We don’t know exactly why bonds are gyrating so much. Barclays Analyst Ajay Rajadhyaksha Instead, the two markets have seen simultaneous sell-offs. The premier U.S. government bond, the 10-year Treasury note, saw its yield surge above 4.5% this week. Bond prices and yields are inversely correlated, so rising yields signal lower appetite for the bonds.The 10-year Treasury yield ended the week more than 12% higher, while the S&P 500 closed out a week of volatile trading up 5.7%, rebounding late Friday after a series of brutal losses. “We don’t know exactly why bonds are gyrating so much,” Barclays analyst Ajay Rajadhyaksha said in a note to clients Friday that he titled “This is not normal.” Soaring yields on 10- and 30-year Treasurys make it costlier for the federal government to borrow money. It’s also bad news for consumers because the 10-year note’s yield is directly linked to rates for mortgages, credit cards and personal and business loans. “This matters to nearly all Americans,” said Natalie Colley, a partner and financial planner at the New York-based firm Francis Financial. “Gone are the days of a pension,” she said, referring to themore than 70 million U.S. saverswith access to 401(k) retirement accounts tied to markets. Volatility on Wall Street has unnerved many account holders in recent weeks,forcing some financial planners to do double duty as therapiststo rattled clients. “If Treasurys are not a safe-haven asset, that has major implications for balance sheets across the board — businesses, nonprofits, pensions, households,” said Ernie Tedeschi, a former top economist in the Biden administration who’s now the director of economics at Yale University’s Budget Lab. “So much of world finance is predicated on U.S. Treasurys being safe.” He called recent bond market trends “the most concerning piece of data since the tariffs began.” “It’s showing a deterioration in confidence in the U.S.’s place in the world,” he said. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent haspushed backagainst such concerns, telling Fox Business on Wednesday, “There is nothing systemic about this. I think that it is an uncomfortable but normal deleveraging that’s going on in the bond market.” But experts see warning signs elsewhere, too. The value of the dollar relative to other global currencies has nosedived. This week itsuffered its biggest drop since 2022and ended Friday at its lowest level since September. “Everything in the U.S. is not doing well right now,” Kyla Scanlon, a financial educator and author of “In This Economy?: How Money and Markets Really Work,”told her TikTok followersthis week. “The U.S. dollar is getting crushed.” She chalked up the currency’s decline to “the erratic trade policy that we’ve seen,” adding: “Markets don’t believe that the U.S. has a stable or clear economic plan.” Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, flagged similar concerns. “Normally when you see big tariff increases, I would have expected the dollar to go up. The fact that the dollar is going down at the same time I think lends some more credibility to the story of investor preferences shifting,” hetold CNBC on Friday. There are several other possible explanations. One has to do withthe way hedge funds beton bond markets. Another could be that investors are anticipating a run-up in inflation and demanding higher interest rates now so they don’t lose money in the future. “Maybe they feel, or the market feels, that the actions around tariffs are actually going to create upward inflationary pressure,” said Douglas Boneparth, president of Bone Fide Wealth, an advisory firm in New York. “That very well could be part of the puzzle here.” Even experts who are more hesitant to assign a cause to the bond sell-off say geopolitical factors are hard to ignore. So much of world finance is predicated on U.S. Treasurys being safe. Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics, yale budget lab “The idea of other countries turning away from America, I don’t want to go down that rabbit hole necessarily,” said Lee Baker, founder of Claris Financial Advisors in Atlanta. “But in this particular instance, America turned away from everybody else” with steep new trade barriers. For now, Baker and other wealth advisers are cautioning clients not to react hastily to the recent volatility. Younger investors who aren’t close to retirement — and typically have less exposure to the bond market — should stay the course, Colley said. “Making sure that you’re in an appropriate asset allocation for your stage in life” andbuilding up some emergency savingscan help create a “financial moat that will insulate any investor at any point in their investing career from feeling panic around what’s going on in the stock market,” she said. If possible, she recommends keeping at least six months’ of cash on hand for a rainy day. Older retirement savers can consider some protective measures, Baker said. His firm has been buildingbuffer exchange-traded funds— so-called “defined-outcome” ETFs tied to options contracts — into clients’ portfolios. These funds tend to be more expensive and typically cap potential gains, but they offer robust downside protections and have seen a recent surge in interest. BlackRocklaunched a new iShares buffer ETFearlier this year, billing it as a way of “mitigating risk while participating in market growth.” Baker added that “there’s a whole lot of other stuff in the world beyond stocks and bonds” to consider investing in, such as real estate, infrastructure and private equity. But he cautioned that it’s usually a good idea to consult a qualified adviser first, partly to avoid making important money moves out of fear. “It’s probably not a good idea to go whole hog in any of these,” he said, “but we can certainly reduce your downside while giving you some upside with a combination of these things.”",

    "title": "Millennials have lived through economic uncertainty before. They're not nostalgic for more.",
    "article_text": "Millennials are worried they are about to experience a “once-in-a-lifetime” recession. Again. Dire economic downturns are supposed to be rare, but millennials — defined by thePew Research Centeras those born between 1981 and 1996 — have already had several recessions during formative stages of their lives, from the dot-com bubble burst when most were children, to the Great Recession as they entered the workforce after college, to the Covid-19 pandemic when they were trying to settle into their careers. Once dubbed the “unluckiest generation,” millennials have postponed major milestones during past recessions. A significant slice of them graduated college between 2007 and 2009 and struggled to find jobs, which led them todelay buying homes,getting married,andmaking major purchases, such as cars. Then, after the pandemic led to another sharp recession, some millennials, contending with student loans and rising costs of living, decided torethink having kids. Now, as theTrump administration’s tariffs programroils global markets, raising fears of another recession, the millennial cohort of approximately 29- to 44-year-olds is expressing their frustration and fatigue over the financial instability that has haunted so much of their lives. Some have posted videos on TikTok joking about how they have little advice for Gen Zers who may have to navigate their first possible recession. Others have shared how they are preparing for economic turmoil. Most are just going on social media to trade memes and jokes. “It’s out of our control, and so why not handle it with a sense of humor and joke about it?” said Jeremy Dozier, 38, a real estate agent in Los Angeles County, California, who has posted funny TikTok videos as a way to express his disdain for the current economic situation. Dozier knows how painful recessions can be: He graduated college in 2008 and was forced to take temp jobs out of college because he couldn’t find full-time work during the Great Recession. By the time the pandemic hit, he had been in a steady job for a decade, but then was laid off. “Every time we start to get ahead or it starts to feel like, ‘OK, things are going to work out,’ the other shoe drops,” he said. TikTok has been an outlet for him. In a video that Dozier posted in February,he pretends to sob as the song “I Dreamed a Dream” from “Les Misérables.” plays. The caption to the video reads: “Millennials preparing to live through their 4th recession before hitting 40.” The video racked up 23,000 likes and hundreds of comments. For young people, sarcasm and memes have become increasingly popular coping mechanisms, said Pamela Aronson, a sociology professor in the Department of Behavioral Sciences at the University of Michigan-Dearborn. “These social media arenas represent a shared cultural understanding, and these then get spread across groups who are connected to each other digitally,” she said. “’It both reflects and transforms how we think about things.” Not all members of this generation have fared poorly during past economic uncertainty. A wave of millennials were able topurchase houses during the pandemic. And concern about another recession is not limited to only their age group, said Jean Twenge, a professor of psychology at San Diego State University and author of the 2023 book “Generations,” which posits that technology, not major events in history, is the primary cause of generational differences. “Millennials went through these horrible economic times at the beginning of their adult lives, then built everything back up, did really well, and now are rightfully concerned that if there’s another recession, that they could lose it all again,” Twenge said. But, she added: “I do think this is something that is coming up for people of all ages.” There was some relief Wednesday afternoon, as stocks soared afterPresident Donald Trump announced that he would pausefor 90 days higher tariff rates on dozens of trading partners. John Sabelhaus, a visiting fellow in economic studies at the Washington-based think tank the Brookings Institution, pointed out that “the overall strategy of the current Congress could be extremely disruptive” still and noted that a financial downturn at this time would be especially damaging to millennials. “Millennials are exactly at that age where they are building businesses, and they’re trying to make these businesses work,” he said. “It’s always risky, and when you throw in a lot of macroeconomic risk, it just makes it that much worse.” Christie Cronan, a millennial content creator in Central Florida who has been posting about recession fears, said she feels like her videos have brought comfort to others in her generation. “Everyone feels validated. This is what people are expecting, that we are in an economic downturn of some sort — whether they want to call it a recession or not,” she said. Dozier, the millennial in California, said posting lighthearted TikToks has prompted other people to open up about their economic anxiety. He said people have shared what they are doing to prepare for financial stress, with some saying they are growing their own food and others commenting that they bought an extra freezer so they can try to stockpile frozen items now before tariffs hit. “While people in the comments are talking about the struggles they’re going through, it’s all kind of handled with a sense of humor and a sense of community,” he said. “We’re going to weather the storm together.”",

    "title": "Trump exempts phones, computers, chips from new tariffs",
    "article_text": "PresidentDonald Trumpexemptedsmartphones,computers, and other tech devices and components from hisnew tariffs, newguidancefromU.S. Customs and Border Protectionshows. The guidance, issued late Friday evening, comes after Trump earlier this month imposed 145% tariffs on products from China, a move that threatened to take a toll on tech giants likeApple, which makesiPhonesand most of its other products in China. The guidance also includes exclusions for other electronic devices and components, including semiconductors, solar cells, flat panel TV displays, flash drives, and memory cards.TheWhite Housesaid on Saturday the exemptions were made because Trump wants to ensure that companies have time to move production to the U.S. White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai said in a statement that Trump “has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops.” “At the direction of the President, these companies are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible,” Desai said. The 20 product categories listed in the CBP guidelines are apparently exempt from the 125% tariff imposed by Trump on Chinese imports and the 10% baseline tariff on imports from other countries. A 20% tariff on all Chinese goods remains in effect. CNBC has asked the White House and CBP to confirm the total effective tariff rate on the exempted products but so far has received no definitive answer. The exemptions are a win for tech companies like Apple, which makes the majority of its products in China. The country manufactures 80% of iPads and more than half of Mac computers produced, according to Evercore ISI. “This is the dream scenario for tech investors,” Dan Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, told CNBC. “Smartphones, chips being excluded is a game changer scenario when it comes to China tariffs.” He added that the tariffs have been a “black cloud over tech since the day of liberation, because no sector was going to be more hurt than big tech.” “I think ultimately big tech CEOs spoke loudly, and the White House had to understand and listen to the situation that this would have been Armageddon for big tech if were implemented,” Ives said In the days since Trump’s tariff announcement, Apple lost over $640 billion in market value,CNBC previously reported. The cost of an iPhone under Trump’s tariff plan could have ballooned to as high as $3,500 undersome estimates. Since Trump’s tariffs announcement, stocks have sold off sharply as uncertainty and volatility on Wall Street spiked. The S&P 500 plunged more than 5% during the period until Friday’s close. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield soared more than 50 basis points during the week, one of its largest jumps on record, as the whiplash from Trump’s trade policy led investors to sell off U.S. assets. Thebond market’smove higher may have forced the White House’s hand into some reversals, including a90-day tariff reprieveon most countries in favor of a universal 10% rate announced Wednesday — excluding China. The items excluded from Trump’s tariffs under the new guidelines are retroactive for products that have left the warehouse by April 5, 2025. This provides clarity and financial planning for the U.S. shipper, who is responsible for paying the tariff once it arrives weeks later at U.S. Customs for processing and release.",

    "title": "'They left together': Family member of Hudson River helicopter crash victims speaks out",
    "article_text": "The brother of Merce Camprubi Montal, the young wife and mother who died inthis week’s New York City helicopter crashalong with four other family members and the pilot, threw flowers into the mist-covered Hudson River on Saturday to honor the victims. Shortly after the flowers were thrown near the site of the crash, Joan Camprubi and Mayor Eric Adams spoke to the press. “They left together. They left without suffering,” Camprubi said. “We mourn the lives of Agustín, Merce and their three beautiful children, Victor, Mercedes and Augustine. Our hearts are broken,” Adams added. “You have 8.5 million New Yorkers who want to say to the family members and to the wider Spanish community that we are here with you, and this symbolic gesture is our way of knowing and acknowledging that our words cannot bring back their family members, but it is our way of saying as New Yorkers, we stand united with this family during this moment of grief, and their grief is our grief,” Adams said. Now family members of the victims are asking for privacy as they continue to mourn their loved ones. “We want to move the bodies as soon as possible, home, back home, with all the family, to rest in peace together in our place,” Camprubi said. “But also we want to thank all the institutional support that we received, starting from Spain, from also Catalonia, from U.S., New York, New Jersey. Everybody has been supporting us, and especially also Siemens as a company, where Merce and Agustín were working,” he continued.The doomed aircraft, a Bell 206,broke apart over the Hudson River Thursday afternoonand plunged into the water below with a loud boom, killing the Spanish family of five and the pilot on board during a tour over Manhattan that was meant to celebrate one of the family members’ birthdays. Agustín Escobar and Merce Camprubi Montal, amarried couple from Spain, were identified as two of the adult victims. The Spanish Foreign Ministry confirmed that the couple and their three children died in the helicopter crash. A senior New York City official told NBC New York the third adult victim was the pilot, Sean Johnson. Johnson was 36 years old, according to the Jersey City mayor’s office. Divers continued to recover pieces of the chopper from the Hudson on Saturday as investigators evaluate the aircraft’s flight control system, the National Transportation Safety Board, which is leading the investigation into the crash, said Saturday. The divers are still searching for the helicopter’s main rotor, main gear box, tail rotor and a large portion of the tail boom, the NTSB said. The main fuselage, including the cockpit and cabin, the forward portion of the tail boom, the horizontal stabilizer finlets and the vertical fin have been recovered. The helicopter was not equipped with any flight recorders, the NTSB said. It had last been inspected on March 1 and completed seven tour flights earlier Thursday. The accident took place during the aircraft’s eighth flight of the day, according to the NTSB. The cause of the crash remains unclear. NBC aviation analyst Jeff Guzzetti said on NBC’s“TODAY” showFriday that weather doesn’t appear to be a factor, although there were some gusts and wind in the area. He noted they are looking into potential hardware issues that could have befallen the flight.",

    "title": "Mistakenly deported man is alive and detained in El Salvador, Trump admin says",
    "article_text": "The Trump administration, in a filing posted to the docket several minutes after a 5 p.m. Saturday deadline, said a man mistakenly deported to El Salvador is alive and remains detained there. The late-in-the-day filing is in an effort to comply with Maryland-based U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis’ order from Friday, which demanded the government provide a daily status report on Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s whereabouts and conditions, along with any efforts being taken to bring him back to the United States. “It is my understanding based on official reporting from our Embassy in San Salvador that Abrego Garcia is currently being held in the Terrorism Confinement Center in El Salvador,” Michael G. Kozak, a senior bureau official in the Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs at the State Department, wrote in a two-page sworn declaration. “He is alive and secure in that facility. He is detained pursuant to the sovereign, domestic authority of El Salvador.” In a separate filing also submitted Saturday evening, asking for additional relief, attorneys for Abrego Garcia used President Donald Trump’s words against him. “Yesterday, President Trump confirmed that the United States has the power to facilitate Abrego Garcia’s release from prison and return to the United States: ‘If the Supreme Court said, ‘Bring somebody back,’ I would do that. ... I respect the Supreme Court,” the attorneys quoted Trump as telling reporters Friday night. The attorneys were referencing a Thursday ruling from the high court that orderedthe Trump administration to “facilitate”Abrego Garcia’s release from a Salvadoran prison to which he was sent on March 15. “Of course,” the man's lawyers wrote, “that is precisely what the Supreme Court did when it ruled that this Court’s injunction ‘properly requires the Government to “facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.’” However, Trump appeared to walk back his Friday message in aSaturday post on Truth Social. In the post, Trump said he is working with President Bukele of El Salvador “to eradicate terrorist organizations, and build a future of Prosperity.” “President Bukele has graciously accepted into his Nation’s custody some of the most violent alien enemies of the World and, in particular, the United States,” Trump wrote. “These barbarians are now in the sole custody of El Salvador, a proud and sovereign Nation, and their future is up to President B and his Government.” The two leaders are scheduled to meet Monday in the White House. Attorneys for Abrego Garcia are asking the district court to order the government to, by the end of the day Monday, take specific steps to comply with the injunction in the case and to order expedited discovery of the government’s actions — or failure to act — in facilitating Abrego Garcia’s return to the United States. They are also asking the court to order the government to show cause by 10 a.m. Monday as to why it should not be held in contempt due to its failure to comply with the court’s prior orders, including any failureto a comply with the court’s April 11 orderthat stated the government needed to provide, by Friday morning, information on what steps it was taking to coordinate Abrego Garcia’s return following the Supreme Court’s order from the day prior. Xinis on Friday had directed the Trump administration to “take all available steps to facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s return following Thursday’s high court order. She also asked for a daily update on Abrego Garcia’s whereabouts. The Supreme Court decision did not require the Trump administration to immediately try to return Abrego Garcia because Xinis’ deadline to bring him home had already passed. But the unsigned decision stated that the government “should be prepared to share what it can concerning the steps it has taken and the prospect of further steps.” The ruling rejected the administration’s emergency appeal of Xinis’ April 4 order, whichcalled for Abrego Garcia’s returnby April 7. On Friday, the government said it needed more time to provide Xinis with the requested information on Abrego Garcia. The Maryland father, a legal resident protected from deportation by a 2019 court order, was mistakenly sent to the Salvadoran prison along with other men who were alleged to be gang members. The Trump administration claims Abrego Garcia is a member of MS-13, though he has never been charged with or convicted of a crime. His attorneys said there is no evidence he was in the gang, and immigration officials have conceded he should not have been sent to El Salvador, his country of birth, calling it an “administrative error.” Saturday is the first time since March 15 that the government has said Abrego Garcia is alive. Xinis is set to hold a hearing Tuesday afternoon to check in with the government on where it is in terms of getting Abrego Garcia back to the U.S.",

    "title": "FBI analyst targeted in Kash Patel's book placed on leave",
    "article_text": "The FBI has placed an analyst on leave whose name was on a list of alleged \"deep state\" actors in a book written by FBI Director Kash Patel, two people familiar with the matter told NBC News. This was firstreportedby the New York Times. It’s unclear what reason the FBI gave for the move, and the agency declined to comment. Brian Auten, a Russia expert, was the employee who was placed on leave. He was also among the FBI employeesrecommended forinternaldisciplineby former FBI Director Christopher Wrayover mistakes made in connection with the 2017 investigation into links between then-candidate Donald Trump and the Russian government. A later review by the Justice Department inspector general found no evidence that any FBI employee acted out of political bias in the Russia investigation. Patel included Auten ona list of roughly 60alleged\"deepstate\"actorsin his 2023 book, \"Government Gangsters.\" Patel denounced the FBI analyst by name, writing: “The fact that Auten was not fired from the FBI and prosecuted for his part in the Russia Gate conspiracy is a national embarrassment.” Patel also accused Auten of downplaying information found on the laptop of former President Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden. The FBI director has disputed that the list in his book is an enemies list. Patelhas his own links to the 2017 investigationinto ties between President Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and the Russian government. At the start of Trump's first term, Patel worked for then-Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., as a staffer on the GOP-led House Intelligence Committee. In that role, Patel authored a memo accusing the FBI of making mistakes when it obtained a warrant to conduct surveillance of Carter Page, one of Trump's campaign advisors at the time. Later in the first Trump administration, Patel served on the White House National Security Council. The move to place Auten on leave comes after the Trump administration has for months targeted FBI officials who worked on prosecutions of Trump or those who rioted at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. In January, the Trump administrationforced out six of the agency's senior executivesand several heads of FBI field offices across the country. A letter sent to those who were fired at the time said that their removal was based on the their role in the Jan. 6 prosecutions. Later, in March, the Trump administrationforced out the head of the FBI's New York field officeafter he urged employees to \"dig in\" in the wake of the January firings.",

    "title": "American teen was killed by Israeli soldiers in the West Bank. The U.S. has said little about it.",
    "article_text": "TURMUS AYYA, West Bank — To his family, Amer Rabee was just a 14-year-old American boy picking almonds with two friends. But to the Israeli soldiers who gunned him down on Sunday night, the trio were “three terrorists” who were “endangering civilians” by throwing rocks at cars. The hail of bullets the soldiers fired over the next several minutes succeeded in “eliminating one terrorist and hitting two additional terrorists,” theIsrael Defense Forcessaid in a statement Tuesday. Now, as the village of Turmus Ayya, which has a large number of U.S. citizens, mourns the loss of one of its children — whose family insists had neither violent tendencies nor political allegiances — it’s grappling with a deeper question: whyPresident Donald Trumpand the U.S. government have said so little about the killing of one of its citizens. Amer was “an American citizen,” Mohammed Rabee, 28, said Thursday about his cousin, who grew up in Saddle Brook, New Jersey. “He thought his passport came with freedom and American protection, but it clearly didn’t.” “Our president hasn’t shed a light on this,” he added. Mohammed and other family members spoke to NBC News on the third day of mourning for Amer at one of Turmus Ayya’s municipal buildings, where townspeople shuffled through to offer their condolences, sipped coffee and smoked cigarettes before dining on a lamb and rice lunch. Describing Amer, the youngest of five siblings, as “very intelligent,” Amer’s father Mohammed Rabee, 48, said he had “no problems” with anyone in theWest Bank, where the family moved to in 2013. He added that Amer had plenty of friends back home in the U.S. who he kept in contact with over the phone and through his gaming console. As soon as he heard his son was involved in a shooting, he said he tried to contact the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem, hoping it would intervene or provide medical help. The process of identifying himself and his son took too long, Mohammed said, and he begged the State Department official on the other end of the line to contact the IDF to ask it to hold its fire. NBC News has asked the embassy for comment. The following day, hours after his son had been killed, the embassy called Mohammed back to follow up, he said. “I told them he’s already dead, so what can you do now?” Mohammed said. The same day, the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem released a statement acknowledging that an American citizen had been killed and offered “our sincerest condolences to the family on their loss.” But Amer’s family, along with other residents of Turmus Ayya, said they wanted to hear from Trump, who did not mention him at a meeting in the Oval Office with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netnayahu the day after his death, even as he held forth on the plight of remaininghostages in the Gaza Strip. “We have a U.S. citizen, a child, who was murdered in cold blood,” said Yaser Alkam, the head of the Turmus Ayya’s municipality. “Why should we not be treated equally as any other American?” The Trump administration has been “fighting for the release of one of the American hostages in Gaza,” said Alkam, referring to Edan Alexander, a 21-year-old Israeli American soldier who grew up in the U.S. After the Trump administration took power, it broke long-standing diplomatic protocol and started negotiating directly with Hamas to try to free Alexander — thought to be the last living American hostage in the enclave — and secure the release of the bodies of four other Israeli Americans in Gaza. Like Amer’s family and many of the other residents in the village dubbed “little America” by Palestinians, Alkam said he has dual citizenship and divides his time between the West Bank and the U.S. Turmus Ayya is the ancestral homeland for thousands of Palestinian Americans, many of whose ancestors immigrated to the United States decades ago. Their descendants return to inherited property in the town — homes, businesses and farms that allow residents to keep their feet in both cultures. But even though many storefront signs in Turmus Ayya are written in English and pizza places are as common as shawarma stands, the town is fraught with danger. Settler violence in the West Bank, including incursions into occupied territory and raids, has intensified since the start of Israel’s war in Gaza that has killed over 50,500 people there, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run enclave. The Israeli onslaught in Gaza followed a Hamas terror attack on Oct. 7, 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and about 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies. In an update late last month, the United Nations humanitarian affairs office said Israeli forces had killed99 Palestinians this year in the West Bank. In Turmus Ayya, villagers showed NBC News videos from security cameras of young men rampaging through the town committing violent acts of vandalism. NBC News could not independently verify that the footage was of Israeli settlers. Amer’s father, Mohammed, said settlers burned down one of the family’s vacation homes outside the village. He added that he regularly warns his sons not to venture to the outskirts for fear of settler attacks, even tracking their movements on a cellphone app. Many of the uniformed soldiers are settlers themselves, deputized by the armed forces to carry and use firearms as a kind of local law enforcement. “The reason why all this aggression happens is because they want to push out and take our land,” said Amer’s older brother Saad. “Us just being here, simply existing on this land, is an act of resistance, and it pushes back their illegal settler expansion.” Along with its statement, the IDF released a grainy, night-vision video of what it said was the incident that showed three people, one of whom appeared to throw an object. Both Amer’s father and brothers said they couldn’t identify him from the video, but that the shooting occurred at a well-known teenage hangout spot amid green almond trees that had just begun fruiting. One of the other boys, Palestinian American Ayub Ijbara, remains in the hospital. Abdul Rahman Shhadah has returned home. Both are also 14. Traipsing through the small town’s hilly outskirts is “something that Palestinian boys do,” Amer’s brother Saad said. The family all said they thought it was unlikely that Amer and his friends had been throwing rocks at cars. If they were throwing rocks at all, it was more likely they were trying to knock the almonds from the trees. But even if they had been targeting cars on the nearby road — which wasn’t clearly visible from the scene of the IDF shooting — teenage hijinks shouldn’t have merited a death sentence, they said. “I want the whole world to hear our story so they can feel the same way if this happened to an American kid or an Israeli kid,” said Amer’s grandfather Amjad. “We want them to be safe in this world, not killed at 14 years old.”",

    "title": "Republicans plow ahead with anti-abortion agenda in states where voters approved constitutional amendments",
    "article_text": "Even as Republicans swept into power in Washington in last year’s elections, abortion rights supporters found success at the ballot box across the country. But that hasn’t deterred abortion opponents. Republican lawmakers have moved forward this year with bills to restrict abortion in more than half of the stateswhere voters passed constitutional amendmentsin November to protect or expand reproductive rights. They’ve also advanced bills in a bevy of states that would make if more difficult for groups to place similar measures on the ballot in the future. Those efforts extend to three states where amendments to enshrine a constitutional right to an abortion fell short last November. “The abortion industry’s attempts to completely deregulate their industry via ballot measures is putting women and girls in danger,” Kelsey Pritchard, the director of state public affairs for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, said in an email. “Republican leaders in states with pro-abortion ballot measures should be doing all that they can to protect health and safety protections for women and girls.” Reproductive rights groups say the actions — even if ultimately unsuccessful — amount to an overt rejection of the desires of voters on the issue of abortion. “Even when their voters made their support of abortion access extremely clear with these ballot amendments, Republicans are still willing to trample them,” said Yari Aquino, who helps advise candidates for EMILY’s List, a national group that backs Democratic women who support abortion rights. Aquino suggested that if conservatives’ efforts continue, Democrats would be wise to keep abortion rights at the center of their platform heading into next year’s midterms. “This is why abortion rights and reproductive rights continue to be such a salient issue,” she said. In Arizona, where votersoverwhelmingly chose toenshrine abortion rights in their state constitution five months ago, Republicans in the state Legislature have advancedbills that would createnew restrictions on the use of abortion-inducing drugs. Those include the requirement that a doctor must examine a patient before the patient can obtain the drugs.Another bill would bandoctors in the state from introducing abortion care to their patients as a prospective treatment option. The bill proposes punishing doctors and practices who “promote” abortion care as a potential treatment option by stripping them of any contracts or funding from any state agencies. Criticsargue the billsare a “backdoor” way to eliminate Medicaid funding for any practice that even mentions abortion to a pregnant patient. “Arizonans spoke their voice. They used their voice to say what they wanted,” said Arizona state Rep. Stephanie Simacek, a Democrat who has co-sponsored multiple bills thatseek to protector expand abortion rights. “This is just another way for [Republicans] to push exactly what they did not get.” “It’s a backdoor way for them to try to come in and overrule the voice of the people here in Arizona,” she added. Republicans in Missouri are teeing up a ballot measure that would reverse the onevoters approved in Novemberthat effectively protected abortion rights until fetal viability and undid a near-total abortion ban on the books. Conservative lawmakers in the state havealso introduced legislation that would allow Missouriansto wipe out most all of their tax bill if they donate what they owed in state income taxes to pregnancy resource centers, which reproductive rights advocates say are designed to steer pregnant women away from abortions. In Montana, where voters enshrined abortion access into the state constitution, GOP lawmakers responded by introducing a bill that seeks to make traveling to or from the state for an abortion later in pregnancy a crime punishable by up to five years in prison. The bill, which compared that action tohuman “trafficking,”was eventuallytabled. In Colorado, where abortion had already been legal through fetal viability, voters passed a measure to formally enshrine those rights. Republican legislators there introduced abillthat would make bringing a minor to the state for an abortion a felony crime. Voters in Kentucky, a Republican stronghold that has a near-total ban on abortion,rejected an initiativein 2023 to amend the state constitution to explicitly state that there isn’t a right to abortion. Republican lawmakersstill passeda bill thatabortion advocates said further narrowedthe medical exceptions that had been allowed under the existing abortion ban. Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear vetoed the bill, but Republicans in the Legislature used their supermajority to override it. Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers in at least 15 states have advanced bills in recent weeks that would make it more difficult for proposed constitutional amendments to qualify for the ballot. In Arizona, Missouri and South Dakota, legislators are attempting to raise the threshold for passage for ballot measures to 60% from a simple majority. In those states, as well as Montana, Nebraska, Florida and Arkansas, Republicans have also advanced bills that create more onerous signature requirements for proposed amendments to qualify for the ballot. (Voters rejected amendments to enshrine abortion rights in the constitution in 2024 in Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota.) Groups that advocate for reproductive rights and for ballot measures said these actions are an effort to roll back voters’ rights. “Ballot measures have been a lifeline to working people in red and purple states, allowing them to make change even when politicians fail to represent their interests. Legislators are trying to systematically take that power away,” Kelly Hall, the executive director of the Fairness Project, a nonprofit organization that helps progressive groups advance citizen-led ballot initiatives, said in a statement. “This is their playbook,” Hall said, adding that when “politicians know they can’t win with voters on the issues, they try to change the rules of the game.”",

    "article_text": "North Carolina has reported a record number of flu deaths this respiratory virus season, health officials said this week. More than 500 flu-related deaths were reported for the 2024-25 respiratory virus season, the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services said in a Wednesday press release. The figure marked the highest statewide total since reporting began in 2009. “These numbers would be even higher without the dedication of the NCDHHS Division of Public Health and local health department teams who provide flu education, distribute vaccines, and support treatment and prevention efforts in all 100 counties,” North Carolina Health and Human Services Secretary Devdutta Sangvai said in a statement. “Their work saves lives every single day,” he added. Flu-related deaths in the state were nearly on par with deaths caused by Covid-19, which is known to be a more severe illness than the flu, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDCrecordedapproximately 600 Covid-19 deaths in the state between October and April. Health officials warned that federal funding cuts to the state “have impacted the ability to protect the health and well-being of North Carolinians, leaving the state vulnerable to public health threats.” In recent weeks, the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency has been making steep cuts to the federal workforce andfunding for scientific researchacross the country. A representative for DOGE did not immediately respond to NBC News’ request for comment. The funding cuts led to the elimination of more than 80 jobs and a loss of at least $100 million for the department, according to the press release. “Despite these challenges, trust in public health remains high,” the release said. “This trust is a clear signal that public health is more important than ever,” said Dr. Kelly Kimple, the interim state health director and NCDHHS’ chief medical officer, in a press release. “I’m incredibly proud of the dedication and impact of our public health teams across the state.” “Now is the time to match that trust with stable, long-term investment in our public health workforce and infrastructure so we can continue to protect our communities for years to come,” Kimple added.",

    "title": "Patsy Cline's 'Lost Recordings' released 60 years after her death",
    "article_text": "More than 60 years after her tragic death, country music legend Patsy Cline still has more to share with the world after never-before-released recordings of the iconic star were discovered in a basement. A limited-edition, two-LP set, “Imagine That: The Lost Recordings (1954-1963),” which includes 48 songs from live concerts and radio and TV appearances, was released on Saturday for Record Store Day byElemental Music/Deep Digs. A two-CD set will also be available on April 18. Two of the oldest recordings, discovered in a basement where they’d been stored for 30 years, were found on their original acetate disc recorded at the old WARL radio station in Arlington,NBC Washingtonreported. Many of the tracks were recorded in D.C. or Virginia. Cline, originally from Winchester, Virginia, only recorded a few studio albums before she died in a plane crash at 30 years old. “It’s just like she’s alive again,” her daughter, Julie Fudge, told NBC Washington. “It is really very personal. And I’m just so impressed with the work that these people did and so glad that we trusted them to do this.” The compilation spans Cline’s career from the start of her professional work in the early 1950s to the peak of her popularity before her death in 1963, according to Elemental Music. Fudge said the never-before-released recordings of her mother’s performances evoke a different listening experience than her previous albums. “She’s in her early 20s and she’s singing in front of people live,” Fudge told NBC Washington. “It really does have a personal feel when you listen to it. It’s like sitting in a room and talking to somebody.” Marc Zitelman found the relic WARL disc in a box of records sitting in his basement, though it is not immediately clear when the recordings were rediscovered. “There’s an A side and a B side,” Zitelman said while showing it to NBC Washington. “As you can see in the label, it was just typed up in the front office while the engineer was recording this from a live presentation.” Zitelman’s father kept the box of records in his downtown restaurant, Bassin’s, which used to be a popular night spot. Zitelman believes the disc had been stored in the restaurant since 1954, though he was not sure how it ended up in his father’s hands. “I think the thing is that it’s finally found its way into perpetuity,” Zitelman told NBC Washington. “So, I’m actually really thrilled that this is now in a place where forever it can be heard, and it’s something I don’t think was ever heard before.” Listeners can hear new renditions of Cline’s most iconic tunes on the record, like “Walkin’ After Midnight,” “Crazy” and “I Fall to Pieces.” The traditional gospel song “Just a Closer Walk With Thee” also appears, recorded just weeks before Cline’s death. It is one of her last known recordings.",

    "title": "Trump’s ongoing 25% auto tariffs expected to cut sales by millions, cost $100 billion",
    "article_text": "DETROIT — As PresidentDonald Trump’s25% tariffs on imported vehiclesremain in effect despite a pullback this week on other country-based levies, analysts are expecting massive global implications for the automotive industry due to the policies. They’re expecting to see a drop in vehicle sales in the millions,higher new and used vehicle prices, and increased costs of more than $100 billion for the industry, according to research reports from Wall Street and automotive analysts. “What we’re seeing now is a structural shift, driven by policy, that’s likely to be long-lasting,” Felix Stellmaszek, Boston Consulting Group’s global lead of automotive and mobility, told CNBC. “This may well be the most consequential year for the auto industry in history — not just because of immediate cost pressures, but because it’s forcing fundamental change in how and where the industry builds.” BCG expects tariffs to add $110 billion to $160 billion on an annual run rate basis in costs to the industry, which could impact 20% of U.S. new-vehicle market revenues, increasing production costs for both U.S. and non-U.S. manufacturers. The Center for Automotive Research, a Michigan-based nonprofit think tank, believes costs for automakers in the U.S. alone will increase by $107.7 billion. That includes $41.9 billion for Detroit automakersGeneral Motors,Ford Motorand Chrysler parentStellantis. Both analyses take into account the 25% tariffs on imported vehicles implemented by Trump on April 3 as well as forthcoming levies of thesame amount on automotive partsthat are set to begin by May 3. Automakers and suppliers may be able to bear some of the cost increases, but they’re also expected to pass them along to U.S. consumers, which could in turn lower sales, according to analysts. “We believe the tariffs as proposed will raise the cost of both importing and manufacturing vehicles in the US by at least a low to mid single digit thousand dollar level on average, and we believe it will be hard for the auto industry to fully pass this on, especially with softening consumer demand more generally,” Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney said in a Thursday investor note. Goldman Sachs assumes new vehicle net prices in the U.S. will rise by roughly $2,000 to $4,000 over the next six- to 12-month timeframe to better reflect tariff costs. Automakers haveresponded to the tariffsin a variety of ways. Manufacturers that are mostly domestic, such as Ford and Stellantis, have announced temporary deals for employee pricing, while others, such as British carmaker Jaguar Land Rover, have ceased U.S. shipments.Hyundai Motoralso has said it would not raise prices for at least two months to ease consumer concerns. Consumer sentiment grew even worse than anticipated in April as the expected inflation level hit its highest since 1981, a closely watched University of Michigansurvey showed Friday. Sam Abuelsamid, vice president of insights atauto advisory firm Telemetry, expects many automakers have at least a roughly two-month supply of non-tariff impacted vehicles that they will be able to sell down before needing to increase prices due to tariffs. Telemetry expects the higher costs for production, parts and other factors to result in upward of 2 million fewer vehicles sold annually in the U.S. and Canada, which will have ripple effects on the broader economy. “A couple million-unit reduction in sales will have a broad impact economically,” Abuelsamid said. “That’s driven by higher prices, not just for vehicles, but across the board … which is going to limit people’s’ spending power.” Affordability of new and used vehicles has been a problem for several years. On average, Cox Automotive reports new vehiclescost nearly $50,000.That figure doesn’t include the cost of financing such a vehicle, which has risen significantly in recent years in an attempt to combat inflation. Auto loan rates remain near decades-high levels of more than 9.64% for a new vehicle and nearly 15% for a used car or truck, according to Cox. “We expect to see declining discounting and then accelerated price increases as the tariffs are passed through and supply tightens, leading to price increases on all types of most new vehicles,” Cox Automotive Chief Economist Jonathan Smoke said during avirtual event Monday.“Over the longer term, we expect production and sales to fall, newly used prices to increase, and some models to be eliminated.” Expected price increases vary based on vehicle, but Cox estimates a $6,000 increase to the cost of imported vehicles due to the 25% tariff on non-U.S. assembled vehicles, as well as a $3,600 increase to vehicles assembled in the U.S. due to upcoming 25% tariffs on automotive parts. Those are in addition to $300 to $500 increases as a result of previously announced tariffs on steel and aluminum.",

Officials said 189 people were rescued alive from the rubble of the popular venue in the capital Santo Domingo. More than 200 were injured, with 15 of them still hospitalized, including five in critical condition. Early on Tuesday, the roof at the nightclub Jet Set collapsed during a merengue concert. Politicians, athletes and a fashion designer were among those enjoying live music when disaster struck. As of Saturday morning, people remained at a forensics institute waiting forthe return of their loved ones’ bodies. Later in the day, health authorities said all 225 bodies had been returned to the victims’ families. Health minister Victor Attalah told journalists Saturday there was a delay in identifying victims because the majority of them had to be matched using biometric data. Victims identified so far include former Major League Baseball players Octavio Dotel and Tony Enrique Blanco Cabrera. Nelsy Cruz, the governor of the northwestern province of Montecristi whose brother is seven-time MLB All-Star Nelson Cruz also died. Officials have said it is too soon to determine why the roof fell, although prosecutors visited the scene on Thursday after rescue crews began packing up and removed heavy equipment. On Thursday, President Luis Abinader and First Lady Raquel Arbaje attended the burial of singer Rubby Pérez in Santo Domingo’s National Theater. Pérez had been performing on stage at the packed Jet Set club early Tuesday when dust began falling from the ceiling and, seconds later, the roof caved. Mourners clad in black and white streamed into the theater and some doubled over in tears as a recording of Pérez singing the national anthem played.",

    "article_text": "A slow-moving low-pressure system is bringing snow, rain and gusty winds to the Northeast this weekend. Winter alerts are in effect from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. ET for parts of the Green Mountains in Vermont, the Berkshires in Massachusetts and the Catskill Mountains in New York. An additional 1 to 3 inches of snow are possible across parts of Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Maine. Up to 4 inches of snow may be possible across Maine through Sunday. As of 2 p.m. ET, Princeton and Ashburnham, Massachusetts, reported 9 inches of snow, while Austerlitz, New York, reported 5.8 inches. Twin Lakes, Pennsylvania, and High Point, New Jersey, have both reported just about 6inches of wintry powder. Snow was seen coming down in the Catskills and Albany early Saturday morning.One TikTok user sharedvideoof snow covering her backyard in Maine. As of 4:00 p.m. E.T., over 4,700 utility customers were without power across the Northeast, including 2,239 in New Jersey and 1,038 in New York, according toPowerOutage.us. Temperatures are also colder than usual in the Northeast on Saturday, dipping 10 to 20 degrees below average. They’re expected to rebound to seasonal highs by Sunday. Scattered rain is also taking aim at the region, staying in the forecast through Saturday afternoon, with most areas drying out by Sunday morning.

Around 23 million remain under fire alerts this weekend across the Four Corners (where Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah meet), Texas and Florida. Denver and Colorado Springs, Colorado; Tucson, Arizona; Santa Fe, New Mexico; and Miami, Florida are all included in these alerts due to the combination of gusty winds, dry vegetation and low relative humidity festering in the area. These high fire concerns are also fueled by warm temperatures, as Saturday afternoon highs soar 10 to 30 degrees above average. Numerous record highs are threatened, including inPhoenixand Tucson, Arizona; Denver, Colorado; and Amarillo and San Antonio, Texas.",

    "title": "Oldest known Pearl Harbor survivor dies at 106",
    "article_text": "At 106 years old, Vaughn Drake Jr. was the oldest known survivor of the attack on Pearl Harbor until his death on April 7, according to hisobituary. Born Nov. 6, 1918, in Winchester, Kentucky, Drake served in the Army Corps of Engineers during World War II. He saw the battles of Pearl Harbor and Saipan in the Marianas, collecting an array of honors including the special congressional medal for Pearl Harbor veterans and the World War II Victory Medal. In 2016, theLexington Herald-Leadersat down with Drake to record some of his memories of the fateful attack on Dec. 7, 1941. He was only 23 at the time, according toPacific Historic Parks. Drake recalled in his interview that he was in charge of a temporary power plant, ensuring carpenters had electricity for saws and other equipment. The crew was building new barracks at Kaneohe Naval Air Station, which is now a Marine Corps installation east of Pearl Harbor. “We were getting ready to go to breakfast, and we heard all these planes flying over and making a lot of noise,” Drake told the newspaper. “We just figured it was the Army Air Corps carrying out maneuvers for practice, like they did a lot. We didn’t pay much attention to it.” Drake said they went to the chow line for breakfast and saw planes over the naval air station, diving about. “We thought, ‘Boy, they’re really putting on a good show,’” he said. They saw the red dots on the wings, marking them as Japanese, but Drake said they still couldn’t believe what they were seeing. One of the officers was in contact with headquarters at Schofield Barracks in Oahu, calling out, “This is an attack! The Japanese are attacking the whole island!” Drake said. At 98 years old at the time of the interview, Drake could still remember seeing a Japanese plane crash at Kaneohe. “Later that day, some of us went over there and tore some pieces out of it, and this is a little control stick that I got,” he said. “It’s got some Japanese writing on it, which I never did get translated.” Drake told the newspaper he never returned to Pearl Harbor or Oahu but would share his story in interviews or public meetings on occasion. “I do feel like a part of history,” Drake had said. “I haven’t made it the big thing in my life.” And Drake indeed lived a full life after the war. He returned to Kentucky, beginning a career as an engineer in the private sector and starting a family with his wife, Lina Drake. They were married 65 years before she died in 2011, according to herobituary. The Drakes had one son, Samuel, who now survives both his parents. Vaughn Drake also leaves behind two grandsons and three great-grandchildren. The veteran will have a military burial service at the Winchester Cemetery in Kentucky on April 17.",

    "article_text": "A convicted murderer who escaped custody from correction officers in California in December is now accused of killing a Mexican police commander. Cesar Hernandez, 34, who was serving a life sentence for murder, escaped from the custody of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation on Dec. 2, according to a flyer released by the U.S. Embassy in Mexico and the U.S. Marshals Service on Friday. The flyer said Hernandez killed a Mexican State Citizen Security Forces agent on Wednesday as law enforcement tried to apprehend him. It included a mug shot of Hernandez and described him as “dangerous,” armed and having violent tendencies. The U.S. Marshals Service confirmed the incident in a statement to NBC News and identified the agent shot and killed as Mexico Police Commander Abigail Esparza Reyes. The USMS said its personnel were in the area but not involved in the shooting incident. The law enforcement agency added that U.S. authorities rendered aid to Reyes before she succumbed to her injuries. “Those who commit violence against law enforcement officers will be held accountable,” the law enforcement agency said. Officials are offering a reward of $35,000 for information leading to Hernandez’s arrest. Before he escaped, the 34-year-old was serving a sentence of 80 years to life for first-degree murder in a 2019 killing in Los Angeles County,according to NBC affiliate KGETin California. Hernandez was set to appear in Delano court the morning of Dec. 2, after pleading no contest to manufacturing a weapon and possessing drugs in prison,KGETreported. Video of Hernandez’s escape shows him running across an empty field without shackles or handcuffs, according to the local outlet. Kern County Sheriff Donny Youngblood told KGET in December that Hernandez likely used a self-made key to break free from the chains before punching a guard and running through an open gate in the transfer parking lot of the courthouse. A spokesperson for the CDCR confirmed there was an active investigation “related to Cesar Hernandez in Tijuana,” but declined to comment further.",

    "article_text": "A convicted murderer who was mistakenly released from jail in March was apprehended and arrested in Florida on Friday, officials said. Kathan Guzman was taken into custody by the U.S. Marshals Service without incident, per the Orange County Sheriff’s Office. The U.S. Marshals Service did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Guzman is being held in Florida, NBC affiliateWXIA-TVreported. Guzman was sentenced to life in prison in October 2024 for a murder in Clayton County, Georgia, according to Clayton County Sheriff Levon Allen. WXIA-TV reported that he was found guilty of murdering his girlfriend, 19-year-old Delila Grayson, in 2022. While awaiting transport to the Georgia Department of Corrections to serve his sentence, Guzman was mistakenly released from the Clayton County Jail on March 27, Allen said in a statement. Officials only realized the error on Tuesday when the Clayton County District Attorney’s Office contacted Allen about Guzman. Allen said he activated the office’s fugitive squad, contacted local law enforcement agencies for assistance and turned over all information to the U.S. Marshals Service. Guzman’s whereabouts were traced to outside of Georgia, he added. Guzman was apprehended in Ocoee, Florida, on Friday morning by the U.S. Marshals Service, according to the Orange County Sheriff’s Office. It is not immediately clear what led to Guzman’s release from jail. “The cause of the release is under investigation, and disciplinary actions are pending,” Allen said. “Once the investigation is complete, it may result in the termination of employees within the Clayton County Sheriff’s Office.”",

    "article_text": "MUSCAT, Oman —Iran and the United States will hold more negotiationsnext week over Tehran’s rapidly advancing nuclear program, Iranian state television reported Saturday at the end of the first round of talks between the two countries since President Donald Trump returned to the White House. Iran’s state-run broadcaster revealed that U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi “briefly spoke” together —the first timethe two nations have done that since the Obama administration. Tehran’s declaration that the two sides spoke face-to-face — even if briefly — suggests the negotiations went well even to Iranian state TV, which long has been controlled by hard-liners. In a statement released Saturday afternoon, the White House described the discussions as “very positive and constructive,” while conceding the issues that need to be resolved “are very complicated.” “Special Envoy Witkoff’s direct communication today was a step forward in achieving a mutually beneficial outcome,” the White House said. The next round of talks will take place Saturday, April 19, according to the Iranian and American statements. This first round of talks began at around 3:30 p.m. local. The two sides spoke for over two hours at a location in the outskirts of Muscat, Oman’s capital, ending the talks around 5:50 p.m. local time. The convoy believed to be carrying Witkoff returned to Muscat before disappearing into traffic around a neighborhood that is home to the U.S. Embassy. Thestakes of the negotiations couldn’t be higherfor the two nations closing in on half a century of enmity. Trump repeatedly has threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran’s nuclear program if a deal isn’t reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn that they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels.",

    "article_text": "By Chandelis Duster This illustration photo shows a clock in the background of a smartphone showing the time after daylight saving time was implemented in Los Angeles, Calif., on March 15, 2022.Chris Delmas/AFP/Getty Imageshide caption President Trump is urging Congress to pass legislation that would make daylight saving time permanent — which, if enacted, would put an end to a longstanding debate over whether to change the time in the U.S. twice a year. Both the House and Senate should \"push hard for more Daylight at the end of a day,\" the presidentwroteFriday morning on Truth Social. \"Very popular and, most importantly, no more changing of the clocks, a big inconvenience and, for our government, A VERY COSTLY EVENT!!!,\" Trump also wrote. The latest directive from Trump follows ongoing efforts in Congress to adopt daylight saving time — including the Sunshine Protection Act, which wasreintroduced in the HouseandSenateby Florida Republicans Rep. Vern Buchanan and Sen. Rick Scott in January. Another Florida Republican, then-Sen. Marco Rubio, had previously championed the bill, first introducing it in 2018 and reintroducing it in 2021. The Senate passed the bill in 2022, but it never came to a vote in the House. Every state observes daylight saving time except for two — Hawaii and Arizona, with the exception of the portion of Navajo Nation that's in the state. U.S. territories American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands also don't change their clocks. Trump, who has long been supportive of the change andtweeted in 2019that making it permanent was \"O.K. with me!,\" appeared to soften his stance when he called it a \"50/50 issue\" in early March, three days before clocks moved an hour forward in most parts of the country. \"I assume people would like to have more light later, but some people want to have more light earlier because they don't want to take their kids to school in the dark ... A lot of people like it one way. A lot of people like it the other way,\" he told reporters then in the Oval Office. The issue was debated during a Senate hearing on Thursday, where Republican Sen. Ted Cruz from Texas called changing the clocks twice a year an \"outdated and harmful practice.\" Cruz also said while changing the clocks made sense in the early 20th century, advancement in technology has \"drastically reduced the relative price of energy compared to the past.\" \"When we take a closer look at the implications of changing the clocks, its impact on our economy, our health and our everyday lives, we can see that this practice is more than an annoyance,\" Cruz, who is chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. \"The disruption to sleep patterns and the result in fatigue can have consequences on our productivity, mental health and well-being.\" Democratic Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester from Delaware also said changing clocks twice has a negative impact on Americans and that \"it's time to figure this out.\" \"The back and forth between daylight savings time and standard time needs to change and needs to stop,\" she said. \"We need to stop the clock. We need to find a solution and stick with it.\" While there is concern among sleep experts that switching the time biannually is not good for one's health, some in the medical community also say a permanent daylight saving time might not be a good solution, either. Dr. Karin Johnson, medical director of the Baystate Regional Sleep Medicine Program,previously told NPRa permanent standard of time is more beneficial. \"The scientific and medical community really feel it's very important for us to go to permanent standard time, which is much more aligned with the sun in the sky and so better for our overall health and well-being,\" Johnson said.

    "article_text": "By The Associated Press This photo provided by Ana L Vazquez, shows Victor Perez in a hospital bed in Pocatello, Idaho.Ana L Vazquez/APhide caption BOISE — An autistic, nonverbal teenage boy who was shot repeatedly by Idaho police from the other side of a chain link fence while he was holding a knife died Saturday after being removed from life support, his family said. Victor Perez, 17, who also had cerebral palsy, had been in a coma since the April 5 shooting, and tests Friday showed that he had no brain activity, his aunt, Ana Vazquez, told The Associated Press. He had undergone several surgeries, with doctors removing nine bullets and amputating his leg. Police in the southwest Idaho city of Pocatello responded to a 911 call reporting that an apparently intoxicated man with a knife was chasing someone in a yard. It turned out to be Perez, who was not intoxicated but walked with a staggered gait due to hisdisabilities, Vazquez said. His family members had been trying to get the large kitchen knife away from him. Video taken by a neighbor showed that Perez was lying in the yard after falling over when four officers arrived and rushed to the fence at the edge of the yard. They immediately ordered Perez to drop the knife, but instead he stood and began stumbling toward them. Officers opened fire within about 12 seconds of getting out of their patrol cars and made no apparent effort to de-escalate the situation. The shooting outraged Perez's family and Pocatello residents, and a vigil had been planned for Saturday morning outside the Pocatello hospital where he was treated. \"Everybody was trying to tell the police, no, no,\" Vazquez said. \"Those four officers didn't care. They didn't ask what was happening, what was the situation.\" \"How's he going to jump the fence when he can barely walk?\" she said. The officers, whose names have not been released, were placed on administrative leave. Decisions about whether charges should be filed against them will be made after an independent investigation by the Eastern Idaho Critical Incident Team, Bannock County Prosecutor Ian Johnson told the AP via email. \"When that investigation is complete a report will be submitted for review,\" he said. \"In a continued effort to ensure independent and objective consideration, said report will be reviewed by an agency outside of Bannock County.\" Pocatello Mayor Brian Blad said in a statement Friday, after the family announced that Perez had no brain activity, that officials' thoughts and prayers were with them. \"We recognize the pain and grief this incident has caused in our community,\" Blad said. Blad said Thursday that the city was \"addressing this matter with the seriousness and thoroughness it deserves and with the appropriate respect for the gravity of the situation.\" \"The criminal, external, and internal investigations regarding the officer-involved shooting are underway, which is why we cannot answer questions out of concern of interfering with or compromising the investigation,\" he said.

    "article_text": "Juliana Kim Versions of the new Apple iPhone 16 are displayed at an Apple store in in Manhattan Beach, Calif., on April 8.Jay L Clendenin/Getty Imageshide caption The Trump administration has amended its list of imports that will be affected by sweeping global tariffs in order to exempt certain electronics, including smartphones and computers. Theupdated guidancewas published Friday night by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The exemption will apply to President Trump's steep \"reciprocal tariffs\" imposed across dozens of countries, which have since beenpaused until early Julyas well as the 145% levies currently in place on China. That was the only country excluded from the reciprocal tariff pause. The exemption is effective for products that entered the U.S. or left warehouses starting on April 5. The White House issueda presidential memoabout the exemption on Saturday. When asked about the reasoning behind the exemption, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement: \"President Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops.\" Leavitt added, \"At the direction of the President,\" companies including Apple, TSMC and Nvidia \"are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\" The electronics exemption is a major development in the tariff war with China, which has imposeda 125% tariff on U.S. goods. Prices for electronics from China, a key sector, had beenexpected to spike. Among the items that will now be spared from Trump's steep tariffs include smartphones, computers, semiconductors, and flat panel display modules. But the updated guidance did not address any changes to the existing 20% tariff on Chinese goods in response to China's involvement in the fentanyl trade. According to theU.S. International Trade Commission, China has long been America's chief source for electronic products, with Mexico, Taiwan, Vietnam, and Malaysia rounding out the top five. There was also concern for American tech giants that rely on supply chains in China, like Apple. Before the updated guidance, Apple was expected to experience major setbacks as a result of the tariffs, Dan Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, toldCNBCearlier this week.

    "article_text": "Juliana Kim Maine's Democratic Gov. Janet Mills speaks at a news conference at Morse High School on Oct. 20, 2022, in Bath, Maine.Robert F. Bukaty/APhide caption A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to unfreeze federal funding that was allocated to Maine from the U.S. Department of Agriculture — funds that had been withheld followingPresident Trump's clash with Maine Gov. Janet Millsover the issue of transgender athletes. U.S. District Court Judge John Woodcock granted Maine's request for a temporary restraining order on Friday. The USDA is just one of the agencies where federal funding for Maine has been threatened. The agency did not immediately respond to request for a comment. The feudbetween Trump and the state of Maine began after the president issued an executive order in early Februarybarring transgender student athletesfrom playing on girls' sports teams. The order also calls for the federal government \"to rescind all funds from educational programs that deprive women and girls of fair athletic opportunities.\" In response, the Maine Principals' Association, which governs school sports in the state, said it will continue to allow trans girls to compete, asserting that federal action is at odds with state law. Then, on Feb. 21, during a governors' event at the White House, Trump called out Mills for resisting his executive order. \"You better do it, because you're not going to get any federal funding at all if you don't,\" Trump told Mills. To which Mills replied, \"See you in court.\" Since the confrontation, Trump has demanded an apology from the Maine governor. \"We need a full throated apology from the Governor herself, and a statement that she will never make such an unlawful challenge to the Federal Government again, before this case can be settled,\"he wroteon social media. Following the fallout, the Trump administration has also initiated multiple investigations into Maine, citing concerns over Title IX, which prohibits discrimination in education based on sex,Maine Public Radioreported. That includes the Education Department and the Department of Health and Human Services. The USDA got involved earlier this month. Ina letter on April 2, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins told Mills that USDA funding for certain administrative and technological functions in schools will be paused in response to the governor's \"defiance of federal law.\" It was unclear how much aid would be affected but Rollins threatened that other areas of research and education-related funding will be reviewed. In response, the state of Maine filed a complaint on Monday, arguing that the USDA did not follow the mandatory statutory and regulatory steps before it can terminate federal funds. In the suit, Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey urged the court to reinstate federal funds, arguing that it was aid used to feed schoolchildren in Maine. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Ukraine's DIY drone makers are helping fighters on the front lines",
    "article_text": "The roots of Russia's invasion of Ukraine go back decades and run deep. The current conflict is more than one country fighting to take over another; it is — in the words of one U.S. official — a shift in \"the world order.\"Here are some helpful stories to make sense of it all. Eleanor Beardsley Biophysicist Oleh Halaidych, 34, helps make drones at a workshop in Kyiv. \"I think we are all motivated because we see that this is a cheap and accessible way to make weapons,\" he says. \"They kill the enemy and destroy his armored vehicles.\"Anton Shtuka for NPRhide caption KYIV, Ukraine — In the courtyard of a group of ordinary-looking Kyiv apartment blocks, a stairway leads down to a small basement apartment. Three big dogs run out into the hallway when newcomers arrive. Inside a main room, three people sit hunched over desks. Around them, tables are laden with parts and small hand tools like pliers and tweezers. Boxes of tiny plastic propellers sit on the floor and wall shelves are stacked with carbon-fiber frames. This is the workshop for a secret drone-making operation. It turns out about 100 attack drones for Ukraine's military every month. Andrii Yukhno, who supervises this operation, reaches up to close one of the windows. They are covered with paper to block prying eyes. With the windows cracked open, children's voices from a nearby kindergarten fill the room. \"But don't worry,\" he says, \"we don't show our drones to the children.\" Before Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, Yukhno earned his living as a barista in a coffee shop. But he says the war turned him into a full-time volunteer in one of the many DIY weapons factories arming the fighters on Ukraine's front lines. Earlier, he supported the war effort differently. Andrii Yukhno, 31, a former barista, manages a drone-making workshop in Kyiv.Anton Shtuka for NPRhide caption \"In the beginning I was delivering food and medicine to people in Kyiv, anything to help,\" he says. \"But then I moved on to bigger and bigger things.\" He took online drone-making classes — there are several offered in Ukraine — and started making first-person view (FPV) drones in this basement apartment. These are manually piloted unmanned aerial vehicles. At the front lines, they are equipped with a high-explosive payload the drone makers refer to as \"candy.\" Operators, wearing goggles with portable screens strapped around their heads to show a livestream view from the drone's camera, fly the drones into combat. They steer the drones directly into enemy targets — vehicles, trenches, personnel, even tanks — to destroy them with explosives. Yukhno is now training others. One of his trainees is 35-year old Khrystyna Pashchenko, who arrived here a couple of weeks ago. \"Andrii praised my work, so I'm already soldering the engines to the motherboard,\" she says. Pashenko says she's good at attention to detail. She used to enjoy cross-stitch as a hobby. Khrystyna Pashchenko, 32, left her job with a internet firm to help the war effort, even though it means she now receives no pay.Anton Shtuka for NPRhide caption Today, instead of working with needle and thread, she holds a soldering wand puffing out thin wisps of smoke. She recently left her job as a manager in a company that helped businesses appear higher in internet searches. She earns nothing now as a volunteer, but says that when the war started, her old work no longer felt meaningful. \"But now I feel super excited and a little bit proud of myself that I can do something useful,\" she says. \"That I can help in the war effort. And the guys who are using our drones on the front lines send us videos saying how thankful they are, and that's hugely motivating.\" The war in Ukraine is now largely being fought with drones, with more than half the destruction on the front line caused by FPVdrones, according to the Ukrainian general staff. Ukraine is at the cutting edge of drone innovation but lags behind Russia in drone production, experts say. Necessity has transformed this country into a nation of drone-makers, who churn them out from factory assembly lines and mom-and-pop operations like the one in the basement apartment in Kyiv. Yukhno says he knows of at least 15 like his in Kyiv alone. Drone makers Oleksandr Ptashnyk (left) and Andrii Yukhno in their workshop. Ptashnyk, a dancer, says he's making drones to help Ukraine end this war on the best terms it can.Anton Shtuka for NPRhide caption For Sasha Ptashnyk, who was a dancer before the full-scale invasion, making drones is a way to help end this war on the best terms Ukraine can get. \"Of course I would love for us to be victorious and get all our land back,\" he says. \"But we have to be more realistic. We are fighting a huge foe. We must be sober.\" What's most sobering, he says, is that Ukraine's greatest ally, the United States, may be abandoning his country. Ukrainians have felt stunned by the Trump administration's turnabout on Ukraine. They watched as their own president was berated and accused of being ungrateful in late February in the Oval Office, and see President Trump as cozying up to Russian President Vladimir Putin as he pushes to end the war. A stack of carbon fiber drone frames ready to be loaded up with engines, cameras and transmitters.Anton Shtuka for NPRhide caption A 30-minute drive away from the improvised weapons workshop, the sharp whine of a drone's four motors cuts through the country air. Oleksii Babenko is testing one of his company's new drones in a field surrounded by forest on the outskirts of Kyiv. Babenko is the CEO of one of Ukraine's most successful drone-making companies, Vyriy. It recently reached a milestone: it is now turning out drones made entirely of Ukrainian-sourced parts — from the carbon-fiber frames to the intricately mounted motors and cameras. Babenko says that's important at a time when Ukraine has to increasingly rely on itself. Oleksii Babenko, the CEO of Vyriy drones, test flies one of his drones in a field outside Kyiv. His company recently announced that its drones are 100% made in Ukraine.Anton Shtuka for NPRhide caption \"From the start of this war, every time Ukraine needs something, we have to ask other nations for it over and over again,\" he says. \"So the only way to stay strong is to make everything here. Ukrainian soldiers, Ukrainian manufacturers…\" The whereabouts of Vyriy's factory are a closely guarded secret, because Russia tries to target Ukraine's drone-making operations. But Babenko lets NPR watch a drone test on a recent sunny afternoon. Sunlight glints off what looks like fishing wire strewn through the trees and bushes. It is, in fact, fiber optic cable — hundreds of yards of it — spooled out by the drone, transmitting control signals and video feeds between the operator and the flying machine. The system is impossible to jam with blasts of radio waves, a common counter-measure in the field. Babenco says Ukraine made this breakthrough in 2023. But Russia quickly caught up. A Vyriy drone is prepared for a test flight at a field outside Kyiv.Anton Shtuka for NPRhide caption Oleksandr Kamyshin, an advisor to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on strategic affairs, estimates that Russia is, most of the time, several months behind Ukraine in drone innovation. But he says the Russians have much bigger production capabilities. So he calls this war a technological race. \"Once you've got a technology, the other side tries to counter this technology,\" he tells NPR. \"And then you have to find another solution and the other side tries to counter that. Within the war is a constant war of innovations and technologies.\" He says Ukraine is capable of producing up to 5 million FPV drones per year and has more than 150 manufacturers that can produce up to 100,000 drones per month.

Part-time drone maker Oleh Halaidych has just shown up and sits down at his workstation. This biophysicist, who has a Ph.D. in the study of stem cells, says making drones is probably the quickest, most impactful way of helping Ukraine. \"I think we are all motivated because we see that this is a cheap and accessible way to make weapons,\" he says. \"They kill the enemy and destroy his armored vehicles.\" Halaidych says the war has made many people who work in culture or the arts and sciences realize that it's a time to pursue different options. \"Science is slow,\" he says. \"And we need to do something to protect ourselves right now.\" Oleh Halaidych at work in a Kyiv drone workshop.Anton Shtuka for NPRhide caption Kateryna Malofieieva contributed reporting to this story.

When the St. John's College Freshman Chorus lined up to sing on the steps of one of the red brick academic buildings, the crowds knew the teams would soon be taking the fields. The midshipmen exited the building single-file, dressed in pristine white uniforms. The Johnnies, notoriously secretive about their uniforms, made their entrance costumed as the tournament's grass croquet courts, complete with mini wickets, mallets, balls and clips. The yearly competition between the small liberal arts college lauded for its \"great books\" curriculum and the famed school for naval officer training began in the early 1980s. Several attendees recountedthe legendthat a discussion between a St. John's College student and the Commandant of the Naval Academy led to the latter's challenge that his midshipmen could beat Johnnies at any sport. The student suggested croquet. The Johnnies won that first match and, except for the years during the COVID pandemic, the tradition has continued ever since. The 41st annual Annapolis Cup croquet tournament was held on April 5 at St. John's College between the Johnnies and the neighboring U.S. Naval Academy team. Thousands donned fancy dress to attend the event, which included not only croquet, but swing dancing, a New Orleans-style brass band and choral singing.Tyrone Turner/for NPRhide caption St. John's Dalton Olsson swings as teammate Angus Preston and members of the Naval Academy's team look on.Tyrone Turner/for NPRhide caption Brynn Myers and Lindsay Irmiter, juniors at St. John's College, wiggle their \"good luck\" fingers as they root for the Johnnies.Tyrone Turner/for NPRhide caption Attendees swing dance as the crowds await the croquet teams' arrival.Tyrone Turner/for NPRhide caption The Naptown Brass Band gets the crowds dancing at the Annapolis Cup.Tyrone Turner/for NPRhide caption The tournament consisted of five croquet games, plus one exhibition match, and lasted until late in the afternoon. The Naptown Brass Band second-lined their way through the venue, keeping feet moving and energy levels high as the day progressed. The well-coiffed crowd lounged on picnic blankets surrounding the croquet courts. This year's tournament came down to the last match, pitting the Johnnies' Imperial Wicket, or captain, Magnus Oberg and teammate Ben Dahlgren against the Navy's Grant Bartuska and Andrew Wilkinson. Spectators crowded the sidelines, cheering intensely for their team with each thwack of the croquet mallet. When the midshipmen scored for the win, Navy players and fans rushed the field in a frenzy of white-uniformed jubilation. The Navy's Imperial Wicket, Liam Wert, lifted the trophy cup above his head.

Reflecting on how unique the Annapolis Cup is in the world of croquet, Johnnie croquet alum Elizabeth Meade said the tournament is \"not like playing croquet anywhere else in the world.\" One reason is that, unlike other manicured and level courts, the front lawn at St. John's is bumpy, throwing in a measure of unpredictability.

    "article_text": "Scott Simon Alice Tan Ridley sings in the New York City Subway, Monday, June 21, 2010.Charles Sykes/ASSOCIATED PRESS/SYKEChide caption By the time Alice Tan Ridley tried out for America's Got Talent in 2010, she had already led a tough, full, and interesting life. Her audition song aptly, was the Etta James classic, \"At Last.\" Ms. Ridley, whose death was reported this week, was the 7th child in a large family, born in Charles Junction, Georgia. She came to New York just after high school, in the early 70s. \"I liked that it wasn't Charles Junction,\" she toldThe New York Timesin 2016. \"It was cars, lights, and people.\" She became a teacher's aide for special needs children in Brooklyn, and married a man from Senegal who drove a cab. Alice Ridley, called Tan by friends and relatives, had always sung with her family. In New York, she began performing on street corners and in subway stations. After her marriage ended, busking became her livelihood. Imagine trying to charm even small change from grim-faced New Yorkers trying to sprint in and out of overpacked subway cars. But Tan's powerful renditions of \"I Will Survive\", \"My Heart Will Go On\", and other songs stopped travelers in their tracks. She performed in a few clubs, had some TV gigs, and got a regular subway station slot through the \"Music Under New York\" program run by the Metropolitan Transit Authority. Eventually a passing student took notice and asked to be her manager. \"Whenever I saw her performing, there were always hundreds of people around her,\" Dvir Assouline told The Hollywood Reporter this week. \"She brought joy to so many people every day.\" Alice Tan Ridley's singing career picked up. She reached the semi-finals on America's Got Talent, where Meg McAlduff, co-executive producer on the show, told us, \"She was a joy to have on set and made friends with everyone. She was always smiling.\" \"I remember my mom being hopeful in a way I couldn't be,\" her daughter, Gabourey Sidibe — the Academy Award nominated actress — toldThe New York Times. Ridley went on to perform in arts centers and nightclubs around the country and overseas. She sang in commercials, and put out an album, calledNever Lost My Way. After her tour ended, she brought her act back to Herald Square station. \"I missed it,\" Alice Tan Ridley toldThe New York Times. She went back down to sing to the city she loved. \"My lonely days are over,\" as she sang in At Last. \"And life is like a song.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "A crow's math skills include geometry",
    "article_text": "Nell Greenfieldboyce Carrion crows can distinguish some geometric patterns.MyLoupe/Universal Images Group via Getty/Universal Images Group Editorialhide caption Crows are able to look at a handful of four-sided shapes and correctly distinguish those that exhibit geometric regularity from those that don't, according to a provocative new study. It's the first time a species other than humans has been shown to have this kind of geometric intuition, saysAndreas Nieder, a cognitive neurobiologist at the University of Tübingen in Germany. \"Claiming that it is specific to us humans, that only humans can detect geometric regularity, is now falsified,\" says Nieder. \"Because we have at least the crow.\" Previous research has demonstrated that regardless of age, culture, or education, humans are really good at noticing geometric regularity in shapes. Other critters might have an inherent sense of geometry, too, says Nieder, but until now, researchers mostly haven't focused on this ability in their tests of animals' mathematical skills. \"I would never dare to say that this is the only species,\" he says, \"it's just now opening this field of investigation.\" He and his colleagues tested the abilities of two carrion crows that live in their lab. Previously, Nieder's group hasshownthat the crows' counting ability rivals that of toddlers. These crows \"are very tame, so they like to work with us,\" he says. The birds' work involves basically playing computer games that are designed to tease out how much they know about math. For this study, the birds would look at a computer screen and see a group of six shapes. To get a treat of tasty mealworms, they'd have to peck on the shape that was different from the others. \"Initially we presented some very obviously different figures,\" says Nieder. \"For instance, five moons and one flower.\" When the crows pecked on the flower shape, they got a snack. After the birds understood this game, the researchers started showing them sets of shapes that included squares, parallelograms, or irregular quadrilaterals. The crows might see, for example, five perfect squares along with one four-sided figure that was just slightly off. What the researchers wanted to know is whether or not \"with these quadrilaterals, they could still continue to find the outlier, even though the outlier was looking perceptually very similar to the other five regular shapes,\" explains Nieder. Yes. It turns out, the crows could. In the journalScience Advances, the researchersdescribea series of tests showing that crows clearly had a sense of right angles, parallel lines, and symmetry. Before these results, says Nieder, \"there was no single animal that demonstrated this capability of detecting geometric regularity.\" In fact, a recentstudyin baboons suggested this non-human primate couldn't do it. \"Baboons are so much closer to us and we trained them so much more,\" saysMathias Sablé-Meyer, a cognitive neuroscientist now at the University College London who worked on that study. \"After failing to train the baboons to do it, I wouldn't have expected crows to do it.\" He called this new research on crows \"pretty impressive.\" \"The evidence is actually quite convincing,\" he says. \"I have to accept the result and think, you know, that's pretty cool! And then the question is, where does that even come from?\" He says since there's been virtually no work on this aspect of mathematics in species other than humans, it's hard to know. Nieder suspects that the geometric abilities of humans build on precursor capabilities that are more present in the animal kingdom than previously thought. \"I hope that my colleagues are looking into other species,\" says Nieder. \"I'm pretty sure they may find that other intelligent animals can also do this.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "After market tumult, Trump exempts smartphones from massive new tariffs",
    "article_text": "Some consumer electronics are also exempted in a major boost to Big Tech. The Trump administration has excluded smartphones and other consumer electronics from its steep “reciprocal” tariffs in a significant boost for Big Tech as the White House battles to calm global markets after launching a multifront trade war. According to a notice posted late on Friday night by Customs and Border Patrol, smartphones, along with routers, chipmaking equipment, wireless earphones and certain computers and laptops, would be exempt from reciprocal tariffs, which include the 125 percent levies Donald Trump has imposed on Chinese imports. The carve-out is a big win for companies such as Apple, Nvidia and Microsoft, and follows a week of intense turbulence in US markets after Trump unleashed a trade war on “liberation day” on April 2. The announcement rattled global investors and triggered a stock market rout. The exemption is the first sign of any softening of Trump’s tariffs against China, which he ratcheted up over the course of the past week even as he paused the steepest “reciprocal” tariffs. He retained tariffs of 10 percent on most trading partners. The Trump administration had already exempted several sectors from its reciprocal tariffs, including semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, but the president has signalled that he still plans to apply tariffs to those sectors. A White House official said on Saturday that the US would launch a separate probe that could lead to a tariff on chips “soon.” The dispensation for smartphones and computers will be especially welcomed by Apple as the bulk of its supply chain is centred on China. Analysts estimate about 80 percent of its iPhones are still made in the country even as the tech group worked to diversify production to India in recent years. The majority of iPhones are made in a big factory complex in Zhengzhou operated by Apple’s manufacturing partner Foxconn. Workers at the plant told the Financial Times this week that operations were normal but that they were worried about the impact of the trade war. Shares in the US tech giant were one of Wall Street’s biggest casualties in the days immediately after Trump announced his reciprocal tariffs. About $700 billion was wiped off Apple’s market value in the space of a few days. Earlier this week, Trump said he would consider excluding US companies from his tariffs, but added that such decisions would be made “instinctively.” Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the exemptions mirrored exceptions for smartphones and consumer electronics issued by Trump during his trade wars in 2018 and 2019. “We’ll have to wait and see if the exemptions this time around also stick, or if the president once again reverses course sometime in the not-too-distant future,” said Bown. US Customs and Border Protection referred inquiries about the order to the US International Trade Commission, which did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The White House confirmed that the new exemptions would not apply to the 20 percent tariffs on all Chinese imports applied by Trump to respond to China’s role in fentanyl manufacturing. White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said on Saturday that companies including Apple, TSMC, and Nvidia were “hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible” at “the direction of the President.” “President Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops,” said Leavitt. Apple declined to comment. Economists have warned that the sweeping nature of Trump’s tariffs—which apply to a broad range of common US consumer goods—threaten to fuel US inflation and hit economic growth. New York Fed chief John Williams said US inflation could reach as high as 4 percent as a result of Trump’s tariffs.

Make him a tokusatsu hero in a sci-fi epic. During his C2E2 panel,ÂRadiant BlackÂco-creator Kyle Higgins revealed he’d be doing just that inÂImmortal Legend Batman. The six-issue series sees him reteam with DC hot shot Dan Mora and some other familiar facesâMat Groom and Erica D’Urso, the writer/artist duo behindRadiant’ssister seriesInferno Girl Red,ÂplusÂRadiantÂcolorist Igor Monti and letterer Becca Careyâfor a brand newÂElseworldsÂbook. The pitch? It’s centuries into the future and humanity’s used dark matter to master interstellar space travel and create a galactic empire. All that tampering has resulted in soulless monsters called “Shadows” terrorizing newly colonized worlds, and that’s where the Immortal Legends come in. This three-person team has figured out how to manipulate dark matter to turn them into superheroes, resulting in a dynamic trio of Batman, Robin, and Nightwing. According to Higgins,ÂImmortal Legend BatmanÂhas been “years in the making” since he and Groom saw Mora’srad tokusatsu redesignsfor the characters back in 2020. Being fans of the toku genreâwhich is all overÂRadiantÂandÂInferno,Âby their own admissionâthe duo saw an opportunity “to bring that love to a very unique version of Gotham, with very unique versions of these characters.” And having worked together onÂPower RangersÂalongside Carey, Monti, D’Urso, and editor Matt Levine, it was “beyond a perfect storm” of events. “We wanted to find a way to take everything thatâs so great about Batmanâhis immense determination, resilience and selflessnessâand explore it in a totally new way,â continued Groom. âSo, weâre taking him to the stars, turning him into a wandering hero, exploring humanityâs final frontierâ¦ and searching out deadly threats he inadvertently released upon the galactic community.” Look for Bruce and team to morph into action whenÂImmortal Legend BatmanÂbegins on August 27.

    "title": "Trump Keeps Backing Down, Exempts Phones and Computers from Tariffs",
    "article_text": "Donald Trump’s tariff regime keeps getting less and less robust. In the latest backtrack from the Trump administration following the repeated warning of the markets to chill out a bit, the US Customs and Border Protectionpublished guidancelate Friday night that introduced new exemptions for smartphones, computers, and other electronicsâa major carveout for tech companies that were feeling the crunch. The exemptions, asreported by Bloomberg, include popular devices like iPhones and MacBooks, as well as Android and Windows devices made overseas. It also includes hardware like hard drives, computer processors, memory chips, and graphics cards. Some have noted the exemption does not include video game consoles, which leaves things still pretty up in the air for thelaunch of the Nintendo Switch 2. Notably, the exemptions apply universally, meaning these items coming into the US will not be subject to the 10% global tariff that currently applies to every nation, nor the145% tariffthat is currently levied against China. The exemption was also backdated to April 5, 2025, so just pretend this whole past week didn’t happen. The exemption comes after another week of extremely volatile markets that seem to be pleading with Trump to stop harassing the nation’s top trade partner while the rest of the world side-eyes America andstarts shifting its money elsewhere. Pretty much theonly thing that has sent the markets bouncing back upin the last few weeks is even the tiniest of breadcrumbs suggesting that maybe Trump isn’t as pot-committed to the nonsensically calculated tariffs as he insists he is. Trump left a little trail for investors, suggesting this type of exemption might be on the horizon on Friday when hetold reporters aboard Air Force Onethat there could be “a couple of exceptions for obvious reasons” coming. He didn’t say what the obvious reasons were, but we can probably interpret that as “we’d like to stop the bleeding for some of our most profitable companies.” The tech sector was certainly signaling that pain was coming. Applereportedly airlifted 1.5 million iPhonesto the United States from Inida to try to keep them from getting hit by the tariffs, and waswarning that the prices of their devices could be going upsoon. Other major tech players includingAsus,Sony, andNividiaall started ticking up the retail price for their devices as the tariffs took effect. Consumers, expecting those price increases,raced to stockpile devices. Those who might be in the market to buy a new phone or computer can breathe a slight sigh of relief now, as can the companies who were ready to upend their entire logistics to try to figure out how to duck the extra charges. The exemption does seem to suggest a backtrack from Trump’s position that we can just make our electronics in the country. Earlier this week, Press Secretary Karoline LeavittsaidDonald Trump “believes we have the labor, we have the workforce, we have the resources” to build iPhones in Americaâwhich is maybe theoretically true, but in practice, experts say such a device wouldcost as much as $3,500to buy, plus years to build the manufacturing infrastructure to even do it.

    "title": "Final Fantasy VII Remake Wants to Know Its Own History",
    "article_text": "Released in 1997,Final Fantasy VIIÂwas a landmark game of its era, making waves across its own series, genre, and the entire medium. Over the years, fans turnedthat loveinto hopes for a remake or some kind of revisitation. Those hopes seemed to bear fruit in2015, when Square Enix revealed at E3 that a remake was happening! After the initial excitement, fans waited… …And kept waiting for years, wondering where it was as veteran developer Tetsuya Nomura worked on other projects likeÂFinal Fantasy XVÂandÂKingdom Hearts III. After trailer after trailer and a very good demo,ÂFinal Fantasy VII RemakeÂfinally released on April 10, 2020 for PlayStation 4, the first of a multi-game saga. It was a title that came at just the right time: the PS4’s big two first-party games,ÂThe Last of Us Part IIÂandÂGhost of Tsushima,Âweren’t due until the summer, and the then-early COVID-19 pandemic made staying at home to play video games a valid activity. Add onto that the interest in seeing how Nomura and other alums from the original game would re-develop the title that helped make (and in some cases, completely define) their careers in the industry, and it’s no wonder it was a critcal and commercial darling. The term “remake” carries a strong negative connotation in the film space, but in games, it’s slightly more complicated. Ports and remasters have been a part of the medium since forever, and everyone knows what that entails. A remake is another matter entirely and varies from game to game. When thefirst twoHaloÂgameswere remade, players could toggle between its original graphics or a modern version at the push of a button, and both came with suplemental material that helped set up future titles. Capcom’sResident EvilÂremakes feature modernized gameplay and updated plot elements, while theDead Spaceremake’s biggest change was giving a voice to Isaac Clarke, who didn’t speak until the second game. FinalFantasy VII RemakeÂboth is and isn’t what its title suggests. UnderneathÂ the skin of the originalÂVIIÂis the DNA of then-recentFinal Fantasygames Nomura contributed to in some fashion. FromFinal Fantasy XV,the remake takes real-time combat, allowing players to freely switch between three party membersâoccasionally reducing the size to just one or two charactersâwhile hearkening back to the originalVII’sturn-based nature by slowing down time so players can queue up specific attacks or take potions. Structurally, it borrows from theXIIItrilogy, which was derided for taking players down a linear path.RemakeÂis similarly straightforward most of the time: its two hub areas are big, but notthatÂbig, and you can only do specific actions like jump or enter specific areas when prompted. Such linearity was noted at the time, but that was nearly drowned out by how good the combat felt and older players’ affection for playing through a prettied up version of Midgar on modern hardware. By far,Remake’sbiggest changes came to its narrative. At first, it was small things like introducing main baddie Sephiroth much earlier than in the original game, or fleshing out supporting cast members Jessie and Biggs. Over time, those tweaks extended to the introduction of wholly new characters like Roche or beefing up the original’s early section in Midgar into its own beginning, middle, and end to help justify the transformation into what’s likely a trilogy. To quote Austin Walker duringWaypoint’s podcastonRemake,Âseveral conversations in the original game were effectively turned into boss fights or minigames for its modern day incarnation, which can feel like padding in its worst moments. (2024’sÂFinal Fantasy RebirthÂis especially guilty of this, given its many minigames and expansive open-world areas.) Oh right, there’s also another big story change:Final Fantasy VIIÂRemakeÂis aboutthe legacy ofFinal Fantasy VII. It frequently teases the player with characters or events diverging from the source material, resulting in ominous ghosts called Whispers working to put things back on track. Usually, this amounts to saving or killing someone that didn’t die where they were meant to, occasiaonally sticking around to make sure the job’s done before vanishing again. For characters in the know about how this all shakes out, like Aerith and Sephiroth, the Whispers can be used to their own ends. In these beings exists the potential to tell the original story and keep everything as is or break off into new, uncharted territory. Maybe some of the same ground is tread, but the endpoint could be different forVII’sÂcast, who all become increasingly aware they’re being manipulated to one degree or another. With much of the original game’s talent at the helm, it may have been inevitable thatRemakewould directly explore the importance of its own source material. Still, the way it does this makes all the difference, since this entire enterprise from Nomura and Square Enix includes bringing in parts or elements from spinoffs likeCrisis Core,plus the feature filmAdvent Children. Its entire scope is at once exciting and potentially exhausting, depending on how things conclude in the unannounced third installment. 2024’sFinal Fantasy VII RebirthÂhad it both ways, leaving playersuncertainjust how much would really change when it paradoxically recreated Aerith’s deathÂandÂgave some she may live on in another timeline only visible to the ever-traumatized Cloud. (Plus, his work husband Zack, who died prior to the original events ofVII,is alive inRebirth,Âbriefly teaming up with Cloud against Sephiroth before he returns to his own alternate timeline.) What is theÂFinal Fantasy VIIÂremake saga? The answer is, seemingly, something for everyone: a way for longtime fans to relive the original as it’s simultaneously expanding, tweaking, or in conversation with parts of that earlier product. Newcomers get to play a series of slick action-RPGs that could guide them to otherFinal FantasyÂgames, or even just a simple remaster of the original. (Like EA withÂDead Space,ÂSquare Enix thankfully doesn’t want these remakes to wholly erase the OGFinal Fantasy VII.) The developers are treating it as a way to reflect on one of the biggest games of their careers, and for the characters? We’ll have to wait for whenever Part 3 comes toÂ find out. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "CDC Can’t Help Fix Milwaukee Schools Lead Poisoning Problem After Cuts",
    "article_text": "The Trump administration’s cuts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the head of the Department of Health and Human Services, have gutted vital health programs in recent months. And the public is slowly learning about the ramifications of these moves that will make Americans sicker and less able to respond to threats to public health. One of the latest casualties has been the CDC’s lead poisoning response team at the National Center for Environmental Health, which can no longer help schools in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, with their lead problem, according to a report fromCBS News. Seven buildings in the Milwaukee Public School system have been found this year to have concerning levels of lead, according to theMilwaukee Health Department, from both lead paint that’s deteriorating and lead pipes for drinking water. CBS News obtained an email sent to city officials in Milwaukee earlier this month to notify them CDC wouldn’t be able to help. “I sincerely regret to inform you that due to the complete loss ofour Lead Program, we will be unable to support you with this,” Aaron Bernstein, director of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, said in an email obtained by CBS News. Lead is a neurotoxin and half of Americans are believed to have been exposed to dangerous levels of lead in childhood, according to a studyfrom 2015. The age of the buildings and water infrastructure in Milwaukee are part of the problem, with almost every school building in the city having been built before 1970, according toPBS News. Lead paint wasn’t banned in the U.S. until 1978. The CDC didn’t respond to emails sent Friday, which isn’t surprising given reports of mass layoffs at the agency. The buildings with concerning levels of lead in Milwaukee include Fernwood Montessori, Golda Meir School, Kagel School, Robert M. LaFollette School, Maryland Avenue Montessori, Starms Early Childhood Center, and Trowbridge School of Great Lakes. Some schools have been temporarily shut down, with students relocated, but others have tried to attempt emergency responses to the lead threat without moving kids. CDC isn’t the only agency that’s been gutted recently, as anyone who’s been even slightly aware of the news since Trump took office knows all too well. USAID no longer exists as an agency, and billionaire Elon Musk is currently taking his chainsaw to the IRS and the Social Security Administration under the guise of DOGE, the absurdly titled Department of Government Efficiency. Musk is unilaterally choosing what to fund and what not to fund, a glaring conflict of interest since he has lucrative government contracts. The cuts are unlawful since Congress alone has the power of the purse, but that hasn’t stopped the destruction yet. And it’s unlikely to stop the destruction, as kids in Milwaukee are drinking water with lead in it. DOGEDonald TrumpElon Musk Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Dinosaurs Weren’t Fading Before the Asteroid—We Just Suck at Finding Their Fossils",
    "article_text": "Diversity is central to one of the biggest questions paleontologists have about dinosaurs. Namely, were these ancient creatures already on the decline when that fateful asteroid came crashing out of the sky? A group of Earth scientists believes they probably were not. While itâs true that fossils from the final dinosaur era are comparatively rare compared to those that came before, it seems the fossil record may not be telling the entire story. The point may seem moot: one way or the other, dead is dead, and this mass die-off occurred more than 66 million years ago. But among paleontologists, itâs a bit of a hot-button issue. For decades, scientists have argued both for and against the idea that extinction rates among dinosaurs were accelerating towards the end of their reign. Those who believe dinosaurs were dwindlingclaimthat new species were appearing with less frequency compared to previous eras. Some reachers have presentedevidencesuggesting a shifting climate was partially responsible, as was the emergence of hadrosaurs who proved better at competing for food than other herbivores. But those on the other sidebelievetheir colleagues simply arenât looking hard enough for signs that dinosaurs remained just as diverse at the end as they were in the millions of years that preceded it. Dinosaurs Were Already in Big Trouble Before the Asteroid, More Evidence Suggests The latest shot in the ongoing battle comes from a collaboration of scientists from the U.S., U.K., and China. Their argument, which theymadein the journal Current Biology,is that while there is a drop in the number of fossils hailing from the final 9 million years of the dinosaur age, this is more a matter of geology and a shifting planet than it is a sign that the dinosaurs were actually on the decline. To make their point, the Earth scientists looked at dinosaur fossils from North America that date from the last 18 million years of dinosaur existence, a span that took place between 84 and 66 million years ago. They focused in particular on dinosaurs belonging to the Ankylosauridae, Ceratopsidae, Hadrosauridae, and Tyrannosauridae families. They chose North American fossils in particular because nearly 50% of all fossils discovered from that era have been found in North America, particularly in the Western Interior Basin (WIB), where an ancient body of water once split the continent in half. The WIB ârepresents an unprecedented dataset for discerning patternsâ in dinosaur evolution, the team wrote. After creating a map of North America as it would have appeared at the time, including geology, geography, and climate, they divided it into grids. They then used mathematical formulas that are common in studies on modern biodiversity to calculate the likelihood of each of these families inhabiting the different grids over time. The results showed that population levels would have remained fairly stable over time. To find an explanation for the discrepancy between this finding and the fossil record, they ran another test, this time to determine if the areas where the dinosaurs would have thrived would also be conducive to fossils being discovered, as the terrain has dramatically changed in the time since the dinos roamed. They looked at factors such as how much exposed rock exists in these areas today, how much of the area is inaccessible to humans, and how often paleontologists have bothered to look in a given area. According to their calculations, the dinosaurs didnât decline, but the odds of finding evidence of them did. âThe probability of finding dinosaur fossils decreases, while the likelihood of dinosaurs having lived in these areas at the time is stable,â said Chris Dean, a paleontology research fellow at University College London, who led the research, in astatement. âThis shows we canât take the fossil record at face value. Half the fossils we have from this time were found in North America. Our findings hint that, in this region at least, dinosaurs may have been doing better than previously suggested in the lead-up to the asteroid impact, potentially with a higher diversity of species than we see in the raw rock record.â What If the Asteroid Never Killed the Dinosaurs? While the research is compelling, it likely isnât a smoking gun. If nothing else, it could point to new areas to explore in the quest to better understand the full scale of dinosaur history. It should be fun to see what the next punch thrown in this paleontologic fistfight brings. dinosaursmass extinctionPaleontology Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Having a power bank on hand is now essential if you spend most of your time on social media platforms likeTikTok,Instagram, andFacebook. Live streaming and videos can quickly drain your smartphone battery within hours which makes you miss out when you need your device the most. For those who use their phones a lot, the INIU 10000mAh power bank is a must-have accessoryâand now,it’s even cheaper than it was on Black Friday. Originallypriced at $24, this fast charger is available for $15, which is a 36% discount. Last year, the lowest price was $17. See at Amazon What’s so amazing about this deal is thatit comes at rising tariffs that are purported to impact the cost of electronics in the coming weeks. Despite this challenge, INIU continues to come up with great deals on their items, so it’s the ideal time to obtain this power bank prior to the prices might increase. The INIU charger performs very well and thoughtful design: It has a 10,000mAh capacity and it can charge most smartphones to full capacity several times. Whether you own an iPhone 16 or a Samsung Galaxy S25, this power bank will have your phones charged all day long. Its high-speed charging is 3A output compatible, so you cancharge your phone up to 78% in just one hourwhich is much faster than regular chargers. In addition, its USB-C output and input guarantee compatibility across an enormous range of devices including tablets like the iPad and peripherals like AirPods and smartwatches. Perhaps the most impressive thing about this power bank is just how thin it is: Despite its lofty-capacity power, it is light and portable enough to be pushed into your pocket or bag without consuming any additional space. That renders it ideal for use on-the-go, if you’re just commuting, on a trip or simply using a day away. INIU charger also offers pass-through charging capability, with which you may charge your gadgets and the power bank simultaneously. Besides its speed and portability, the INIU power bank boasts state-of-the-art safety functions that protect your devices and charger. Its TempGuard technology scans charging temperatures a massive 3 million times daily to prevent overheating or overcharging. This yields optimum performance and maintains your device’s battery well-being in the long termâa function that comes in handy to anyone concerned with long-term electronics wear. With tariffs on electronics (and Chinese imports) steadily rising, discounts like this will become increasingly rare. Experts predict that these price hikes will soon affect popular brands like Anker and INIU more significantly which makes it unlikely that such low prices will persist for long.

    "article_text": "After a four-season run,Â it’s game over forÂMythic Quest. PerVariety, the Apple TV+ series was canceled two weeks after its season finale in March. To reflect the show’s official end, Apple’s releasing an updated finale episode next week that’ll feature a brand new conclusion. Even so, the news probably comes as a shock to those who watched it, since it’s one of Apple TV+’sfirst shows ever, and could be considered a fixture of the streaming service. “Endings are hard,” wrote executive producersÂ David Hornsby, Megan Ganz, and Rob McElhenney. Weâre so proud of the show and the world we got to buildâand deeply grateful to every cast and crew member who poured their heart into it. To all our fans, thank you for playing with us. To our partners at Apple, thank you for believing in the vision from the very beginning. Because endings are hard, with Appleâs blessing we made one final update to our last episodeâso we could say goodbye, instead of just game over.” A post shared by Megan Ganz (@meganganz) Created by Ganz, McElhenney, and Charlie Day,ÂMythic QuestÂstars McElhenney as Ian Grimm, the creative director for the show’s titular (and fictional) MMORPG. As the series starts, the game’s on the cusp of getting a brand new expansion, and tracks Grimm’s clash with other team leads to get the expansion out the door. Along with McElhenney, the core cast includes Hornsby,Ashly Burch, and Danny Pudi, among others. Each season was well-regarded, and the show got its own spinoff calledSide Quest,Âwhich aired alongside the now-series finale and focused onMythic Questplayers, fans, and other developers at its studio. In a eulogy on Instagram, Ganz calledMythic Quest“four seasons and seven years of working with the greatest group of people you ever met. We helped each other through a pandemic and took our hearts and made them art.” She extended her thanks to Hornsby for all those nights “in a ridiculous costume writing and rewriting with me,” and McElhenney “for sending me that email oh so many years ago.

    "title": "Alienware Area-51 Review: It Would Be My Forever Case if It Didn’t Look so Dated",
    "article_text": "There was a time, even if it was just a few years ago, when an Alienware device looked like nothing else on the market. Now, in 2025,Alienwareâs Area-51 desktopis built to compete on ease and customizability, all while taking the guise of every other tower out there. Thereâs a benefit to that. It means this extra-large, 85L desktop tower will accommodate any and every new component you want to stick in it from now until judgement day. The downside is the Area-51 is an overly-large, samey brick of a desktop that loses the brand’s sense of self in its quest for the practical. The Area-51 is made to be your forever case. There are half a dozen small, though still notable innovations that make it a great case for a first-time PC gamer, from the USB-loaded port selection to QR codes on every component. All this attention to detail helps future proof the Area-51 so well that I wish I could tip my hat to Alienware rather than sit here in the doldrums of melancholy. Alienware Area-51 The Area-51 has a lot of small innovations and an interesting cooling mechanism, but it doesn't scream \"Alienware\" like it should. Pros Cons The main thing you notice about Alienware’s latest desktop is that its big. Itâs so big, you need two people to lift it onto your desk. Itâs so mundane looking, I might not want it on my desk at all. The premium build quality also comes at a premium price. The big Alienware pre-built PCstarts at $3,750. Our review model, which includes the highest-end Intel Core Ultra 9 285 K and Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090, will set you back $5,500. Alienware opted for an Intel chipset, though currently the chipmakerâs highest-end desktop CPU is notably less effective for gaming scenarios, sometimes even missing benchmarks of the 14th-gen Intel chips. I would have preferred an AMD option, but that’s not available outside buying your own separate motherboard and installing it yourself. Otherwise, if it wasn’t already clear, the rest of the specs are going to absolutely blast through benchmarks thanks to that 5090 and 64 GB of DDR5 XMP 6400 MT/s memory, though you should know beforehand the board only has two RAM slots. The Area-51 is essentially an upscaledAurora R16 from 2024. I liked that PC, and I think that rendition feels more evocative than this rendition. The silver color doesnât do much to accentuate the relatively few RGB accents lining the front intake mouth or internal components. The Aurora sported hexagonal shapes on the side panel, whereas the Area-51 is far more of a box with every panel line highlighted by its bright color. Itâs not ugly, but itâs not something I imagine looking at next to my desk with the smug satisfaction of a PC gamer with the coolest hardware. The best aspects of Alienwareâs new design are centered around its huge body. Thereâs a lot of empty space inside, and that allows for a huge sliding bracket that hooks onto the end of your graphics card. Even when itâs packing a 2.5-slot Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090, thereâs still an extra five inches in length you could go before hitting the front intake fan. That should leave you plenty of room to install a next-gen GPU when they inevitably arrive pricier and longer than the current generation. And while that swappable motherboard is good news, you will also need to purchase a separate $35 conversion kit to make sure everythingâs working correctly. That kit includes cables to help the new motherboard interact with the AlienFX board on the side panel. The FX board controls the RGB for the system, and itâs a testament to the design that itâs so easy to access by simply removing the right-hand side panel. Alienware hardware reps told me they opted to not include it in the box since they anticipate âonly a very small percentageâ of customers will want to do the upgrade immediately. The company promised it will offer the kit for âseveral yearsâ after the end of the Area-51âs lifespan. Even though the kit is a silly omission, the PC is still the most easily-upgradable Alienware unit in years. The panels are detached by unscrewing a lock, turning a dial, then hitting a button. Dell even took a page from Frameworkâs playbook. Every component, from the graphics card to the top fan bank, has a QR code that takes you to a dedicated page describing how to safely remove and replace the GPU, SSD, PSU, and RAM. If you have any experience with PC building, all the advice will seem rote. If you donât know what youâre doing, the videos are relatively helpful with some basic but sane advice for handling components. The most dramatic feature of the redesigned Area-51 is the positive pressure environment used for cooling. The CPU uses a 360mm liquid cooler unit plus fans in the front and bottom to draw in air, but the system makes use of thermodynamics to push the hot air out the rear vents. The desktop doesnât have any exhaust fans. Instead it relies on a number of gaskets and its fitted panels to keep pressures at the necessary level inside. I would be lying if I told you I wasnât skeptical, but it does indeed work. If you stand behind the rear vents, you can feel the hot air moving. In my tests, using Alienwareâs built-in Command Center software monitoring, the PC wasnât getting overly steamy. Above: An older edition Area-51 Desktop compared to the 2025 Alienware Area-51. Just to compare, I attached an old 120 mm fan to the rear exhaust to find if the PC performed any better. I didnât experience any major difference with or without the fan after running PC Mark and spending 15 minutes apiece playing intensive games includingCyberpunk 2077andMarvelâs Spider-Man 2. I’m sure someone might eventually find a way to soup it up with additional fans, but for now I can say is it works. Alienware claims this supplies better airflow, allowing for better temps which should also help it run better. I don’t have enough systems to offer apples to apples comparisons to check those claims. I also wouldn’t say the Area-51 system is any more silent than its contemporaries. It still will sound like a jet engine when you want to get the most out of your performance. I donât even need to tell you the PC absolutely blasted through benchmarks, though perhaps less dramatically than a PC like theCyberPowerPC Gamer Supremeprebuilt that sported an AMD Ryzen 9800X3D. If you want to know just how much horsepower a RTX 5090 can put out, you can findmy impressions from February. Installed in the Alienware tower you get the kind of rig that will let you push even the most demanding games to full ray tracing and path tracing and still manage to get around 60 FPS at 4K, and thatâs before you decide to opt for 4x framegen to push the number to over 200. The 5090 is an expensive and demanding card, so Alienware stuck a 1500W Platinum-rated ATX12VO PSU, which offers 500W more headroom than Nvidia suggests for peak performance. Alienware pulled out all the stops for this build, all the way down to the efficient cable management. This is a primo machine made to pair with other premium hardware, like a 240 Hz QD-OLED monitor. At that point, youâre spending $6,000 on a setup, so you better like the look of it. Back in December, when Dell first showed off the new Alienware desktop, it showed us earlier models of the triangular Area 51 that looked like the landing gear for an extraterrestrial starship. The new Area-51 looks like a big desktop. I know which one Iâd plug in first. Alienware Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

This is the ultra-expensive monitor you buy for the sake of your too-expensive new graphics card. The rejuvenated Alienware Area-51 laptop lineup includes a window to its internals. The Area-51 desktop is extra big to accept Nvidia's GPUs. We were quite spooked by how good Octoberâs best gadgets, gizmos, and watchamajigs were in the days leading up to Halloween. Alienwareâs next best attempt at a gaming headset goes back to basics. It has solid audio, but it may be looking too much to the past. Judging by this seven-year-old Lenovo Legion Y920 and 18-year-old Alienware Area-51, thatâs both a good and a bad thing.

    "title": "How Biden Set Up Trump to Use Authoritarian Tactics on Tesla Protesters",
    "article_text": "In 2021, when the Democrat-controlled Congress and the Biden administration were attempting to set up anew domestic terrorism program, human rights groupsâones that had typically fretted over the rightwing militia groups that the program was designed to combatâwere the first to express dismay.Â  âWe write to express our deep concern regarding proposed expansion of terrorism-related legal authority,â wrote 157 different signatories, ina letterÂ to Congress. âWe must meet the challenge of addressing white nationalist and far-right militia violence without causing further harm to communities already disproportionately impacted by the criminal-legal system.â Meanwhile, a swell of CIA and national security officials eagerly urged the government to create new legal authorities to treat Americans like terrorists. Now, as Trump’s second term gets underway, the new rightwing government appears to be using the legal and operational infrastructure set up during the Biden years to go after leftwing protesters. Independent journalist Ken Klippenstein is out witha new articleon the Trump administration’s blossoming counterterrorism strategy, which, according to government insiders, is poised to target Americans who express discontent about the president or his wealthy allies. âSo-called Tesla terrorism and potential anti-Trump violence is driving new articulations of the threat,â a senior intelligence official told Klippenstein. Indeed, in recent weeks, the Justice Department has pivoted federal law enforcement away from more traditional enemies and towards people who vandalize Tesla dealerships. Several people arrested and accused of having firebombed the cars will likely be charged with “domestic terrorism” charges, Attorney General Pam Bondi has said. Meanwhile,critics of Israelhave also become a target for the government’s roving eye. As previously noted, the precedent for much of this was set by the previous administration. Under Biden, the government developed its firstNational Strategyto counter “domestic terrorism.” The strategy, which was designed with input from America’s national security agencies, set up a broad variety of new programs to counter what it perceived as extremism in the homeland, including new task forces and liaisons with state and local law enforcement. However, as Klippenstein points out, the full scale of the program is not publicly known. He points to a recently published Â Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on America’s counterterrorism strategy that notes “officials from DHS, DOJ, and State told us that the classified implementation plan includes some additional guidance for classified activitiesâ and that âDHS and DOJ officials told us that they conduct additional activities to respond to the 2021 Strategy that are classified.â In other words: a secret program that spies on Americans and treats them like terrorists is not available for public consumption. That secret program is now being helmed by the Trump administration, which has very different ideas about who and what poses a danger to this country than its predecessor. The administration is busy revising the strategy to better suit Trump’s needs. Klippenstein writes: …the rewrite of the National Strategy document is shaping up to comport with Trumpâs view of the country, the GAO hints and others say, rescinding the previous approach and altering the focus of counterterrorism actions over the next four years. That includes focusing more on Trumpâs political opponents and framing petty crimes taking place at day-to-day protests as terrorism. Worse still, the head of America’s counterterrorism strategy, Sebastian Gorka, is described as an Israel-loving gun nut who is fond of “secret operations” and “special operators.” Gorka is tasked with overseeing all of America’s counterterrorism operationsâboth international and domestic. Klippenstein quotes from a federalcounterterrorism manualpublished in 2021 that lists various so-called “mobilization indicators.” These indicators, he writes, are considered “characteristics that could move people to carry out acts of extremist violence.” Under the government’s domestic counterterrorism mandate, Americans who demonstrate such indicators could find themselves the subject of a suspected terrorism probeâeven if they have never committed a crime. Klippenstein writes: Ever had a heated argument expressing sympathy for Luigi Mangione or HAMAS? Or bought military-style tactical equipment? Or withdrawn from family? If so, you meet the governmentâs criteria listed in its 2021 âMobilization Indicatorsâ booklet, a document intended to help local and state police to spot a terrorist. These criteria might strike you as creepy because, as the booklet itself concedes, âmany of the mobilization indicators included in this booklet may also relate to constitutionally protected activities.â In short, if you’ve ever been a super-vocal critic of the current administration or its allies, you could end up being a target of the government’s national security state. Lots of peopleâmyself includedâsaw this coming. In 2021, when the Biden administration began pushing for a new domestic terrorism program, I thought it wasa really, really bad idea. At the time, I wrote: For all the wailing and gnashing of teeth the Democrats did about Trumpâs authoritarian style, it seems deeply ironic that they would kick off this new moment of party ascendance by pushing for such overwhelming new powers for the nationâs security agencies. Such proposals seem destined to do little except further disfigure the already mutilated corpus of civil liberties that Americans used to take such pride inâbut which they now ever more sleepily deride as outdated, impractical, and unsafe. Now, here we are, some four years later, and a program that offers the government way too much power could easily be weaponized against peaceful political protesters. It’s not a happy time, though perhaps Americans might learn something from it. Donald TrumpJoe BidenTESLA Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Sperm Use Secret Corkscrew Power to Turbocharge Their Swim",
    "article_text": "When we learn about “the birds and the bees,” weâre taught that after heterosexual intercourse, sperm swim up through the vagina, past the uterus, and into the fallopian tube, where one fertilizes an egg released by the ovaries. It turns out, however, that sperm arenât just leisurely swimmingâtheyâre racing through the female reproductive tract, propelled by swirling fluid vortices shaped like rolling corkscrews. Researchers from Monash University and the University of Melbourne used advanced imaging to analyze the 3D fluid motion around swimming sperm. As detailed in astudypublished Tuesday in the journal Cell Reports Physical Science, the imaging revealed that a single swimming sperm creates multiple swirling vortices that attach to the cell and rotate around each other in sync, boosting the sperm’s propulsion. This discovery sheds light on how corkscrew flow patterns influence sperm locomotion and could have direct relevance for reproductive science. “As the sperm swims, its flagellum (tail) generates a whipping motion that creates swirling fluid currents that could optimise their propulsion in the reproductive tract,” Reza Nosrati, co-author of the study and lecturer in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Monash University, said in a universitystatement. “Whatâs really fascinating is how these spiral-like âimprintsâ in the surrounding fluid attach to the sperm body and rotate in sync, adding extra thrust.â If you’re having a hard time visualizing this exceptional propulsion method, it’s a bit like two swirling columns twisting around each other. Or “imagine taking a straight rubber band and twisting it into a spiral. Now, add another turn to create a superhelixâa tightly coiled, extra-twisted structure,” Nosrati explained. “For sperm, this extra twist in the fluid enhances their movement, following them as it tightens, allowing them to swim more efficiently.” Nosrati and his colleagues claim to be the first to have simultaneously imaged both the sperm tail movement and its 3D flow field. Because this propulsion method may influence how sperm interact with their surroundings, it could have important implications for fertility research. More broadly, capturing the movement of “tiny swimmers” could also be relevant to understanding how other tiny swimmers, such as bacteria, move and interact with their environments, according to the researchers. “These visualisations help us to better understand the fluid dynamics and the way sperm and other microorganisms navigate through different fluids,” Nosrati explained. Turns out that making babies really is about having the right movesâall the way down to the sperm’s choreography. fluid dynamicsHuman reproduction Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "article_text": "Smell the rage. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Apple TV's comedy series about a videogame studio making an MMO has been canceled after four seasons and an expansion pack—the four-episode spin-offSide Quest—as reported byVariety. After spending so long parodying the videogame industry, the show will get a send-off that sounds like the equivalent of a Dota patch. \"Endings are hard. But after four incredible seasons, 'Mythic Quest' is coming to a close,\" executive producers Megan Ganz, David Hornsby, and Rob McElhenney were quoted as saying. \"We're so proud of the show and the world we got to build—and deeply grateful to every cast and crew member who poured their heart into it. To all our fans, thank you for playing with us. To our partners at Apple, thank you for believing in the vision from the very beginning. Because endings are hard, with Apple's blessing we made one final update to our last episode—so we could say goodbye, instead of just game over.\" It's a shame the series has to end here, with a season our local Mythic Quest-enjoy Chris Livingston called\"the best it's been since the first\". Chris summed it up as \"a nimble comedy with a lot of heart, packed with enough gaming references to make nerds smile but not so many that it becomes impenetrable to non-gamers.\" Meanwhile, Netflix is out herecommissioning a second seasonof its unwatchable Devil May Cry anime—a show whose theme song is literally Rollin' by Limp Bizkit. That's not a joke, they deliberately subjected people to the song that makes you wish Run-D.M.C. and Aerosmith put the wall back up after they were done. That show gets to live on while Mythic Quest dies. It's an unjust world is what I'm saying. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "The Trump tariff pendulum swings back to 'everything's normal' from 'everything's broken' again, with computers and other electronic devices now exempt from even the steep levies on China",
    "article_text": "Well that's good, at least until it's not again, which will probably happen tomorrow or the day after. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. As reported byThe Guardian, The Trump administration has announced, through the United States Customs and Border Patrol, that smartphones, computers, and other electronic devices/components will be exempt from the US's chaotic and destabilizing new tariff regime. That even includes the steepest 125% tariffs on China. I've lost track whether we're doing the tariffs, not doing the tariffs,kind of doing the tariffs, oronly doing the tariffs on China, and Mr. Market seems similarly confused: He's mostly been sad lately, but also had some real pep in his step at other points. We're either headed for The Great Depression 2, or feelin' fine, depending on who you ask and when. The reasoning behind the tariffs similarly depends on who you're talking to. \"Normal\" conservatives will say it's Art of the Deal Madman Theory to prove that the US means business in trade negotiations with the rest of the world. More \"esoteric\" or \"avant-garde\" right wingers say it's in the name of transitioning the US back into a manufacturing economy, a sort of \"reindustrialization\" that has never been implemented in world history. Countries have industrialized, but never transitioned away and then back again, much less the unprecedentedly wealthy consumer economy at the center of the global financial system. Wedbush Securities global head of technology research Dan Ives toldCNBCthat it would cost Apple an estimated $30 billion over the course of three years just to move 10% of its supply chain from Asia to the US with a \"major disruption.\" The Guardianreported earlierhow investment bank UBS estimated this might look on the ground: A 79% increase (about $1,000) in the price of an iPhone 16 Pro Max, as one example. That \"category five price storm,\" in the words of Ives, is likely the primary motivation behind this new, semi truck-sized hole in America's tariff armor, though I'm sure panicked tech CEOs have been lobbying their hearts out to mitigate things as well. We're firmly back in \"only kind of doing the tariffs\" territory, then, but it's unclear how all of this will trickle down to us gamers⁠—won't somebody think of the gamers!US preorders for the Nintendo Switch 2 have been on icepending any tariff-related increase of its $450 MSRP, while I've been sweating how this might impact theRX 9070 XTgraphics card purchase I've been weighing. Buying a GPU was already excruciatingthanks to shortages, scalpers, and manufacturing partners (like MSI or Gigabyte) really stretching the \"suggested\" part of \"Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price.\" In the worst case scenario of the new Trumpenomics, at least a good mid-range card can last you a lot longer than it used to⁠—I could definitely ride out my RTX 3070 another few generations if RX 9070s and 5070s start commanding $2,000 a pop out of nowhere.

Bungie's taking a crack at the extraction shooter genre and so can you when theMarathonalpha test opens up later this month. Official launch day for Marathon isn't until September this year, but it will be running an alpha and beta test before that. Fromwhat we've played so far, it's all that Bungie FPS sauce in a different live service package than Destiny 2. The first alpha will give players who get in a chance to try out four of its different characters (\"runners\") and two maps in crews of three players all doing the PvPvE thing and trying to exfil with gear and completed contracts. Here's the quick facts on the Marathon alpha: Marathon's first alpha test will startApril 23later this month, with Bungie yet to disclose how long it will run for. Signups are live now over in the officialMarathon Discord server. The alpha test is private, requiring a code from Bungie, and is limited to North American players over 18 years of age. Marathon's first alpha test will include four runners and two maps for your squad to test out. Runners: Maps: Marathon is built on teams of three players and you'll want to crew up with friends if possible.

    "title": "Bungie says Marathon is about losing all your gear but still having a great time because you 'come out with a good story'",
    "article_text": "Marathon is an extraction shooter, but also a \"story engine\", according to Bungie. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Bungie is finally opening up about Marathon, its shiny new extraction shooter that's been under wraps since 2023. This is the legendary FPS studio's first new game in eight years, its first non-Destiny project since the Halo days,anda reimagining of a series that's laid dormant since the '90s, so the collective hobby is keen to know what sort of spin the Destiny folks can put on a relatively new flavour of PvP known for its loot lust and high stakes. Today's big reveal stream made one thing clear: Marathon will have all the hallmarks of Escape From Tarkov: A blocky inventory, faction quests, three-person squads, customizable guns, and a huge emphasis on money. Everything in your inventory has a sell price, and what you choose to extract from a map will be informed by big ol' dollar signs. Or in the game's case: credits. But Bungie says Marathon is about more than just getting rich (and dying trying). It's the journey, not the payday, is the idea. The studio's stated goal is for Marathon to be a \"story engine\" that produces memorable fights, adventures, and anecdotes for your group chat. Even if you leave the map empty-handed. \"A lot of people who are looking to try an extraction shooter, when they look at it, they don't see that adventure of going hiking in a dangerous area or going through a horror experience, right?\" Marathon game director Joe Ziegler told PC Gamer in an interview last week. \"They just look at the complexity of all this stuff like, 'Is it just me trying to do things and dying over and over again?'\" Partially, yes. Bungie's gameplay overview video andTim's hands-on with an early build of Marathonsuggest its loop is more-or-less dying over and over again, but the hope is that you're always bringing a new memory back to the menu. Although in some cases trauma might be a better descriptor. \"What we're trying to do is say, 'how do you go on adventures and then feel that survival challenge, that survival story that you're making?' Some of the best survival stories and moments I've had in gaming are actually failures or weird things that have happened, right?\" Ziegler said. \"And so it's learning to learn, it's learning to enjoy both of those things. Not seeing success purely as every single time I expect to survive, but every time you should expect to come out with a good story.\" Honestly, that sounds like a tall order. I'm not a Tarkov enjoyer, but I have played hundreds of hours of the other biggest extraction shooter, Hunt: Showdown. That game is a \"story engine\" in the sense that its fights are intense, explosive matchups that can last seconds or drag out into 20-minute standoffs, but the truly memorable ones are way more rare than something you can expect to experience in most play sessions. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. I need stronger motivations than the chance of an all-timer showdown, which is why Hunt has clear-cut win conditions in the form of scarce bounty tokens won by defeating a boss. Based on what I've seen, Marathon doesn't have anything like that. Like Tarkov, the loot is the goal, and the loot is inherently not going to be something you hold onto long-term, given Bungie's expectation that most maps will have a less than 50% survival rate. So I wonder what a memorable story in Marathon looks like beyond \"I extracted with this expensive gun which I will probably lose soon\". We've got a lot more on Marathon today, including our hands-on,Bungie's reasoning for not having proximity chat, and theunexpected inspirationbehind the animated short that premiered today.

    "title": "Marathon won't have proximity chat because it'd be way too toxic: 'I don't think anyone has a good solution to that just yet'",
    "article_text": "You won't be able to hear the battle cries of enemy runners in Marathon. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. We all have that moment when our eyes are opened to the hijinks made possible by proximity chat. For me, it was the night some guy in DayZ drove a truck through the town I was looting while screaming at the top of his lungs, the volume gradually rising and falling as he disappeared over the horizon. Ever since that formative belly laugh, it's been a treat to watch a once-niche feature of milsims make the jump to battle royales and, more recently, extraction shooters. Proximity chat is a modern tool for our modern times, but it has a downside: As long as someone's standing close enough, you're at the mercy of whatever they have to say—whether it's friendly or downright awful—until you mute them. That recipe for toxicity was potent enough for Bungie to decide that proximity chat wouldn't make the cut in its upcoming extraction shooter Marathon. \"When it comes to prox chat, I don't think we're against the experience of it, to be fair,\" game director Joe Ziegler told PC Gamer in an interview at Bungie's Seattle studio. \"I think the challenge is how to make sure we're creating a safe environment for players inside of that space. \"I don't think anyone really has a good solution to that just yet. Because we're so dedicated to making sure that we're creating a safe space where we don't have players just flaming each other or doing terrible things to one another, I think we're not ready to invest in prox chat until we have a solution.\" An explanation that will undoubtedly bring mixed reactions. I do have friends and coworkers who wince at the thought of having to put up with the ramblings of nearby strangers, social enrichment be damned, and will think this is purely good news. I'm of the mind that skipping prox chat will shrink Marathon's possibility space—extraction shooters can't truly reach their peak without impromptu negotiations, team-ups, deceptions, and roleplay. \"I think that's where we stand right now. Like, if it was magical and we could somehow come up with that solution, I think we totally would do it. But right now, it is a challenge that many companies are trying to figure out,\" Ziegler said. Bungie's not closing the door on prox chat forever, but it also doesn't seem all that motivated to invent the version of it that eradicates toxicity, so the smart money is on it never happening. One obvious counter to Bungie's reasoning is that proximity chat can be toggled off in other extraction shooters like Escape From Tarkov or Hunt: Showdown. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. This isn't a scientific observation, but in 592 hours of leaving prox chat on in Hunt, I can count my toxic encounters with strangers on two hands. In my experience, the open-ended goals of the extraction format don't tend to attract the mean-spirited, ultra-sweaty jerkwads.

After all the cryptic teasers, brutal layoffs, and a thrilling, somewhat messy, not-quite conclusion to the story of Destiny 2, Bungie today finally laid its cards on the table with a livestream gameplay reveal ofMarathon, its upcoming extraction shooter that continues the story of its mind-bending Doom-era series of Mac FPSes.

    "title": "Marathon: Everything we know about Bungie's sci-fi extraction shooter",
    "article_text": "Bungie makes a run for the finish line in September. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Bungie isn't ready to retire its '90s sci-fi FPS series,Marathon, just yet. The last game in its original trilogy released in 1996, but the Destiny and Halo studio hasn't forgotten its roots and announced a new Marathon game almost two years ago. Exciting stuff for gamers of yore, but go ahead and set some expectations—this isn’t the same Marathon we grew up on. Long gone are the days of Doom and Quake dominance—sort of. Those classic series look quite different today, and Marathon will too. Bungie’s new take on the old Mac OS trilogy is an extraction shooter pitting teams of three runners against each other in a fight for resources. There’s no singleplayer experience this time, but there’s still a season-to-season story to follow. Here’s everything we know about the new Marathon, including its release date, playtests, features, and every runner confirmed so far. Marathon launches on September 23, 2025,with full cross play and cross save compatibility—though you will be able to opt out of facing console players. Bungie made it official during the firstgameplay showcase,nearly two years after the studio announced it was working on a new Marathon game. Since the initial reveal in 2023, Bungie's sci-fi extraction shooter hasn't had the easiest development cycle. In that same year, the studio announced itsfirst round of layoffs, only to announce another brutal wave of220 developers cut from their jobsin 2024. Between the layoffs, Bungie also saw leadership shake-ups. Former Marathon director Chris Barrett was reportedlyfired for inappropriate behaviorwith female employees and is nowsuing Sony and Bungie. Joe Ziegler, former Valorant director, is the extraction shooter's new lead. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The firstMarathon closed alpha testis expected to begin in late April 2025.Sign-ups have already begun, and you can join the officialMarathon Discordfor a chance to play. Bungie plans on hosting more playtesting opportunities, so don’t be too bummed if you miss out on the first round. Along with the release date news, Bungie debuted Marathon's gameplay reveal trailer. It's one of many the studio published during its April livestream, including an extended look at how the extraction shooter showdowns will go with theMarathon gameplay overview, and acinematic introductionto its runners. Marathon takes place in the year 2893, when you and other \"runners\" are fighting for scraps on the planet Tau Ceti IV. The 30,000 people who once lived in Tau Ceti’s original colony have mysteriously disappeared, and few resources remain. What happened to them is a bit of an unknown, but distant messages and shoddy cover-ups indicate the UESC isn’t telling the full story. The runners—humans who traded their physical bodies for biosynthetic prints—dominate what remains of the planet in a race for riches. Factions employ runners, and you’ll uncover more about their motivations and interests over time. Bungie’s recent updates go into that a little more, and the studio confirmed its narrative plays out through seasonal storytelling. Think a bit more Destiny, and less how old-school Marathon fans may expect a new entry to look. OurMarathon previewfrom Tim Clark says it \"drips with Bungie's signature shooter sauce,\" and believes it’ll be a good one despite some obvious obstacles, but it’stough. Extraction shooters aren’t typically easy, but the harsh risk and reward cycle of Marathon’s 25-minute matches make you truly feel every loss and win, or as Tim put it, \"Marathon's highs are mountainous, but the lows feel like you're at the bottom of the Mariana Trench.\" The general extraction shooter rules apply to Marathon, with teams of three duking it out until no one is left and ultimately fighting over a safe sliver of the map. But Tim’s experience was a real bloodbath. When a runner dies, they lose all of their loot and don’t have a chance to get it back. That makes decisions to the exfiltration point far more nerve-wracking as runners juggle UESC incursions, puzzles, and bosses. It’s mean up until the very end, too. Marathon doesn’t even throw you a bone by indicating when you’re the last team standing. It just leaves the team to wait, anxiously. No wonder Bungie expects the typical map survival rate to sit under 50%. Bungie went from total silence to a flood of information after the Marathon gameplay debut. There’s quite a bit to sift through, including everything from anti-cheat to update cycles, so we’re keeping a running list of some of the most notable features. Runners are Marathon’s classes, each equipped with a Prime and Tactical ability, plus two Traits. A runner’s kit gears them toward distinct playstyles and fulfills a need in the squad, like providing ally support through intel or silently stalking enemies. Familiarity with the ins and outs of Tau Ceti’s maps will be a major factor in determining the last crew standing. Two of those alien locales are options in the upcoming Marathon alpha—the woody, five-crew mapPerimeterand the more open, six-crew battlefield,Dire Marsh. Its close-quarters map,Outpost, launches with the game in September. The fourth and final of the bunch, theUESC Marathon ship, is a little more enigmatic, but we know it’s on the way in a post-launch update. A runner’s day-to-day boils down to what factions they pick up contracts for, and there are different incentives to play mercenary for each. You can build reputation with any of Marathon’s secretive organizations, unlocking the group’s passive perks through the season. So far, Bungie’s revealed six factions:Cyberacme, Arachne, Sekiguchi, MIDA, Traxus, and NuCal.

    "title": "After thousands of hours in Destiny I had serious concerns about Bungie's Marathon reboot, but now I've played it my worry isn't whether or not it will be good",
    "article_text": "Two days spent on Tau Ceti IV confirm that Marathon will be one of the year's most exciting shooters, but still a major risk for Sony. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Here's the easy part: Marathon is an extraction shooter in which crews of three runners race against the clock, using 3D-printed cybernetic bodies to strip resources from a mysteriously abandoned colony on Tau Ceti IV. In your way stand teams of rival runners, robot forces left behind by the colony's owner, the Unified Earth Space Council (UESC), and even some local alien wildlife. Marathon is also Bungie's first non-Destiny release in 11 years, and as such is one of the most hotly-anticipated games of 2025. The early buzz centred on its startling art style—screaming acid colorways and blocky industrial shapes—which all but guarantees Marathon will be the best looking extraction shooter when it launches on 23 Sept. Having now spent a couple of days playtesting, I'm also confident enough to say it's going to be a good game. It may even be a great one, largely thanks to the secret sauce that makes combat in Bungie shooters feel so good. Now here's the hard part: All of that might not be enough to make Marathon a success. Does it have dedicated servers?Yes, unlike Destiny which uses a hybrid of client-server and peer-to-peer networking, Marathon has been built for dedicated servers from inception. It was a non-negotiable from the design team. Is there a solo queue playlist?No. Marathon has been built around the three-person crew format. However, youcanqueue as a solo or duo by switching off the crew autofill option. Just know that you will be at a severe disadvantage. How does loot rarity work?The standard common, rare, epic system applies with the corresponding colours you're used to. What determines a base weapon's rarity is actually the number of attachments on it. Do weapons have durability?Yes, but not in the usual way. Weapons have a hidden durability stat that ticks down when they change hands (ie you die and someone takes it). Once the counter reaches zero, the weapon blips out of existence. The idea is to prevent the economy getting bloated with the best guns over a season. Is proximity chat enabled?No. Bungie is interested in the idea, but has to factor in the capacity for it to create horrendous experiences. An additional wrinkle is current EU law, which means players need to be able to instantly block problematic players. What anti-cheat does it use?BattlEye, which is the same as Destiny. Is there disconnect protection?Yes, in the sense that the AI will fill in for you while you try to reconnect. But if it dies, so do you. Bungie wants to help protect against actual outages, not create an incentive to yank out your ethernet. Before we get to the hurdles in Marathon's way, let's break the gameplay down. Each trip to Tau Ceti IV lasts up to 25 minutes. At the beginning of a run you're given an exfiltration point to reach. Along the way you can choose to investigate any of the other points of interest on the map, taking on events like UESC incursions, solving simple puzzles (think matching computer terminals), and even tackling what Bungie describes as boss encounters. The only one of these I ran into involved a bunch of particularly beefy UESC robots hunkered down in a red dome that did damage over time. Marathon's AI enemies are surprisingly aggressive, and will chew you up fast if you get complacent. Objectives can be pinged for teammates, but how much risk you want to take is down to you. It's possible you snag a couple of decent bits of gear early and decide to book it to the exfil point, praying not to get mugged by players along the way. At the other end of the spectrum, you might have already whittled down the number of competing crews and opt to harvest as much from the map as possible, leaving with a mammoth haul of weapons, credits, and consumables. The kicker is that each time you fail to extract,you lose allof your loot. This is not unusual for an extraction shooter, which are inherently brutal by design, but even Soulslikes give you one shot at getting your gear back. Marathon doesn't tell you when you're the last team standing so, with imperfect map knowledge, the threat of encountering other players is a constant tension. My adrenaline spiked each time I heard a 'runner spotted' warning. It was especially pronounced during the final 30 seconds while posted up around the extraction flare waiting for rescue. If all three of you jump into the circle it'll cut the timer down to 10, but then of course you're even more exposed to a perfectly-placed grenade and heartbreak. For the bold, it's possible to hijack another team's extraction by dashing into the circle at the last second. Downed players can also claw their way into its radius, provided the other team doesn't make a killshot, which makes for some rowdy after-action stories. The Faustian Pact of Marathon's risk/reward dynamic is that each time you make it out will feel spectacular, but the late losses are just as heartbreaking. Arguably even worse are the runs where you spend 10 minutes gathering gear only to get team wiped while barely registering a shot. The emotional result is that Marathon's highs are mountainous, but the lows feel like you're at the bottom of the Mariana Trench. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Bungie says the expected survival rate on a typical map is under 50%, which means even good players should expect to die a lot. Failure is baked into the genre's DNA, which I worry will see a lot of casual players bounce straight off. I can certainly confirm that a string of bad beats during the first day had me ready to tilt all the way out of the solar system. (Watch my full hands-on preview below.) The second session went much better, in no small part because our crew was joined by a Bungie dev whose map knowledge and tactical nous (specifically when to take a fight versus when to circumvent one) helped deliver a run of Ws that was only interrupted when we wandered into an ambush by a crew of Valorant pros. On another occasion we lost a 1-v-3 to Bungie runner team leadKevin Yanes. Hard to complain about either of those, even if we did lose the equivalent of the kids' college fund in items. Bungie says the expected survival rate on a typical map is under 50%, which means even good players should expect to die a lot. Weaponry in Marathon is the expected range of sidearms, SMGS, shotties, assault rifles etc, albeit as imagined by a Lego designer in a PCP-fuelled revenge fantasy. As far as I could tell there was little in the way of alt fire modes or wacky options, with light machineguns and the railgun representing the heavier hitting options. The one break from the norm are the battery operated 'volt' weapons, which fire energy charges. Of those, the scout-rifle style 'Twin Tap HBR' is particularly nasty in the current build. I found nothing in the way of rocket or grenade launchers, presumably because anything that can wipe a team in a single shot is too much of a rage inducer, even for a game as uncompromising as Marathon. As for how they feel when fired, hey, it's a Bungie game: they feel great. For someone like me, with many 1,000s of hours in Destiny 2, it's like sliding into the comfiest suit of power armor. The shadow of Bungie's other live service game hangs heavy throughout Marathon, but the DNA is most obvious in combat—the bounce of your reticule, the arc of your grenade, the almost pornographically pleasing reload animations. It all drips with Bungie's signature shooter sauce. Live service games simply don't launch with everything calibrated correctly right out of the gate. To put it politely, Bungie should know this better than anyone. Marathon's base time to kill is punchy because the studio doesn't want players to win fights simply because they out-gear their opponents. If I get the drop on you, I need to be able to put you down even if you're rocking a purple tier shield. Still, it can feel oppressive when you're equipped with one of the poverty starter kits that the game hands you after a failed run, and you know you're up against runners with the net worth of Warren Buffett. I expect that kind of power delta stuff to be extensively rebalanced based on player feedback from the alpha and beta tests. Likewise, I imagine there will be quite a bit of discourse about whether it's easy enough to spot whether distant enemies are actual players or AI bots. After a while you get a sense for how they move differently, but on more than one occasion I was caught out by a real runner using the PvE enemies as a distraction. That feels both like a legitimate strategy and a potential irritant. Again, feedback will be crucial. Live service games simply don't launch with everything calibrated correctly right out of the gate. To put it politely, Bungie should know this better than anyone. By the time you read this, the Marathon reveal livestream will have concluded, during which alpha sign-ups were announced. That will include four runners to select, all of which I've tested, with a further two coming at launch. You can think of runners as akin to classes: Each has a prime and tactical ability, plus two traits, making for genuinely distinct playstyles and consideration when it comes to team comp. In all our runs, having a Blackbird felt essential. Her Echo Pulse prime (ie ult) pings a large radius around her, highlighting enemies for teammates. Even cooler is her Interrogate trait, which enables you to perform a finisher on a wounded runner that simultaneously reveals the location of their remaining crew. You show me a team that doesn't want wall hacks, and I'll show you three losers. Prime:Echo PulseTactical:Tracker DroneTrait 1:InterrogationTrait 2:Stalker Protocol The coolest of the initial quartet, Blackbird's ability to provide map information is invaluable on any team. Because she gleans extra awareness from finishing opponents, it actually creates an incentive to keep wounded enemies alive until Blackbird is in position. As with everything in Marathon: risk=reward. Prime:Search and DestroyTactical:Riot BarricadeTrait 1:ThrusterTrait 2:Tactical Sprint My biggest issue with Locus is that his bulky Mjolnir suit-looking ass makes him blend into the UESC bots at a glance. As the generic soldier choice, he combines strong defence in the form of a deployable shield and a powerful prime that temporarily adds tracking rockets to your outgoing weapon damage. Prime:Smoke ScreenTactical:Active CamoTrait 1:Shadow DiveTrait 2:Shroud If the name wasn't clue enough, Void's day job as a Stealth Assassin should be enough to tell you he's The Sneaky One. This is the character to pick if you like playing Nightstalker Hunter in Destiny 2, as his kit centres almost entirely on going invisible and talking in a growl. Prime:AmplifyTactical:DisruptorTrait 1:MicrojetsTrait 2:Power Slide Most of Glitch's power budget has been spent on her neutral game in the form of double jumps and long slides with little cooldown. Lore-wise she's a Martian freedom fighter and 'combat anarchist'. Glitch is likely to be the pick for high-skill sweats who like breaking opponents' ankles with crazy movement. During my visit I bounced between all four available runners. Glitch is the high mobility option that will feel most familiar to Destiny veterans (Marathon is otherwise a notably slower, more deliberate game than its stablemate), while Locus is your generic beefcake whose shield tactical and damage-focused prime make him a strong, if somewhat boring, choice. I found myself gravitating most towards Void, but not for his edgelord stylings. The ability to go invisible on demand is a great way to open engagements, with the 15-second duration feeling very generous, especially as firing your weapon only breaks stealth temporarily. His Smoke Screen prime is also clutch when it comes to reviving teammates or as an insurance policy during exfils. The focus on three-player crews encourages a pleasing tactical flow. If one player is downed, another can handle the revive, while the third provides cover. It also creates the potential for simple positional strategy. One of the more skilled teams in our session ran two aggressive attackers with their final player hanging back with precision weapons to make easy picks during the skirmish. Clearly, map knowledge will be a major determinant in Marathon's skill ceiling. Two maps were available in our test, both of which will be included in the alpha. Perimeter is a woodsy mid-sized map designed for five crews, while Dire Marsh is a more open map with six crews in mind. They will be joined at launch by Outpost, a more claustrophobic, indoorsy map that will end up hosting either three or four crews. What unifies all the maps is that stellar aesthetic, which Bungie senior concept lead Tobias Kwan calls variously \"acid ROMS\", \"neon horror\", and \"graphic realism\". In person it looks almost cel-shaded, but for how tactile the textures are. Marathon also avoids feeling cartoony by keeping the runners and their weaponry realistically proportioned. Kwan cites Breath of the Wild, Into the Spider-Verse and Mirror's Edge as touchstones, while also referencing sportswear, tactical gear, and (of course) cyberpunk in terms of the runners' wardrobes. As with everything in Marathon, there's a delicious sense of menace under the surface, which is only enhanced by an eerie soundtrack that fizzes with digital distortion. I'm a sucker for a haunted house in space, so I'm already itching to find out what's waiting on the UESC Marathon Ship. The Marathon colony ship was built into a chunk of the Martian moon Deimos. Doesn't sound hugely efficient to me, but I am no spaceship engineer. Intriguingly, there is one more map we haven't seen, but it isn't set to arrive until a couple of weeks after launch. The UESC Marathon Ship is the titular vessel hanging in low orbit, which Bungie is billing as the hardest map. So why hold it back? Some of the content creators at the hands-on eventhaveplayed older versions of it, and although they're locked into NDAs about the specifics, they seem genuinely convinced that the map is a game changer. There was even breathless talk that it could have the same energizing effect on Marathon that the Vault of Glass raid had on vanilla Destiny. Heady stuff. Prior to joining the Marathon team in July 2023, Ziegler spent 12 years at Riot, working first on League of Legends before going on to become game director on Valorant, a project he co-founded. I pressed Bungie for hints about what makes UESC Marathon Ship different from the other maps, and was told by game director Joe Ziegler that it has: \"Other vectors of pressure\". Somewhat less obscurely, he said there are objectives which lead to puzzles, \"raid-like mechanisms\" and different \"gameplay stressors\". To which I say: aliens. There is breathless talk that the UESC Marathon Ship map could have the same energizing effect that the Vault of Glass raid had on vanilla Destiny On the surface of Tau Ceti IV, youwillencounter extraterrestrials in the form of scuttling red ticks which are about the size of a small dog. They're easily dispatched, and sometimes you'll need to destroy their nests in order to complete a contract for a faction. It's possible to work for multiple factions in Marathon, but you can only have one contract active at a time. Earning rep from factions unlocks their passive perks, like being able to buy a specific item from the game's Black Market. Picking up a bigger backpack is an early priority because, in the current build, the essential items you need to bring on each run—two types of ammo, shield boosts, med patches etc—take up too much inventory space, forcing you to make Sophie's Choice-style decisions about what loot you keep too early. Some faction contracts are locked to specific maps, which may alleviate the risk of one map becoming the de facto community favourite while the others are left to rot. Bungie says all the factions will have secrets that can be uncovered over time, but not to expect week-to-week narrative beats like Helldivers 2. \"We're not really focusing on the format that Arrowhead delivered [narrative] in, which is the ongoing war,\" Ziegler told me, \"but what we do like is the idea of there being disruptive elements that help shift the narrative.\" It sounds like this stuff isn't totally locked down, but Bungie acknowledges the need to surprise players in order to keep them coming back. \"We ideally want players, veteran or new, to hear the chatter and overall vibe of a new season and be like: 'Wait, we have to deal with what now?' In a good way.\" Bungie wasacquired by Sonyin July 2022 for a cool $3.6B, with the idea being that the publisher was looking to muscle-up its live service offering. Since then, Sony has seenhuge successfrom Helldivers 2, but also the catastrophic flameout of Concord, the hero shooter from a studio founded by ex-Bungie devs that wasshut downjust two weeks after launch. Complicating things further, Marathon has undergone substantial changes behind the scenes, with former Valorant director Joe Ziegler replacing Christopher Barrrett as game director. It later transpired that Barrett wasterminatedby Sony for allegedly inappropriate behavior with female employees, and is now involved in alawsuit with his former employerfor $45.5M he claims is owed. Sony has also absorbed a substantial number of Bungie personnel in central service roles and an incubation project—a rumoured MOBA codenamed Gummy Bears. Back in February last year, SIE chairman Hiroki Totoki went so far as todemand more \"accountability\"for development budgets and deadlines. In Japanese corporate culture, that's about as public a rebuke as they come. Solving what happened to the colony is going to be the main narrative driver across Marathon's seasonal model. As with other extraction shooters, your loot and faction perk progress will be wiped at the end of each season, which are expected to last three months. In addition to new story stuff, there will be the usual gamut of weapons, components and mods added. I wasn't lucky enough to find one, but gold tier rarity mods exist that substantially change the performance of specific guns. For example, the Magnum can be turned into a pocket sniper—with no drawbacks—using a gold scope, while the Railgun can have an AoE detonation added to its beam. Snagging one of these from a downed runner is going to feel like hitting the jackpot. New seasons will also bring additional runners, and inevitably cosmetics, although it sounds like maps will be relatively rare—probably only one or two a year. Which brings us to perhaps the biggest issue facing Marathon: price. So far Bungie hasn't confirmed how much Marathon will cost, only saying it will be a premium product. Tarkov isn't free either, but it's the incumbent from which Bungie will need to lure players. And even then, the question remains: Will the extraction shooter genre, which feels inherently designed to generate as much stress as it does happiness, ever be mainstream enough to support the kind of success Bungie and Sony need to fund a game with the high production values Marathon has? My biggest worry is how Marathon can mitigate the bad vibes from those shuttle crash runs when you lose everything. I put it to Ziegler that players need some sort of lockbox in which they can protect a single item from a failed run. So far Bungie hasn't confirmed how much Marathon will cost, only saying it will be a premium product. As it turns out, Tarkov already has that in the form of the Kappasecure container, although that can't hold guns and is so grindy to obtain that few players will see one in a season. Ziegler points to the fact you can still earn XP and complete contracts even if you don't make it to exfiltration, but to me progress on an XP bar feels like the thinnest of gruel, although I do concede that not every failed run felt awful if the gunfights were particularly good. Later on, senior design lead Lars Bakken explained that ring-fencing items in that way could cause duping issues due to the way Marathon handles gear sharing. It'll be interesting to see what the feedback is around gear loss from the alpha and beta. Perhaps the real loot will be our own dead bodies left along the way. Even if the game blows up on Twitch, it's hard to imagine Marathon will bottle lightning quite like Helldivers 2 did. One thing I am certain of is that Sony will need some patience. Even if the game blows up on Twitch, it's hard to imagine Marathon will bottle lightning quite like Helldivers 2 did. The genre is too hardcore to have that sort of instant mainstream success. Before playing Marathon, I hadsubstantial doubtsabout whether, even as someone with so much time in Destiny 2, I would enjoy the high-stress setting on an extraction shooter. But I left the session wishing I could log back on for another run. Which is not to say my worries have been allayed. In fact, over two and a half decades of covering videogames, I can't think of many games which have been freighted with more problems to solve. From a spooked Sony, to the inherently hostile nature of the genre, and Bungie's own chequered history with Destiny's live service model, monetisation, and especially PvP balancing. These are substantial hurdles the game has to clear. Which is why just being good still might not be enough for Marathon. But what I played last week? Definitely good.

    "article_text": "Are you ready to lose control? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Bungie finished today's Marathongameplay reveal streamwith a surprise treat: An eight-minute animation that sets the scene for the game's lore, and specifically how brutal life is for runners seeking to make their fortune on Tau Ceti IV. Or, more specifically, their frequent, repeated deaths. I actually saw the short just over a week ago at Bungie's Seattle office as part of a two-day playtest—which you can read about here—and it's honestly the best one of these I've seen from a game in a long time. (Watch it below.) Credit for the quality goes toAlberto Mielgo, a director who won the Best Animated Short Film Oscar forThe Windshield Wiperin 2021. Since then, he's also won five Emmys, including for his work writing, designing and directing two episodes of Netflix's 'Love, Death and Robots' series. (Hey, maybe not everyone at Bungie got thememo from Sonyabout keeping budgets under control?) Death certainly features heavily in the Marathon short, as we watch runners transfer their consciousnesses into cybernetic 3D bodies to go scavenging around Tau Ceti's IV's abandoned colony. Life expectancy is shown to be startlingly short, with runners swiftly coming to gory (but stylish) ends. After each death, their psyche returns to their actual host body, where they are then shown several objects of emotional importance from their past and asked whether they recognise them, with the idea being that this process anchors them back to their real bodies. The process works a bit likebaseline calibration scenesfrom Bladerunner 2049, but that's not the true inspiration. As soon as I saw the scene, I knew where the idea had been lifted from: A brilliant but obscure sci-fi thriller called Possessor, directed by Brandon Cronenberg and released in 2020, who as you've probably guessed is the son of David Cronenberg, the guy who practically invented the body horror genre. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. In that movie, the always excellent Andrea Riseborough plays a corporate assassin who hijacks the mind of someone close to her target, makes the kill, then jumps back to her original body. One of the core conceits in the movie is that if you spend too much time inside your temporary body, your own identity starts to degrade and get lost, intermingling with the host persona. To prevent that, after each mission, the assassin is shown—you've guessed it—several objects with emotional resonance from her childhood and asked to recall them. It's basically repeated verbatim in the Marathon short, and when I approached the Bungie devs at the event to ask if they'd seen Possessor they acknowledged the film is one of many inspirations. Honestly, anything which gets more people to watch Possessor is fine by me. But be warned: it's not for the squeamish.

Survival-action shooterAtomfallhas lured more than two million players into its post-nuclear-disaster Britain, and they've apparently drunk 500,000 cups of tea while there. Which is not enough. Those are rookie numbers in the British tea drinking game. We need those numbers up to like three per person just to make average. That's 6,000,000 cups of tea, people, get on it. DeveloperRebellionshared the latest Atomfall stats from its first two weeks after release, and I was happy to find that 60% of players helped a poor wounded scientist, and deeply disappointed not just with tea consumption, but with how the delicious pasty somehow came in third on the list of foods consumed. What is wrong with you people? You're eating tinned meat when the pasty isright there. The nice part is that the cricket bat kill total is over 5.9 million, so we're right where we should be there. No, I do not have a statistic to base this one (unlike the tea one) but it just feels right. Drink a cuppa, kill a man with a wooden bat. Simple as. The new stats are a follow-up to a previous announcement from Rebellion that Atomfall hadbroken 1.5 million players. That made it the most successful game launch in Rebellion's 32 year history, which is pretty dang good for the veteran Zombie Army and Sniper Elite studio.

    "article_text": "\"I hope I get to play him again.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I already feel preemptively sorry for whatever studio ends up making Baldur’s Gate 4. Imagine watching Larian put out an RPG as massive, impressive, and flexible asBaldur’s Gate 3, and having the license holder Hasbro say \"another one of those, please!\". Now, as if following in the footsteps of one of the greatest games of all time wasn’t challenging enough, that unfortunate studio may also have to contend with the wrath of one of its lead actors. Said actor is Neil Newbon, aka Baldur’s Gate 3’s devilishly charming vampire Astarion. Newbon attended the video game BAFTAs earlier this week, where he was asked byTheGamerwhat he thought about Astarion being potentially recast should Baldur’s Gate 4 become a reality. To this, Newbon playfully responded that he would \"have to be dead\" in order for that to happen. And as for the developer that recast him, he’d \"hunt them down and gut them like a fish\". Newbon was obviously joking, but he did follow this up with a proper answer, stating that in such a scenario, he’d mainly wish the actor in question did justice to the character. \"I have no control over that, so, ultimately, if somebody played him in something else, I'd just hope that they'd come at it the same way I did, in terms of looking at the core character and their life story and their history and their backstory, and honor that story as much as possible, and not run to a trope.\" We still don’t know for certain whether Baldur’s Gate 4willbe a thing. Larian very nearly committed to it, and had itpartially playableat one point. But ultimately the studio decided to pursue its own projects, one of which is codenamedExcalibur. That said, Hasbro isdefinitely keenfor more Baldur’s Gate to exist. In March, Hasbro’s Dan Ayoub said the company has \"a lot of people very interested in Baldur’s Gate\" and that \"In pretty short order, we’re going to have some stuff to talk about around that.\" If Baldur’s Gate 4doescurrently exist in some form, Newbon seemingly knows nothing about it at present, stating. \"I don't know what's going to happen.\" But he does sincerely desire to return to playing Astarion, adding \"I hope I get to play him again.\" Baldur's Gate 3 romance: Who to pursueBaldur's Gate 3 multiplayer: How co-op worksBaldur's Gate 3 endings: For better or worseBaldur's Gate 3 multiclass builds: Coolest combosBest RPGs: The greatest you can play now Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "Following massive player fall-off, Amazon's MMO Lost Ark is getting an update to make levelling faster and address a 'known progression pain point'",
    "article_text": "\"These changes will help make progression more accessible.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Lost Arkwas mostly a pleasant surprise for me when I reviewed it back in 2022. I enjoyed both its spectacular ARPG combat and its increasingly absurd MMO story, which shifted from conventional fantasy fare to throwing you into enormousclown battlesand exploring islands inhabited by Borrowers-like characters. But there came a point where the progression barriers were thrown down, and my movement across its colourful archipelago was increasingly inhibited by grind. It seems I'm not the only person who has struggled with Lost Ark's progression, as developer Smilegate and the game's Western publisher Amazon are cooking up a bunch of changes designed to improve the RPG's forward momentum. These changes were originally announced in a livestream that focussed on the Korean version of the game. Later, after some community members voiced concerns about plans to nerf gold income in various raids, Amazonpublished a Steam blogaddressing how the changes will affect the Western version of Lost Ark. Chief among these changes is a nerf to several crafting requirements in the game, with required gold and materials for several in-game crafting processes such as advanced honing and armour and weapon transcendence reduced by as much as 50%. While Amazon specifies the changes are not 1:1 with the Korean version, it does plan to implement many of the announced updates. “To ease progression costs for new and returning players, we will be implementing the Transcendence and Advanced Honing nerfs,” the company writes. “These changes will help make progression more accessible without the negative impact that gold nerfs might have caused.” Elsewhere, Smilegate is looking at an overhaul to Lost Ark's gem system, where players can plug gems into their skills to increase their damage or reduce their cooldowns. Smilegate feels like the system currently “creates barriers to both character progression and playstyle flexibility” and so is examining potential solutions to make the system more accessible. In addition, Smilegate is planning to address Lost Ark's infamous T3 dead zone, a “known progression pain point” upon reaching character Tier 3 where character progression grinds to a halt. Apparently this is not exclusive to the Western version of the game, and something that Smilegate has wanted to deal with for some time. Now the studio is actively doing so, although Amazon says it's are not able to share the exact plans at the moment. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Why this sudden focus on smoothing player progression? Well, it may have something to do with the fact that Lost Ark's player retention isn't great. The game's Western launch was massive, attracting a peak concurrent 1.3 million players in February 2022, according to Steam DB. But that figure dropped off rapidly over the following six months and has declined consistently since. In the last 24 hours, Lost Ark attracted just shy of 17,000 players at its peak. While not a bad number by most metrics, it's still a huge fall-off compared to launch. It's also alower 24 hour peakconcurrent than fellow Korean MMO Black Desert, a game that achieved a considerably smaller all-time peak of just over 60,000 concurrent players nearly six years ago. From this, it's clear Lost Ark has a problem with picking up and holding onto new players, and it doesn't surprise me that ponderous progression is the issue. Lost Ark is at its best when you're barrelling through one of its wacky side adventures like an intercontinental ballistic missile flying through a circus, and I think the easier Smilegate makes it to encounter those stories, the more popular Lost Ark will be. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Rick has been fascinated by PC gaming since he was seven years old, when he used to sneak into his dad's home office for covert sessions of Doom.

    "title": "Literary masterpiece The Count of Monte Cristo is being adapted as a clicker game about getting educated to escape prison",
    "article_text": "Click for freedom. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The Count of Monte Cristo is the third most famous fictional count, after Sesame Street’s numerically obsessed vampire ‘The Count’ and the most infamous vampire of them all, Count Chocula. Alexandre Dumas’ classic novel of romance and revenge has nothing to do with vampires (which some may consider an oversight), but it’s still recognised as one of literature’s greatest works, having been adapted into countless films and TV shows. As yet, though, a proper video game adaptation has eluded us. A quick Steam search shows that the closest thing currently available is ‘The Count of Monster Disco’, a Transylvania-themed spinoff of Train Simulator, which beyond the punny title, has nothing to do with Dumas’ novel whatsoever. Thanks goodness, then, for theCount of Monte Clicker, a bona-fide attempt to retell the classic tale in the interactive mode Dumas himself would no doubt have chosen—an incremental clicker game. As in the novel, players assume the role of Edmond Dantès, a French first-mate who is wrongfully accused of treason by Fernand Mondego, and imprisoned in the island fortress Chateau d’Iff. There, he meets fellow inmate Abbé Faria, with whom he concocts a plan to escape the island, recover a treasure buried on the island of Monte Cristo, and exact vengeance upon Mondego and those who conspired with him. From the available footage, the game itself seems to centre around the escape from Chateau d’Iff, an ideal scenario for an incremental experience. Dantès’ days are spent chipping away at the stone walls of his prison cell, while also pondering on the lessons of logic, rhetoric and philosophy taught to him by the Abbé. These ponderings are far from idle, however. What Dantès thinks about in any given moment provides fleeting bonuses. Focussing on his self-belief, for example, briefly increases his chip speed. Similarly, the Abbe’s lessons provide more permanent upgrades to Dantès. Learning basic addition provides Dantès with extra pickaxes to hack away with, while mastering trigonometry helps him perfect his strike angle, increasing pickaxe damage. Oh, and there’s also a Vampire Survivors-style autobattler element where Dantès has to shoot hordes of encroaching rocks. Is this true to Dumas’ original vision? Perhaps not. Would the novel be a superior work if it was? Indisputably. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. While it’s all charmingly silly, but there’s a pretty serious development brain behind it. The game’s created by Adam Travers, who previously developed another idle GameJourney to Incrementalia, in which you play as a necromancer. It has a ‘Very Positive’ rating on Steam for how it cleverly adds a bit more substance to your typical clicker, as noted by one Steamreviewer“By almost entirely removing arbitrary time gates and making it universally free to respec, Incrementalia takes the formula created by idle games and refines it from pure skinner box addiction into a format that's actually fun to seriously engage with.” Thanks for the insight, er, doot doot. There’s no specified release date for the Count of Monte Clicker yet, though there's a vague window of the third quarter of this year. When it does launch, its Steam page says it will feature “multiple game modes” across four acts, suggesting it will cover the broader story of the novel after all.

He grew up on a diet of similarly unsuitable games, with favourites including Quake, Thief, Half-Life and Deus Ex.

    "title": "Days Gone’s upcoming survival arcade mode will introduce endless hordes and ‘exploding freakers’, and I’m beginning to think it might be the best way to play the game",
    "article_text": "Horde assault mode aims to turn the open world game into a survival roguelite. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I was ambivalent aboutDays Gonewhen it shambled onto PC in 2021, though my issues were primarily with its clumsy storytelling rather than anything systemic. Exploring the world on Deacon St John’s motorcycle while evading hordes of shambling undead was enjoyable enough, especially when a minor pitstop to pick up some fuel would turn into a cross-country fight for survival. Hence, I was more than a little curious when Sony announced that the upcomingBroken Road DLCwill feature a horde assault mode that focuses squarely on that. With the DLC due to launch in a couple of weeks, Sony has revealed several new details about the mode, and I’m beginning to wonder whether it might turn out to be the best way to play the game. Described as a “survival arcade” mode by Sony in its recentSteam update, horde assault basically strips all the narrative gubbins from Days Gone and condenses its survivalist feedback loop into a 30-minute battle to the death. Players drop into the map as Deacon or one of several other playable characters (including six new avatars to inhabit), and must immediately fight through an initial horde simply to get to their bike. Once acquired, players can use the bike to scout out supply boxes that contain more powerful weapons they’ll use to defend themselves, including a brand new weapon—a flamethrower. Horde assault is designed to be a more intense experience than vanilla Days Gone. Alongside the tighter structure, the mode also increases the size of hordes. Moreover, if you manage to survive for a whole half hour, the game will spawn an “unlimited horde” that will presumably hunt you down until you die. The mode also features a levelling system that will provide in-mode rewards, including those new playable characters as well as unique injectors. Injectors are a concept carried over from the main story and basically act as game modifiers. But horde assault expands their number and increases their power, amounting to 12 positive injectors that boost your scoring potential while increasing the game’s challenge, and 12 negative injectors that do the exact opposite. Examples of these include “wanted”, an injector that starts you off at the highest intensity for undead hordes, and “exploding freakers”, which may sound like it’s designed to make the game harder, but is actually intended to help you thin enemy ranks. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. While the horde assault mode is designed as an endgame challenge, Sony says the mode will be available to players from the get-go, and should provide an additional 10 hours of play on top of the base game. It’s worth noting this mode isn’t all the Broken Road DLC will add—it also brings a permadeath mode, a speedrun mode, and a photo mode. Frankly, though, none of this intrigues me anywhere near as much as horde assault. Much as I enjoyed biking around Days Gone’s slice of Oregon, I sometimes wondered whether the size of the open world played against it, dispersing its survival loop across too broad an area. We won’t have long to find out how the new mode shakes things up, the Broken Road DLC arrives on April 25. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Rick has been fascinated by PC gaming since he was seven years old, when he used to sneak into his dad's home office for covert sessions of Doom.

    "article_text": "Get all the help you need with today's Wordle. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's the first day of the weekend so sit back, relax, and let us help you win thisWordleand every single one that comes after it. Treat yourself to a quick win with a cheeky little click through to today's answer if you like, or get comfy and spend some time with our hint for the April 12 (1393) puzzle. However you'd like to play, we've got you covered. What a brilliant way to start the weekend. That wasn't the breeziest Wordle I've faced recently, but that was why I enjoyed it. A few clues, a few stumbles, and then one fantastic \"Ah, got it\" moment as it all fell into place. Don't worry if you're not so lucky—you can guarantee yourself a similar experience with our hints (or today's answer). Any person who cares for someone else could be this, but most often this is a trained medical professional busily treating sick people in hospitals. No, there is not a double letter in today's puzzle. A good starting word can be the difference between victory and defeat with the daily puzzle, but once you've got the basics, it's much easier to nail down those Wordle wins. And as there's nothing quite like a small victory to set you up for the rest of the day, here are a few tips to help set you on the right path: There's no racing against the clock with Wordle so you don't need to rush for the answer. Treating the game like a casual newspaper crossword can be a good tactic; that way, you can come back to it later if you're coming up blank. Stepping away for a while might mean the difference between a win and a line of grey squares. Here's that word you've been looking for. The answer to the April 12 (1393) Wordle isNURSE. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Past Wordle answers can give you some excellent ideas for fun starting words that keep your daily puzzle-solving fresh. They are also a good way to eliminate guesses for today's Wordle, as the answer is unlikely to be repeated. Here are some recent Wordle answers: Wordle gives you six rows of five boxes each day, and you'll need to work out which secret five-letter word is hiding inside them to keep up your winning streak. You shouldstart with a strong wordlike ARISE, or any other word that contains a good mix of common consonants and multiple vowels. You'll also want to avoid starting words with repeating letters, as you're wasting the chance to potentially eliminate or confirm an extra letter. Once you hit Enter, you'll see which ones you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second guess should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. With a bit of luck, you should have some coloured squares to work with and set you on the right path. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it wassold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes. When baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do. She's now PC Gamer's word game expert, taking on the dailyWordlepuzzle to give readers a hint each and every day. Her Wordle streak is truly mighty. Somehow Kerry managed to get away with writing regular features onold Japanese PC games, telling today's PC gamers about some of the most fascinating and influential games of the '80s and '90s.

    "article_text": "The studio's new competitive sports game, Rematch, will cost $30 when it releases this summer. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Sifudeveloper Sloclap has pivoted from martial arts games to sports games with Rematch, a 5v5 competitive football (soccer) game coming this summer. It turns out the skills transfer: Rematch is more Rocket League than FIFA, and it's \"something special,\" writer Daniella Lucas said aftervisiting Sloclap for a hands-on preview. It'll also be $30, a decision some will probably balk at. Most of today's biggest multiplayer games either started as free-to-play games or turned free-to-play at some point, and a common refrain when a competitive multiplayer game fails is that it should've been free-to-play—it was said aboutConcord. Speaking to PC Gamer during that recent studio visit, Rematch creative director Pierre Tarno said that he doesn't think online games have to be free-to-play, and that making a free-to-play game was never even on the table for Sloclap. \"I never considered free-to-play,\" Tarno said. \"One of the things I love about making games is that there is no secret formula or anything, but the best way—or maybe actually the only way—to make a commercial success is to just make a very good game.\" That was certainly the case for Helldivers 2, which launched at $40 and became thefastest-selling PlayStation game ever. \"One of our cultural pillars at Sloclap is respecting our players, respecting their intelligence, respecting their skills,\" Tarno continued. \"We like challenging gameplay and gamers are a very discerning audience. They are often very analytical, very precise in their assessment of mechanics and what works, what doesn't, what's balanced, what's not balanced, etc. \"My point is, if you make a game that's good enough, that's unique enough—even if players say, 'Oh, it's an online game with a competitive edge, it should be free-to-play otherwise it's dead on arrival'—I think that's not true. I think that if it's original and solid, plus very reasonably priced, players will get it.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Rematch will be out on June 19 (here's theSteam page) and if it's as good as Absolver and Sifu, I sure hope players get it.

    "article_text": "The latest twist in the tale When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. There's a new twist in theUS tariff trade war: Phones, computers, semiconductors and various other electronics are now exempt from punishing import tariffs, which have shot up to 145% for China and are typically now 10% as a baseline for other countries. The news was reported by theAssociated Pressand others, and while it's still early to say what the full impact will be, it does ease the pressure on companies who mostly manufacture their gadgets outside of the US – includingApple,Dell,Nvidia, andSamsung. US President Donald Trump introduced a raft of tariffs for goods imported to the US at the start of the month, and markets have been in chaos ever since. Earlier this week, a lot of those tariff hikes above the 10% baselinewere paused– but not for China, which raised its own tariffs in turn. This new exclusion policy does cover China, and mentions smartphones, laptops, hard drives, computer processors, memory chips, and machines used to make semiconductors. Most companies that deal in electronics will be breathing a sigh of relief, though some device categories apparently aren't covered, including video games consoles. It's been difficult to predict the moves the US government has made in respect to tariffs in recent days, and that hasn't changed. This latest move should mean gadget pricingsettles down for consumers, but it's impossible to be certain. Bloomberg reportsthat the new exclusion policy could be a precursor to a whole separate tariff focused specifically on electronics. For now, the world is waiting to see how the 90-day pause on many of Trump's tariffs plays out. As a US company which assembles almost all of its goods overseas, including in China, Apple has been in the spotlight during all of this tariff uncertainty: there have even been suggestions ofApple factories in the USand reports ofiPhone panic-buyingahead of potential price rises. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Apple is one of the companies that it seems will benefit the most, though the move may not be enough toopen up Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders in the US, which have been delayed. Consoles like the Switch 2 aren't mentioned in the new exemptions, though the previous 90-day pause should mean more stock can be moved to the United States.

    "article_text": "Kioxia, AIO Core, and Kyocera are all working on separate parts of the project When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A trio of Japanese tech giants, Kioxia, AIO Core, and Kyocera, have announced the development of a prototype broadband SSD with an optical interface that works with the PCIe 5.0 standard. The optical SSD prototype has reportedly achieved \"functional operation\" using PCIe 5.0, which offers double the bandwidth of PCIe 4.0. This was made possible through a combination of AIO Core’s IOCore optical transceiver and Kyocera’s OPTINITY optoelectronic integration module. This optical SSD was created to handle the demands of modern applications like generative AI, which rely on moving large amounts of data quickly. The use of optical connections in SSDs could help reduce the physical limitations tied to traditional electrical interfaces, especially in large-scale data center environments. The three firms say they plan to continue developing the technology and apply it to proof-of-concept testing aimed at future real-world use. One of the major benefits of going optical is the ability to increase the physical distance between compute and storage without losing performance or energy efficiency. This is expected to be especially useful for data centers that span wider areas. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! There's also the added advantage of reduced energy use when shifting petabytes of data, which could help meet growing environmental goals in the tech industry. The project's aim is to ultimately create new digital infrastructure technologies that cut energy use in data centers by over 40% compared to current systems. This work is part of Japan’s “Next Generation Green Data Center Technology Development” project, JPNP21029, which receives funding from the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) through the Green Innovation Fund Project. Each company brings specific expertise to support the shared goal of building more efficient and capable data infrastructure for the future. Kioxia is focusing on broadband optical SSD development, AIO Core is working on optoelectronic fusion devices, and Kyocera is creating optoelectronic packaging.

    "article_text": "OpenAI is helping out When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Netflix has long used AI algorithms torecommend new moviesand shows to its users, but it's now testing an enhanced experience that can suggest titles to watch based on your mood or whatever criteria you choose. As reported byBloomberg, and confirmed by Netflix toThe Verge, the test is live now for iPhone users in Australia and New Zealand. For now, it seems the focus is on iOS, but US subscribers are apparently getting this \"in the coming weeks and months\". The feature is going to be opt-in for users, at least to begin with, and will be powered by technology fromChatGPTdeveloperOpenAI. As yet we haven't had any official announcement from either Netflix or OpenAI. It's perhaps understandable that Netflix is taking a low-key approach to the new recommendation feature: the use of AI in movies and shows is underan increasing amount of scrutiny, with serious questions being raisedabout the creative industry. We haven't been able to test this out for ourselves at TechRadar, and there's not much to go off in the reports as yet. Being able to get recommendations based on your mood is really the only detail that's emerged so far. However, given the way movie and show recommendations already work in generative AI bots such as ChatGPT, it's not difficult to imagine the sort of functionality that's heading to Netflix: a more personal, more detailed recommendation experience. You can already ask ChatGPT to recommend movies similar to classic 90s action thrillers, less than two hours in length, and without excessive violence in them and get some decent answers back. Netflix's own version is likely to work in a similar way. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. In other words, you'll be able to make all kinds of requests in terms of recommendations, from genre to setting, and you'll get a bunch of AI-picked movies and shows back – all available in the Netflix catalog, of course.

    "title": "With this simple gadget, you can make great-tasting pour-over coffee with fewer beans",
    "article_text": "It's all in the neck When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Researchers have discovered the secret to brewing tastier, well-rounded coffee without using any extra beans – and it's the simple gooseneck kettle. This type of kettle has a long, fine pouring spout, which produces a higher-pressure, more precisely controlled stream of water that's the key to a better brew. Coffee prices have soared in recent months due to factors including climate change (including severe droughts and frosts in Brazil) that leads to poor harvests, increasing costs of production, and increased demand for coffee worldwide. Getting the same flavor from a smaller portion of beans is, therefore, great news for those of us who love to start the day with a mug of pour-over. As reported byThe Guardian, researchers from the University of Pennsylvania have found that pouring water slowly from a height creates an 'avalanche-like' effect that results in better mixing of the coffee and water, increasing contact time, and extracting more flavor compounds from the grounds. They suggest you try reducing the amount of coffee you use by 10% and experiment with pouring from different heights (up to 30cm) to see the changes in flavor profile. There are plenty of gooseneck kettles around, but I have a couple of particular recommendations. If you want a traditional kettle for the stove, the Stagg Pour-Over Coffee and Tea Kettle from Fellow is an excellent choice. Fellow is well known for its premium coffee-brewing equipment, and theFellow Aiden Precision Coffee Makeris the choice of many professional roasters, including my Specialty Coffee Association (SCA) instructor. Its gooseneck kettle comes in two versions: stovetop and electric. The stovetop version includes a thermometer with a dial on top that shows you when the water has reached the optimal brewing temperature. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. In contrast, the electric version has a temperature control that you can set in increments of 1°F. The Dualit 92960 Pour-Over Kettle is another great option if you're in the UK. It also has variable temperature controls and a hold function that keeps the water at your preferred temperature for up to five minutes while you weigh out and grind your beans. It's a little cheaper than Fellow's electric gooseneck kettle. Cat is TechRadar's Homes Editor specializing in kitchen appliances and smart home technology.

    "title": "The end is nigh for Windows 10 – here are 5 things Microsoft must do to get people to love Windows 11",
    "article_text": "5 things Microsoft needs to do to make people ditch Windows 10 and love Windows 11 When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Microsofthas aWindows 10problem. The problem is that despite the launch of the newer, shinierWindows 11, a large section of PC users are stubbornly refusing to upgrade, and instead sticking with the almost 10-year old operating system. While that might not seem like ahugeproblem for Microsoft – after all, people are still using a version of its Windows OS, even if it’s not the latest – the company has also announced thatWindows 10 is fast approaching its ‘End of Life’ date of October 14,2025. After that date, Microsoft will no longer provide updates, including security patches for Windows 10 – leading to anyone still using the OS being potentially at risk as new security threats emerge. So, Microsoft’s problem is that it has a hard deadline (which it imposed itself, to be fair) to get people to move fromWindows 10toWindows 11. Unfortunately, it’s currently doing a terrible job of it. According to GlobalStats’ most recent numbers(from last month), 54.23% of Windows PCs are running Windows 10, while 42.66% are on Windows 11. While the gap is narrowing, the fact that Windows 10 remains the most-used version will no doubt be disappointing to Microsoft. The race is now on to get Windows 10 users to move to Windows 11 – but what can Microsoft do? Microsoft has so far taken a carrot and stick approach to tempting people to move to Windows 11, though it has tended to be more stick-heavy than I’d have liked. Carrot-wise, Microsoft initiallyoffered the Windows 11 upgrade for free for people moving from Windows 7 and Windows 10. While this was only a limited-time offer, various methods remained that allowed people to continue to upgrade for free, and up until recently it seemed Microsoft was happy to turn a blind eye – I assume as it at least meant people were moving to Windows 11. To be fair, it was a good move – offering it for free took the sting out of having to upgrade to a newoperating systemafter being told repeatedly byMicrosoft that Windows 10 would be ‘the last version of Windows’. It’s also similar to Apple’s approach with its rival macOS operating system, which releases new versions every year, but which are always free. The free offer was enough to make me upgrade my Windows 10 PCs to Windows 11, and while I’m sure it also tempted people who would have otherwise stayed on the older version if they had to pay, clearly it wasn’t enough to get everyone to shift. For a start, due to some odd system requirements for Windows 11, there were people with perfectly good Windows 10 machines that could not upgrade due to their device not coming with a TPM (Trusted Platform Model). In those cases, they could either buy a new Windows 11-compatible device or stick with their current device and stay on Windows 10. That was obviously an easy choice for a lot of people. Also, while Windows 10 is far from perfect, it is also a very solid operating system, so I completely understand people who are perfectly happy to keep using Windows 10 as they know it works well, and they are familiar with using it. Windows 11 is very similar to Windows 10, but there are a few things that could be frustrating for people coming from Windows 10 (especially how the Taskbar works). And moving to a new operating system always brings some degree of risk. If your PC is running great with Windows 10, would you really want to jeopardize that by upgrading to Windows 11 and introducing problems due to incompatibilities and other bugs? So, with some Windows 10 holdouts not being tempted by the carrot, Microsoft switched to the stick. This mainly involved showing ads and pop-ups encouraging people to upgrade to Windows 11 – and some of these can be annoying and intrusive if you’re using your PC for important tasks. Instead of gently bullying people to make the switch, it’s ended up annoying a much larger group of Windows 10 users – and in some cases I can imagine it’s made people even more reluctant to move to Windows 11. So, with the clock ticking, what can Microsoft do to convince people to move to Windows 11? While I fear the company will keep using its ‘stick’ approach until everyone is so fed up they install Windows 11 just to shut Microsoft up, I have a few better suggestions. If you were to ask anyone at Microsoft why you should use Windows 11, they’ll probably say because of the artificial intelligence andCopilotfeatures (perhaps because they’re worried CEO Satya Nadella is eavesdropping on the conversation). AI, and Microsoft’s integration of it via the Copilot app in Windows 11, is the big obsession for the company, and while recent Copilot-centric events have done a better job of selling Microsoft’s vision of AI, the truth is that the company’s excitement about Copilot just isn’t being matched by consumers. This is mainly because Microsoft has failed to show how Copilot can make people’s lives easier. Instead it’s focused on frivolous things such as image generation and email summaries, which might be fun for a few minutes, but the novelty quickly wears off. However, if Microsoft showed some of the things Copilot can do that rival AI chatbots can’t, and explain how these can help you with tasks you perform every day, then people will be much more interested. Some of these features are exclusive to Copilot+ PCs – which are devices that come with anNPU(Neural Processing Unit) for performing AI tasks on the device (rather than via the internet), so if Microsoft wants people to ditch their old Windows 10 device and buy a new Copilot+ PC, then it’s going to have to do a much better job at showcasing the benefits that AI and Copilot brings to Windows 11. One of the biggest changes with Windows 11 was the taskbar which runs along the bottom of your screen. As well as making a visual change that moves icons to the center of the screen, rather than at the left-hand side of the taskbar, which has been the norm since Windows 95, Microsoft made some background tweaks to how the taskbar works. The problem is, it made Windows 11’s taskbar worse to use than Windows 10’s. This is particularly evident when you want to drag and drop files from your PC onto an app icon on your taskbar. In previous versions of Windows, this would open the file in that app (as long as it was compatible). With Windows 11, you can’t do that. Nor can you move the taskbar to the side of the screen (or the top) – something that a lot of people like to do. Trying to get people to move to your new product becomes much harder when there are key areas where the new product is worse to use than its predecessor. After all, why would you go to the trouble and expense to upgrade if you lose features? Microsoft has said it is working on bringing those features back to Windows 11’s taskbar, but it’s been several years now, and the issues remain. Making this a priority for the expected influx of Windows 10 users when the End of Life period starts would be an excellent idea. It’s fair to say that Windows 11 is going through a phase at the moment where it seems that every update that Microsoft releases for the operating systembreaks as many things as it fixes. This happens to operating systems –Windows 10 also suffered from a spate of bad updates a few years ago,andmacOS has had its fair share of broken updates– but the timing of Windows 11’s update woes is very unfortunate. It’s led to months of bad headlines for Microsoft, and that’s going to shake the confidence of anyone thinking of upgrading. And, because Windows 10 is now 10 years old, it’s a far more stable operating system than Windows 11, which again could put people off moving from Windows 10 to 11. So, how can Microsoft fix this? It won’t be easy, but making sure every update is thoroughly tested by its employees, as well as its legions of Windows Insiders, who are users who signed up to help test early versions of software. This would mean lengthening the time each update takes to come out, but that’s not a bad thing (outside of critical security fixes). It’s better to have fewer, more stable, updates, than rush out an update that breaks people’s PCs and frustrates people. Having fewer prompts to restart my PC and install an update would also be very welcome. One of the most obnoxious things about Windows 11, and likely a big reason why people are hesitant to upgrade, is because Microsoft is increasingly adding adverts to the operating system, with banners and icons appearing in places like the Start menu and within certain windows. It’s pretty annoying, and feels a touch desperate when it’s yet another advert begging you to sign up to OneDrive or PC Games Pass. The company has alsobeen blasted for including adverts for its games likeAvowed, and it all makes Windows 11 feel a little cheap. It also makes your own PC feel less like you actually own it. Dropping these ads would be incredibly welcome, and would boost Windows 11’s reputation. This is probably very unlikely that Microsoft would entertain this idea, as it really wants to get people to pay for more of its products and services, and ads in Windows 11 seem to be the way the company wants to do this, but that doesn’t stop it from annoying its users. So, if cutting the ads in Windows 11 is a non-starter, how about making the adverts less annoying and frustrating? I have an idea… I don’t mind adverts in free things, be it free-to-view TV shows or websites, but putting them in a product I’ve paid for is a major bugbear for me. So, if Microsoft continues to have adverts in Windows 11, it could at least make Windows 11 free – permanently. This would justify the use of adverts (the company needs to make money, after all), and means those ads were a small price to pay for a free operating system. It would also mean people stopped looking at loopholes and workarounds to get Windows 11 for free. And making upgrading from Windows 10 to Windows 11 as easy, and cheap, as possible could be another big win for getting people to drop the old operating system. It'd also mean Microsoft could keep its beloved ads (it could even offer an ad-free version of Windows 11 for a small fee) as well. Regardless, Microsoft needs to do something fast if it wants people to move from Windows 10 to Windows 11 ahead of October, and what it’s doing at the moment just isn’t cutting it. What Microsoft doesn’t want to happen when Windows 10’s End of Life hits is a load of people who will continue to risk using Windows 10 or – worse – switch to an alternative such asLinux. This is an important time for Windows 11, and Microsoft needs to get it right. But will it? Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

It challenges you to find groups of four items that share something in common, and each group has a different difficulty level: green is easy, yellow a little harder, blue often quite tough and purple usually very difficult. On the plus side, you don't technically need to solve the final one, as you'll be able to answer that one by a process of elimination. What's more, you can make up to four mistakes, which gives you a little bit of breathing room. It's a little more involved than something like Wordle, however, and there are plenty of opportunities for the game to trip you up with tricks.

    "title": "‘It will take time for foldables to become mainstream’: OnePlus defends decision to delay the OnePlus Open 2 and bow out of the foldable phones race in 2025",
    "article_text": "Exclusive: OnePlus elaborates on its surprising strategy shift When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. TheOnePlus Openwas well-received on its release in October 2023 (we described it as “the only foldable phone that doesn't compromise” in ourOnePlus Open review), so it was more than a little disappointing to hear that a much-rumoredOnePlus Open 2 won’t be hitting shelves any time soon. In astatementposted to the OnePlus Community forum in February, OnePlus announced that it had “made the decision not to release a foldable” in 2025, noting that Oppo – OnePlus’ sister company – is now “taking the lead in the foldable segment” with theOppo Find N5(which, incidentally, is still not available outside of China at the time of writing). \"This is not a step back, it’s a recalibration,\" OnePlus explained at the time – but what does that mean, exactly? We asked the company to elaborate on its reasoning during a recent sponsored visit to OnePlus HQ in Guangdong, China. Rudolf Xu, Senior Product Marketing Manager for OnePlus, had this to say: “In the foldable industry, the common challenge for every smartphone maker is [working out] how to make the phone slimmer, lighter, and the crease less visible, while also, at the same time, not sacrificing other key specs when you are trying to solve those challenges,” Xu told TechRadar. “At OnePlus, we want to bring the best possible experience [to the user]. If you look back at the OnePlus Open, even up until today, it still has very competitive specs, honestly. It’s more about a timing situation. We are thinking about how we want to solve those [aforementioned] challenges in a better way. That’s why we decided not to launch a foldable this year.” The OnePlus Open, even up until today, still has very competitive specs. It’s clear, then, that a desire to bring meaningful (i.e. not iterative) innovation to the foldable market lies at the heart of OnePlus’ decision to delay its foldable plans – but there are economic factors at play here, too. Xu explained: “There's also a figure I can share [that will help justify our decision]. If you check the latestCounterpoint research, foldable shipments increased by 2.9% year-over-year in 2024, which was actually lower than expected. The foldable market is increasing, for sure, but it will still take time for foldables to become mainstream and to really, let's say, cross the chasm and become a product for the majority [of people].” Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. In other words, the foldable market simply isn’t yet big enough to make regular product launches economically viable – at least for OnePlus. Samsungcontinues to release book- and flip-style foldables on an annual basis (theGalaxy Z Fold 7andGalaxy Z Flip 7are next on the agenda), but it’s true that the South Korean giant has more resources at its disposal, not to mention a much larger user base. The good news is that the OnePlus Open 2 isn’t just a pipe dream. OnePlus confirmed in its aforementioned statement that it’s not withdrawing from the foldable market entirely – “our decision to pause on foldables for this generation does not signify a departure from the category,” the brand explained. And given that we’re not expecting a new model in 2025, it’s safe to assume that the OnePlus Open 2, when it does eventually arrive, won’t just be a rebadged Oppo Find N5 (though we are huge fans of that particular device). What do you think about OnePlus' decision, and the state of foldable phones in 2025 more generally? Let us know in the comments.

    "title": "'We watched Scooby-Doo': Doctor Who stars reveal how they prepared for the Disney+ show's upcoming Hanna Barbera-like animated episode",
    "article_text": "Exclusive: 'We're serious actors – we do our research!' When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Doctor Who's two main stars have revealed the unusual homework they were assigned to prepare for season 2's next episode. Speaking to TechRadar, Ncuti Gatwa and Varada Sethu discussed the exciting but challenging process of bringing The Doctor and Bel to life in animated form. That's because, if it wasn't clear already, the iconic sci-fi series' next episode will be a live-action-animation hybrid – one that'll see the show's lead duo turned into animated characters. The second episode ofDoctor Whoseason 2, titled 'Lux', will see the intrepid time traveler and his new companion travel to 1950s Miami. Once there, though, they'll discover a local theater is hiding a terrifying secret. That'll be Mister Ring-a-ding, a fully animated villain who, as teased inDoctor Whoseason 2's first trailer, kidnaps humans and turns them into cartoon forms of themselves. Mister Ring-a-ding's appearances in that teaser andDoctor Whoseason 2's official trailerimmediately reminded me of the rubber hose animation style from the US' golden era of cartoons. It's an art form that was primarily used in the 1930s, with companies including Walt Disney Animation Studios, Fleischer Studios, and Walter Lantz Productions imbuing their animated offerings with its surrealist qualities. While that animation form influenced some of the visuals in 'Lux', Gatwa and Sethu told me that the style used to bring their character to life actually takes its inspiration from another celebrated animation studio in Hanna-Barbera. With the legendary Time Lord and Bel being transformed into cartoon versions of themselves in theDisney+show's next entry, they were set some curious homework by showrunner Russell T. Davies before they filmed this season's second installment. \"It was so much fun!\" Gatwa enthusiastically replied. \"It [filming 'Lux'] was a highlight of shooting this season. \"In the script, each animation style had been noted down for us to see, so we knew the style of animation that was going to be used on our characters. It was like a Hanna-Barbera type of cartoon, so we spent our mornings watchingScooby-Doo. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. \"We're serious actors – we do our research!\" he continued with a laugh. \"But, we needed that to get in the right headspace to act out those scenes. We filmed them in-person, so we had to figure out all of our animated form's movements ahead of time. How does a cartoon think? What does it move like?

    "title": "Some of Siri's delayed Apple Intelligence features are tipped to arrive with iOS 19",
    "article_text": "App interactions could show up When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Applehas got itself into quite the tangle with Siri and Apple Intelligence, with promised AI upgrades nowofficially delayedand the company takingplenty of criticismfor it – but at least some of these delayed features could make an appearance later this year. In aNew York Timesarticle recapping some of Apple's recent AI woes,including internal frictionover future plans, there's a mention that Siri would get certain upgrades \"in the fall\" in the US – so probably September time, with theiPhone 17andiOS 19. \"Apple hasn’t canceled its revamped Siri,\" the article states. \"The company plans to release a virtual assistant in the fall capable of doing things like editing and sending a photo to a friend on request, three people with knowledge of its plans said.\" That's not a whole lot to go off – are we just getting some extra photo editing capabilities, or the full suite of delayed features? Ultimately, Apple wants to get Siri on a par withChatGPTor Gemini, but that may not happen in 2025. The photo editing feature mentioned in the NYT article is one of the Apple Intelligence upgradespromised back in 2024: the ability for Siri to dig deeper into iPhone apps and take actions on behalf of users via voice commands (known as App Intents). That's just part of the picture though. Apple has also said Siri will get much smarter interms of context, understanding more about what's happening on your iPhone and more about you (by tapping into some of your personal data, in a private and secure way). Once Siri gets those features, it'll be better able to compete with its AIchatbotrivals. Just this week, for example,ChatGPT added a memory upgradethat means it can tap into your full conversation history for answers, if needed. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Apple Intelligence features already added to Siri include support for more natural language in conversations, and improved tech help support for your devices.

    "title": "Reacher season 4: everything we know so far about the hit Prime Video show’s return",
    "article_text": "Reacher season 4 will begin filming in mid-2025 When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. - Renewed in October 2024- Filming reportedly starting in mid-2025- No release date revealed yet- Reacher returns for another adaptation of Lee Child's novels- Main cast predicted to return- Speculation around plot and which book it will follow- No official trailer yet- Neagley spin-off officially commenced filming in February Reacherseason 4 is on the way. With season 3 done and dusted, it's time to really start talking aboutseason 4, which was officially renewedback in October 2024. Prime Video, one of thebest streaming services, proudly revealed thatReacherseason 3 has become Prime Video’s biggest returning show, thanks to 54.6 million viewers globally within the first 19 days. So, it's certainly one of thebest Prime Video showsthat's ready to return for more. Based on the novels by Lee Child, action-packed thriller follows Jack Reacher, an ex-military police officer, who finds himself continuously embroiled in conspiracies and dangerous missions after being wrongly accused of murder. Each season is filled with big fights and mystery-solving, and season 3 was no different. A tumultuous ending hints at much more to come, so here's everything we know aboutReacherseason 4 from a release date and trailer to plot rumors and more. Full spoilers followforReacher season 3and the previous seasons.Potential spoilers forReacherseason 4will also appear. A post shared by Amazon MGM Studios (@amazonmgmstudios) A photo posted by on There’s noReacherseason 4 release date just yet, but we do know that the show was renewed back in October 2024. Speaking toThe Mirrorin February, Child said: “So we’re ready to go on season four. Obviously, we can’t reveal anything yet, but it’s another good’un, I’ll tell you. It’s going to be great.” He added: “I’ll see you next year and we’ll talk about it,” possibly hinting thatReacherseason 4 will premiere in 2026. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. If we take previous seasons as a guide for season 4, season 1 came out in 2022, season 2 ran from 2023 to 2024, and season 3 in 2025. If Prime Video continues releasing annually, it could well be early 2026. WhenChild discussed future seasons ofReacherin an exclusive chat with TechRadar, he revealed filming will commence sooner than you might think: “It’s written and it’s ready to go. It’s going to start shooting in the summer.” Given the cast and crew haven’t started filming yet, there’s no trailer to share. Historically, trailers come out a lot nearer to the release of the show. So, for aReacherseason 4 trailer, we imagine a wait until at least late 2025, early 2026. Full spoilers follow forReacherseason 3. Based on theReacherseason 3finale, this is the cast we predict will return forReacherseason 4. Though, at time of writing, these characters are yet to be confirmed. Aside from Reacher himself: Full spoilers follow forReacherseasons 1-3. Plus, potential spoilers forReacherseason 4. Jack Reacher is a man on a mission, or several missions if you take all seasons so far into consideration. He’s been repeatedly ensnared in conspiracies that put a lot of lives at risk, including his own. From false murder accusations to going deep undercover to retrieve a lost DEA agent, following Lee Child's novels has given plenty of plot for the show to follow along with. And season 3 saw Reacher’s feud with villains (new and old), Xavier Quinn and Zachary Beck, come to a head. The finale episode, titled ‘Unfinished Business’, saw Reacher's team break down a crime syndicate, run by Beck, by infiltrating his base. But, in order to do so, he had to come up against Beck'stowering bodyguard, Paulie. And that led to an almighty brawl placing brains against brawn. At the end of it all, he sat down with Neagley and talked about the real reason Reacher gets embroiled in so much trouble, because he hates the \"big guy\". For season 4's plot then, the best place to turn is to the books. Season 1 was adapted fromKilling Floor, Child’s debut novel, season 2 fromBad Luck and Trouble,his 11th novel, and season 3 fromPersuader, his 7th novel. So, they're not going in book order, but they're certainly going from the books. While there’s been speculation aroundPersonal, book 19, being the basis of season 4 given how the flashbacks inPersuaderand in season 3 line up with the plot, there's been no confirmation. Speaking toThe Independentthough, Child revealed book 22 is one he’d love to adapt: “It was well received butThe Midnight Lineis one of my favourites because it was an opioid book, but it was written from the point of view of the addict with tremendous sympathy.” Adding: “I wonder if it will ever get made. We have to see whether we ever choose that one, but I’d love to see how it comes out.” And Child supports that the show can jump around the book order, saying he: “very deliberately wrote the book series so you did not have any prior knowledge. I wanted people to be able to pick up any title anywhere and have a really satisfying story, so we can take the same approach.” Which directionReacherseason 4 decides to go in is entirely down to Lee Child and showrunner Nick Santora, so we’ll have to wait and see. Reacherseasons 1 to 3 can be streamed exclusively on Prime Video. Finished them all and eager for more? Check out these6 muscular thrillers to watch while you wait. A post shared by Maria Sten (@mariasten) A photo posted by on It's incredibly likely.Reacherseason 4 was greenlit months before season 3 came out, and we wouldn't be surprised to hear about season 5 in a similar way. And, of course, there's all the books that Lee Child has written of the Jack Reacher series — currently totalling 29. But, it's not justReacherthat'll be on the scene. In October 2024, Prime Video announced a spin-off series, focused on Frances Neagley, a recurring character in theReacherseries. And in February, the show officially went into production with Maria Sten pictured holding the clapperboard for episode one. While we wait to hear news on more seasons ofReacher, we'll keep an ear to the ground and update you when we can.

    "title": "ICYMI: the week's 7 biggest tech stories from tariff-based iPhone panic buying to Samsung One UI 7 update taking its times",
    "article_text": "Here's your firmware update for April 12, 2025 When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. This week has been a wild ride with US tariff fears causing price hikes and panic-buying, but we've also been treated to some escapism from our existing dystopian to explore a series of new ones thansk to the release of Black Mirror Seaosn 7. To catch up on all this and more scroll down for recaps of the week's seven biggest news stories. When you're done be sure to check out our picks for theseven new movies and TV shows to watch this weekend (April 11). It’s been hard to avoid tariff talk this week, even if you’re just looking for gadget news. The economic dance spooked iPhone buyers into panic-buying phones, according toAppleStore employees across the US – and that was before the tariffs on China went into the stratosphere. With iPhones still mostly made in China, the theory is that Apple’s smartphones could see hefty price rises later this year. While that’s certainly possible, predicting what’s going to happen next week is hard enough right now, let alone five months in advance. So while we understand some people pulling the trigger now, it’s also no time to be stockpiling expensive tech – particularly with the iPhone 17 now on the horizon. OlderSamsungphones are finally starting to unlock Android 15 features via the One UI 7 update that’s rolling out – but some of you might be left waiting until June before you see any changes. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. That’s according to Samsung itself, who explained on their Korean site that while theSamsung Galaxy S24series,Galaxy Z Fold 6, Z Flip 6, and phones going back to the Galaxy S23 series devices would get the latest update this month, those of you relying on older, more budget-friendly phones and tablets like the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE, Galaxy A53, Galaxy Tab A9, and others will be waiting until June. Considering we’re expecting to see Android 16 atGoogleI/O 2025 in May, that means Android will have lapped Samsung’s software update before its Android 15 port can land on all of its devices. This week, Nothing teased that on April 28, 2025, at 9 am ET / 2 pm BST / 11 pm AEST, it’ll showcase the CMF Phone 2 Pro alongside the new CMF Buds 2, Buds 2a, and Buds 2 Plus. There are two strange things about this reveal, though. For one, Nothing has yet again skipped the base model – like we just saw withthe Phone 3a and 3a Probeing released before even announcing the regular Phone 3. Here, the CMF Phone 2 Pro is coming out before the CMF Phone 2 or CMF Phone 1 Pro. Also, Nothing didn’t tease a new CMF Watch. The CMF Watch Pro 2 was showcased alongside its phone and earbuds last year, and while it wasn’t the perfect smartwatch, it was an excellent budget pick. Hopefully, a new CMF Watch will make an appearance later this year. Sam Altman teased an exciting new feature forChatGPT, and while that made it clear this wasn't going to be the debut of a new model – though that's still expected soon—it did end up being meaningful – at least,OpenAIthinks it is. ChatGPT has received an improved memory function that will let the AI assistant andchatbotbetter reference previous conversations and remember things about you. This means it'll go beyond just what you like and dislike, but if you discuss things, it can also bring previous points or elements into the current flow. Of course, not everyone might be on board with this memory function, so it is opt-in. OpenAI's other fix is a temporary mode, which ensures the AI doesn't add the information contained in the history. This week, we finally tested the Samsung Galaxy Watch FE, and it’s the most confusing smartwatch we’ve tested – especially since the much better Galaxy Watch 6 still exists. TheSamsungGalaxy Watch FE is meant to be Samsung's answer to theApple WatchSE. Yet Samsung has failed to emulate its rival, and the result left us “bewildered.” Whether it's sluggish performance, poor battery life, or a disappointing design, unless you pick this smartwatch up for literally $100/£100, you might as well opt for a discountedGalaxy Watch 6orGalaxy Watch 7. Black Mirror season 7 has landed on Netflix just in time for a weekend binge-watch. But is it any good, and is the show’s first-ever sequel worth your time? We’ve ranked the newest episodes from worst to best, giving some pretty honest thoughts about what we made of this installment. There are highs, lows, and big surprises, too, and we’ve predicted this season will seriously divide fans as it’s something of a mixed bag – though that’s perhaps to be expected from an anthology series. All six episodes of Black Mirror season 7 are streaming on Netflix now, along with all the previous seasons. Check out our streaming coverage for even more from the much-loved anthology show. The Pico 4 Ultra might not be thebest VR headsetout there, but one way it trounces the Meta Quest 3 is its motion trackers, which have allowed it to bring accurate and easy foot tracking to supported VR games. Now, Pico has launched a new version you can wear around your waist to create a more full-body setup that sounds perfect for VR dancing. Best of all, it only costs £39.99 (around $50 / AU$85). We haven’t been able to test the tracker for ourselves, but given how impressive the foot trackers were during ourPico 4 Ultra review, we expect Pico’s new waist trackers will be solid, too, when used in supported titles such as VRChat and compatible PCVR titles through the Pico Connect feature.

    "title": "Adding Google Gemini to Samsung's Ballie AI robot sounds impressive, but I'm not sure it matters",
    "article_text": "Why not just put a smartphone with the app open on a skateboard? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I’ve watched enough robot videos online to know that slapping an AI model into a hunk of hardware doesn’t automatically make it useful. I remember one clip in particular where someone had wiredChatGPTinto a robot dog, and the results were mixed. Sure, the robot could suddenly answer your questions with confidence. But asking it to open a door or pick something up was still the same clumsy creature as before. The intelligence was in the voice, not the motion. So, whenSamsungannounced that its long-awaited Ballie robot would come preloaded withGoogle’s Gemini AI, my first thought was to wonder what exactly Gemini brings to the table that Ballie hadn’t already promised. Gemini is capable of understanding language and images and performing complex reasoning. Ballie is supposed to be a rolling companion packed with cameras, projectors, sensors, and the ability to navigate your home. I can see why some might be eager to see what a combination of the two could do. Samsung and Google have suggested that Ballie plus Gemini would enable the robot to suggest activities to raise your energy or give you outfit tips using its onboard camera and a Gemini-powered sense of style. But looking at it more, I'm not really sure anything the companies describe is either already something Ballie would be able to do or something Gemini can already do without needing to be connected to Ballie. Ballie can adjust smart home devices and project videos or ambient lighting onto your walls, but does it need Gemini to do so? Gemini can answer questions, analyze photos and fashion, and organize your whole day, but does being embedded in a ball-shaped robot enhance those features much? You may as well open Gemini on a tablet and tape it to a skateboard. Gemini gives Ballie better language understanding and smarter suggestions, but those don’t require a robot body that can roll across your living room. Ballie is an impressive piece of hardware. It has dual projectors, depth sensors, LiDAR, multiple microphones, and a high-end camera setup. It can follow you, return to its charger, and even record or stream footage. But all of those things were innate to the hardware. Gemini doesn’t make Ballie project in higher resolution or roll faster. It doesn’t give Ballie arms or the ability to interact physically with objects. It just gives it better words – and while words matter, they don’t necessarily translate into a robot that’s more useful. AI can make achatbotsmarter and mimic your tone or finish your sentences in an email. But when it comes to hardware, intelligence without capability hits a wall. If Ballie can’t do more things because it has Gemini, then it's just a more articulate version of itself. If Gemini brings a lot of useful features to Ballie that it wouldn't have had before but that Gemini couldn't do on its own, then that's a different question. It's not that Gemini brings nothing to the table. Talking to Ballie about your schedule and getting a visual summary projected on the wall is a pleasing idea. And Gemini’s ability to integrate multi-modal inputs could make those interactions smarter. But again, the robot’s physical role in that process is still fuzzy. There’s a reason people still get excited by videos of robots folding laundry or climbing stairs. It’s because movement and manipulating the environment are still rare and impressive feats. No matter how smart the AI becomes, if the hardware can’t meet it halfway, the result will always feel like a demo missing its payoff. Making more conversational, more responsive, and more human in its communication is a leap for Samsung. But that leap is only meaningful if the robot itself can deliver something you couldn’t already get from a screen. Otherwise, you may as well open Gemini in a browser tab on a tablet, duct-tape it to a Roomba, and call it a day. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

    "article_text": "The White House has put a dramatic painting of US President Donald Trump on display in a prominent spot in the Grand Foyer of the East Wing, replacing the official portrait of former President Barack Obama. The new artwork depicts Trump with blood on his face and the American flag in the background, capturing the moment he raised a clenched fist after surviving the July 2024 assassination attempt during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The dramatic scene, showing Secret Service agents rushing to shield Trump as he gestures defiantly, became a defining image of his re-election campaign, echoing his call to“fight, fight, fight.” “Some new artwork at the White House 👀,”the administration posted on Friday via its official X account, sharing a short video of the painting. Some new artwork at the White House 👀pic.twitter.com/l6u5u7k82T The portrait, based on a photograph by New York Times photographer Doug Mills, was created by artist Marc Lipp and donated by school safety advocate Andrew Pollack, whose daughter Meadow was killed in the 2018 Parkland school shooting. Some critics noted that the spot in the Grand Foyer is traditionally reserved for portraits of recent presidents. However, they acknowledged that Trump, being a former president himself, is not breaking with any official protocol. Obama remains in the Entrance Hall of the White House State Floor.pic.twitter.com/lOLv7371Cd Although Obama’s portrait was moved to make way for the new painting, it remains on public display in another prominent location overlooking a Steinway grand piano once played by Franklin D. Roosevelt, White House spokesperson Harrison Fields clarified. “Obama remains in the Entrance Hall of the White House State Floor,”Fields wrote on X. That location was previously occupied by George W. Bush’s portrait, which has now reportedly been moved to the staircase area.",

    "title": "Trump extends Russia sanctions for 12 months",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump has prolonged US sanctions on Russia for another year, based on the supposition that Moscow still poses a serious threat to the country’s national security. Washington placed punitive restrictions on Russia after it absorbed Crimea following a referendum held in 2014, and later over Moscow’s alleged meddling in American elections. The sanctions were drastically expanded following the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022. The latest extension approved by Trump and dated April 10, 2025, has been posted to the Federal Register’s website, announcing the“Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Specified Harmful Foreign Activities of the Government of the Russian Federation.” It refers primarily to Executive Order 14024 signed by former President Joe Biden in April 2021 in response to an“unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and the economy of the United States”presumed to be posed by Russia. Among the“harmful”activities ascribed to Russia in the document are“efforts to undermine the conduct of free and fair democratic elections and democratic institutions in the United States and its allies and partners.” Some of Moscow’s other alleged transgressions are attempts to“undermine security in countries and regions important to United States national security; and to violate well-established principles of international law, including respect for the territorial integrity of states.” Late last month, the US president lamented that there was still“a lot of ill will between”Ukraine and Russia. Trump has also threatened to impose new sanctions on Moscow if he deems Russia responsible for any failure in ceasefire talks on the Ukraine conflict. Commenting on Trump’s threat, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said last week that“our dialogue with the American side is ongoing,”and that Moscow remains open to resolving the Ukraine conflict diplomatically. In mid-March, the US president proposed a pause on strikes against energy infrastructure, which was publicly supported by both Moscow and Kiev. Russia has accused Ukraine of breaching the ceasefire, but has reiterated its aim to uphold the partial truce in order to build relations with the US.",

    "title": "Split among ‘coalition of the willing’ on Ukraine – EU top diplomat",
    "article_text": "There is currently no agreement within the“coalition of the willing”regarding a potential joint troop deployment to Ukraine, EU top diplomat Kaja Kallas has stated. Early last month, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron said they were ready to lead a coalition of European countries to support Kiev with ground forces and aircraft, if and when Ukraine and Russia achieve a ceasefire. The proposal followed the launch of bilateral peace talks between Moscow and Washington, from which both the EU and the UK were conspicuously left out. Speaking to reporters on Friday, Kallas, the EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, said that the“different member states have different opinions and the discussions are still ongoing,”as quoted by The Telegraph. When pressed as to whether the group’s meeting in Brussels on Thursday provided some clarity to the coalition’s plans, Kallas responded in the negative. In contrast to her comments, UK Secretary of Defense John Healey told the gathering that“our planning is real and substantial. Our plans are well developed.” Meanwhile, AFP cited unnamed European officials as saying later that day that thus far, only six nations, including the UK, France, and the Baltic states – Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania – have pledged to contribute troops. The sixth country was not named. Other potential coalition members have publicly expressed concerns about such a deployment and refused to make any commitment yet. Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans said the group must have the US on board – a scenario already ruled out by Washington. “What is the mandate? What would we do in the different scenarios, for example, if there would be any escalation regarding Russia?”he asked. “It’s helpful if there’s a clarity of what that mission would entail, and what do we do,”Swedish Defense Minister Pal Jonson similarly stated. Late last month, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni ruled out Rome committing troops to any force deployed in Ukraine. Moscow has repeatedly warned the West against sending ground forces to Ukraine under any pretext, specifically objecting to troops from NATO countries appearing in the country. Last month, former Russian president and the deputy chair of Russia’s Security Council, Dmitry Medvedev, said that such a development would mean a war between the bloc and Russia.",

    "article_text": "The countries that deem US tariffs on their goods to be too high can just stop doing business with America altogether, President Donald Trump has suggested. He further insisted that his latest trade policies have made the US“strong,”bringing“billions of dollars a day”into its coffers. On Wednesday, the US president slapped stiffer“reciprocal”tariffs on nearly 90 nations, only to announce a 90-day pause and a“substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%,”in a post on his Truth Social platform several hours later. The pause however does not apply to China, with which the US has engaged in a tit-for-tat exchange of ever-higher tariffs, with most of Beijing’s imports now subject to a 145% duty. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday, Trump proclaimed that“ultimately, we pretty much can do what we want to do.” “We can set the tariff, and they can choose not to deal with us, or they can choose to pay it,”he explained, asserting that“if they think it’s too high, they don’t have to do business with us.” Trump insisted that the tariffs he has introduced are“appropriate,”arguing that“there could be a couple of exceptions for obvious reasons, but I would say 10 percent is a floor.” Trump also brushed off concerns over stock market turmoil in response to his trade policies. ”The bond market’s going good. It had a little moment but I solved that problem very quickly. I’m very good at that stuff,” the president claimed. When asked whether he feared that the sweeping tariffs could adversely affect the dollar’s global standing, Trump replied that it will“always”remain the“currency of choice.” As for nations striving to wean themselves off of the US currency,“I would tell you that within about one phone call they would be back on the dollar,”the president asserted. Speaking at a National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) dinner on Tuesday night, Trump said that dozens of countries“are calling us up, kissing my ass”to negotiate a way out of stiffer tariffs. Trump’s recent moves sent shockwaves across US stock markets, which bled trillions of dollars in a matter of several days. However, his decision to backpedal tariffs on most countries to a“baseline”10% saw markets rebound shortly thereafter.",

    "title": "US wants control of key gas pipeline in Ukraine — Reuters",
    "article_text": "The administration of US President Donald Trump wants Kiev to give Washington control of a pipeline through which Russian gas reaches the EU, according to Reuters. The request is one of the“Easter eggs”contained in the latest draft of the minerals deal that Washington is pressuring the government of Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky to sign, the agency claimed in an article on Friday. Reuters said, citing an informed source, that the text of the agreement put together by Washington includes a“demand that the US government’s International Development Finance Corporation take control of a natural gas pipeline from Russian energy giant Gazprom across Ukraine to Europe.” No gas has been sent through Gazprom’s pipeline since the start of year due to Ukraine refusing to prolong its transit deal with the Russian company. On Friday, US and Ukrainian officials met in Washington to discuss the deal granting the Americans access to Ukraine’s mineral resources, including rare-earth metals, with the talks going on in a“very antagonistic”environment, according to the source. The strains between the sides stemmed from“maximalist”demands in the latest draft of the agreement, which the Trump administration presented to Kiev last month, the agency’s interlocutor explained. The Ukrainian authorities have hired a US-British law firm, Hogan Lovells, to work as an outside adviser on the deal, the source added. The US came up with harsher terms after Zelensky refused to sign the initial agreement during his White House meeting in late February. The visit ended with a public spat between the US and Ukrainian leaders, during which Trump accused his guest of being ungrateful for Washington’s assistance during the conflict with Russia and not wanting peace. According to Reuters, the latest draft of the deal would give the US privileged access to Ukraine’s mineral deposits and require Kiev to place in a joint investment fund all income from the exploitation of its natural resources. The agreement does not provide the country with American security guarantees, which the Ukrainian government considers a priority. Trump, who claims that the agreement would enable the US taxpayers to recoup funds spent by the previous administration of Joe Biden on aiding Kiev, warned earlier this month that Zelensky would have“big, big problems”if he backs out of it.",

    "title": "‘Not good for China’ to retaliate over tariffs – White House",
    "article_text": "The White House has warned China that further retaliation through tariff hikes would not serve Beijing’s interests, as the world’s two largest economies clash over trade. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt has stated that over 75 countries reached out to US President Donald Trump’s administration to initiate trade talks, a sign that Washington’s tariff policy is working, she argued. “The phones have been ringing off the hook to make deals,”she said on Friday during a press briefing at the White House.“These countries wisely heeded President Trump’s warning not to retaliate… and were rewarded with a 90-day pause and substantially lower reciprocal tariff rates,”she added. In early April, Trump imposed a universal 10% tariff on all imports and higher“reciprocal”tariffs on select countries to promote domestic manufacturing and address trade imbalances. While most elevated tariffs were paused for 90 days, China was excluded from this reprieve. The total tariff on Chinese goods has been hiked to 145%. In response, China imposed a 125% tariff on US imports, while criticizing Washington’s actions as“economic bullying”and warning that continued escalations would render the US a“joke”in global economic history. When asked directly about China, Leavitt reiterated Trump’s stance.“The tariff rate on China remains where it was yesterday at the 145 percent level,”she confirmed. Beijing has signaled that its recent tariff hike might be the last, and that further increases would not make economic sense. When asked if this meant China was backing down, Leavitt said the US president had made it very clear that“when the United States is punched, he will punch back harder.” Leavitt said the administration remains open to negotiations, claiming Trump would“be gracious if China intends to make a deal with the United States,”but added without elaborating,“If China continues to retaliate, it’s not good for China.” She also rebuffed critics who said the US administration had not pushed China hard enough with tariffs, saying“Trump is finally taking bold and courageous action.”She added that both Democrats and Republicans have talked tough on China for years, but“no other president had the courage, the work ethic, or the stamina to take on such a task.”",

    "title": "Here’s why the AfD is destined for the German government",
    "article_text": "Germany has an undeserved reputation for dour rationality and lacking an appreciation of the absurd. In reality, however, Germany is a – for want of nicer terms – very counterintuitive country. If you are running a regime in Kiev (at least according to the official story) and blow up Germany’s vital energy infrastructure, Germans will say thank you and throw money and arms at you, while also helping you blame someone else (the Russians, of course: Germany has never been an imaginative country). If you are in Washington and certainly had a hand in blowing up that infrastructure, and then go on to fleece the Germans by selling LNG at a high cost and promoting their deindustrialization by filching their companies, good Germans get very, very angry – at China. If you happen to be the single most popular and perfectly legal political party in Germany, get ready to never be allowed to actually participate in governing. Because Germany is also a countryin which that single most popular party – the Alternative for Germany (Alternative für Deutschland, commonly known simply as AfD)– is locked out of building governing coalitions. By definition. That system is called a“firewall”– against that nasty most popular party that makes life so difficult for all those other, no longer popular parties. It has absolutelynobasis in the constitution or in law. Come to think of it, as the“firewall”systematically and deliberately treats the votes of AfD voters as somehow less effective than those of others, it may well be the“firewall”itself that is unconstitutional, at least in spirit if not even by the letter of the law. So much for Germany, the country that allegedly loves order and rules. In reality, the“firewall”amounts to a dirty political cartel and a form of disenfranchisement: The traditional parties, feeling threatened by the insurgent AfD have simply decided that they do not care what the voters say and won’t have anything to do with it. Since German governments are virtually always based on coalitions, which means that the AfD and its voters are treated as inferior. That this means that, as of now, in particular voters in the former East Germany are subject to this kind of discrimination, adding a West-East aspect to it that sits very badly with talk about German unity. To get one thing out of the way: For now, it is only one poll that shows the AfD in the lead;other polls still have it in (barely) second placeafter the mainstream conservatives of the CDU/CSU bloc (which, in reality, functions as one party) of soon-to-be chancellor Friedrich Merz. But these differences are irrelevant. What matters is that the AfD’s rising trend is unbroken. That is definitely ablowto Merz, even before he has officially assumed office, as international observers are noting. Especially in view of the fact thatMerz’s own poll numbers are crateringat the same time. Yet there is a broader point, too: The whole“firewall”strategy is malfunctioning extremely badly. Sensible observers have long predicted it, and now it is becoming ever more obvious: Freezing the AfD out only serves to make it stronger. One thing that does not make Berlin’s ruling parties, the CDU and SPD, any more popular is that they have concluded their negotiations on how to divvy up the spoils of ministries and other goodies. Indeed, it is extremely embarrassing for the new governing coalition of conservatives and Social-Democrats (SPD)that the most recent AfD milestone breakthrough is happening now. It is a coincidence from hell: there they are, the traditional parties, seemingly safe behind their“firewall”and all ready to go, and the voters – uncouth as they can be – show them just how unpopular they are. Germans expect little from them, even now: Afresh pollshows that two thirds do not believe that things will change under the new coalition of tired old parties. Note that most Germans have been deeply unhappy with the status quo, as we also know from recent polls: In February, Ipsos found that the general mood was“as bad as never before.”Only 17 percent of citizens – less than a fifth – believed their country was“on a good trajectory.”The other 83 percent were not indifferent or neutral but felt Germany was on the“wrong”trajectory. Even for a nation with something of a culture ofangstand doom, those are atrocious figures. Hence, expecting no change now amounts to deep pessimism: Germans have felt for a while already that they are in dire trouble; and a preponderant majority thinks that that is where they will be stuck under new old management as well. A senior AfD leader, Alexander Gauland, is already more than confident:“It’s a natural law that we’ll be ahead of the CDU at the next elections,”he recently declared. That may be jinxing it. The AfD is, after all, muchlessunlike other parties than the latter like to pretend: The AfD as well may end up squandering its current good luck with infighting, for instance, overhow to react to US President Donald Trump’s tariff attacks, which will severely harm Germany. Yet there is no doubt that the traditional parties are doing their utmost to repel not only voters but even their own members. In particular Merz’s CDUis in barely contained rebellion: its members and voters are fuming at having voted conservative and yet being saddled with a massive deficit spending program. The pretext that all of this is needed because of – drum roll – Big Bad Russia is not dampening down the anger. One local CDU organization has already rebelled openly. In the state of Sachsen-Anhalt, formerly part of East Germany, CDU members from the Harz district have gone public with an official resolutionmaking two pointsand one demand: There is“massive”unrest among the CDU’s base of ordinary party members, and in Germany’s“East,”that is, what used to be the former German Democratic Republic, the CDU has decisively lost the last federal elections. The demand is to tear down the so-called“firewall”against the AfD and start collaborating with it systematically. It is symptomatic that this very local rebellion is making news all over the country. “What a scandal! Opening the gates to the far right!”many will scream. Yet they have it all upside down: Disregarding the fact that, in reality, the CDU/CSU conservatives and the AfD mostly see eye-to-eye ideologically, one day, in the not so far away future, the AfD may well enter and perhaps even dominate a German government. The irony is that when that happens, those who have upheld the, frankly, moronic“firewall”will have only themselves to blame. Because the real question is notifthe AfD will enter government in Berlin but how and, in particular, how strong. The longer the“firewall”is kept up, the more likely the AfD will not just participate but dominate.",

    "title": "‘Europe’ should be built around Ukraine – PM",
    "article_text": "Ukraine is the central point around which a new geometry of Europe is being built, Kiev’s Prime Minister Denis Shmigal has said. During his speech at the EU-Ukraine Business Summit in Brussels on Thursday, Shmigal tried to persuade the bloc to speed up the process of making his country a full member. “Today, Ukraine is not just a country at war,”he said, referring to the conflict with Russia. “It is the central point around which the new geometry of Europe is being built.” “We are not a buffer zone. We are not a gray zone. We are a new opportunity for Europe to rediscover its identity,”the PM added. Speaking about the global tariff war which was recently unleashed by US President Donald Trump, Shmigal urged the EU to“recognize the new reality,”in which“free trade no longer guarantees security. Energy is no longer apolitical, and supply chains are no longer neutral.” He called upon Western European businesses to invest in Ukraine’s natural resources and stressed a vast potential for cooperation in such areas as the restoration and use of gas storage facilities, renewable energy, agriculture and IT. Ukraine could become“an industrial heart of Europe,”which would provide for the EU’s rearmament and defense autonomy, the prime minister claimed. Kiev was granted EU candidate status in 2022, a few months after the escalation with Moscow, in which the bloc fully backed Ukraine. However, Brussels has never set a definitive timeline for the country’s accession. In order to join the bloc, the EU has demanded that Ukraine implement a comprehensive set of governance reforms, fight rampant corruption and harmonize its legislation with EU law. Full membership also necessitates the unanimous approval of all EU nations; countries like Hungary are currently skeptical about it. Russia, which is categorically opposed to Ukraine’s membership in NATO, would not object to its EU accession, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in February.“It is the sovereign right of any country. We are talking about integration, economic processes, and here, of course, no one can dictate anything to any country. We are not going to do that,”he explained.",

    "title": "UK deeply involved in Ukraine conflict – The Times",
    "article_text": "Britain’s military leadership has played a far more extensive and covert role in the Ukraine conflict than previously known, not only designing battle plans and supplying intelligence, but also authorizing secret troop deployments inside the country to provide weapons training and technical support, according to a report by The Times. While London’s political and military backing for Kiev has been public since the 2014 Western-backed coup, the extent of its involvement after the escalation in February 2022“remained largely hidden… until now,”the British newspaper wrote on Friday, citing unnamed Ukrainian and British military officers. The Times claimed that British troops were sent into Ukraine in small numbers on several occasions throughout 2022 and 2023, operating discreetly to avoid provoking Russia. In particular, UK forces were deployed to fit Ukrainian aircraft with Storm Shadow long-range cruise missiles and train pilots and ground crews in their use. “UK troops were secretly sent to fit Ukraine’s aircraft with the missiles and teach troops how to use them,”the publication wrote, noting that it“would not be the first time British troops had been deployed on the ground.” The UK had been delivering thousands of NLAW anti-tank missiles to Kiev and sending instructors to train Ukrainian soldiers in their use since 2015. While British troops were pulled out of Ukraine shortly before the escalation in February 2022, the deteriorating battlefield situation and the urgent need for technical expertise saw small teams of UK personnel redeployed quietly alongside fresh supplies of missiles, the newspaper reported. London also reportedly played a key role in helping Ukraine prepare its much-touted 2023“counteroffensive”against Russia – and in mediating between Kiev and Washington when the operation failed to meet US expectations. The newspaper claimed that“behind the scenes,”the Ukrainians referred to Britain’s military chiefs as the“brains”of what they called an“anti-Putin”coalition. Former UK Defense Secretary Ben Wallace was even reportedly nicknamed“the man who saved Kiev”by military officials. “The Americans went to Ukraine only on rare occasions because of concerns that they would be seen to be too involved in the war, unlike Britain’s military chiefs, who were given the freedom to go whenever necessary,”The Times wrote.“Sometimes their visits were so sensitive they went in civilian clothing.” Moscow perceives the Ukraine conflict as a Western-led proxy war against Russia, in which Ukrainians serve as“cannon fodder.”It considers foreigners fighting for Kiev as“mercenaries”acting on behalf of Western governments. Senior Moscow officials have suggested that the more complex weapon systems provided to Kiev are highly likely operated by NATO staff. The presence of current and former NATO troops has also been tacitly admitted, but never openly confirmed, by Western officials. For example, last year, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz revealed the involvement of British and French forces in preparing Ukrainian missile launches, as he explained why Berlin would not supply similar weapons to Kiev. Earlier this month, a New York Times investigation found that the administration of former US President Joe Biden provided Ukraine with support that went far beyond arms shipments – extending to daily battlefield coordination, intelligence sharing, and joint strategy planning, which were described as indispensable to Kiev’s fight against Russia.",

Finn Wolfhard has mixed emotions about his character’s fate in Stranger Things. The actor, 22, who has portrayed Mike Wheeler in the show since the Netflix sci-fi series premiered in July 2016, shared his complex feelings in an exclusive interview with People. He said: “I was so happy with his ending, and I don’t know, I was satisfied, but I was also very confused and sad, but also very happy.\" As the final season of Stranger Things is set to come out later this year, Wolfhard also reflected on what it felt like to finish the series that transformed him from a young actor into a household name. Reflecting on filming his final scene for the series, Wolfhard admitted it didn’t feel real at first. “I just couldn’t believe it at all,” he said. “It didn’t really start to go into focus until the next day. It was like an emotional hangover.” He also recalled how the show’s actors remained together on the last day of filming, saying: “The cast all stayed for the last day, we were all there together. “It was really great to be around each other.” Looking back on the whirlwind success of Stranger Things, Wolfhard explained the overwhelming nature of his success. He added: “I don’t think I’d ever go back and do something over, but maybe I would go back to when the show first came out and blew up, and I would directly put myself into therapy. “But it was so crazy and overnight, that there was not really any time to think about that.” Copyright© Mediacorp 2025.

Taylor Swift's Eras Tour movie director is set to direct the upcoming remake of The Bodyguard. Sam Wrench will helm the new version of the 1992 movie, which starred Whitney Houston as singer Rachel Marron and Kevin Costner as her bodyguard and love interest, Frank Farmer. Jonathan Abrams, who wrote Clint Eastwood's Juror #2 is writing the script. Matthew Lopez wrote a previous version of the screenplay. Warner Bros. Entertainment chairperson Mike De Luca and CEO Pam Abdy confirmed the director news in an interview with Deadline. The Bodyguard tells the story of a former Secret Service agent hired to protect a celebrity from her stalker. It became 1992’s second-highest-grossing movie at the worldwide box office and went on to receive two Oscar nominations. No casting announcements have been made for the remake, which has been in various stages of development since 2011. Meanwhile, De Luca and Abdy admitted that making movies has become more challenging in recent years. Abdy told Deadline: \"I don’t think the pressure to picking movies and deciding what movies to make and the movie-making process has dramatically changed over the decades that we’ve been doing it. It’s still the same idea of picking right. Sometimes you’re going to pick winners, sometimes you’re not. Sometimes you’re going to pick movies that are critically applauded and then don’t find an audience. I think what’s more difficult in this era is about how do you get audiences to come out of the house and it’s the chemistry and alchemy of all the things coming together at the same time. \"Whether that’s the concept of the movie, the talent that’s directing the film, the dating of the film, what’s going on in the world around it. I think that’s what has become a little more challenging. It lifts the pressure of it all, but I think that makes the job still exciting.\" Copyright© Mediacorp 2025. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

Barcelona extended their advantage in the Spanish top flight with a 1-0 win at Leganes on Saturday, completing a 12-match unbeaten run and moving seven points clear of second-placed Real Madrid. \"We have to focus on recovery, recovery, recovery. That's the way it is. We will arrive in Barcelona tonight, train tomorrow and fly to Dortmund on Monday,\" Flick told reporters. \"We have no excuses - we have to recover, but that's our job,\" he added. Defender Jorge Saenz's own goal was enough to secure victory for the Catalans, and Flick added that a win, however it came, was a win, especially after their packed calendar. \"Three points are three points and every game we fight for 90 minutes, when you see the load the players have had in the last few weeks or days, it's unbelievable. \"After the international break, you see what my players have done, my team's performance has been unbelievable. I'm very proud of them.\" The coach was also quick to praise Inigo Martinez, who made a superb tackle in stoppage time to prevent Munir from scoring when he was already heading for Wojciech Szczesny's net. \"That was also part of the game, to defend well, yes, I celebrated it. It was a perfect game,\" Flick added. Barca, who are unbeaten in 24 games across all competitions, visit Borussia Dortmund in their Champions League quarter-final second leg on Tuesday, having won the first game 4-0.

    "article_text": "Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Women Women Women Women Wellness Wellness Wellness Wellness People Living Living Living Style & Beauty Obsessions Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Travel Dining Women Dining Experiences Travel Trending Living Travel Travel When you go to Seoul, trying out the food and exploring its history are a must. What if you can do both at the same time? From left: Dwaeji gukbap, tteokbokki and mul naengmyeon. (Photos: iStock) This audio is generated by an AI tool. Until recently, I’ve been immune to the charms of South Korea. For years I had obsessed over North Korea’s dynastic totalitarian regime as other Singaporeans traipsed about Gyeongbokgung in hanbok. When I finally caught on to its charms, my induction to Hallyu was relatively painless. All of a sudden, I realised there is an endless supply of K-drama on Netflix, K-grocery stores exist in heartland malls, and a surprising number of my girlfriends are BTS fans. In Seoul for the first time with my spouse, Lotte World was not on the cards even though we were with two young children. Instead, we went to the War Memorial of Korea, sought out restaurants near our Airbnb flat, and explored the National Museum of Contemporary History, opting to get to know Seoul through its food and history. Everything was foreign yet familiar at the same time–the common Confucian values in East Asian culture, pronunciations, and Hanja. I relished the opportunity to try food I had only seen online. Every meal, also foreign yet familiar, was a multi-sensorial experience to connect the dots of expectations with reality. When you are still peckish after dinner – but not quite hungry enough for ramyeon, the siren song of standing-room-only snack food carts outside the subway station exit beckons. A small plate of chewy rice cakes drenched in bright-red sweet-spicy sauce should do the trick, paired with a stick of wavy eomuk (fish cake) or two. Tteokbokki in spicy red sauce is credited to a Ma Bok-rim who first started selling it in the streets of Sindang-dong in eastern Seoul in 1953. Last year, North Korea banned the sale of tteokbokki purportedly because of its South Korean origins. A post shared by Atsuko Hanahana (@atsuko.hanahana) Roadside carts are Korean communal snacking at its best, especially on a cold day as strangers huddle in the relative warmth of a tent, sipping bottomless paper cups of free peppery eomuk soup. Don’t be intimidated as a tourist. It’s self-service for eomuk, point and order for the rest, and you settle your bill just before you go. If you are feeling adventurous, there are soondae (blood sausage) and pig's lungs. My only regret: I wish I’d spoken Korean to swap stories with the street food vendor. A cluster of eateries outsideTapgol Parkwhere old men gather for cheap gukbap or “soup rice”? I’m down. In a country known for its fiercely-competitive food and beverage industry, gukbap might actually be Korea's first fast food and delivery food, inexpensive and widely available since the late Joseon dynasty. Tapgol Park is Seoul’s first modern park recently seen in the second season of Squid Game, but more importantly, it is the birthplace of the March First Movement in 1919, a pivotal series of demonstrations against Japanese colonial rule calling for Korean independence. Don’t miss one of South Korea’s national treasures in the park, the 10-storey marble Wongaksa Pagoda built in 1467. A post shared by 배부른뮤지션 (@full.musician) Hapcheon Dwaejigukbapwas relatively packed even after lunch hour but service was fast. Dwaeji gukbap (pork and rice soup) was born out of the Korean War in Busan when food was scarce and North Korean refugees used pork bones discarded by American soldiers to fashion a simple meal. The nourishing soup, generously garnished with chives and served hot in a ttukbaegi (earthenware pot) makes a good break from all the sweet-spicy Korean dishes. Mix in the rice and season it as you like with saeujeot (salted fermented shrimp), kimchi, and gochujang (red chilli paste). A post shared by goeun (@eleven.twenty_seven) At 7,000 won (S$6.38), this hearty meal is also a lifesaver for the elderly living on the margins of society, collecting cardboard scraps or playing janggi (Korean chess) outside the park – a side of South Korea tourists seldom see. South Korea has the highest elderly poverty rate among Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) member countries, says a 2021 OECD report. Realistically, not many people would get the chance (or want) to visit North Korea. North Korean watchers might head to Panmunjom in the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) separating the two countries, just 50 km away from Seoul, although authorities have disallowed foreigners from joining the Panmunjom tour since 2023 when a US Army soldier crossed into North Korea during a tour. The closest for most people is to get mul naengmyeon (cold noodle soup), Pyongyang style. In the depths of a negative double-digit winter, I craved Pyongyang-style naengmyeon and was glad I was not the only one. It was bustling atPyeongyang Myeonok, among the oldest Pyongyang-style naengmyeon restaurants in Seoul. A post shared by KC (@cathywitch) When I told a Korean friend how the broth tasted mild, he wasn’t surprised. According to him, aficionados appreciated the blandness and would slurp their buckwheat noodles unseasoned. Once hooked, one can't go back to eating other variations of naengmyeon. A post shared by 1mokiss (@1mokiss) Pyeongyang Myeonok is a short walk from Zaha Hadid's futuristic beast Dongdaemun Design Plaza but what you really shouldn’t miss are gems by two of contemporary Korea's most prominent first-generation modern architects along the way: Dr Seo's Women's Clinic, nowArium office building, by Kim Chung-up, the only Korean architect who had worked with Le Corbusier; and Kim Swoo-geun's 1981 Brutalist masterpiece across the road from Pyeongyang Myeonok,Kyungdong Presbyterian Church. As the father of Korean architecture, Kim Swoo-geun is also responsible for Seun Sangga and the Space Group of Korea building which now housesArario Museum in Space(unmissable maze-like contemporary art museum but note no children under 10 years old). Kalguksu (knife-cut noodle soup) wasn’t on my list of food to try in Seoul, maybe because it seemed too much like ban mian. Yet, as we were looking for a lunch spot after visiting Gyeongbokgung that won’t take us too far away from theNational Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art (MMCA) Seoulwhere we were planning to head to after lunch,Hwangsaengga Kalguksuwas the obvious choice. A post shared by 𝗜𝗭𝗨𝗠𝗜 | 𝗛𝗮𝗶𝗿&𝗠𝗮𝗸𝗲𝘂𝗽 𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗶𝘀𝘁 | 📍🇯🇵/🇰🇷 (@izubeee) I was hesitant about going to a touristy restaurant with a Michelin Bib Gourmand. Even for late lunch, there was a queue but it moved quickly and the staff, welcoming and playful with kids. Remarkably, the noodles came in a light, flavourful broth and had the perfect bite. Whole leaves of baechu kimchi one had to snip into more manageable slivers at the table was also delightful. A post shared by 멜로디~(❁´▽`❁) ♬☻☻♫ (@my._.melody88) After lunch, don't leave without checking out chic Korean fragrance brandNon FictionandBaekmidang'scozy hanok-style cafe just down the street. Be sure to grab silky smooth soft serve ice cream and window seats before heading to the MMCA for a few free exhibitions. It’s well worth your time to observe the meticulous design of the museum complex, seamlessly incorporating Joseon structures, a Japanese colonial era army building that eventually housed the Defense Security Command, and contemporary architecture. After my first bowl of jjajangmyeon in a crowded food court at the National Museum of Korea, I’ve learnt that one does not need to look too hard for delicious jjajangmyeon. Like chicken rice, you are more likely to be disappointed going to Instagram-famous restaurants. The Chinese form the largest group of foreigners in South Korea today, with migratory waves from the late 19th century. Jjajangmyeon, as we know it, is a Chinese-style Korean noodle dish, adapted from zhajiangmian, a specialty of Shandong province where many early Chinese migrants hailed from. A post shared by Mike C (@holidaywithmike) Enthusiasts can take a side trip to theJjajangmyeon Museumin Incheon’s Chinatown. The museum is located in the building which once housed Gonghwachun, the restaurant credited with inventing the noodles. Jjajangmyeon became cheaper and more widely available after the Korean War when the South Korean government started promoting the consumption of wheat flour-based food like noodles during a rice shortage after receiving surplus wheat flour from the US as food aid. I stumbled uponSsingpuafter going to the mogyoktang, one of the many no-frills public baths that are fast disappearing in Seoul.This one I goto isn’t much to write home about unlike trendy sprawling jjimjilbang but the homely vibe, shuffling grandmas, and seshin (Korean body scrub) more than made up for it. The eatery was empty save for a few lone diners but I had an inkling it would be good when I heard the frantic wok clanging and it was – chewy wheat noodles coated in a savoury-sweet black bean sauce thickened to just the right consistency. Jjajangmyeon doesn't need to be exquisite, it just has to be satisfying in the way only unfussy food for the masses can be. Think Cha Eun-woo's viral jjajangmyeon-eating scene in the K-drama Wonderful World. Walk off your meal with a stroll alongSeongbukcheon, right outside the restaurant. Lesser known than Cheonggyecheon and thus attracting fewer tourists, it is another prime example of Seoul's urban revitalisation, transforming streams into accessible green corridors. The﻿lady boss gestured to me to scoop more ground chopi (Japanese prickly ash) into my chueotang (loach soup) and so I did. We were inOlbareun Sikdang, a small mom-and-pop eatery in a sleepy residential neighbourhood after a hike at Inwangsan. Of all the Korean soups people usually rave about, chueotang is a name that seldom comes up, not even among locals. A local delicacy that is stuck in the middle, not as extreme as ganjang gejang (soy-marinated raw crabs) or hongeo-hoe (fermented skate) but also not a crowd-pleaser like samgyeopsal (grilled pork belly). A post shared by BulletDance (@crazy4beat) A thick soup of ground or sieved boiled fish, it is an invigorating soup that is nutritious and energy-boosting, especially in the summer, perfect for the elderly or those who feel exhausted. In Joseon-period Seoul, licensed panhandlers were the only ones who could sell chueotang. In Seoul-style chueotang, or chutang, the fish is served whole in the soup because in the past, customers wanted to be sure loach was used. Seoul's third oldest restaurantYonggeumokhas been selling chueotang since 1932, a rare feat through the Japanese occupation and the Korean War. North Korean Prime Minister Yon Hyong-muk dined at Yonggeumok for two consecutive days when he visited Seoul in 1990 for inter-Korean talks. A post shared by Sangmin Lee (@lesmin76) At Olbareun Sikdang, the chueotang was earthy but not fishy, the ideal post-hike pick-me-up. I'd highly recommend theInwangsan hike. You don't even have to travel out of the city for this baby hike. It's manageable in under two hours, comes with views–and a small shrine that is one of Seoul's most important Shamanic sites. We were lucky enough to overhear a ritual in progress atGuksadangas we walked past! For history buffs interested in Korea's patriotic past,Seodaemun Prison History Hallis nearby. The prison was in use from 1908 to 1987, first by the Japanese colonial government to imprison Korean independence activists and later bypostwarauthoritarian regimes to repress democracy activists. I admit I have a strange relationship with mukbang (eating broadcast). I usually can’t stand the sound of people chewing loudly yet I can't stop watching mukbang. It has taught me about the delectable holy trinity of beef offal–gopchang (beef small intestines), makchang (beef reed tripe), and daechang (beef large intestines). I'd imagined I would enjoy juicy, fatty daechang the most, paired with crunchy chives. AtDaesung Gopchang, the servers put on quite a show of grilling the offal. I soon learnt that it is best enjoyed with sips of smooth soju. A post shared by 대승곱창 (@daeseung.official) If you have time to spare, explore Yeonnam-dong, a vibrant neighbourhood popular with college students before heading to the restaurant. Walk aimlessly or head to places likeCoffee Nap RoastersandGyeongui Line Forest Park, built along an old railway track. Independent bookstoreYour-Mindis further out but boasts an interesting curation of art books and zines even for those of us who don't read Korean. While offal might not be for everyone, what is undeniable is long before the West's obsession with nose-to-tail eating, offal has pervaded Korean cuisine as a valuable source of nutrients, showcasing resourcefulness in times of scarcity and openness to textures and flavours. Speaking of gopchang, there is a retro dive bar near Hongik University named after gopchang hot pot and where Freddie’s dance scene in 2022 bittersweet film Return To Seoul was filmed at. Gopchang Jeongolhas an extensive vinyl collection of Korean rock and pop music from the 60s to the 90s but the bast part has to be its local clientele, strangers and friends alike, who would sing and dance without inhibitions, bringing infectious energy to everyone into the small hours.

    "title": "We can’t stop checking our phones while watching TV or movies – and it’s affecting the quality of shows",
    "article_text": "Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Women Women Women Women Wellness Wellness Wellness Wellness People Living Living Living Style & Beauty Obsessions Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Travel Dining Women Dining Experiences Travel Trending Living Entertainment Entertainment It's no longer just about short attention spans. Our problematic smartphone habit might be changing the TV and movies being made to (re)capture our attention. Feel the urge to check your phone mid-movie? You're definitely not alone. (Photo: iStock/LanaStock) This audio is generated by an AI tool. In March, I was drawn back into a highly addictive relationship: I reactivated my Netflix account after two years. I’d previously cancelled my subscription after noticing the increase in vanilla programming, akin toartificial intelligence slop. Each TV series or movie featured characters whose flat inner world resulted in scripts with less depth than office pantry conversation. I fell for every well-cropped thumbnail and intriguing synopsis, only to be disappointed when I was unable to sustain more than 15 minutes of interest in a show that the algorithm suggested I’d enjoy before picking up my phone. But I decided to give the streaming service another shot for the viral British crime dramaAdolescence. The four-part series, which has been hailed for its realistic performances and one-take filming style, follows the fallout surrounding a 13-year-old after he is accused of murdering a female classmate. Adolescence wasn’t the first show I’d seen highlight the effect of online misogynists and the digital “manosphere” on boys and men – yet a miracle happened when I turned it on. I devoured all four episodes in a single sitting. Without checking my phone once. Not for emails or texts. Not to mindlessly scroll social media. Not even to google the plot, look up the actors’ past works or read reviews. This utter absorption shouldn’t be groundbreaking. But it’s rare for me – and apparently, for others too. A post shared by VeryBritishProblems (@verybritishproblemsofficial) In particular, one tongue-in-cheekInstagram postthat challenges users to sit through an entire film or movie, like in the good old days, seems to capture the zeitgeist in five steps. Several users understood the need to put their phones away during the show, but drew the line at the third step. “For the love of god, don’t keep me from looking up actors, box office, details about the production and reviews. That’s straight up inhumane,” one commented. Another opined that they had to know everything related to the movie, “otherwise the world is going to explode” – in response to a user who assumed, misguidedly, that people already did this “normally”. Even my informal straw poll among 36 friends to see if I was, in fact, among the minority revealed I wasn’t. Only 13 of them said they could successfully do the challenge, with one admitting it would be “very tempting” to disobey the steps. The challenge wasn’t just commentary on our fleeting attention spans caused byextensive smartphone and social media use. It was, more specifically, was about our instinctive habit of satisfying our craving for multiple layers of stimulation at once – which has been exacerbated by an online culture of churn that prioritises quantity over quality. The proliferation of short-form videos – many as brief as 15 seconds – on TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and even LinkedIn means we can switch to new content whenever we want, leading to us becoming less patient, a cognitive neuroscientistpreviously told CNA TODAY. At the same time, a professor of consumer neuroscience had noted this behaviour was merely adaptation to the digital age. When digital natives are seemingly rewarded for rapidly switching from one task to another, they become more proficient at distributing attention across different media at once – like being in a cinema and scrolling through TikTok. Experts have noted our capacity to change our brain’s behaviour, amid much hand-wringing over the impact of a decreased attention span on the individual. But with the disappearance of severalbookstoresandcinemas– symbolic of an era of traditional content consumption – and the apparently rare experience of finding a film or TV show worth devoting our full attention nowadays, it feels like we’ve only just begun to scratch the surface of a bigger cultural loss. Perhaps the most obvious casualty is the ability to truly immerse ourselves in a show anymore – and what it means for studios hoping to (re)capture our attention. In a Reddit thread from three years ago asking if anyone was “really struggling” to watch a movie without using their phone, several users said they could – but pointed out that an environment which encouraged total focus was key. “I have a hard time focusing on a movie at home, but I get absorbed in the theatre,” one said. Another echoed: “That immersion is key to enjoying a film, whether it’s a slow burn or a blockbuster. At home, there’s always an urge to pause and get something to eat or check the phone etc.” Ironically, as our ability to focus on a show declines, streaming services like Netflix seem to respond by making content that requires less attention. This involves familiar tropes and broad storytelling that feel primed for surface engagement rather than meaningful impact. (Quirky yet competent protagonist? Check. Dark family secret that threatens to tear apart generational legacy? Check. A plane hijacking? That’ll be the top show in Singapore.) Even titles resemble blunt, SEO-friendly descriptions (The Night Agent, The Stranger, The Perfect Family) engineered for quick reach on a scrolling feed, yet many lack resonance that I may recall a plot but never the show name. Such moves are intentional, suggested American cultural critic Will Talvin in an essay on how Netflix ruined movies. More “pseudo movies” were being made for viewers to run in the background while doing other tasks, “designed to be played but not watched”, Talvin wrote in n+1 magazine in December 2024. “Such slipshod filmmaking works for the streaming model, since audiences at home are often barely paying attention,” he said. “Several screenwriters who’ve worked for the streamer told me a common note from company executives is ‘have this character announce what they’re doing so that viewers who have this programme on in the background can follow along.’” In line with such alleged practices of creating for passive consumption, I’ve also noticed the increasingly common plot device of therapy. It may tackle the taboo around mental health, but more often than not, an onscreen therapist serves to spell out another character’s motivations – as opposed to trusting viewers to infer emotions through subtext. Like immersive TV and movies, reading culture has also taken a hit. While I can read an online article spanning several thousand words in one sitting, I struggle to finish a book despite going through several a day pre-smartphone. Withothers like me, it's little wonder bookstores are a dying business. I’ve even seen apps advertised as “TikTok for books” with a dystopian promise to summarise a novel into its key points – even though any true reader would know such efficiency misses the point of reading. To me, themain conundrumlies in the paradox of accessibility. Streaming services, just like social media, give creators a platform and opportunities to reach anyone. But they also give consumers access to an unprecedented amount of content than we can feasibly consume thoughtfully. The best way to stand out among the influx of programmes fighting for clicks is to engineer content for algorithm visibility and easy consumption, risking formulaic storytelling that maylook sound yet feel soulless. But when we can immediately get something better with another click on another device, there’s little reason to overthink a rise in lacklustre offerings. We can accept that the caricature of the digital native being unable to put away one's phone is just about shorter attention spans and call it a day. But this behaviour seems more like a precursor to a looming cultural loss – one in which the bulk of TV and movies prioritises instant satiation over lasting satisfaction. And this loss, like a show designed to be played in the background, feels increasingly noticeable even if you're not paying attention. Copyright© Mediacorp 2025. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

    "article_text": "Sport Sport Paris 2024 Olympics - Surfing - Men's Round 2 - Heat 3 - Teahupo'o, Tahiti, French Polynesia - July 28, 2024. Jordy Smith of South Africa paddles. Ed Sloane/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo South African veteran Jordy Smith took his first world championship tour victory in eight years at the Surf City El Salvador Pro on Saturday, while Hawaiian powerhouse Gabriela Bryan carved her way to the win in long, overhead waves. The 37-year-old Smith, who joined the tour in 2008, excelled as the waves improved for the final two days of competition and comfortably beat compatriot Matthew McGillivray in an all South African final. He dedicated the win to his wife and to his father, who shapes his surfboards. \"I've always wanted to ride his board in a final and to win on it, and that dream has come true. I love you Dad,\" Smith said after being carried up the rocks at the venue of Punta Roca. Smith got off to a strong start in the final with a 7.33 out of 10 for his first wave and backed it up a 6.93 late in the contest for a two wave total of 14.26 out of 20. McGillivray, who took down the two previous event champions en route to the final, couldn't find the waves he needed in the somewhat inconsistent conditions and ended with a heat score of 9.33. Bryan, a standout throughout the event with her powerful carves, looked in trouble in the final against Australia's Isabella Nichols. Trailing midway through the heat after a series of uncharacteristic falls, Bryan realised she had buckled her board and called for a replacement. The next wave was her best of the final, a 7.83 out of 10 for a series of heavy turns that gave her the lead that she never relinquished. \"I made some really big mistakes but I was like, just give me one wave and I promise I won't mess it up,\" she said after the win. \"I had a little mishap with my board, but my backup was just as good so I had confidence in it. I just can't believe it, so stoked.\" The win lifts Bryan to number two in the world rankings, with Smith jumping to number five. With four events of the 11-stop tour now complete, the surfers head to Australia for three events before the number of competitors is cut by a third. The top five surfers at the end of the regular season will then compete in a one day, winner takes all finals day in Fiji.

    "title": "This young entrepreneur left a stable banking career to build a business selling curtains",
    "article_text": "Experiences Experiences Experiences Experiences Obsessions Obsessions Obsessions Obsessions People People People People Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Remarkable Living People People Ken Lim founded Everyday Curtains six years ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. He reflects on innovating within a traditional industry and the entrepreneurial lessons he has learnt along the way. Ken Lim founded Everyday Curtains in 2019. (Photo: CNA/Kelvin Chia) This audio is generated by an AI tool. Ken Lim, 30, may be the boss of a curtain shop – but he admits that home interiors and decor weren’t always his passion. Like many others, Lim often found himself scrolling through home tour videos online. But one particular video stood out: “The house had an all-pink theme, but the curtains were grey,” he recalled with a grimace. That mismatch stuck with him so much so that when it came to designing his own home, he reminded himself that “everything needs to be cohesive” – even window dressings can make or break the design. Later on, when Lim began his own search for curtains for his home, he noticed a gap in the market. “They were either very expensive and high-end, or very cheap and low quality. At that time, there really wasn’t much of a middle ground,” he recalled. Lim, a former banker, started Everyday Curtains from scratch in 2019. Today, the company is popular for its modern, minimalist curtains and window blinds offered at accessible price points. “We cater to the mid-to-high-end market, focusing on curtains and blinds that offer a more visual appeal. We also have consultants who understand design,” Lim said. As a homeowner himself, Lim understands the important role curtains play – despite often being one of the final touches in the renovation process. “Our customers are usually very tired by the time they come to us as it’s the end stage of their renovation. Which is why we want to give them a good experience and help guide them to make a good decision,” shared Lim. I met with Lim at his experiential showroom – it opened in 2024 – in the east of Singapore. The space hints at Everyday Curtains’ design aesthetic with a neutral colour scheme and natural light filtering in through glass entrance doors. On display is the company’s product range – from pleated and ripple-fold curtains, Venetian blinds, Shangri-La blinds, and more. The designs reflect a modern approach to curtains by emphasising simplicity and clean lines. This appeals to the company’s biggest demographic of clients – young homeowners in their 20s to 40s. Lim calls the company a “pandemic baby” as he started the business during the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, he credits the pandemic for the company’s early success. “During that time, our clients’ budgets started shifting away from travel and shopping. They started putting more money into their homes and became more sensitive towards materials. The level of spending just went higher.” Although many curtain companies choose to fabricate in Malaysia, Lim made the decision to produce his curtains in Singapore due to border travel restrictions. On hindsight, the decision proved to be the right one as it gave him better control over quality. To start the company, Lim invested an initial capital of S$80,000 from his own savings, adding that he does not come from a well-to do family. At first, he balanced running the company with his day job as a banker. Two years into the business, he decided to focus on Everyday Curtains full-time. “I asked myself what I truly wanted to do and I found it more fulfilling to solve a problem,” Lim said on the appeal of entrepreneurship. Still, leaving the stable world of banking was a daunting decision. “In banking, everything is very structured. Your entire career is planned out for you,” the married father of a newborn reflected. “But in entrepreneurship, there are constant crises and problems to solve. There’s no rulebook to follow.” The curtains industry is a long-established one, and Lim admits that getting started was challenging – from sourcing the right suppliers to understanding the intricacies of curtain-making. “The older generation doesn’t readily share their knowledge, so you have to stay humble and ask the right questions,” Lim explained. Over time, however, they came to recognise his sincerity. In a legacy industry, where incumbent players have been around for decades and innovation is often slow, Lim is determined to do things differently – particularly by introducing more environmentally conscious practices. “Depending on their composition, curtains can be difficult to recycle. Polyester, in particular, is especially hard to repurpose,” said Lim. A post shared by Everyday Curtains (@everydaycurtains) Since curtains come in a variety of colours and materials, the company makes it a point to reuse as much excess fabric as possible. Offcuts are repurposed as decorative borders or used to extend curtains that may otherwise be too short. Other times, fabric scraps are upcycled into art pieces. Last year, Everyday Curtains collaborated with local artist Alicia C Kirwan to transform leftover materials into decorative wall hangings. These unique artworks were showcased at the company’s showroom opening and were well-received by customers. They have since completely sold out. As a young entrepreneur, Lim understands the power of social media marketing. On Everyday Curtains’ Instagram account – which has amassed over 41,000 followers – Lim personally appears in videos, showcasing the company’s product range, completed projects, and even answering common questions, including the age-old debate of curtains versus blinds. Through social media, Lim wants to make a lasting impression. “When people buy a house – it may not be today, it could be five years later – they’ll still remember us, and they’ll come back to us,” he said. To improve the speed and efficiency of the production process, the company also recently opened a state-of-the-art manufacturing factory in Singapore that incorporates automation technology into the curtains-making process. “When we first experimented with curtains, we used traditional sewing machines. Now, we want the whole process to be automated to reduce dependency on individual skill levels. It’s impossible to replicate 30 years of sewing experience and without automation, the business cannot scale.” Overseas expansion is on Lim’s mind, and he has identified markets such as Kuala Lumpur, Dubai and the US as potential opportunities. But for now, Lim prefers to focus on strengthening the company’s presence in its home base. “We don’t want to bite off more than we can chew. We will do it step by step,” he quipped. It has been six years since Lim started Everyday Curtains. Having successfully navigated the crucial first five years of building a business, he now finds himself in a position to reflect on the journey and the lessons he has learned as an entrepreneur. What’s one piece of advice he would give to his younger self, just starting out? “Think bigger,” answered Lim. “All business owners start out a bit timid – they don’t dare to think too far ahead. But it’s in those first few years that thinking bigger can make all the difference. If I had a better understanding of how the market would evolve, I’d have gone bigger from the start.” One of the most important lessons Lim has learned is that even as a founder, “you can’t do everything alone.” “You can’t solve all your problems by yourself; you need a strong team to support you. Maybe you can put out fires for two or three years, but you can’t keep doing that for 10 years. You need a strong team, and you need to take care of your staff. That kind of relationship will take you far.” Lim also offers a word of caution to fellow business owners – especially those just starting out – not to be naive about employees leaving the company one day. “Everyone has their own dreams. And the more ambitious a person is, the harder it is to make them stay. That’s a painful part of running a business,” he shared. When asked how he measures success for his company, Lim offers a simple answer. “I’m very happy when customers tell me they bought our curtains and they were happy with them. It’s a small goal, but I’m not a greedy person,” he reflected. Looking ahead to the future, his vision for Everyday Curtains is to build a permanent, lasting presence in Singapore. “We want to continue serving the local market and become the go-to curtain shop – a nice final stop in someone’s renovation journey.” Copyright© Mediacorp 2025.

    "title": "Commentary: What Singapore can do more against rising threat of foreign interference",
    "article_text": "Commentary Commentary Citizens everywhere need deeper understanding and awareness of fast-evolving foreign interference tactics and techniques if they are to resist influence by foreign powers in their voting behaviour, says the Singapore Institute of International Affairs’ Nicholas Fang. A multitude of online threats await political parties, authorities and the voting population as Singapore’s next general election looms. (Illustration: CNA/Clara Ho) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: In the flurry of activity asSingapore gears up for a general election, attention is on political issues, potential candidates and contestation between the various parties. As exciting as local contests might prove, the backdrop for any elections – in Singapore and elsewhere – includes a graver potential threat:Foreign interference. Hopefully, this rising threat is not completely unheard of by most Singaporeans. Singapore’s Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) defines foreign interference as activities conducted by foreign actors, including foreign governments and organisations, that interfere in the politics and policies of a target country to advance the foreign actor's own interests. Singapore’s Elections Department (ELD) warns thatforeign interference is typically done through disinformation; amplifying false or inflammatory narratives via cyber armies, trolls or bots; the use of fake online identities; party or campaign financing; and the cultivation of political entities. While this concept is nothing new in the history of the world, the challenge will be whether Singaporeans recognise it when we see it, given the full range and forms of the threat. It helps to look at examples of countries targeted by interference from foreign sources. Last December, the Romanian Constitutional Court annulled the first round of the country’s presidential election, on grounds of Russian interference. Declassified intelligence documents alleged acoordinated effort to boost a far-right Pro-Russia candidate, through illicit campaign funding and manipulation of TikTok algorithms. The candidate garnered a relative majority of votes. Moldova accused Russia of “illegal and deliberate interference” in its November 2024 presidential election and referendum to inscribe European Union accession as a goal in its constitution. The Russian-friendly candidate was defeated by a slim margin, and Moldova narrowly voted in favour of EU membership. In the lead-up torecent German election, public broadcaster DW gave examples of top candidates being targeted by disinformation efforts, such as false allegations of a mental breakdown and suicide attempt or a corruption scandal. It is somewhat reassuring to note that Singapore has not been hit by overt examples of large-scale foreign interference campaigns. But there is concern that the threat will intensify and spread more widely. Technological evolution and the ubiquitous nature of digital and social media have opened up new fronts in the battle for hearts and minds. Disinformation campaigns leveraging on artificial intelligence and tools such as deepfakes have been the source for instability and disruption in different countries. As the technology evolves, tactics and techniques of bad actors shift in tandem. This creates significant challenges for governments seeking to protect their institutions and societies from malign influence. At the same time, the world is facing increased contestation, with two physical wars persisting in Europe and the Middle East, and a trade war brewing on the back of questionable policy decisions and the use of tariffs by the US. With major powers seemingly on the precipice of outright conflict, globalisation and cooperation seem to be a distant consideration. The environment seems ripe for tactics such as foreign interference to grow in popularity as a means to get an edge over competitors. It would be foolhardy to think that Singapore is and always will be immune to threats of foreign interference. As an open and relatively successful financial and economic hub, with outsized representation and leadership on various international fora, Singapore represents an attractive target for bad actors. A variety of measures has been deployed to address such threats. The Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act, or FICA, was enacted in 2021 and contains countermeasures to prevent, detect and disrupt foreign interference in Singapore's domestic politics. The law was in the news recently whenfour members of one of Singapore's richest families were designated as \"politically significant persons\"for their membership to a China political advisory body. MHA had emphasised that the four individuals had not engaged in any “egregious activity”. As such, their designation can be seen as a pre-emptive move to guard against any potential vulnerabilities to foreign interference. This is the second time MHA has announced its intention to designate individuals under FICA provisions, followingSingaporean businessman Philip Chan Man Ping’s designationin February last year. Also last year, FICA was invoked to block 95 social media accounts linked toself-exiled Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui, the first time that the account restrictions directions under FICA were being deployed. MHA said the directions were issued after the network of accounts was found to have disseminated disinformation, which included allegations that Singapore is \"in the pocket of a foreign actor\", who was \"behind the scenes in the selection of Singapore’s fourth-generation leader”. A law was also passed in October last year to ban deepfakes and other digitally manipulated content of candidates, as part ofonline election advertising. Beyond legislation, MHA had also recently launched an online campaign to raise awareness about what foreign interference can look like, and how technology can be used as tools by bad actors. Legislation and awareness campaigns are important steps. But building a country’s resilience against foreign interference threats requires deeper efforts to be successful in the longer term. For a start, we need to recognise that the nature of foreign interference is broad and constantly evolving with new tactics, techniques and procedures. As such, coming up with a framework and common vocabulary can ensure that different national agencies, international partners and citizens are aware of what exactly we are talking about when referring to such threats. The European External Action Service, or the European Union’s diplomatic service, has pioneered development of the concept of Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (FIMI). FIMI aims to meld two adjacent threats – information operations and foreign interference – into a joint concept that can be tackled holistically. This makes sense given that disinformation is often used in foreign interference operations as an effective tool. Other countries around the world could consider exploring concepts and frameworks such as FIMI in order to establish a common understanding and language that would enable more effective cross-border collaboration to tackle such threat. As countries like Singapore, Canada and Australia gear up to go to the polls this year, citizens will need to arm themselves with the knowledge, information and awareness that will enable them to resist influence by foreign powers in their voting behaviour, and interference in our electoral processes. One thing is clear: The threat of foreign interference represents a clear and present danger that all nations and their citizens need to be cognisant of. We all need to do our part to be ready to counter it. Nicholas Fang is director for security and global affairs at independent think tank, the Singapore Institute of International Affairs.

    "title": "Commentary: How trustworthy is your fitness tracker score?",
    "article_text": "Commentary Commentary The concept of simplifying data like heart rate, sleep and activity into a single daily number has clear appeal – but it’s a lot trickier in practice, says this expert. Millions of people now start their day with a number – a “readiness” score, a “body battery” level or a measure of “strain” – delivered by the wearable device on their wrist or finger. (Photo: iStock) DUBLIN: Millions of people now start their day with a number – a “readiness” score, a “body battery” level or a measure of “strain” – delivered by the wearable device on their wrist or finger. But how much trust should we place in these scores? Composite health scores are increasingly used by digital fitness trackers to offer a single, daily number that reflects how your body is coping with recent demands. Whether it’s marketed as a measure of energy, recovery or resilience, the idea is the same: Combine several internal signals into one clear indicator of how prepared you are to take on the day. The concept has clear appeal. It simplifies complex physiological data – things like heart rate, sleep and activity – into an actionable recommendation: Push harder, take it easy, rest. But how solid is the science behind these scores? My colleagues and I recently conducted a systematic review of the most widely used composite health scores in wearable devices to find out. First, what goes into these scores? Typically, quite a lot – at least on paper. Most composite health scores pull data from several biometric signals – measurements from your body that indicate how it’s functioning. These include resting heart rate, heart rate variability (the variation in time between heartbeats), sleep quantity and quality, recent physical activity, and sometimes breathing rate, skin temperature and blood oxygen levels. On paper, that’s a rich dataset. These signals reflect how your body responds to stress, recovers overnight and balances exertion with rest. But while the inputs may be rooted in physiology, the final score can be less informative than it appears. One issue is sensor accuracy. These devices rely on optical sensors and motion tracking to estimate what’s going on inside your body, such as your sleep stages or daily stress levels. Even small inaccuracies in measuring heart rate or movement can distort the score. And since these metrics feed directly into the algorithm that calculates your \"readiness” or “strain”, small errors can add up. Another challenge is transparency. Most companies don’t disclose how exactly they turn raw data into a final score. We don’t know which inputs matter most, how they’re combined or whether they’re adjusted for individual differences such as age or fitness level. Without that clarity, it’s difficult to evaluate how meaningful or personalised the number really is. A more subtle issue lies in the way certain physiological signals overlap. For instance, poor sleep is often followed by lower heart rate variability – a common sign of stress or incomplete recovery. But many health scores penalise you for both factors separately: once for the bad sleep and again for the resulting change in heart rate variability. This kind of double-dipping can exaggerate the effect of a single “stressor” (things that put pressure on your body or mind), making your body seem more run down than it truly is. It creates the illusion of a sophisticated analysis, but may actually be highlighting the same signal twice. Similarly, some scores penalise you for the activity you did yesterday, regardless of how well you’ve recovered from it. If your heart rate variability and resting heart rate suggest you’ve bounced back, that should be reflected in your score. But some algorithms still factor in recent exertion as a negative, even when your body is clearly coping well. To make these scores more personalised, many devices compare your daily data to your typical values – your baseline. If your sleep or recovery looks significantly different from your recent average, the score adjusts accordingly. That’s a sensible idea in theory. But there’s no standard for how these baselines are calculated. Some devices use seven days of data, others 28. Some exclude outliers; others include them. Each company defines it differently, which makes comparisons between devices impossible and raises questions about consistency. Not at all. Fitness trackers can still offer valuable insights. Watching how your core physiological signals shift over time – from week to week or season to season – can help you spot patterns, improve habits and better understand your body’s response to stress and training. The problem is when we treat the daily score as a definitive measure of health. It’s not a diagnosis, and it doesn’t always reflect what’s really happening inside your body. So while it’s fine to glance at your readiness or recovery score, don’t let it dictate your decisions. Use your fitness tracker as a guide, but not as your coach, your doctor, or your judge.

    "title": "Israel expanding Gaza offensive, seizes key corridor",
    "article_text": "World World IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari speaks at the entrance to a tunnel leading to Egypt amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas in the Gaza Strip, in the Philadelphi Corridor area in southern Gaza, Sep 13, 2024. (Photo: REUTERS/Amir Cohen) GAZA CITY: Israel said Saturday (Apr 12) it planned to expand its military offensive in Gaza after seizing a new corridor as part ofa broader effort to take large parts of the war-battered Palestinian territory. It also told tens of thousands of residents of Khan Yunis and surrounding areas in southern Gaza to evacuate and launched strikes after projectiles were fired from there. \"Soon, IDF operations will intensify and expand to other areas throughout most of Gaza, and you will need to evacuate the combat zones,\" Defence Minister Israel Katz said in a statement addressing Gazans. \"The IDF (military) has now completed its takeover of the Morag axis, which crosses Gaza between Rafah and Khan Yunis, turning the entire area between the Philadelphi Route (along the border with Egypt) and Morag into part of the Israeli security zone,\" Katz said. \"Now is the time to rise up, remove Hamas, and release all the Israeli hostages, this is the only way to end the war.\" Katz said the military was also taking over several areas in northern Gaza and the \"security zone is being expanded, including in the Netzarim Corridor\". His announcement came as a Hamas official told AFP the group expected \"real progress\" towards a ceasefire deal to end the war, ahead of talks with Egyptian mediators in Cairo. Since a ceasefire collapsed in mid-March, Israel's renewed offensive has displaced hundreds of thousands of people. Israeli officials say the ongoing assault aims to pressure Hamas into freeing its remaining 58 hostages. Hamas said the offensive not only \"kills defenceless civilians but also makes the fate of the occupation's prisoners (hostages) uncertain\". On Saturday Hamas released a video showing Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander criticising Israel's government for failing to secure his release. The soldier was abducted by Palestinian militants during their Oct 7, 2023 attack on Israel. In Tel Aviv, hundreds of Israelis gathered to mark the Passover festival and called for the release of hostages. \"Passover has so many meanings, but I think freedom is the most important one, and that's one thing we are missing for the second year already,\" said protester Oren Baron. \"So, we are not really celebrating until we are free, until our hostages are free, and until us as a nation are free.\" Israel ordered Saturday's Khan Younis evacuation after it intercepted four projectiles fired from Gaza, three from the territory's south. \"IDF troops are operating with significant force in the area, and will strike with intensity on any location from which rockets are launched,\" the military posted on X. The United Nations warned Friday that expanding evacuation orders were resulting in the \"forcible transfer\" of people into ever-shrinking areas, raising \"real concern as to the future viability of Palestinians as a group in Gaza\". Ahead of a meeting between Hamas and Egyptian and Qatari mediators later Saturday, a Hamas official familiar with the ceasefire negotiations said the group hoped the meeting \"will achieve real progress towards reaching an agreement to end the war\". Speaking on condition of anonymity, he said Hamas has not yet received any new ceasefire proposals, despite Israeli media reports suggesting Israel and Egypt had exchanged draft documents outlining a potential ceasefire and hostage release agreement. Hamas later confirmed its delegation had departed for Cairo. \"We in the Hamas movement affirm our positive engagement with any proposals that ensure a permanent ceasefire, the complete withdrawal of occupation forces, an end to the suffering of our Palestinian people, and the achievement of a serious prisoner exchange deal,\" it said. The Times of Israel reported that Egypt's proposal would involve the release of eight living hostages and eight bodies in exchange for a truce lasting between 40 and 70 days and a substantial release of Palestinian prisoners. Since Israel resumed its Gaza strikes, more than 1,500 people have been killed, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory to which Israel cut off aid more than a month ago. The UN said that in dozens of these strikes \"only women and children\" were killed. The Gaza war broke out after Hamas's October 2023 attack on Israel which resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures. Gaza's health ministry said Saturday at least 1,563 Palestinians had been killed since March 18 when the ceasefire collapsed, taking the overall death toll since the war began to 50,933.

    "title": "UK government to take control of British Steel under emergency law",
    "article_text": "World World Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer speaks during a visit to meet British Steel workers in Appleby Village Hall near Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, Apr 12, 2025. (Photo: Pool Photo via AP/Peter Byrne) LONDON: The UK government said it was taking control of Chinese-owned British Steel on Saturday (Apr 12) after rushing an emergency law through parliament to avert the shutdown of the country's last factory that can make steel from scratch. The struggling plant in northern England had faced imminent closure andPrime Minister Keir Starmersaid his government \"stepped in to save British Steel\" with legislation to prevent its blast furnaces going out. At a rare weekend session, parliament approved the law without opposition to take over the running of the Scunthorpe site, which employs several thousand people and produces steel crucial for UK industries including construction and rail transport. The government saw its possible closure as a risk to Britain's long-term economic security, given the decline of the UK's once robust steel industry. Officials were poised to take over the site after the emergency bill passed into law on Saturday evening, according to UK media reports. Following its approval Starmer said his administration was \"turning the page on a decade of decline\" and \"acting to protect the jobs of thousands of workers.\" He insisted \"all options are on the table to secure the future of the industry,\" after a government minister indicated nationalisation could be a likely next step. Earlier, as MPs debated in parliament, the prime minister made a dash to the region where he told steelworkers gathered in a nearby village hall that the measure was \"in the national interest\". He said the \"pretty unprecedented\" move meant the government could secure \"a future for steel\" in Britain. \"The most important thing is we've got control of the site, we can make the decisions about what happens, and that means that those blast furnaces will stay on,\" he said. It came after protests at the plant and reports that workers had stopped executives from the company's Chinese owners Jingye accessing key areas of the steelworks on Saturday morning. The Times newspaper said British Steel workers had seen off a \"delegation of Chinese executives\" trying to enter critical parts of the works. Police said officers attended the scene \"following a suspected breach of the peace\", but no arrests were made. Facing questions about nationalisation in parliament, business and trade secretary Jonathan Reynolds said state ownership \"remains on the table\" and may be the \"likely option\". But he said the scope of Saturday's legislation was more limited, it \"does not transfer ownership to the government\", he explained, saying this would have to be dealt with at a later stage. Ministers have said no private company has been willing to invest in the plant. The Chinese owners have said it is no longer financially viable to run the two furnaces at the site, where up to 2,700 jobs have been at risk. Jingye bought British Steel in 2020 and says it has invested more than £1.2 billion (US$1.5 billion) to maintain operations but is losing around £700,000 ($916,000) a day. Reynolds said \"the effective market value of this company is zero,\" and that Jingye had wanted to maintain the operation in the UK but supply it with slab steel from China to keep it going. The Labour government came under fire from the opposition Conservative party for its handling of the negotiations and faced calls from some left-wing politicians to fully nationalise the plant, while unions also urged the government to go further. Reynolds explained the government had sought to buy raw materials to keep the furnaces running with \"no losses whatsoever for Jingye\", but met with resistance. Instead Jingye demanded the UK \"transfer hundreds of millions of pounds to them, without any conditions to stop that money and potentially other assets being immediately transferred to China\", he said. \"They also refused a condition to keep the blast furnaces maintained.\" Saturday's legislation allowed for criminal sanctions and gave the government powers to take over assets if executives fail to comply with instructions to keep the blast furnaces open. MPs had left for their Easter holidays on Tuesday and had not been due to return to parliament until April 22 when the rare session was called. MPs last sat on a Saturday recall of parliament at the start of the Falklands War between Britain and Argentina in 1982. Scunthorpe in northern England hosts Britain's last virgin steel plant, which produces steel from raw rather than recycled materials, after Indian firm Tata's Port Talbot site shuttered its blast furnace last year. British Steel has said US President Donald Trump's recent tariffs on the sector were partly to blame for the Scunthorpe plant's difficulties. However, fierce competition from cheaper Asian steel has heaped pressure on Europe's beleaguered industry in recent years. British Steel has its roots as far back as the Industrial Revolution but took shape in 1967 when the Labour government nationalised the industry, which at the time employed nearly 270,000 people.

    "article_text": "Sport Sport LEGANES, Spain :Barcelona extended their lead at the top of the table to seven points with a hard-fought 1-0 win away to stubborn Leganes thanks to an own goal by defender Jorge Saenz on Saturday that took their unbeaten LaLiga run to 12 matches. Hansi Flick's side moved to 70 points above second-placed Real Madrid, who have 63 and visit Alaves on Sunday. \"For us today was a very difficult game but winning was very important. I am proud of what my team is doing in the last few weeks and months,\" Barca boss Flick said. \"We need to work on our defence and attack. But we've got three points and that's what's important,\" he added. In a tense first half, the hosts could have taken the lead when Dani Raba's pass found Adria Altimira in the box, but Barclona goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny was on hand to deny him. Barca also threatened when Jules Kounde beat Saenz to the ball before firing wide. The deadlock was finally broken after the break when Barca took the lead after Raphinha's cross for Robert Lewandowski was inadvertently deflected into the net by Leganes defender Saenz. Lewandowski, chasing his 100th goal for the Catalans, later saw his header from another Raphinha's centre go wide before he was replaced by Ferran Torres after 67 minutes. The hosts looked to have levelled when Dani Raba headed home Adria Altimira's cross but the goal was disallowed for offside. Barcelona had a few more attempts, the clearest coming when Lamine Yamal combined with Torres but the former was unable to capitalise. Leganes were desperate to get back into the game but the closest they came was a long-range effort from Diego Garcia that missed the target. The relegation-threatened side remain second from bottom on 28 points, two points off the safety zone. Barca, who are unbeaten in 24 games across all competitions, visit Borussia Dortmund in their Champions League quarter-final second leg on Tuesday having won the first game 4-0.

    "article_text": "Sport Sport Juventus netted first-half goals through Teun Koopmeiners and Kenan Yildiz for a 2-1 home win over relegation-threatened Lecce in Serie A on Saturday to leave new coach Igor Tudor unbeaten. Koopmeiners gave Juve the lead after two minutes and Yildiz capitalised on brilliant team play to double the advantage after the half-hour mark before Lecce pulled a goal back late on through Federico Baschirotto's powerful header. Juventus moved provisionally up to third on 59 points from 32 games. They are one point above fourth-placed Atalanta, who host Bologna, who are fifth with 57 points, on Sunday. Juve, who were held to a 1-1 draw at AS Roma last weekend, beat Genoa 1-0 before that in their first game under Tudor. The hosts were fully in control in the opening half on Saturday, creating 18 chances with five on target. Koopmeiners set the tone with his early opener, scoring with a low strike inside the far post after Dusan Vlahovic released the Dutchman into the box with a neat pass. Vlahovic and Renato Veiga had chances blocked in quick succession as Juve stormed Lecce's goal before Yildiz made it 2-0 in the 33rd minute with an effort into the bottom corner. The 19-year-old's goal was also set up by Vlahovic. The Serbia striker had an excellent opportunity to make it 3-0 after the break but Lecce goalkeeper Wladimiro Falcone beat him to the ball before the forward could shoot from close range. Juve took their foot off the gas after that and Lecce made it a nervy ending at the Allianz Stadium when Baschirotto nodded home in the 87th minute following a free kick. Lecce, who extended their winless run to nine games, have 26 points and are two points above the relegation zone. Their last victory was a 3-1 success away to Parma at the end of January.

    "article_text": "This week, Slovenian phenomenonLuka Dončićreturned to Dallas to play his former team, the Mavericks. Clearly, there were mixed feelings going into the game: Dressed like a mourner—or a stealth assassin, depending on your POV—in all black, Dončić grew visibly emotional when his old team played him a tribute video during the pre-game warmup. The night finished with Dončić torching his former team and started on the right foot with an equally fire watch. The now-Laker wore an Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Perpetual Calendar Openworked, an appropriately blacked-out watch for his monochromatic getup. Since being traded to LA in a shocking trade in February, Dončić has been all Audemars Piguet.

But there’s something special about an AP-madeperpetual calendar, and there’s something doubly special about a skeletonized version housed in the Royal Oak case. Dončić’s ref. Ref. 26585CE.OO.1225CE.01 doesn’t boast the latest generation of the brand’s QP movement, theCalibre 7138, which can be adjusted using the crown alone. The Royal Oak Perpetual Calendar Openworked is still a hell of a watch, boasting a sapphire dial with applied pink gold hour indices, luminescent pink gold hands, and four registers displaying the day, date, month, leap year, and moon phase. This is the type of watch that both Bruce WayneandBatman would wear. Perhaps more than any other organization, venue, or event, theNBAis the national proving ground for fresh watch designs. (And vintage ones, as well.) From the players themselves toactors,musicians, and business types, all manner of well-heeled celebs show up in their horological best to be seen (and judged) courtside on their wristwear choices. Dončić is merely the latest in a long line of superstars to embrace the cult of the status-signifying expensive watch. But the proliferation of a complicated perpetual calendar from a family-owned business based in the middle-of-nowhere Switzerland throughout the broader zeitgeist is notable. It feels as if we’re all climbing an interesting horological and cultural mountain together and haven’t reached the peak just yet. (Just askLeBron and his AP-wearing Ken doll!)

Designed in 1917, theTankis perhaps most famous today as the Tank Louis Cartier with a gold case. However, the more recent Must models—which are themselves based upon an entry-level collection from the 1970s—offer fans a more affordable way to cop the Tank look without shelling out five figures.

Funnily enough, the brand still advises using this “seawater recipe” in the care sectionon its website, which goes as follows: “Let your jeans get dirty as long as possible, go swimming in the ocean wearing your jeans, rub them with dry sand and repeat several times. Rinse in fresh (not salt) water and let dry in the sun.” In a cosmic sense, this lore naturally lends itself to the wateryWhite Lotusuniverse. We can only hope that Goggins brought these jeans along with him to the beachside Four Seasons Koh Samui resort in Thailand, because his low-rise selvedge denim could definitely use a soak. Anyways, speaking of 2000s-and-late denim, here’sa funny momentfrom Goggins’s oeuvre: in a 2011 episode of theDanny McBride-led HBO seriesVice Principals, Goggins’s character Lee Russell chastises a couple of students who made fun of his starchy cuffed denim: “Uh, yes, look at my jeans. You wish you could afford them. They’re 7 For All Mankind.”",

    "title": "‘The Pitt’ Season Finale: TV's New Favorite Doctors (Finally) Get a Break",
    "article_text": "Season one ofThe Pittends unexpectedly, yet inevitably. While a few cases still linger, the quiet, meditative first-season finale focuses less on medical drama and more on where its characters have ended up emotionally at the end of a harrowing shift. “9 P.M.” takes its time tying up loose ends while creating new character dynamics. And, fittingly, for the first time all season and therefore in this entire series, we finally see the characters outside of the hospital. In the last hour before going home, Dr. Langdon pleads his case,Dr. Santosreveals a sensitive side, Dr. King gets to watchElfin September, and Whittaker finds a home. But most importantly,Dr. Robbyand Dr. Abbott circle back to a theme that’s been omnipresent throughout the episode and the first season ofThe Pittas a whole:Everyone’s a little fucked up, and also: Men, go to therapy! The finale instantly establishes a reflective tone by eliminating the penultimate episode’s cliffhanger immediately. Dr. Robby berates and pleads with the cops who arrested Dr. McKay for disabling her ankle monitor—and comments on how ridiculous they are to do this amid the aftermath of a mass shooting. When Robby reminds them that McKay saved a brother officer’s life today, they agree to let her go, on the condition that she resolves the broken ankle monitor first thing in the morning. Dr. Robby then convinces Flynn’s dad, whose wife is aggressively anti-science, to approve the spinal tap, through some morbid manipulation—their walk-and-talk ends in the Peds room, which is now the Pitt’s packed-to-capacity makeshift morgue. “We couldn’t save them,” Robby says, as they stand over the bodies, “but we could still save your son.” The dad calls him a “fucking asshole,” but it works: Dr. King performs the spinal tap while the mom takes her daughter to get food. She walks into the room during the procedure, horrified—and unsupported in her decision to risk her son’s life because of what she’s read on the internet. Dr. Robby has a brief, completely horrible conversation with Jake, who says, “We’re not friends and you’re not my father, so fuck off!” right before he tells Leah’s parents the news about their daughter. Despite his never-ending hardship on this shift, Dr. Robby has the energy for an inspiring speech to the day shift staff before they head home. “This place will break your heart, but it’s also full of miracles.” He encourages everyone to cry, because it’s grief leaving the body. Dr. Abbott communicated the “Men, go to therapy” message quite literally. This is, essentially, Dr. Abbott’s reveal episode: today was his day off, so he came in on his own volition (I, for one, assumed he simply came in a few hours early for his night shift) and he’s an amputee. After referring a patient to Dr. Shen, Utensil Specialist, Dr. Abbott visits Dr. Robby, who is standing disturbingly close to the roof’s edge, a reversal of Abbott’s first appearance in the pilot. The two old guys talk through it, but it is mostly Abbott talking and Robby asking Dr. Abbott to stop talking. Dr. Robby admits he choked during the MCI. “So fucking what?” Dr. Abbott says. “That’s what happens when you’re in a war and nothing makes sense.” Then, before meeting the staff for park beers, Dr. Abbott—who is coming back to work around 2am—tells Dr. Robby that his therapist says he “finds comfort in darkness.” When Dr. Robby asks if therapy helps, he says, “I haven’t jumped off the roof yet.” These exchanges are fitting bookends for the season, and for these characters, especially Dr. Robby, who not only survived a personally triggering day, but did excellent work despite the internal and external pressure. Despite the ongoing horrors of their day-to-day life, it’s in their DNA, like Dr. Abbott says. Meanwhile, Dr. Langdon spends the hours of 9pm to 10pm trying to right his wrongs. He interrogates Dana in the kitchen (where a calendar on the wall confirms that this season takes place in September) to find out what she knows. He confirms she doesn’t know anything, so he attempts to convince Dr. Robby to…well, simply not report that he was stealing drugs from patients and working while high. Their exchange outside the ER is the most explosive the finale gets, really. Dr. Robby berates him and explains that the best option is inpatient treatment followed by ongoing urine tests and years of mandatory AA meetings. Dr. Langdon, clearly not as skilled in manipulation as his mentor, has the audacity to use ER gossip against Dr. Robby. He says a night nurse saw him in the Peds room, talking to the painted animals on the walls. “This job will fuck you up if you let it. You let it go.” This exchange makes Dr. Robby paranoid that his breakdown has made him incompetent, but thankfully, he has the rooftop exchange with Dr. Abbott to make him feel more confident in his work. The finale gives every character a little moment to wrap up their 15-hour character arcs. Dr. McKay explains what it is like to be a woman in a cheesy (but true) speech to David, the suspected Pitt Fest shooter. This storyline and its resolution felt unsatisfactory to some, since it ultimately ended without a literal bang. But I understand its purpose as a narrative mechanic to keep the audience on its toes for the mass shooter non-reveal. With Dr. Robby’s inaction and Dr. McKay’s action, David’s story highlights the way women experience the world differently from men. Dr. Robby did not see him as a threat because he’s never felt threatened in the same way as Dr. McKay, whose patients this shift have also included a victim of trafficking. David’s struggle with mental health also allowed Dr. Robby to reflect on his own mindstate throughout the season. Santos finally displays some bedside manner with her suicidal patient and reveals she had a friend who committed suicide after being groomed by an older man—which also explains why Santos reacted so emotionally to the patient who was allegedly molesting his daughter earlier in the season. Is psych in her future? Perhaps so, but the bedside manner disappears after she catches Whittaker living in the hospital. She offers him the empty room in her apartment, with the condition that he keeps to himself and doesn’t annoy her. Mohan has a surge of energy—a common response to trauma—followed by a meltdown in the blood-covered bathroom. Dana packs up her photos, indicating she was serious about never coming back (although I am begging her to please come back, for my entertainment). Dr. Jahadi gets to socialize with real human beings, including her crush, and drinks her first beer (seriously, don’t tell her mom). And, finally, Dr. King gets to pick up her sister, eat spaghetti, eat pizza,andwatchElfon a Friday night in September. The first season ofThe Pittis genuinely revolutionary television. It manages to split the difference betweenthe familiar beats of 1990s network television dramaand the depth of prestige TV, all while effectively communicating the dire state of healthcare in this country, not to mention the culture’s influence on medicine—as seen in the measles case, David’s case, Doug, the patient who hit Dana, the presence of anti-maskers in the waiting room, and the woman who was pushed onto train tracks in a racially-motivated act of violence. The season finale effectively communicates exactly what the series wants to be: a character study, a cultural reflection, and an education. The finale’s effective, quiet, and subtle setup for the next season reminded me ofMad Men’s season finales, which were often less about plot and more about giving characters space to reflect. If there’s any justice, the next time we see this cast together will be at theEmmys, butThe Pittwill return for real in January 2026, with a season set on the Fourth of July. While we probably won’t get 72 episodes covering every hour of the holiday weekend, Independence Day is traditionally one of the worst times to work in an emergency room (think boating accidents, grilling accidents, eating too many hot dogs, drinking too much, not drinking enough water, fireworks, fireworks up the butt, etc.) I have also been informed that every year over Fourth of July weekend, the city of Pittsburgh is host to one of the world’s largest furry conventions. We have just under 9 months to imagine the possibilities.",

    "title": "The Pitt Season 2 Will Promote Newbie Docs, As Departed Staffer Makes a Return",
    "article_text": "Though viewers are still recovering from Thursday’s season finale oflauded medical dramaThe Pitt, its producers are raring to go for season 2. A January 2026 premiere is already planned for the next run of theNoah Wyle-led HBO series, which depicts a single-day shift at the fictional Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Hospital, each episode breaking down the action hour by hour. Wealready knowthat the second season will be set about 10 months after the first, during one of America’s most dangerous holidays, the Fourth of July. Given the explosive nature of that annual celebration, viewers can expect lots of blown-off extremities and spoiled potato salad shenanigans, one can only assume. (Spoilers for The Pitt’s first season follow, so continue at your own peril.) Noah Wylie on set ofThe Pitt. But what of the show’s four newest doctors, all of whomscrubbed in for their first dayin season one? In a real-life teaching hospital, one might expect them to be cast to the four winds a year later, spread across departments at the Pitt and even elsewhere. And then there’s nurse Dana Evans (Katherine LaNasa), sucker-punched and—based on her photo gathering and resolute look in the show’s final moments—done with the job. Or Frank Langdon (Patrick Ball), the doctor turned drug thief who seemed oddly unrepentant. Is there a way back for that guy? Speakingwith TV Line, series creatorR. Scott Gemmillsays the second season will “pick up on Langdon’s first day back at work,” presumably after he’s completed a drug treatment program. That absence for Langdon also provides an elegant way for the show to explain what’s happened to the characters in the interim, as “with it being Langdon’s first day back, we get to catch up as he catches up with all those people.” That includes the hospital’s newest staffers, who spent day one managinga shocking masscasualty. Dr. Victoria Javadi (Shabana Azeez), Mel King (Taylor Dearden), Dr. Trinity Santos (Isa Briones), and Dennis Whitaker (Gerran Howell) would likely rotate elsewhere, if this were a hospital in the real world. But for the sake of the series, “everyone has been promoted or graduated to the next level,” Gemmill says. “So we’ll see everybody, for the most part, and some people might be working different hours and different shifts, but it’s pretty much the same crew.” But what about LaNasa’s Dana? She seemed pretty serious when she gathered her things at the end of season one. Is she less done with life as an ER nurse than she tearfully claimed to Wyle’s Dr. Robby? Relax, everyone, as Wyle confirms she will return. “Obviously, I can’t get rid of Katherine,” he tells TVLine of actor Katherine LaNasa. Gemmill says the Dana we see in season 2 might be a little bit different. “I think when she comes back, she’s going to have a bit of an attitude adjustment, though,” he says. “She’ll be even less tolerant of bullshit. She’s going to be much more protective of her flock.” With all that said, viewers should still prepare for big changes and even some departures. According to Wyle, a veteran ofERwho knows a thing or two about earth-shaking cast shifts, “One of the things that is tricky when you’re making a very realistic hospital show is that not everybody stays in the hospital forever, you know? So, the longer the show goes, the more we’re going to have to reconcile with the realities of where people would be — not just in terms of their emotional life in the hospital, but where they would be in their matriculation.” But when one doc or nurse steps away, another moves in, Gemmill says. In season 2, “We’re going to introduce a couple of new characters,” he says. “There are always new people coming in and out of the hospital. So that will give us some new dynamics as well.” Karen Read’s Second Murder Trial Is Already a Spectacle Usha Vance’s “Very Lonely, Lonely World” The WatchThat Links the Kennedys to Kim Kardashian—and a Real Housewife Dying for Sex: The True Story of a Cancer Patient TurnedSexual Explorer Tom Hanks Is Supportive of HisDaughter’s Revealing MemoirAbout Her Troubled Childhood AsTwin PeaksTurns 35, theMystery Is Still the Message DidBiden’s AidesCover Up His Mental State—or Was It Group Delusion?

    "title": "White House Ignores Preferred Pronouns and the Journalists Who Use Them",
    "article_text": "The wealthiest man in the world,Elon Musk,celebratedon his social media site X late Friday, writing that the “pronoun bs is finally going away.” “That was silly,” Musk, who heads up the Department of Government Efficiency and has been slashing crucial federal funding for months, wrote after reposting apronoun knock-knockjoke. “Thank god Trump won,” a user named TheDogeGlory replied below Musk’s post, to which he responded with a bullseye emoji. Musk’s post comes days after White House Press SecretaryKaroline Leavittsaidthat administration officials would refrain from responding to inquiries from journalists who include their preferred pronouns in email signatures or bios. “As a matter of policy,” Leavitt wrote in an email from a reporter asking about theclosure of a research observatory, “we do not respond to reporters with pronouns in their bios.” SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk arrives on stage at an America PAC town hall on October 26, 2024 in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. PresidentDonald Trump’s administration, in January,instructedfederal employees to remove any reference to their identifying pronouns from their email signatures and other forms as a part of the broad effort to roll back any and all evidence of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Or, as a Texas state employeefound out, get fired. Leavitt’s admission this week confirms that the press office is following suit. “Any reporter who chooses to put their preferred pronouns in their bio clearly does not care about biological reality or truth and therefore cannot be trusted to write an honest story,” the press secretary, who in just afew short monthssince Trump has taken office hasgained a reputationascombativetoward bothindividual journalistsand legacymediain general, said in a separate statement to other news outlets. Axios alsoconfirmedon Wednesday that officials will continue to skirt these reporters, asking Trump spokesperson Harrison Fields if that was now their official policy. “FACTS!” he replied. AsThe New York Timesreportedthis week, “On at least three recent occasions, senior Trump press aides have refused to engage with reporters’ questions because the journalists listed identifying pronouns in their email signatures.” A spokesperson for theTimessaid, “Evading tough questions certainly runs counter to transparent engagement with free and independent press reporting.” “But,” they continued, “refusing to answer a straightforward request to explain the administration’s policies because of the formatting of an email signature is both a concerning and baffling choice, especially from the highest press office in the U.S. government.” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt speaks during the daily briefing in the Brady Briefing Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on February 25, 2025. In one instance,Matt Berg, a reporter at Crooked Media, the network that runs the “Pod Save America” family of podcasts, decided to experiment with the new administration’s handling of journalists who include their pronouns. Berg doesn’t usually include pronouns in his email signature. But, when he included “he/him” in an email toKatie Miller, a senior adviser at DOGE, he too was met with a response claiming that the use of pronouns is detrimental to science, that it was her policy to refuse to respond to journalists with listed pronouns, and that he was ignoring facts. “I find it baffling that they care more about pronouns than giving journalists accurate information, but here we are,” Berg said in an email to theTimes. The press office has previously been harsh on reporters who do not use the language they prefer. In February, Leavitt and the administration blocked The Associated Press from covering multiple White House events because it refused to change its editorial style from “Gulf of Mexico” to “Gulf of America.” The AP sued Leavitt and two other White House officials on First Amendment grounds and won—though the White House said it would be appealing. Dozens of protesters gather in Times Square near a military recruitment center to show their anger at President Donald Trump's decision to reinstate a ban on transgender individuals from serving in the military on July 26, 2017 in New York City. The White House’s handling of pronouns aligns with the president’s coordinated rollback of protections for transgender and nonbinary Americans and those who support them. Trump has signed several executive orders targeting transgender people. In his first moments in office, the president signed an order declaring that the United States would only recognize two sexes, “male” and “female,” as defined at conception—a move that required government agencies to use an outdated andscientifically inaccurategender binary on documents like passports, visas, and employee records. He also signed others aimed at barringtransgender student athletesfrom playing on girls’ sports teams,restrictingfunding for gender-affirming care for people under 19, andremovingtransgender service members from the military.Multipleof Trump’s orders against transgender people are beingchallengedin the courts. For Musk, this isn’t the first time he’s discussed preferred pronouns on X, formerly Twitter. In 2022, hewrote, “My pronouns are Prosecute/Fauci.” And in June of 2023, on the first day of Pride Month, Musk said he would allow users to intentionally misgender someone without consequence. He alsoclaimedthat he personally would use the pronouns that someone prefers for manners’ sake—something he has repeatedly chosen not to do with hisown daughter.

    "title": "Taylor Swift Eras Tour Director to Lead Remake of The Bodyguard",
    "article_text": "IsTaylor Swiftpreparing to step into the late Whitney Houston’s lauded, beloved shoes? That’s the question roiling social media today, after news broke thatSam Wrench, the director ofmassively popularconcert filmTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour, has agreed to direct a remake ofThe Bodyguard, a 33-year-old romantic thriller starring Houston as an endangered pop icon andKevin Costneras her titular protector. Warner Bros’ original version of the film, which was released in 1992, marked the film debut for Houston, who by then was one of the best-selling musicians of all time. Originally written byscreenwriterLawrence Kasdanin the 1970s as a vehicle forDiana RossandSteve McQueen, theMick Jackson-directed movie spawned one of the best-selling soundtracks ever and won the Grammy for the album of the year. Singers Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston, and actor Kevin Costner with his then-wife Cindy Costner attend 'The Bodyguard' Hollywood premiere on November 23, 1992 at Mann's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, California. Mike De LucaandPam Abdy, the present day co-chairman/CEOs at Warner Bros Pictures, spilled theBodyguard2.0 beans to Deadline on Friday, sayingin an interviewthat “When we got here, one of the first things we did was look at what is here. What could we identify quickly, IP that could be big movies?” The Bodyguardappeared to be near the top of the list, along with legacy propertyBeetlejuice(henceBeetlejuice Beetlejuice) and Minecraft (A Minecraft Movie, thelong-delayed adaptationof that popular game,is currently breakingbox-office records). Wrench, a director whose resume ispacked with concert films, has been tapped to direct. Its script will come fromJonathan A. Abrams, whose biggest credits are arguably the book for the short-livedHuey Lewis-centric jukebox musicalThe Heart of Rock and Rolland the screenplay for 2024’sJuror #2, the latter of which was his feature screenwriting debut. Taylor Swift performs during The Eras Tour at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California on Monday, Aug. 7, 2023. Casting has yet to be announced for the film, which has yet to set a release date. But as you can imagine, there’s one name on manysocial media users’ lips: Taylor Swift, of course. The speculation makes a certain sort of sense. Though Branch’s body of work is large, his biggest-profile film is 2023’s Swift-ledEras,which remainsthe highest-grossing concert film of all time. Then, just last month,rumors spreadon X (formerly Twitter) that Swift had been exploring a move to film, so the timing of the news feels auspicious. While rumors on X are as reliable as that phone charger you bought at the bodega, she likely has the skills to pull this one off—check out her charming turn in 2010’sValentine’s Dayif you don’t believe me. Then again, maybe Swift’s acting days are behind her, and she’d prefer to direct. Ina 2022 discussionat the Toronto International Film Festival, Swift said, “I’m at a place now where the next baby step is not a baby step. It would be committing to making a film. And I feel like I would just absolutely love for the right opportunity to arise because I just absolutely, absolutely adore telling stories this way.” Karen Read’s Second Murder Trial Is Already a Spectacle Usha Vance’s “Very Lonely, Lonely World” The WatchThat Links the Kennedys to Kim Kardashian—and a Real Housewife Dying for Sex: The True Story of a Cancer Patient TurnedSexual Explorer Tom Hanks Is Supportive of HisDaughter’s Revealing MemoirAbout Her Troubled Childhood AsTwin PeaksTurns 35, theMystery Is Still the Message DidBiden’s AidesCover Up His Mental State—or Was It Group Delusion?

While President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he woulddelay many of the market-shaking tariffsthat he’d announced the previous week, he kept a universal baseline 10% tariff in place, while also increasing tariffs on Chinese goods to 125% (on top of a 20% tariff that he’d already imposed on goods from China). There’s been plenty of speculation aboutwhat the tariffs will mean for the tech industry, which manufactures many consumer electronics in China and elsewhere abroad. One of Trump’s stated goals is to bring manufacturing back to the United States, but others believethe dream of an American-made iPhone is a fantasy. Those debates may be paused after Friday evening, when U.S. Customs and Border Protection posteda list of product categoriesthat are “excluded from the reciprocal tariffs imposed under Executive Order 14257,” with the exclusions backdated to April 5. Those categories appear to include smartphones, laptops, hard drives, and machines that make semiconductors. Those products will all be exempt from both the 125% tariff on goods from China, as well as the universal baseline tariff. (Other tariffs, such as the previous 20% tariff on Chinese goods, would presumably still apply.) Notable Silicon Valley figuresled by Elon Muskhave joined the Trump administration, while other tech CEOs have been courting Trump, most visibly with millions of dollars donated to his inauguration. Those efforts seemed tobear little fruit— until last night’s announcement, which Daniel Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities,describedas “a dream scenario for tech investors.” Tech giants like Apple and Nvidia are likely celebrating the news, as are U.S. consumers who will avoid a big markup on their next iPhone. But the industry could still be hit with more targeted tariffs and other restrictions. For example, The New York Times reports thatthe Trump administration is preparing a national security-related investigationinto semiconductors. And indeed,U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick saidSunday that these products would be included in “the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two.” This post has been updated with Howard Lutnick’s comments about the tariffs.

    "article_text": "Smell the rage. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Apple TV's comedy series about a videogame studio making an MMO has been canceled after four seasons and an expansion pack—the four-episode spin-offSide Quest—as reported byVariety. After spending so long parodying the videogame industry, the show will get a send-off that sounds like the equivalent of a Dota patch. \"Endings are hard. But after four incredible seasons, 'Mythic Quest' is coming to a close,\" executive producers Megan Ganz, David Hornsby, and Rob McElhenney were quoted as saying. \"We're so proud of the show and the world we got to build—and deeply grateful to every cast and crew member who poured their heart into it. To all our fans, thank you for playing with us. To our partners at Apple, thank you for believing in the vision from the very beginning. Because endings are hard, with Apple's blessing we made one final update to our last episode—so we could say goodbye, instead of just game over.\" It's a shame the series has to end here, with a season our local Mythic Quest-enjoy Chris Livingston called\"the best it's been since the first\". Chris summed it up as \"a nimble comedy with a lot of heart, packed with enough gaming references to make nerds smile but not so many that it becomes impenetrable to non-gamers.\" Meanwhile, Netflix is out herecommissioning a second seasonof its unwatchable Devil May Cry anime—a show whose theme song is literally Rollin' by Limp Bizkit. That's not a joke, they deliberately subjected people to the song that makes you wish Run-D.M.C. and Aerosmith put the wall back up after they were done. That show gets to live on while Mythic Quest dies. It's an unjust world is what I'm saying.

    "title": "Never mind, President Trump truths on Truth Social that electronics (including from China) are still subject to tariffs",
    "article_text": "I guess somebody was just feeling silly at Customs and Border Patrol. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. 4/13/25:In a fresh truth on Truth Social (Trump's proprietary Twitter), the American president truthed that there will actually not be an exception to tariffs on electronics and computers. \"The Fake News knows this, but refuses to report it,\" the 45th and 47th president truthed. It's still unclear what was going on with the CBP announcement about the exception. The short of it? The president says that this will lead to a Golden Age of America, while economists and supply chain experts say to get ready for $2,000 iPhones. I can't wait to find out which one comes to pass. Original story:As reported byThe Guardian, The Trump administration has announced, through the United States Customs and Border Patrol, that smartphones, computers, and other electronic devices/components will be exempt from the US's chaotic and destabilizing new tariff regime. That even includes the steepest 125% tariffs on China. I've lost track whether we're doing the tariffs, not doing the tariffs,kind of doing the tariffs, oronly doing the tariffs on China, and Mr. Market seems similarly confused: He's mostly been sad lately, but also had some real pep in his step at other points. We're either headed for The Great Depression 2, or feelin' fine, depending on who you ask and when. The reasoning behind the tariffs similarly depends on who you're talking to. \"Normal\" conservatives will say it's Art of the Deal Madman Theory to prove that the US means business in trade negotiations with the rest of the world. More \"esoteric\" or \"avant-garde\" right wingers say it's in the name of transitioning the US back into a manufacturing economy, a sort of \"reindustrialization\" that has never been implemented in world history. Countries have industrialized, but never transitioned away and then back again, much less the unprecedentedly wealthy consumer economy at the center of the global financial system. Wedbush Securities global head of technology research Dan Ives toldCNBCthat it would cost Apple an estimated $30 billion over the course of three years just to move 10% of its supply chain from Asia to the US with a \"major disruption.\" The Guardianreported earlierhow investment bank UBS estimated this might look on the ground: A 79% increase (about $1,000) in the price of an iPhone 16 Pro Max, as one example. That \"category five price storm,\" in the words of Ives, is likely the primary motivation behind this new, semi truck-sized hole in America's tariff armor, though I'm sure panicked tech CEOs have been lobbying their hearts out to mitigate things as well. We're firmly back in \"only kind of doing the tariffs\" territory, then, but it's unclear how all of this will trickle down to us gamers⁠—won't somebody think of the gamers!US preorders for the Nintendo Switch 2 have been on icepending any tariff-related increase of its $450 MSRP, while I've been sweating how this might impact theRX 9070 XTgraphics card purchase I've been weighing. Buying a GPU was already excruciatingthanks to shortages, scalpers, and manufacturing partners (like MSI or Gigabyte) really stretching the \"suggested\" part of \"Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price.\" In the worst case scenario of the new Trumpenomics, at least a good mid-range card can last you a lot longer than it used to⁠—I could definitely ride out my RTX 3070 another few generations if RX 9070s and 5070s start commanding $2,000 a pop out of nowhere.

    "title": "‘Coalition of the willing’ split on Ukraine – EU’s top diplomat",
    "article_text": "There is currently no agreement within the“coalition of the willing”- a group of Western European nations willing to back Ukraine in more military conflict - regarding a potential joint troop deployment to the country, top EU diplomat Kaja Kallas has stated. Early last month, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron said they were ready to lead a coalition of European countries to support Kiev with ground forces and aircraft, if and when Ukraine and Russia achieve a ceasefire. The proposal followed the launch of bilateral peace talks between Moscow and Washington, from which both the EU and the UK were conspicuously left out. Speaking to reporters on Friday, Kallas, the EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, said that the“different member states have different opinions and the discussions are still ongoing,”as quoted by The Telegraph. When pressed as to whether the group’s meeting in Brussels on Thursday provided some clarity to the coalition’s plans, Kallas responded in the negative. In contrast to her comments, UK Secretary of Defense John Healey told the gathering that“our planning is real and substantial. Our plans are well developed.” Meanwhile, AFP cited unnamed European officials as saying later that day that thus far, only six nations, including the UK, France, and the Baltic states – Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania – have pledged to contribute troops. The sixth country was not named. Other potential coalition members have publicly expressed concerns about such a deployment and refused to make any commitment yet. Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans said the group must have the US on board – a scenario already ruled out by Washington. “What is the mandate? What would we do in the different scenarios, for example, if there would be any escalation regarding Russia?”he asked. “It’s helpful if there’s a clarity of what that mission would entail, and what do we do,”Swedish Defense Minister Pal Jonson similarly stated. Late last month, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni ruled out Rome committing troops to any force deployed in Ukraine. Moscow has repeatedly warned the West against sending ground forces to Ukraine under any pretext, specifically objecting to troops from NATO countries appearing in the country. Last month, former Russian president and the deputy chair of Russia’s Security Council, Dmitry Medvedev, said that such a development would mean a war between the bloc and Russia.",
