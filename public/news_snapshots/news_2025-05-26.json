    "title": "Common daily vitamin could slow biological aging, major study suggests",
    "article_text": "Fox News medical contributor Dr. Nicole Saphier joins ‘Fox & Friends Weekend’ to discuss the new study finding multivitamins do not decrease people’s risk of death. Vitamin D might be doing more than just supporting bone health — it could also help the body age slower, according to a new study led by researchers at Mass General Brigham (MGB) and the Medical College of Georgia. The study, published this month in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, reveals that taking vitamin D supplements may protect againstbiological agingby slowing the shortening of telomeres, the tiny caps on DNA that naturally erode as people grow older. Conducted as part of a nationwide four-year trial, the study tracked over 1,000 U.S. adults (men over 50 and women over 55) and found thatdaily vitamin D3could reduce biological wear and tear, equivalent to nearly three years of aging, according to a press release from MGB. COLORECTAL CANCER RISK REDUCED BY THIS COMMON VITAMIN, STUDY SUGGESTS Participants were randomly assigned to take either a placebo or a daily dose of vitamin D3 (2,000 IU) and omega-3 fatty acids (1 gram). Telomere length in white blood cells was measured at the start of the study, at the two-year mark and after four years. Daily vitamin D3 could reduce biological wear and tear, equivalent to nearly three years of aging, the study found.(iStock) Compared to the placebo group, those taking vitamin D3 had significantly less telomere shortening, the researchers found. In contrast,omega-3 supplements\"had no significant effect on telomere length throughout follow-up,\" the team reported. AGING MAY SPEED UP IN AREAS WITH EXTREME HEAT, RESEARCH SUGGESTS This was the first large-scale, long-term randomized trial to show that vitamin D supplements protect telomeres, according to co-author JoAnn Manson, M.D., the Michael and Lee Bell Professor of Women’s Health at Harvard Medical School. \"This is of particular interest because VITAL (the trial) has also shown benefits of vitamin D in reducing inflammation and lowering risks of selectedchronic diseases of aging, such as advanced cancer and autoimmune disease,\" Manson said in the release. Telomeres are made of repeating sequences of DNA that act like protective tips at the ends of chromosomes, similar to the plastic ends of shoelaces, according to the researchers.(iStock) Telomeres act like protective tips at the ends of chromosomes, similar to the plastic ends of shoelaces, according to the researchers. They \"prevent chromosome ends from degrading or fusing with other chromosomes.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Over time, theseDNA capsshorten, which is a natural part of aging and is linked to a higher risk of age-related diseases. Because of this, scientists view telomere length as a marker of \"biological age,\" which may better reflect a person’shealth statusthan their actual age in years. Participants of the study were randomly assigned to take either a placebo or a daily dose of vitamin D3 and omega-3 fatty acids.(iStock) Earlier phases of the trial showed that vitamin D supplementation could reduce inflammation and lower the risk of certain chronic age-related conditions, such asadvanced cancersand autoimmune diseases, Manson noted. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER While the new telomere findings don’t prove that vitamin D slows aging across the board, researchers say it points to a potentially powerful way to protect the body at thecellular level. The study concluded that vitamin D helps preserve telomeres, which are \"linked to the development of certain diseases\" when they shorten with age.(iStock) \"Our findings suggest that targeted vitamin D supplementation may be a promising strategy to counter the biological aging process, althoughfurther researchis warranted,\" said first author Dr. Haidong Zhu, a molecular geneticist at the Medical College of Georgia, in the release. Previous research suggested vitamin D could reduce inflammation and lower the risk of some age-related diseases. The research team emphasized that more work is needed to determine how vitamin D impacts aging in different populations and whether these effects endure over longer timeframes.

    "title": "Remembering Rep. Charlie Rangel — and a voicemail I'll never forget",
    "article_text": "Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on senators pushing for changes to the House-passed spending bill as it moves to the Senate for debate. I didn’t recognize the \"917\"New Yorknumber that called me. But there was no question about who phoned after they left a message. The caller on the voicemail was utterly unmistakable. They didn’t say their name. They didn’t have to. \"Chad, you’re the only one who missed me,\" croaked the voice. FORMER NY DEMOCRATIC REP CHARLIE RANGEL DEAD AT 94 It carried the sleekness of a stone crusher working over basalt in a West Virginia quarry. The voicemail was from the late Rep. Charlie Rangel, D-N.Y. And he was essentially calling to assure me that he wasn’t dead. After all, I was apparently the only member of the congressional press corps who noticed that the New York Democrat hadn’t voted nor been anywhere near theU.S. Capitolin several weeks. There was no article in Roll Call. Nothing in Politico. No statement from his office. Rangel just wasn’t around. Former Rep. Charlie Rangel, D-N.Y. — a man whose tenure on Capitol Hill I have many fond memories of — died Monday. He was 94.(Andrew Burton/Getty Images) So I called and wound up speaking to his communications director Hannah Kim and chief of staff George Henry. I inquired if Rangel was all right. They assured me he was. But they didn’t quite give me the full story. That was for Rangel to do. And then Rangel himself called — from his sickbed — so I could hear his signature jackhammer-chopping-through-the-asphalt-of-Manhattan voice to prove to this reporter he was still among the living. \"I wanted you to hear it from me,\" said Rangel. EX-REP. CHARLIE RANGEL, 94, QUESTIONS WHETHER BIDEN BELONGS IN NURSING HOME, NOT WHITE HOUSE It was 2012. Rangel was out because of a back injury and a viral infection, which made it difficult for him to stand for long periods of time. From 2008 through late 2010, I dogged Rangel through the halls of Congress on a daily basis as the veteran congressman grappled with an ethics scandal. The ethics case culminated in the House censuring Rangel, permanently smudging his record as a war hero, a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. First elected to the House in 1970, Rangel’s star had dimmed after the ethics scandal. But in 2012, any information about an elderly,legendary congressmanlike Rangel was newsworthy. So, as a reporter on the Capitol Hill beat, I appreciated the phone call as he described the excruciating pain that beset him. It’s possible the Ethics Committee investigation and censure by the House were more agonizing for Rangel than the back problem. Rangel was so confident that he didn’t violate House rules that he referred himself to the Ethics Committee. Rangel's woes with the Ethics Committee might as well have been more painful for him than his back problems.(Alex Wong/Getty Images) Rangel started to feel the ethics heat in 2008. He used his position as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee to solicit funds for a school in his name at City College of New York. He failed to report hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes or rental income on a villa he owned in theDominican Republic. A rent-controlled apartment in Harlem doubled as a campaign office. He improperly parked his broken-down, 1972 silver Mercedes-Benz in the garage of the Rayburn House Office Building. The House prohibits lawmakers from using the garage for storage. The Benz lacked plates, wasn’t registered and apparently hadn’t been driven in about four years. A Falls Church, Virginia, towing company lugged the car out of the garage on Sept. 19, 2008. Video of the tow-truck hauling away the Mercedes-Benz from Rayburn would have made a juicy story the next morning on TV. But Rangel caught a break. Sort of. VIRGINIA DEMOCRATIC REP GERRY CONNOLLY DEAD AT 75 Then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., summoned then-Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson to Capitol Hill that night. The U.S. economy teetered on the verge of an epic financial collapse. By nightfall, it was clear just how bad the nation’s economy was. Everyone temporarily forgot about Rangel. In fact, the inoperable Benz may have been in better shape than some American car companies at that moment. But the House Ethics Committee was investigating Rangel. An inquiry started in 2009 and culminated in his censure on the House floor in 2010. The House voted 333-79 to discipline Rangel. A somber Rangel presented himself in the well of the House chamber, hands folded in front of him as though he were about to receive Communion. Pelosi doled out her admonition from the dais and lightly rapped the gavel. \"He violated the public trust,\" said then-Ethics Committee Chairwoman Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif. It was the first censure of a House member in 27 years. Years after the fact, I half-jokingly suggested that Rangel could blame his Ethics Committee problems on me.(Andrew Burton/Getty Images) Years later, I half-jokingly told Rangel that he could blame me for his problems with the Ethics Committee. As stated earlier, it was Rangel who believed his actions were beyond reproach. So he sent himself before the Ethics Committee to review his conduct. I entered the Capitol one morning in 2008 and discovered his longtime aide, Emile Milne, wandering the basement. I asked Milne what he was looking for. He waived an overstuffed envelope at me. \"The Ethics Committee,\" said Milne. DEMOCRATS' BOILING POT: A LOOK AT THEIR 2026 GAME PLAN This was the actual \"self-referral\" to the Ethics Committee. And Milne was the courier of a dossier Rangel would use to defend himself. I knew exactly where the Ethics Committee was located in those days in the Capitol catacombs. So I escorted Milne to the door. As I said, I told Rangel he could blame all of his problems on me. I recall one instance in which Rangel, hounded by the press, fired back at them with his name, rank and serial number — the only things a prisoner of war is obliged to provide.(Brendan Smialowski/Getty Images) Between 2008 and 2010, I staked out Rangel somewhere at the Capitol nearly every day. The day Pelosi summoned him to her office. The day Pelosi removed him as Ways and Means Committee chairman. The day he spoke at length on the House floor to defend himself against the allegations after the ethics panel formalized its inquiry. One night, a scrum of reporters caught Rangel in the hallway off the House floor and pelted him with a barrage of questions. Rangel briefly answered. Then deflected. He then decided he had enough as scribes fired questions at him with the speed of a Gatling gun. Rangel sighed, exasperated at what to do. \"Sergeant Charles B. Rangel. 85718162!\" hollered Rangel. \"And that’s all I’m going to say about it!\" It’s unclear if the other reporters understood what just happened. But I did. BY DAWN'S EARLY LIGHT: BATTLES TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' WILL FACE IN THE SENATE Rangel served in the Army during the Korean War. He was wounded in the back by shrapnel and eventually led dozens of men out of a firefight and to safety. Multiple soldiers died, and others were taken prisoner. Rangel received the Purple Heart and Bronze Star with valor. Rangel survived that day. But back on Capitol Hill, the news cycle had effectively taken Rangel prisoner. So he complied with the terms of the Geneva Convention. A prisoner of war is only compelled to provide enemy captors their name, rank and serial number. And after absorbing heavy fire from the press corps, Rangel had only one option. It’s notable that someone with Rangel’smilitary recordand Army service passed away on Memorial Day. Rangel, a decorated veteran, died on Memorial Day.(Seth Wenig-Pool/Getty Images) In August 2008, Rangel published his autobiography entitled \"And I Haven’t Had a Bad Day Since.\" The book chronicles how a high school dropout joined the Army and was wounded on the battlefield. Rangel chose to continue — eventually winding up in Congress as one of the most important lawmakers of the last 50 years. But Rangel then faced one of the harshest punishments Congress could dole out. It cost him his chairmanship and upended his reputation. But Rangel was often philosophical about his fate and transgressions in Congress. He argued that despite the trouble, he still hadn’t had a bad day since that fateful battle in Kunu-ri, Korea in late 1950. Back in 2012, I may have been the only one who noticed that Rangel was absent when he was suffering from a back issue and viral infection.

Chicago Public Schools (CPS) officials are debating whether their grading policy is too lenient, with one principal arguing that leniency in grading won’t translate into success in the real world for students,according to a report. \"When students graduate and are working in jobs, what they experience around grace and flexibility at school is not going to match,\" Ellen Kennedy said in a report from the Chicago Sun-Times. \"This bubble is not going to surround you wherever you go.\" Kennedy is principal at Richards Career Academy High School (RCAHS). 300K NYC PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENTS DIDN’T SHOW UP TO SCHOOL LAST YEAR, ACCORDING TO REPORT A school bus is seen navigating through Chicago, Illinois, on October 14, 2022.(Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images) RCAHS is predominantly enrolled by Latino and Black students. The school piloted a new grading policy before theCOVID pandemicthat allowed them to redo assignments repeatedly and then submit assignments late. The policy was intended to addressrising absenteeismin the district. \"Even if they didn’t complete the assignment, the lowest score they could get was 50 rather than zero — a concept known as no-zero grading,\" the Times reported. The trend of \"no-zero grading\" started across the district and the United States as \"part of a push to give students more chances to show what they learned.\" Proponents of the policy argue that the traditional grading policy makes it difficult for students to recover, put in effort, and attend class. Jessica Bunzol, a transformation coach at the University ofChicagoNetwork for College Success, who has done work at RCAHS, said issuing \"Fs\" are \"not motivators for young people.\" \"That belief that our classroom should be oriented toward helping young people to succeed, rather than orienting them towards failure, is really a critical part,\" Bunzol said. \"Research tells us that F’s are not motivators for young people and that they’re not going to engage them in classrooms in the way we might previously have thought or hoped.\" US 'REPORT CARD' SHOWS STUDENTS HAVE FALLEN BEHIND IN READING, BARELY BUDGED IN MATH: ‘THE NEWS IS NOT GOOD’ Chicago Public Schools officials are debating whether their grading policy is too lenient, with one principal arguing that leniency in grading won’t translate into the real world for students, according to a report.(Scott Olson/Getty Images) A CPS official charged with managing attendance and truancy said the \"shift was key in becoming a district that’s attuned to the social-emotional needs of its students.\" \"We’re not issuing grades without knowing the full story,\" Zakieh Mohammed said. \"If the student has not shown up, are we just issuing a zero, or are we asking why?\" \"We wanted to show up for our kids first and then grading was secondary,\" Candace Brahm, a science teacher at RCAHS, said. On the other hand, critics at RCAHS and another high school in CPSF \"worry it allows some students to eke out passing grades with little effort and undermines the importance of turning in work on time and coming to school regularly.\" One student was baffled by the notion that her classmates were passing the class with high absenteeism and missing assignments while she was doing the work.

    "article_text": "French President Emmanuel Macron's wife is seen pushing his face in a viral clip during their arrival in Hanoi, Vietnam. French first lady Brigitte Macron was seen shoving her husband, French PresidentEmmanuel Macron,in the face while the couple was waiting to disembark their plane in Hanoi, Vietnam. Video of the incident showed a uniformed man opening the plane door as Macron was seen wearing a suit and standing in the doorway. Brigitte Macron's arms – in red sleeves – could be seen reaching out and pushing Macron away, with one hand covering his mouth and part of his nose while the other was on his jaw. The French president turned his head away but suddenly noticed news cameras capturing the moment. He quickly smiled and waved before exiting the door frame. Macron and his wife later disembarked the stairs of the aircraft together. TheFrench presidentoffered his arm, though the first lady – seen wearing a red blazer – did not take hold of it.

The headline of a story on the website of the daily Le Parisien newspaper asked, \"Slap or ‘squabble’? The images of Emmanuel and Brigitte Macron disembarking in Vietnam trigger a lot of comment.\" Macron told reporters that the couple — who met at a French high school where hewas a teenage student,and she was a roughly 39-year-old married teacher — were simply joking around. Emmanuel was 29 when he married Brigitte in 2007. \"We are squabbling and, rather, joking with my wife,\" he said, according to the AP, adding that the incident was being overblown into \"a sort of geo-planetary catastrophe.\" The French leader argued that the images and reaction to them offered a cautionary tale about disinformation in the social media age.

It’s a moment of complicity. It was all that was needed to give ammunition to the conspiracy theorists,\" his office said, according to the AP.

    "article_text": "Breitbart senior editor-at-large Joel Pollak discusses President Donald Trump’s meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa at the White House on ‘The Story.’ JOHANNESBURG — South Africans welcomed PresidentDonald Trump's highly critical Oval Office statements Wednesday about killings in the country, according to analysts. The President showed video clips and gave South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa a sheaf of news clippings he said show farm murders. Many believe this \"ambush\" by President Trump toward the South African leader is good for the country, because it throws a sharp light on the darkness that is the high level of killings in the country, and how President Ramaphosa’s government is said to be failing to adequately tackle it. Approximately 6,953 people of all races were murdered in South Africa in just the last three months of 2024, according to police statistics. That is 76 people on average killed every day.

It was reported that between 2019 and 2022 only 12% of murder prosecutions resulted in a conviction. \"President Trump’s focus on violent crime in South Africa is a strong positive to emerge from the Oval Office meeting,\" analyst Frans Cronje told Fox News Digital. Cronje, president of the Washington-based Yorktown Foundation for Freedom, added, \"South Africahas averaged an intentional homicide rate of around 40 homicides per 100 000 residents since becoming a democracy in 1994.\" He continued, \"the global figure is nearer 4/100 000. More people are murdered in South Africa annually, with its population of just over 60 million, than across the entire Western world, with its population of almost a billion people.\" A plainclothes police officer with the Johannesburg Metro Police Department questions a man found inside a dilapidated building used as a shelter in Johannesburg on May 15, 2023.(Photo by MICHELE SPATARI/AFP via Getty Images) At home, the South African government has been harshly and repeatedly criticized for not tackling violent crime effectively.Cronje said, \"The South African government has failed the people of the country in not taking the blight of criminal violence seriously, and external U.S. pressure to address the violence as a precondition for any major investment treaties is pressure that domestic South African activists may employ to address their government's neglect.\" RUBIO BOOTS SOUTH AFRICAN AMBASSADOR FROM US: 'PERSONA NON GRATA' Crosses are planted on a hillside at the White Cross Monument, each one marking a White farmer who has been killed in a farm murder, on Oct. 31, 2017 in Ysterberg, near Langebaan, South Africa. A long campaign of violence against the country's farmers, who are largely White, has inflamed political and racial tensions nearly a quarter-of-a-century after the fall of apartheid.(GULSHAN KHAN/AFP via Getty Images) Analyst Max Meizlish told Fox News Digital, \"It’s clear that decades of corruption in South Africa have hollowed out the state’s ability to provide even the most basic services — from reliable water and electricity, to a functioning police force and equal protection under the law.\" Meizlish, a senior research analyst at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, added that in the election here last year, \"the ANC lost its national majority for the first time since the end of apartheid.\" The African National Congress (ANC) government took power in 1994. \"The Ramaphosa government is devoting more time and resources to courting BRICS allies likeChina, Russia, and Iran, than to restoring order at home. \"President Trump is right to demand change from Ramaphosa on everything from land reform and human rights abuses to South Africa’s growing alignment with America’s adversaries,\" he stated. Perhaps off script, right inside the Oval Office last Wednesday, Zingiswa Losi, president of the Congress of South African Trade Unions, spoke out about other serious crimes going virtually unchecked. \"There is no doubt about it that we are a violent nation,\" she told President Trump and the others crammed into the room. She added, \"if you go into the rural areas where (there is a) Black majority, you would see women, elderly, being raped, being killed, being murdered.\" President of the ruling African National Congress and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa speaks to supporters during the ANC Siyanqoba Rally held at FNB Stadium on May 25, 2024 in Johannesburg.(Photo by Chris McGrath/Getty Images) SOUTH AFRICAN-BORN MUSK EVOKED BY TRUMP DURING MEETING WITH NATION'S LEADER: 'DON'T WANT TO GET ELON INVOLVED' Losi continued, \"And the problem in South Africa, it is not necessarily about race, but it is about crime. And we think that we are here to say, how do we both nations work together to reset, to really talk about investment … to really address the levels of crime that we have in our country. \" Sources say that after previously refusing to letElon Muskbring his Starlink satellite communications system into South Africa, citing the need for local partial ownership, Ramaphosa and his advisors have now realized that Starlink’s data services could help bring greater security, particularly to rural areas of the country. In crime statistics for the first three months of this year released on Friday, which critics say are not verified independently, the Police Minister claimed five of the six people killed on farms were Black, and one was White.

    "article_text": "Behnam Ben Taleblu, an Iran expert and senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Fox News Digital that if the policy works, it could contain Iran. PresidentDonald Trumplast week announced he would normalize U.S. relations with Syria by lifting decades-old sanctions, and he became the first American president to meet with the leader of the Middle Eastern nation in 25 years – a move that some have seen as an indirect hit on Iran. The news was a surprising shift from Trump’s prior position in which he said in aDecember postthat \"Syria is a mess, but is not our friend, & THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.\" Trump’s change of posture is a gamble that could see serious gains regarding regional stability and securing U.S. interestsby deterring Iranian influence, explained Behnam Ben Taleblu, Iran expert and senior fellow with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. President Donald Trump, Syrian President al-Sharaa and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.(Reuters) US AMBASSADOR BARRACK NAMED SPECIAL ENVOY TO SYRIA AMID SANCTIONS RELIEF PLAN \"This is what I call a high-risk, high-reward gamble, but one that, if achieved successfully, can actually prevent Syria from being a launching pad for more Iranian malign activity,\" Ben Taleblu told Fox News Digital. \"But if it fails, . . . Washington would have ended up empowering a jihadist government in Damascus [that] does not have full control over its own territory.\" The December collapse of the Bashar al-Assad regime following the takeover by Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a former al-Qaeda affiliate, not only signified an end to a decades-long oppressive regime, it also effectively dismantled years of Iranian investment in a majorsetback to its regional influence. Trump emphasized that this sanctions relief, which he argued will give the country a chance to recover and was soon followed by an EU order to lift sanctions, is a move to encourage Syria tonormalize diplomatic tieswith Israel. But Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who is also theleader of HTS, which is still a designated terrorist group under the U.S. and the UN, has not officially agreed to pursue diplomatic ties with Jerusalem – a push several Middle Eastern nations have flatly rejected amid its aggressive military operations in the Gaza Strip. Trump also emphasized that the new Syrian government needs to suppress the rise ofIslamic extremist groups,which Ben Taleblu pointed out is going to be one of the nation’s chief vulnerabilities as it looks to completely re-establish itself in the world order as trade, business and diplomacy have been reopened to Damascus.

The Islamic Republic has an ideological view of the way the region should be oriented, and has put time, money, resources, blood and treasure towards that,\" Ben Taleblu said. The Iran-expert explained that Tehran is waiting for the U.S. and Israel to loosen its pressure on the regime and its proxies, \"and for Washington and Jerusalem to make mistakes in the region as they try to push towards bigger-picture things –  like flipping Syria or regional peace and stability.\" \"And it is there that in the interim, whileWashington focusesup on building up states that Tehran will focus on building up proxies and partners,\" he added.

Secretary of State Macro Rubio also warned lawmakers on Tuesday that Syria could be just \"weeks\" away from a \"potential collapse and a full-scale civil war of epic proportions.\" These fractures pose asignificant vulnerabilityfor the new Syrian government. \"Whenever there is a downtrodden or dispossessed person in a war zone or in a conflict zone, that is Tehran's angle of entry back into a conflict,\" Ben Taleblu said. \"This has been Iran’s strategy, sitting and waiting and looking to exploit opportunities across the entire northern tier of the Middle East, from Iraq to Syria to Lebanon. \"Exploiting disarray is a specialty of the Islamic Republic,\" he warned.

Though the president, and his constituents, notoriously opposed nation-building, which could spell trouble for the long-term security of Syria as it sits in Iran’s shadow. \"Tehran is going to be playing the long game.

The dead included three children in the northern region of Zhytomyr, local officials there said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyycalled on the United States, which has taken a softer public line on Russia and its leader, Vladimir Putin, since President Donald Trump took office, to speak out. \"The silence of America, the silence of others in the world only encourages Putin,\" he wrote on Telegram.

The program permits the university to host international students with F-1 or J-1 visas to study in the U.S. In a letter Thursday,Department of Homeland SecuritySecretary Kristi Noem informed Harvard's leadership that the university had lost its \"privilege\" of enrolling foreign students as a result of the institution's \"refusal to comply with multiple requests to provide the Department of Homeland Security with pertinent information while perpetuating an unsafe campus environment that is hostile to Jewish students, promotes pro-Hamas sympathies, and employs racist ‘diversity, equity and inclusion' policies.\" \"This action should not surprise you and is the unfortunate result of Harvard’s failure to comply with simple reporting requirements,\" Noem wrote. Anti-Israel protesters gather outside Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on April 25, 2025.(JOSEPH PREZIOSO/AFP via Getty Images) Noem said she requested records pertaining to \"nonimmigrant students\" enrolled at Harvard, \"including information regarding misconduct and other offenses that would render foreign students inadmissible or removable,\" on April 16. Harvard’s counsel responded twice, but both responses were insufficient, according to the letter. TRUMP SAYS HARVARD'S FOREIGN STUDENTS ARE FROM COUNTRIES PAYING 'NOTHING' FOR THEIR EDUCATION \"Consequences must follow to send a clear signal to Harvard and all universities that want to enjoy the privilege of enrolling foreign students, that the Trump administration will enforce the law and root out the evils of anti-Americanism and antisemitism in society and campuses,\" Noem wrote. The requested records include any and all audio or video footage in Harvard’s possession regarding threats to other students or university personnel, \"deprivation of rights\" of other classmates or university personnel, and \"dangerous or violent activity, whether on or off campus\" by a nonimmigrant student enrolled at Harvard in the last five years. Noem is also asking for any and all disciplinary records and audio or video footage of any protest activity involving nonimmigrant students.

In its court filing, Harvard said the revocation impacts more than 7,000 visa holders – more than a quarter of its student body – and \"is a blatant violation of the First Amendment, the Due Process Clause, and the Administrative Procedure Act.\" \"It is the latest act by the government in clear retaliation for Harvard exercising its First Amendment rights to reject the government’s demands to control Harvard’s governance, curriculum, and the ‘ideology’ of its faculty and students,\" the lawsuit says.

    "title": "Military veterans of US' 'toxic soup' Uzbekistan base fighting for proper care 20 years after its shutter",
    "article_text": "Rep. Mark Green, R-Tenn., is calling on the Pentagon to study a connection between time at Karshi-Khanabad Air Base in Uzbekistan and the illnesses many veterans developed after toxic exposure. At the former Soviet base-turned-CIA black site and U.S. military base in Uzbekistan, researchers knew early on danger lingered not just from the enemy but from the ground itself. Karshi-Khanabad Air Base, known as K2, was a launchpad for U.S. operations into Afghanistan after 9/11. But for thousands of American troops who served there, it may have been a death sentence. Matthew \"Nick\" Nicholls, an Army environmental technician and preventive medicine specialist, was part of an early team that assessed the environmental hazards at K2. \"It is probably the most toxic soup of chemicals that any service member has ever been exposed to,\" Nicholls told Fox News Digital. Yellowcake uranium oozed from the ground. Jet fuel and volatile chemicals from decaying Soviet rocket bunkers polluted the soil and air. Dangerous fumes hung over the base like the fog of forgotten war. Nicholls and his team warned commanders, providing recommendations like laying down gravel to suppress toxic dust and restrictions on how long personnel could work in high-risk zones. Some precautions were taken, others weren’t. Researchers excavated \"Soviet-era jet fuel that was pure enough to put into an engine and work\" at K2 base.(Obtained by Fox News Digital via Matthew Nicholls) Images show visible \"yellowcake\" found in the ground at the K2 base.(Obtained by Fox News Digital/Matthew Nicholls) \"People that I am friends with are actively dying from cancer right now,\" Nicholls said. \"These are weird ontologies that are striking down people who are very young, people in their 20s, 30s, 40s, in the prime of their life.\" K2 veterans have reported a disturbing trend of rare and aggressive cancers, reproductive organ diseases, osteoarthritis and sudden, unexplained deaths. VICTIM SPEAKS OUT AFTER NAVY DENIES FUEL-CONTAMINATED WATER CAUSED INJURIES: 'AFFECTED IN NEARLY EVERY WAY' \"These are not the cancers that young people normally get,\" Nicholls said. \"Their stories are not really able to be told. That’s the tragedy of it.\" \"These people went there right after 9/11 to avenge the deaths of those who were murdered,\" Nicholls said. \"Yet we had this launching pad in Uzbekistan that was left in such derelict condition by the Soviets.\" Between 2001 and 2005, more than 15,000 U.S. service members passed through K2. Thousands more served as contractors. Many now find themselves struggling to get adequate medical care or recognition from theDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA). The VA recognizes such veterans \"may have encountered several hazardous exposures,\" and the Department of Defense conducted an initial study to look at cancer outcomes. But that study was based only on a few cases of each type of cancer and should not be viewed as \"definitive evidence of an association with service at K-2,\" the VA says. But a spokesperson for Rep. Mark Green said he does not believe these studies were enough, that they did not take the full extent of contamination into account and did not appropriately inform occupants of the base of their exposure risk or account for the full range of diseases that can result from toxic exposures. \"That is why Rep. Green's NDAA (National Defense Authorization Act) amendment calls for a new, fully rigorous epidemiological study to cover these blind spots,\" the spokesperson said. \"There are too many unknowns to call it a case closed.\" Fox News Digital has reached out to the VA for comment. Green, R-Tenn., and Rep. Stephen Lynch, D-Mass., introduced a provision in the 2021 National Defense Authorization Actrequiring the Pentagonto complete a study on K2 exposure within 180 days. Four years later, that study remains unfinished. \"This is unjust,\"Green toldFox News Digital. \"There were repeated warnings that service members were being exposed to toxins, and yet their health and safety were ignored by Pentagon leadership of that day.\" Researchers test radioactivity at K2.(Obtained by Fox News Digital/Matthew Nicholls) A researcher explores substances in an excavation pit at K2.(Matthew Nicholls/Obtained by Fox News Digital) In a letter first obtained by Fox News Digital that went out late Friday, Green is pressing the Pentagon to complete the long-overdue study, a step he argues is essential to ensure K2 veterans receive the care they deserve. \"Because this study has yet to be completed (as far as Congress is aware), many K2 veterans are still waiting to receive much needed care,\" he wrote. \"This is unjust. There were repeated warnings at Camp Stronghold Freedom that servicemembers (sic) were being exposed to toxins, and yet their health and safety were ignored by the Pentagon leadership of that day.\" The Pentagon told Fox News Digital it would respond to Green privately. 'LIKE A CAR CRASH': NAVY FIGHTER PILOT DESCRIBES BRAIN INJURY PHENOMENON NOW AT CENTER OF CONGRESSIONAL PROBE In 2024, the VA moved to expand access to disability for K2 veterans and lower the burden of proof for the veterans to link their illnesses to their service. But advocates say it wasn't enough. \"The VA is dragging its feet,\" Green said. \"I think it really purely comes down to cost. I get that the VA wants to be judicious, but my God, the numbers here are so convincing. This is long past due.\" Green has also introduced new legislation requiring the VA to formally recognize links between K2 toxic exposure and diseases like cancer, ensuring affected veterans qualify for care and benefits. Toxins at K2 included petrochemicals, volatile organic compounds, depleted uranium, burn pits and tetrachlorethylene, all chemicals associated with long-term health risks. But K2 veterans are not specifically named in the PACT Act, which expanded coverage for other toxic exposures like Agent Orange and burn pits. Green, a physician and Army veteran, sees disturbing echoes of past delays.

He has also experienced the healing that can come from having \"man’s best friend\" as a companion. That is why Longo, who served in Fallujah, Iraq, and earned theDepartment of State’s Medal of Heroism in Afghanistan, founded the Warriors Choice Foundation in 2016 with the mission of helping fellow veterans heal. In an interview with Fox News Digital, Longo explained that rather than relying solely on medications or a one-size-fits-all approach to treatment, his foundation tailors care to individual veterans through counseling, wellness retreats and a truly unique treatment called \"cognitive K9 rehabilitation.\" Through Warriors Choice K9 rehabilitation program, the group matches veterans with Belgian Malinois breed service dogs specially bred and trained to help people suffering from PTSD and other combat-related mental health challenges.

Someone's got to put food on the table. There are things that have to be done, I have to go do the training, I have to go maintain a level or a standard that I've imposed on myself to essentially hold myself accountable for my actions and what I'm doing in my day-to-day.\" Beyond that, Longo explained that Bourbon has helped him gain a \"true understanding of what I needed to do for myself.\" Though Longo said that fighting against issues like veteranPTSD and suicidecan feel like \"trying to move a mountain,\" he explained that the need could not be more urgent.

    "article_text": "Fox News correspondent Alexandria Hoff highlights the 'troubling trend' found in the MAHA Commission's report on childhood health issues on 'Special Report.' Despite assurances fromTrump administrationofficials that farmers will not be impacted by its attempts to reduce environmental chemical exposure from foods, agricultural leaders have been expressing concern that the move will explode costs for farmers and more than double the cost of food. The administration'sMake America Healthy Again (MAHA)Commission, made up of many of President Donald Trump's political appointees and closest policy advisors, released an assessment strategizing how they will tackle childhood chronic diseases, such as obesity and mental health challenges. Part of the report's focus is on children's chemical exposure from our foods, which the report says is linked to developmental issues and chronic diseases. Amid the report's release, farm groups have expressed concern over the MAHA agenda's focus on pesticides. They have said that if the administration starts clamping down on widely used pesticides, crop yields would decline, input costs would surge and food costs would more than double. DOCTOR TAKES AIM AT 'CANCER-CAUSING' PESTICIDES IN RESPONSE TO MAHA REPORT Some farmers are clapping back at a recent Make America Healthy Again report from the Trump administration, arguing it will upend decades of science by going after widely used pesticides.(Stephen Goin) \"Farmers are already facing a host of challenges—uncertainty about their access to critical crop protection products shouldn't be added to the list,\" said Elizabeth Burns-Thompson, Executive Director of the Modern Ag Alliance. \"Crop protection tools are not only safe, they are essential to food security, affordability, and the survival of family farms all across this country. Losing access to these critical inputs would be a devastating setback to American agriculture.\" Officials from the MAHA Commission sought to reassure farmers at an event releasing their assessment onchildhood chronic diseaseson Thursday. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said that \"at the center\" of the MAHA agenda is \"making American agriculture great again.\" \"We love our farmers, and we want to pay respect to our farmers. And we always will,\" President Trump added at the Thursday event from the White House. \"We won the farmers by a lot in the election, and every election, all three elections – and we won by a lot. I will never forget that. And they are foremost in our thought.\" But some farmers are still expressing concern. MAHA REPORT LAYS OUT 'CHRONIC DISEASE CRISIS' FACING AMERICA A soybean field is sprayed in Iowa.(AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall) \"The Make America Healthy Again Report is filled with fear-based rather than science-based information about pesticides. We are deeply troubled that claims of this magnitude are being made without any scientific basis or regard for a long history of EPA expert evaluations of these products,\" the National Corn Grower's Alliance (NCGA) said. \"We call on the administration to respect the existing body ofscience on pesticidesand, moving forward, to include America’s farmers in discussion as this process evolves.\" According to a statement put out by the Modern Ag Alliance, pesticides are \"rigorously tested\" by the federal government, noting that in the case of glyphosate – mentioned multiple times in the MAHA report – it is one of the most thoroughly studied pesticides of its kind. They said that if the MAHA report drives future policy decisions it would hurt farmers and more than double the cost of food. EX-YANKEES COACH RUNS FARM THAT VOWS TO 'MAKE MEAT GREAT AGAIN' \"Without glyphosate—the most widely used weed-fighting tool by U.S. farmers—crop yields would decline, input costs would surge by 150%, and food inflation would more than double,\" the group said. \"When Sri Lanka prohibited the use of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers in 2021, crop yields fell by over 50%, forcing the government to import massive amounts of food just to meet basic needs. We should be focused on moving American agriculture—and the country—forward.\" The Modern Ag Alliance, a coalition of farmers, has said that policy decisions from the Trump administration clamping down on pesticides could more than double the cost of food.(iSTOCK) Health SecretaryRobert F. Kennedy Jr.,who has been a vocal opponent against the dangerous health impacts of under-regulated pesticides even before he was the MAHA Commission's leader, said last week in a Senate hearing that \"we cannot take any step that will put a single farmer in this country out of business.\" \"There's a million farmers who rely on glyphosate,\" he said. \"100% of corn in this country relies on glyphosate. We are not going to do anything to jeopardize that business model.\" FARMERS COME FIRST AS INITIATIVE AIMS TO LOWER THEIR COSTS, GET FRESH FOOD TO AMERICANS MORE EFFICIENTLY The MAHA report reiterates the economic importance of protecting farmers, but it also lists glyphosate in an infographic of \"Chemical Classes and Common Exposure Pathways\" and says research studies have shown it can cause a range of health effects. It also lists atrazine and other chemicals as dangerous to childhood health. MAHA Commission officials have said that part of the administration's focus will be a return to thegold standard of science,but the NCGA said the focus on certain widely-used pesticides, such as atrazine and glyphosate, goes against \"decades of extensive research and testing.\" \"If the administration’s goal is to bring more efficiency to government, then why is the secretary of Health and Human Services duplicating efforts by raising questions about pesticides that have been answered repeatedly through research and reviews by federal regulatory bodies?\" the group questioned. Both President Donald Trump and Health and Secretary of Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have sought to reassure farmers that they will not be negatively impacted by the Make America Healthy Again agenda.(Getty Images/Greg Nash/Pool/AFP/Tierney L. Cross/Bloomberg/Sebastian Gollnow/picture alliance) Jennifer Galardi, a senior policy analyst focused on health and wellness issues at the Heritage Foundation, took a more balanced view of the MAHA commission's strategy towards pesticides like glyphosate, noting that it appeared to thread the needle between supporting farmers and trying to ensure America's food supply is safe and free of chemicals that could impact child health. \"The MAHA Commission Report seems to carefully examine competing issues in a very complex agricultural debate: the potential that crop protection tools as they’re referred to in the report may cause adverse health outcomes and the desire to protect theeconomic interestsof farmers and the country,\" Galardi said. \"However, everyone should agree that the companies that manufacture products such as glyphosate and GMO’s shouldn’t have undue influence over the research upon which sound policy is based. The American public should demand transparency around these decisions.\" Galardi posited that, due to the tension around the issue of pesticides, the MAHA Commission may decide to go after \"low-hanging fruit,\" such as improving children's diets and lack of physical activity, which, she said, are bigdrivers of obesityand metabolic dysfunction. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In response to this article, a USDA spokesperson sent the following statement from Secretary Rollins: \"We must do more to improve thehealth outcomesof our kids and families, and President Trump knows agriculture is at the heart of the solution. America’s farmers and ranchers dedicate their lives to the noble cause of feeding their country and the world, and in doing so have created the safest and most abundant and affordable food supply in the world. We are working to make sure our kids and families are consuming the healthiest food we produce. I look forward to continuing to work with Secretary Kennedy and other members of the MAHA Commission to improve our nation’s health.\" White House spokesman Kush Desai, in a separate statement, echoed Rollins' sentiment about the importance of agriculture and farmers when it comes to executing the MAHA mission. He also reiterated that the MAHA movement is grounded in \"Gold Standard of Science.\" \"The guiding principle of President Trump’s movement to Make America Healthy Again is the Gold Standard of Science, and everyone from America’s farmers to everyday parents are critical for the success of this movement,\" Desai said. \"The MAHA Commission’s report is a historic step by our government to, for the first time, comprehensively review the latest evidence and research of what we know – and what we don’t know – is driving the health crisis afflicting America’s children.\"",

    "article_text": "Nevada Senate candidate and U.S. Army Captain (Ret.) Sam Brown reacts to Trump's endorsement and what inspired him to run for office. FIRST ON FOX:A slew of veterans’ groups, along with Secretary of Veterans AffairsDoug Collins, are criticizing Senate Democrats for delaying keyagency nominationsover what some have called unserious or \"DOGE-type\" concerns. One top nominee currently facing the collective procedural roadblock ahead of Memorial Day is wounded warrior Sam Brown, a former Nevada senatorial candidate and Army captain who was burned over more than one-third of his body when the Humvee he was riding in in Helmand, Afghanistan, hit a roadside IED that incinerated its fuel tank. He was nominated by President Donald Trump as undersecretary for memorial affairs, which maintains cemeteries and facilitates veterans’ burial ceremonies – about 100,000 per year. A letter from about two dozen veterans’ groups addressed to Senate VA Committee Chairman Jerry Moran, R-Kan., ranking member Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and caucus leaders was obtained Friday by Fox News Digital. Doug Collins, left, Sam Brown, right(Getty) The groups note that they respect the Senate’s advise-and-consent role, but object to the current situation. They note that the VA has the fewest presidentially nominated positions and that other agency nominees receive overnight and weekend considerations at times. \"We will be happy to bring the senators coffee and donuts during such late night and weekend sessions, of course in compliance with the Senate’s gift and ethics rules,\" the groups wrote. Brown and all other nominees since April have been held up by Blumenthal and Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz. – but the lawmakers say their move is not personal and instead aimed to halt mass firings and other Trump-era actions. Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, indicated that he would join the two Democrats, after aconfirmation hearingfor Brown, Marine Lt. Col. James Baehr for general counsel and Army veteran Richard Topping for VA CFO, was mooted in April by the procedural hold. \"We've had 2,400 firings so far,\" King said, according toStars & Stripes. Vietnam Veterans of America, in a separate letter obtained by Fox News Digital, demanded Brown, Baehr and Topping be confirmed summarily. \"All three of these veterans received favorable reports following the April 9th nominations process from theSenate Veterans Affairs Committee,\" wrote VVA President Jack McManus. NEW GOP SENATOR TEARS INTO DEMS 'SEEKING TO DELAY' PETE HEGSETH DOD CONFIRMATION Senate VA Chair Jerry Moran of Kansas(Getty) McManus said that many Vietnam Vets are concerned about the hold-up and agree that Brown and the others are eminently qualified, blaming \"two members of the US Senate Veterans Affairs Committee\" for \"affecting services to our veterans.\" Another letter from the Independence Fund, which provides resources, including trackchairs, to severely wounded veterans, said a fully staffed VA central office is crucial to its mission. Last week, when Moran again attempted to confirm Brown by unanimous consent – a voice vote that must have no audible objections – Blumenthal rose to block him. \"The chairman and I share a bipartisan commitment to putting our veterans first. . . . I think we also share a respect for Sam Brown [and] his service to our nation as a decorated veteran,\" said Blumenthal. Blumenthal, whose own service was criticized by Trump with the nickname \"Da Nang Dick\" after a Vietnamese province, said that Brown’s nomination lacked unanimous support in committee, citing a 10-9 vote. TRUMP VA PICK DOUG COLLINS ADVANCES TO FULL SENATE VOTE Blumenthal(Getty) \"This issue is bigger than Sam Brown. It is about information that has been denied to our committee and to us as senators. The secretary of the VA is actively working to undermine our bipartisan oversight efforts. Blumenthal told Fox News Digital he had a message for Collins: \"Before you hire new top VA bureaucrats, you should be rehiring the dedicated veterans you fired.\" \"Secretary Doug Collins is denying us essential information that is necessary for our oversight, and we want accountability. All Americans, especially veterans, deserve votes by the full Senate on top nominees—not rubber stamp unanimous consents,\" he said, adding Collins can ask the Senate to hold floor-debate on the nominees through regular order. In comments to Fox News Digital, Collins rejected Blumenthal’s claims and lambasted the delays. \"Imagine how much better off America’s veterans would be if Senators Blumenthal and Gallego cared as much about fixing the department’s broken bureaucracy as they do about preventing woundedcombat veteransfrom coming to work at VA,\" he said. \"Despite their obstruction, we will reform the department to make it work better for veterans, families, caregivers and survivors.\" Gallego said he also does not object to Brown personally, and that he is instead seeking agency accountability – saying in a recent statement he wants to reverse \"hack-job firings.\" Primaries were held on Tuesday night to fill the seat being vacated at the end of this year by Rep. Ruben Gallego.(Getty Images) In a statement to Fox News Digital, Gallego said Collins is \"more concerned with three political appointees than the thousands of veterans who are going to lose their jobs and care.\" \"I served this country and received care at the VA. I know how important it is for veterans. Abandoning them, like Secretary Collins wants to do, is reckless and un-American. Show Congress the plan on how care won’t be impacted. Anything short of that is political posturing,\" he said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP A 2024 inspector general report found that the site already faced staffing shortages.

PresidentDonald Trumpbacked several House Republicans for reelection in Truth Social posts on Sunday, expressing support for Reps. Andrew Garbarino of New York, Troy Downing of Montana, Guy Reschenthaler of Pennsylvania, and Bryan Steil of Wisconsin. Each lawmaker received an individual post from Trump, and each post declared that the given lawmaker has Trump's endorsement. Republicanscurrently hold the majority in the House, but the 2026 midterms will determine whether the GOP maintains control of the chamber during the tail end of Trump's second term in office.

House Speaker Mike Johnson said that \"Garbarino did not make it in time,\" but had fallen asleep. \"I am proud to have been the leading voice on Long Island during negotiations on this key reconciliation bill.

HOUSE GOP LEADERSHIP TAKES VICTORY LAP AFTER PASSING TRUMP'S ‘ONE BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL’ \"While I am frustrated that the vote was closed before I was able to cast my vote, I am proud of the work we accomplished to deliver huge results for Long Island. I congratulate President Trump on getting this bill passed and look forward to voting 'yes' when it comes back to the House floor from the Senate,\" Garbarino noted. Johnson spoke highly of Garbarino in aposton X last week. \"In addition to our committee chairs who worked overtime to deliver the One Big Beautiful Bill, we also want to thank @RepGarbarino. My great friend Andrew played an essential role in negotiations among Members, and is a primary reason we were able to secure the deals which allowed us to pass our nation-shaping legislation this morning,\" Johnson noted. \"Andrew is highly regarded by me and all our Members as one of the most trusted, reliable, and talented colleagues in the House, and if it were not for his unique contributions and tireless efforts, we simply would not have achieved what we have in this Congress,\" the speaker added.

    "title": "Study directly compares Zepbound and Wegovy for weight-loss results",
    "article_text": "Board-certified rheumatologist Dr. Mahsa Tehrani discusses President Donald Trump’s possible 25% tariff on overseas medication and a new study on the relationship between Ozempic and dementia risk on ‘America Reports.’ Weight-loss medicationscontinue to grow in popularity as an anti-obesity tool — but are some more effective than others? The question was explored in a new study published this month in The New England Journal of Medicine. Researchers compared the safety and efficacy of tirzepatide (brand name Zepbound) and semaglutide (brand name Wegovy) in a 72-week clinical trial. WEIGHT-LOSS MEDICATIONS MAY ALSO BENEFIT COMMON MEDICAL PROBLEM, STUDY FINDS The randomized, controlled trial — called SURMOUNT-5 — included 751 people throughout the U.S. and Puerto Rico who had obesity but nottype 2 diabetes. \"Doctors, insurance companies and patients are always asking, ‘Which drug is more effective?’\" said Dr. Louis Aronne, director of the Comprehensive Weight Control Center and the Sanford I. Weill Professor of Metabolic Research at Weill Cornell Medicine, in the release. \"This study allowed us to do a direct comparison.\" Researchers compared the safety and efficacy of tirzepatide (brand name Zepbound) and semaglutide (brand name Wegovy) in a 72-week clinical trial.(iStock) \"The results are consistent with — in fact, almost identical to — what we’ve seen in trials in which these drugs were evaluated independently,\" added Aronne, who was a principal investigator in the trial. The study found that tirzepatide achievedgreater weight loss, with participants shedding about 50 pounds (20.2% of their body weight). \"Doctors, insurance companies and patients are always asking, ‘Which drug is more effective?’\" The group taking semaglutide lost an average of 33 pounds or 13.7% of their baseline weight, according to a press release summarizing the study outcome. Overall, 32% of the people taking tirzepatide lost at least 25% of their body weight; semaglutide users lost around 16%. WEIGHT LOSS, DIABETES DRUGS CAN CAUSE MOOD CHANGES: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT BEHAVIORAL SIDE EFFECTS Tirzepatide users also reported a \"greater reduction in waist circumference\" than those on semaglutide. The likely reason for tirzepatide’s greater effectiveness is that it uses a \"dual mechanism of action,\" according to Aronne. The randomized, controlled trial — called SURMOUNT-5 — included 751 people in the U.S. and Puerto Rico who had obesity but not type 2 diabetes.(Steve Christo - Corbis/Corbis via Getty Images) \"Whereas semaglutide works by activating receptors for a hormone called glucagon-like peptide 1, or GLP-1, tirzepatide mimics not only GLP-1, but also an additional hormone, glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP),\" the release stated. \"Together, these actions reduce hunger, lower blood-glucose levels and affect fat cell metabolism.\" WEIGHT-LOSS DRUGS’ IMPACT ON CANCER RISK REVEALED IN NEW STUDY Additional trials are actively exploring whether tirzepatide also reduces the risk ofheart attack and stroke, a benefit that has been linked to semaglutide. The study was led by an investigator at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian. It was also conducted with the University of Texas McGovern Medical School, the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles, the University College Dublin and Eli Lilly (maker of Zepbound). The study found that tirzepatide achieved greater weight loss, with participants shedding about 50 pounds (20.2% of their body weight).(iStock) The participants all received guidance regardingnutrition and exercise. The reported side effects were very similar for the two drugs, with 44% of people experiencing nausea and 25% having abdominal pain. WEIGHT-LOSS DRUGS TO GET SURPRISING ENDORSEMENT FROM GLOBAL HEALTH GIANT Dr. Ada Londono, M.D., a board-certifiedobesity and internal medicineprimary care physician with PlushCare — a virtual health platform offering primary care, therapy and weight management services — said she was not surprised by the study's findings. \"The results are consistent with prior trials, confirming tirzepatide’s advantage over semaglutide’s single GLP-1 action,\" Londono, who is based in New York City, told Fox News Digital. Beyond weight loss, semaglutide has also shown potential benefits for cardiovascular health, sleep apnea and kidney disease.(iStock) Beyond weight loss, semaglutide has also shown potential benefits for cardiovascular health,sleep apneaand kidney disease, she noted. \"These findings highlight the need for continued research to understand tirzepatide’s broader health impacts,\" she said. \"It’s encouraging to see ongoing studies exploring the full potential of GLP-1 medications beyond weight management.\" Londono said these treatments can come with side effects. SEMAGLUTIDE FOUND TO HAVE SHOCKING BENEFIT FOR LIVER DISEASE PATIENTS IN NEW STUDY \"Most people on these medications only report mild symptoms, but some have experienced more serious reactions, such as pancreatitis,\" she told Fox News Digital. \"This underscores the importance of reviewing yourmedical historyand discussing any concerns with your healthcare provider.\" The study did have some limitations — chiefly that it was not a blinded analysis and participants knew which medication they were receiving. This could introduce some level of bias, the researchers acknowledged. Londono pointed out that while the study’s findings are \"promising,\" it was funded by Eli Lilly, the manufacturer of Zepbound. \"This may raise questions about potential conflicts of interest,\" she said. \"Additionally, the open-label design and 72-week duration may limit objectivity and long-term insight.\" An expert emphasized that people should work with a physician to choose a weight-loss medication that matches personal goals and health status.(iStock) While the study primarily looked at the impact of the medications, experts agreed there are other factors that play a role in successfulweight management. \"Weight loss is biological, but it’s also emotional, and whole-person support can make the difference between short-term results and sustainable health,\" Dr. Rekha Kumar, chief medical officer at the weight care program Found and a practicing endocrinologist in New York City, told Fox News Digital. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Kumar emphasized the importance of working with a physician to choose a weight-loss medication that matches the patient’s personal goals andhealth status. \"Both Wegovy and Zepbound have demonstrated clinically significant weight reduction.\" \"For example, if a patient has fatty liver, we will choose the GLP-1 that is proven to work best for liver disease,\" she said. Looking ahead, the researchers plan to investigate new versions of weight-loss drugs, including retatrutide, which mimics the hormones GLP-1, GIP and glucagon, according to the release. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER \"Even though drugs like tirzepatide and semaglutide work really well, better than anything we have ever seen, we still have people who don't respond to them,\" said Aronne. \"So, moving forward, we want to keep trying to do better.\" \"Across the respective clinical trial programs and in SURMOUNT-5, both Wegovy and Zepbound have demonstrated clinically significant weight reduction,\" Novo Nordisk, maker of Wegovy, said in a statement.(iStock) A spokesperson from Novo Nordisk, the company that makes Wegovy (semaglutide), sent a statement to Fox News Digital. \"Across the respective clinical trial programs and in SURMOUNT-5, both Wegovy and Zepbound have demonstrated clinically significant weight reduction,\" the company said. \"It is important to recognize that the comprehensive management of obesity goes beyond weight reduction alone.\" For more Health articles, visitwww.foxnews.com/health The spokesperson also pointed out that in aprevious trial, adults who were obese or overweight and who took Wegovy along with diet and exercise lost an average of 15.2% of their weight (~35 pounds) at the two-year mark, compared with 2.6% (~6 pounds) for patients taking a placebo.

The focus of the research, the Durupinar site in eastern Turkey, was first identified in the 1950s. For decades, it's been speculated that the boat-shaped site once harbored Noah's Ark, but no definitive proof has emerged. Now, an organization called Noah's Ark Scans believes that recent soil samples point toward the site once housing \"ancient wood.\"(See the video at the top of this article.) ARCHAEOLOGISTS MAKE GRIM DISCOVERY AFTER FINDING ANCIENT ROMAN BUILDINGS Researchers collected soil samples from the site last September and analyzed them through this winter. The results \"show significantly higher levels of organic matter and potassium compared tosurrounding areas,\" according to a recent statement from the organization. \"[The results] provide compelling evidence of a unique, potentially man-made structure beneath the surface, distinct from the surrounding mudflow,\" Noah's Ark Scans said. A group of researchers have found evidence to support a claim about where Noah's Ark could have been located.(Getty Images; NoahsArkScans.com) \"These findings suggest the presence of decayed wood or other organic materials, consistent with a large, ancient structure preserved within the mudflow,\" the statement added. Lead archaeological researcher Andrew Jones told Fox News Digital that researchers are registering 2.72 times more carbon inside the \"boat-shaped object\" compared to its immediate outside location. \"The soil composition is markedly different from the natural mudflow, indicating something extraordinary at this site.\" \"The rotting ancient wood inside the boat-shaped area is likely creating a localized soil microenvironment by lowering pH … increasing organic matter [and] elevating potassium,\" he said. ANCIENT JEWISH RITUAL BATH, OLDEST OF ITS KIND IN EUROPE, UNCOVERED BY ARCHAEOLOGISTS \"Rotting wood directly contributes to soil organic matter,\" he added. \"As wood decomposes, it breaks down into humus, a stable form oforganic matterrich in carbon.

    "title": "FBI warns of hackers exploiting outdated routers. Check yours now",
    "article_text": "In the ongoing debate over regulating social media, one company is urging parents to take matters into their own hands. We stay on top of updates for our phones and laptops. Some of us even make sure our smartwatches and security cameras are running the latest firmware. But routers often get overlooked. If it's working, we assume it's fine, but that mindset can be risky. Now, the FBI has issued a warning that cybercriminals are actively exploiting old, unpatched and outdated routers. The alert, released in May 2025, explains how aging network devices with known flaws are being hijacked by malware and used to power anonymous cybercrime operations. A forgotten device in your home can silently become a tool for attackers. Join the FREE \"CyberGuy Report\": Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to myfree \"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\"when you sign up! A router(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) The FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center published apublic service announcement on May 7, 2025, cautioning both individuals and organizations that criminals are taking advantage of outdated routers that no longer receive security patches. Devices manufactured around 2010 or earlier are especially vulnerable, as vendors have long ceased providing firmware updates for them. According to the FBI, such end-of-life routers have been breached by cyber actors using a variant of the \"TheMoon\" malware, allowing attackers to install proxy services on the devices and conduct illicit activities anonymously. In essence, home and small-office routers are being quietly conscripted into proxy networks that mask the perpetrators' identities online. The alert notes that through networks like \"5socks\" and \"Anyproxy,\" criminals have been selling access to the infected routers as proxy nodes. In these schemes, paying customers can route their internet traffic through unwitting victims' routers, obscuring their own location while the victim's device (and IP address) bears the blame. A router(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) FBI WARNS ABOUT NEW EXTORTION SCAM TARGETING SENSITIVE DATA The FBI bulletin even names specific router models as frequent targets, including: All of these devices are roughly a decade or more old and have known security vulnerabilities that were never patched once support ended. With their firmware updates long discontinued, any still in use are soft targets for attackers. WHAT EXACTLY IS A DATA BREACH? WHY SHOULD I CARE? Many recent infections stem from devices with remote administration exposed to the internet. Attackers scan for such routers, exploiting known firmware flaws without needing passwords. A single crafted web request can trick an older device into running malicious code. Once inside, malware often alters settings, opening ports or disabling security features, to maintain control and connect to external command-and-control servers. One prominent threat is TheMoon, a malware strain first seen in 2014 that exploited flaws in Linksys routers. It has since evolved into a stealthy botnet builder, transforming infected routers into proxy nodes. Instead of launching direct attacks, TheMoon reroutes third-party traffic, masking hackers' identities behind everyday home networks. Cybercrime platforms like Faceless and 5socks sell access to these infected routers as \"residential proxies,\" making them valuable assets in the digital underground. For users, a compromised router means slower connections, exposure to phishing and spyware, and potential legal trouble if criminals abuse their IP address. For businesses, the risk is even higher: Outdated routers can be exploited for deeper network intrusions, data theft and ransomware attacks. In critical sectors, the consequences can be severe, affecting safety and compliance. HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PERSONAL INFO FROM PEOPLE-SEARCH SITES A woman working on her laptop(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) 200 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA RECORDS LEAKED IN MAJOR X DATA BREACH Given the serious threats posed by outdated and compromised routers, taking proactive measures is essential. Here are six practical steps you can follow to protect your network and keep hackers at bay. 1) Replace your old router if it's no longer supported:If your router is more than five to seven years old, or if you can't find any recent updates for it on the manufacturer's website, it might be time to upgrade. Older routers often stop getting security fixes, which makes them an easy target for hackers. To check, look at the label on your router for the model number, then search online for \"[model number] firmware update.\" If the last update was years ago, consider replacing it with a newer model from a trusted brand. If you're not sure which router to get, check out my list oftop routers for the best security. It includes models with strong security features and compatibility withVPN services. 2) Keep your router's firmware updated:Your router runs software called firmware, which needs to be updated just like your phone or computer. To do this, open a web browser and type your router's IP address (often 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1), then log in using the username and password (usually found on a sticker on the router). Once inside, look for a section called \"Firmware Update,\" \"System\" or \"Administration,\" and check if an update is available. Apply it if there is one. Some newer routers also have apps that make this even easier. 3) Turn off remote access:Remote access lets you control your router from outside your home network, but it also opens the door for hackers. You can turn this off by logging into your router's settings (using the same steps as above), then finding a setting called \"Remote Management,\" \"Remote Access\" or \"WAN Access.\" Make sure this feature is disabled, then save the changes and restart your router. 4) Use a strong password for your router settings:Don't leave your router using the default login, like \"admin\" and \"password.\" That's the first thing hackers try. Change it to a long, strong password with a mix of letters, numbers and symbols. A good example would be something like T#8r2k!sG91xm4vL. Try to avoid using the same password you use elsewhere. You can usually change the login password in the \"Administration\" or \"Security\" section of the router settings. Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about mybest expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here. 5) Look out for strange behavior and act quickly:If your internet feels unusually slow, your devices randomly disconnect or your streaming buffers more than usual, it could mean something is wrong. Go into your router settings and check the list of connected devices. If you see something you don't recognize, it could be a sign of a breach. In that case, update the firmware, change your passwords and restart the router. If you're not comfortable doing this yourself, call your internet provider for help. 6) Reporting to authorities:The FBI asks that victims or those who suspect a compromise report incidents to theInternet Crime Complaint Center, which can help authorities track and mitigate broader threats. SUBSCRIBE TO KURT’S YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR QUICK VIDEO TIPS ON HOW TO WORK ALL OF YOUR TECH DEVICES This isn't just about asking everyone to upgrade their old gear. It's about the bigger issue of who's actually responsible when outdated devices turn into security risks. Most people don't think twice about the router sitting in a corner, quietly doing its job years past its prime. But attackers do. They see forgotten hardware as easy targets. The real challenge isn't just technical. It's about how manufacturers, service providers and users all handle the long tail of aging tech that still lives on in the real world.

    "article_text": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman sits down with Shannon Bream to discuss the positives and potential negatives of artificial intelligence and the importance of maintaining a lead in the AI industry over China. OpenAI has just made a move that's turning heads across the tech world. The company is acquiring io, the AI device startup founded by Jony Ive, for nearly $6.5 billion. This isn't your typical business deal. It's a collaboration between Sam Altman, who leads OpenAI, and the designer responsible for some of Apple's most iconic products, including the iPhone and Apple Watch. Together, they want to create a new generation of AI-powered devices that could completely change how we use technology. Join the FREE \"CyberGuy Report\": Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to myfree \"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\"when you sign up! OpenAI’s ChatGPT on a smartphone(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) This deal is significant for a few reasons. Jony Ive is stepping into a major creative and design role at OpenAI, bringing along his team of engineers and designers, many of whom also have Apple roots. Their mission is to build hardware that goes beyond the familiar territory of smartphones and laptops. The first product from this team is expected in 2026, and while details are still scarce, it's rumored to be a \"screenless\" AI companion. The idea is to develop something that's aware of its surroundings and designed to help users in ways that current devices simply can't. 5 AI TERMS YOU KEEP HEARING AND WHAT THEY ACTUALLY MEAN Apple, which has long been seen as the leader in design and innovation, suddenly finds itself in a tough spot. The company has struggled to keep up with therapid advancements in AI, and now OpenAI is moving directly into its territory. Investors are clearly worried, as Apple's stock dropped after the news broke. Unlike previous competitors such as Google, which tried tobeat Apple at its own game, OpenAI and Ive are taking a different approach. They're aiming to create a device that could make the iPhone feel outdated by focusing on AI-first experiences and moving away from traditional screens. Apple logo(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) 7 NEW GOOGLE AI TOOLS FROM I/O 2025 YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT So what will this new device actually look like? While Altman and Ive are keeping most details secret, they have hinted at a family of AI devices that focus on seamless, intuitive interaction rather than screens. They want to create something that understands your context, adapts to your needs and helps you connect and create in new ways, all without requiring you to stare at a display. The device won't be a phone or a pair of glasses but something entirely new that fits into your life as naturally as a MacBook or iPhone once did. OpenAI's ambition is huge. In fact, they want to ship 100 million units faster than any company has ever done with a new product, which shows just how big their vision is. AI TO MONITOR NYC SUBWAY SAFETY AS CRIME CONCERNS RISE For OpenAI, this is the largest acquisition it has ever made and marks a serious push into consumer hardware. With Jony Ive leading design, OpenAI is betting that it can outpace Apple and define the next era of personal technology. Meanwhile, Apple is under more pressure than ever to deliver on its own AI promises and to innovate beyond the incremental updates we've seen in recent years. The competition is no longer just about who makes the best phone. Now, it's about who can redefine the relationship between people and technology in the age of AI. SUBSCRIBE TO KURT’S YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR QUICK VIDEO TIPS ON HOW TO WORK ALL OF YOUR TECH DEVICES Artificial intelligence(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) It's impressive to see two visionaries like Sam Altman and Jony Ive working together on something this ambitious.

    "article_text": "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson discusses LEVA, the autonomous robot that walks, rolls and lifts 187 pounds of cargo for all-terrain deliveries. Autonomous delivery robots are already starting to change the way goods move around cities and warehouses, but most still need humans to load and unload their cargo. That's where LEVA comes in. Developed by engineers and designers from ETH Zurich and other Swiss universities, LEVA is a robot that can not only navigate tricky environments but also lift and carry heavy boxes all on its own, making deliveries smoother and more efficient. Join the FREE \"CyberGuy Report\": Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to myfree \"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\"when you sign up! Delivery robot (LEVA)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) Most delivery robots either roll on wheels or walk on legs, but LEVA combines both. It has four legs, and each leg ends with a motorized, steerable wheel. This means on smooth surfaces like sidewalks, LEVA can roll quickly and efficiently, almost like a little car. When it encounters stairs, curbs or rough ground, it locks its wheels and walks or climbs like a four-legged animal. This unique design lets LEVA handle both flat urban streets and uneven terrain with ease. Delivery robot (LEVA)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) RICE-SIZED ROBOT COULD MAKE BRAIN SURGERY SAFER AND LESS INVASIVE LEVA uses a mix of GPS, lidar sensors and five cameras placed around its body to understand its surroundings. These tools help it navigate city streets or indoor hallways while avoiding obstacles. One camera even looks downward to help LEVA line itself up perfectly when it's time to pick up or drop off cargo. Delivery robot (LEVA)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) DRIVERLESS BIG-RIG ROBOTRUCKS ARE NOW ON THE ROAD IN THIS STATE What really sets LEVA apart is its ability to load and unload cargo boxes without any human help. It spots a standard cargo box, moves right over it, lowers itself by bending its legs and then locks onto the box using powered hooks underneath its body. After securing the box, LEVA lifts itself back up and carries the load to its destination. It can handle boxes weighing up to 187 pounds, which is pretty impressive for a robot of its size. Delivery robot’s wheels (LEVA)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) CHINESE HUMANOID ROBOT WITH EAGLE EYE VISION AND POWERFUL AI LEVA is about 4 feet long and 2.5 feet wide, with an adjustable height between 2 and 3 feet. It weighs around 187 pounds and can carry the same amount of cargo. Thanks to its wheels and legs, it can move smoothly on flat surfaces, climb stairs and handle rough terrain. Its sensors and cameras give it a sharp sense of where it is and what's around it. HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PERSONAL INFO FROM PEOPLE-SEARCH SITES Delivery robot (LEVA)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) LEVA's flexibility makes it useful in many places. It could deliver packages right to your doorstep, even if you live in a building with stairs. Farmers might use it to move supplies across fields. On construction sites, it could carry tools and materials over uneven ground. It might even assist in emergency situations by bringing supplies through rubble or rough terrain. Delivery robot (LEVA)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) For folks like us, LEVA could mean faster, more reliable deliveries, especially in tricky urban areas where stairs and curbs often slow things down. For businesses, it means cutting down on the need for manual labor to load and unload heavy items, which can reduce injuries and lower costs. It also means deliveries and material handling could happen around the clock without breaks, boosting efficiency. In industries like farming, construction and emergency response, LEVA's ability to get through tough terrain while carrying heavy loads could make a big difference in how quickly and safely supplies get where they need to go. HOW SECURE IS MY PASSWORD? USE THIS TEST TO FIND OUT Delivery robot (LEVA)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) The first LEVA prototype has shown it can do a lot, but there's still work to be done. The team is improving its energy use, making it better at climbing stairs, and enhancing its ability to operate fully on its own. The goal is to have LEVA become a reliable part of automated delivery systems that work smoothly in real-world settings. SUBSCRIBE TO KURT’S YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR QUICK VIDEO TIPS ON HOW TO WORK ALL OF YOUR TECH DEVICES Delivery robot (LEVA)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) LEVA blends the best of wheels and legs with the unique ability to load and unload itself. This makes it a promising tool for industries that need robots to be flexible, strong and smart. As LEVA continues to develop, it could change the way deliveries and material transport happen, making them faster, safer and more efficient for everyone.

    "article_text": "Author Mark Gerson tells Fox News Digital why grandparents are so important to the health and well-being of their families — and why Jewish parents bless their children each week with specific guidance from the Bible. Digital parenting: Why you should reserve a domain name for your new baby We live in a world where your name online matters almost as much as your name on a birth certificate. And while it might sound like something only Silicon Valley types would do, buying a domain name and reserving social media handles for your newborn isn’t some far-fetched tech trend—it’s potentially a smart, proactive move forparentswho care about protecting their kids’ futures.  Not the typical advice you’d get from a financial expert. Think ahead, like you do with a college fund If you’re already putting away money for your child’s education, teaching them the value of hard work, and raising them with good values, why not also secure theirdigital future? For $10 to $20 a year, you can purchase a domain likejohnsmith.comoremilyjones.com—something that will be increasingly difficult (if not impossible) to get by the time they’re adults.  Just think about how hard it is to reserve a 3-letter, 4-letter, or even 5-letter domain name. It’s the digital version of buying land before a new highway goes into your neighborhood. MOM PRAISES VIRAL PARENTING TACTIC AS SHE ALLOWS HER KIDS TO PLAY BY THEMSELVES: ‘WHOLE NEW WORLD’ I’ve done this forall my kids. I didn’t do it to make them TikTok stars. I did it because, as a financial expert and a parent, I know the power of being prepared. Whether they want to start a business one day, use it for their resume, or simply create a clean professional online profile, they’ll already have the blank canvas ready to go. Don’t let Big Tech or strangers own your kid’s name Here’s the truth that most people don’t think about: if you don’t reserve yourchild’s digital name, someone else will.  Does anyone remember the Brooklyn Nets and the story of Nets.com?  When it comes to domain names, it might be a stranger, a spammer, or a foreign domain squatter. And once it's taken, good luck getting it back. We’ve already handed over too much of our personal data to Big Tech. This is a chance to take some control back. By locking down your child’s domain and social media handles early, you’re not just making a smart move—you’re protecting your family. This isn’t about oversharing Let me be crystal clear: I’m not suggesting you create a baby influencer account and post every milestone online.  We could use less of that. Quite the opposite. You don’t need to publish a single photo or make anything public. Just reserve the space. Keep it private. Hold onto it until your child is old enough to decide for themselves what they want to do with it. That’s called responsible parenting. Protect their privacy, secure their future Critics will say, \"let kids be kids.\" But protecting them doesn’t stop at locking your doors or watching who they talk to at school—it extends to the digital world, too. Reserving theironline nameis a way to give your child more freedom and flexibility later. You’re not forcing anything on them—you’re giving them options.

    "title": "Why saying 'Happy Memorial Day' misses the true meaning of the holiday",
    "article_text": "Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins joins 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss President Donald Trump's Middle East trip and and his executive order to help homeless veterans. ThisMemorial Day, many Americans will gather for barbecues, enjoy a long weekend, or mark the start of summer. But amid the festivities, one phrase you won’t—or shouldn’t—hear is \"Happy Memorial Day.\" Unlike Veterans Day which celebrates service members past and present, Memorial Day is a solemn occasion, a time to honor the American service members who made the ultimate sacrifice. To wish someone a \"happy\" Memorial Day completely misses the purpose of the day. Memorial Day, established after the Civil War and formalized as a federal holiday in 1971, is dedicated to those who died in military service. Each flag at half-staff, each wreath laid at Arlington National Cemetery, represents lives cut short—sons, daughters, parents, and friends who never returned home. Their sacrifice secured the freedoms we cherish. That’s why the words we choose on this day matter. Memorial Day actually isn’t about celebrating service members. It isn’t even a time to advocate forgreater benefitsfor our veterans. It’s a day to reflect on the sacrifice of those few brave men and women in uniform who gave their lives for our country. Accordingly, we ought to choose words that promote the true purpose of the day. TRUMP TO BUILD NATIONAL CENTER FOR HOMELESS VETERANS WITH FUNDS PREVIOUSLY SPENT ON HOUSING FOR ILLEGAL ALIENS Few learned this lesson quicker than \"Squad\" members, Rep. Ilhan Omar and former Rep. Cori Bush who received well-deserved backlash for their tone-deaf Memorial Day messages last year. Both members of congress posted messages that appeared to confuse Memorial Day with Veterans Day. Omar wrote, \"On #MemorialDay, we honor the heroic men and women who served our country,\" advocating for veterans’ access to mental health services, housing, and jobs. Bush echoed similar rhetoric, stating, \"This Memorial Day and every day, we honor our veterans in St. Louis,\" followed by a call for universal healthcare. The misguided messages earned swift rebuke from Americans, including many veterans, around the country. The social media outrage served an important purpose. The backlash was bigger than an opportunity to score political points against the Left. Americans on both sides of the aisle came together to defend the sacredness of the one day in the year completely dedicated to those who paid the ultimate sacrifice. So, the social shame attached to misunderstanding the purpose of Memorial Day is not only justified – it's necessary. In a political era marked by so much frivolity, Americans—especially those in elected leadership—ought to choose words that reflect the gravity of this day. To be clear, this isn’t about political correctness. It’s not about virtue signaling. And it certainly isn’t about promulgating more of the noxious \"language policing\" that happens so frequently on Ivy League campuses. It’s simply about protecting the solemnity of the day. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Memorial Dayis not a festive holiday, but rather one deserving of reverence. It’s a day for pause. Simply put, today is about showing proper respect to those who made it possible to enjoy freedom today. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP It is not difficult tohonor Memorial Daywith the solemnity it deserves. Simply taking a moment to reflect, to attend a local remembrance ceremony, or to learn the story of a fallen service member can have a meaningful impact. Visit a cemetery, join moments of silence, or offer support to Gold Star families. Organizations across the country hold events—large and small—to commemorate the fallen. Local veterans' groups lay wreaths, play taps, and read names aloud. Schools sometimes host programs to teach younger generations what the day is truly about. These rituals are not political or performative; they are acts of collective memory, meant to keep the stories of our nation’s heroes alive. The sacrifices of over one million Americans who died while serving in the armed forces demand a language of respect and gratitude. Of course, we can and should celebrate those who currently serve in uniform on other days throughout the year, but Memorial Day demands humility and respect for our fallen heroes. Their sacrifice deserves nothing less. Jeremy Hunt, a West Point graduate, served as a U.S. Army intelligence captain. He’s now a media fellow at Hudson Institute and chairman of Veterans on Duty, a nonprofit organization focused on national security. Follow him on X @thejeremyhunt.",

Hillary Clinton is back and doing what she does best: trashing women. She wants to make sure we know that thebasket of deplorablesis also sexist. During a conversation at the 92nd Street Y inNew York Citylast month, Clinton was asked by Margaret Hoover, host of \"Firing Line\" on PBS, if she had any advice for the eventual first female president of the United States. Clinton took this opportunity to take a swipe at Republican women. \"Well, first of all, don’t be a handmaiden to the patriarchy, which kind of eliminates every woman on the other side of the aisle, except for very few.\" HILLARY CLINTON BASHES REPUBLICAN WOMEN, SAYS GOP FEMALE PRESIDENT WOULD BE 'HANDMAIDEN TO THE PATRIARCHY' Most Republican women are just \"handmaidens to the patriarchy,\" just there to support the men, according to her. Would Hillary Clinton ever do such a thing? Clinton first rose to prominence because her husband was governor ofArkansasand then president of the United States. On his coattails she later became a U.S. senator from New York. After she ran for president and lost the nomination toBarack Obama, she was appointed Secretary of State, yes, by a man. Former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton took a swipe at future female Republican Party leaders recently at an event in New York City. Clinton called on the future first female Republican president of the United States not to serve as \"a handmaiden to the patriarchy.\"(Getty Images) While president,Bill Clintoncarried on an affair with a White House intern and then lied about it under oath. He was impeached by the House of Representatives for perjury and obstructing justice. During the time that he engaged in this cover-up, his wife Hillary was out in front lambasting Republicans for daring to challenge her husband. She coined the phrase \"vast rightwing conspiracy\" to wave away the charges against him. President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former President George W.

When Bill Clinton was running for president in 1992, he was dogged by accusations he had had a longtime affair with Gennifer Flowers. Hillary Clinton, no girl’s girl, denied that her husband would do such a thing and added \"You know, I’m not sitting here, some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette.\" It wasn’t enough to defend her husband. Hillary had to take a shot at women who made the same choice she would end up making, to stand by her man. Criticizing other women to defend a man, is there anything more patriarchal? Her husband wasn’t the only man Hillary Clinton would protect and defend in this way. In aNew York Times storyafter Harvey Weinstein was exposed as a sexual predator, two well-known women said that they warned Hillary Clinton’s team about her close relationship with Weinstein. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Actress Lena Dunham and magazine publisher Tina Brown both made explicit warnings about Weinstein to Hillary Clinton’s team during both of her presidential races. After the accusations against Weinstein became public, Hillary’s team issued a statement hitting back at Dunham specifically for contacting them instead of going to authorities, noting \"Only she can answer why she would tell them instead of those who could stop him.\" Some champion of women. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Hillary doesn’t like when women won’t do as they are told. In 2018, still bitter over her drubbing in the 2016 presidential election byDonald Trump, Clinton said women who didn’t vote for her were just doing the bidding of the men in their lives. \"We do not do well with white men and we don’t do well with married, white women,\" Clinton said. \"And part of that is an identification with the Republican Party, and a sort of ongoing pressure to vote the way your husband, your boss, your son, whoever, believes you should.\" It couldn’t be that women had considered her candidacy and found it wanting. According to her, it must be that men had told these women how to vote. Hillary always took swipes at women so her latest comments are nothing new. The eventual female president should consider not using women as a punching bag to attain her goals. Thankfully, that president won’t be Hillary Clinton.

    "title": "Freedom isn't free: Honor those who never came home on this Memorial Day",
    "article_text": "Actor Gary Sinise joins ‘Fox & Friends’ to discuss his new film following Iraq war veterans, and their experiences post-war. Memorial Day should make you a little uncomfortable. Because sacrifice should never be comfortable. But from that discomfort can come gratitude. And from gratitude, a commitment to live better—not in guilt, but in honor. And yet sadly, for most Americans, it merely marks the start of summer. It’s beach chairs and burgers, sales and three-day weekends—a reprieve from work with little thought given to the sacrifice this day was meant to honor. But for those of us who’ve stood on foreign soil, witness to teammates who never came home,Memorial Dayis a haunting—but beautiful— reckoning we face each year. There’s a harsh truth about war that never leaves you: the fallen gave everything in an instant—and the living carry it for a lifetime. ON MEMORIAL DAY, LEE GREENWOOD REMEMBERS AMERICA'S HEROES: ‘NEVER TAKE FREEDOM FOR GRANTED’ We, like other generations before us, have lost teammates, more than we care to count, some to bullets and bombs, others to the invisible wounds they carried back with them. Brave souls who gave everything—not for politics or glory—but for love of country and you. For an ideal, theAmerican idealof what we stand for and the potential of what we can become. And therein lies the covenant between the living and the fallen: they laid down their lives for a belief, an ideal—an unbreakable faith in us and our potential to become something greater. This is hard to explain to those who haven’t served, and we don’t blame anyone for that. Less than 1% of Americans serve in the armed forces today. Only about 5% of Americans have ever worn the uniform. Most live free of any direct connection to war. That’s not a condemnation—it’s a consequence of the freedoms we enjoy, protected by those willing to fight and die for them. But that disconnection has made Memorial Day more misunderstood and underappreciated with each passing year. One way to bridge that divide is to listen—to learn the stories of those who gave everything. This Memorial Day, FOX Nation is releasing a powerful new series, \"The Unsung of Arlington,\" honoring five extraordinary Americans laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery. From John Glenn to Jane Delano, their lives remind us what courage, sacrifice, and unwavering belief in this nation truly look like. The series doesn’t just tell their stories—it keeps their legacies alive. If you’ve ever wondered how to honor the fallen, start by learning who they were. Memorial Dayis not about glorifying war. It’s about honoring those who gave up everything so the rest of us could live in peace, prosperity, and yes—comfort. It’s about men and women like Darrik Benson (USN), John Brown (USAF), Shannon Kent (USN), Joshua Wheeler (USA), Edward Smith (USMC), and countless others whose names never made headlines but whose legacies live on in the quiet grief of Gold Star families and the unwavering loyalty of those who fought beside them. Memorial Day is not a celebration—it’s a remembrance of both their sacrifice and the covenant left upon us. A day when the living should ask themselves one question: Am I living a life worthy of their sacrifice? No one is asking you to feel guilty. They fought so you wouldn’t have to. But what they ask—what they hope—is that for one day out of the year, Americans pause to reflect on the cost of the freedoms they so casually enjoy. Reflect on the blessings of safety, security, and opportunity. Reflect on the cost paid by strangers so that your kids can play in the yard without fear. And maybe—do something more. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Teach your kids about the meaning of the day. Toast to the fallen. Or simply take a moment of silence—real silence. That silence—that discomfort—is where gratitude begins. And from gratitude comes action. This Memorial Day, enjoy your freedom. But don’t forget where it came from. It’s not a holiday. It’s a headstone. For those of us who came home, for those who never did, and for those who never had to go—it’s a covenant. One that we, as Americans, cannot and must not ever break.

The verdict, delivered after a three-year trial in Braunschweig, Germany, marked the latest chapter in a 10-year-long saga that reshaped the continent’s relationship with diesel technology. Jens Hadler, who oversaw diesel engine development, received the harshest sentence of four and a half years for orchestrating what judges called “particularly serious” fraud. His team had installed software allowing vehicles to recognize emissions testing, temporarily increasing pollution controls during inspections while running dirty the rest of the time. The scandal’s impact extended far beyond corporate boardrooms. Before 2015, diesel vehicles commanded over half of Europe’s car market, marketed as environmentally friendly alternatives to gasoline. Today, that figure has collapsed to just 10% of new car sales. The whole affair also accelerated Europe’s transition toward electrification. Electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids now account for 25% of new car sales, while Volkswagen itself has become Europe’s leading EV manufacturer, selling three times as many battery-powered cars as Tesla in April,reports The New York Times.

That has sent Big Tech companies scrambling to secure generating capacity for their data centers. For many, that has meantturning to nuclear fission. The power source has been experiencing a resurgence in the last few years following decades of plant closures. (Fission, used in all current nuclear plants, is distinct from fusion, the still-experimental approach to getting power from atoms that,while attracting investors, has yet to produce more electricity than it consumes.) For tech companies, part of the appeal of fission is a stable, predictable source of power that flows 24/7, giving their data centers the potential to run computing loads whenever they require it. But another part of the appeal lies in new reactor designs that promise to overcome the shortcomings of existing nuclear power plants. Where old power plants were built around massive reactors that could generate over 1 gigawatt of electricity, new small modular reactor (SMR) designs see multiple modules deployed alongside each other to meet a range of needs. SMRs rely on mass manufacturing to bring costs down, but to date, no one has built one in the U.S. Still, that hasn’t keptAmazon,Google,Meta, andMicrosoftaway from the table. They’ve either signed agreements to buy power from nuclear startups or invested in them directly — or both. Here are the nuclear fission startups backed by Big Tech. Kairos Powerreceived a vote of confidence from Google when the search giantpromised to buyaround 500 megawatts of electricity by 2035, with the first reactor targeted to come online by 2030. The company’s small modular reactors rely on molten fluoride salt for cooling and to transport heat to a steam turbine. The salt’s high boiling point means that the coolant doesn’t need to be kept at high pressure, which should improve operating safety. The reactors contain fuel pebbles coated in carbon and ceramic shells, which should be strong enough to withstand a meltdown. The Alameda-based startup has received a$629 millionaward from the U.S. government, including $303 million from the Department of Energy. In November 2024,Kairos received approvalfrom the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to commence construction on two reactors in Tennessee. At 35 megawatts, the test units will be smaller than Kairos’ eventual commercial reactors, which are expected to generate 75 megawatts each. Oklois another SMR company targeting the data center world — no surprise given that it was backed by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who alsotook the nuclear startup publicvia a reverse merger with his special purpose acquisition vehicle, AltC, in July 2023. Altman served as chairman of Oklo until April, when he stepped down as OpenAI began negotiating with Oklo for an energy supply agreement. DCVC, Draper Associates, and Peter Thiel’s Mithril Capital Management are among the startup’s previous investors. Cooled by liquid metal, Oklo’s reactor is based on an existing U.S. Department of Energy design that’s intended to reduce the amount of nuclear waste that results from regular operations. Still, Oklo’s path hasn’t been a smooth one. The company’sfirst license applicationwas denied in January 2022. Oklo has said it will resubmit the application sometime in 2025. But that hasn’t stopped the company fromlanding a dealto supply data center operator Switch with 12 gigawatts by 2044. Like Kairos,Saltfoss, formerly known as Seaborg, also wants to build SMRs cooled by molten salt. But unlike Kairos and others, it envisions placing two to eight of them on a ship to create what it calls a Power Barge. The startup has raised nearly $60 million, including a $6 million seed round that included investments from Bill Gates, Peter Thiel, and Unity co-founderDavid Helgason, according to PitchBook. Satlfoss has an agreement with Samsung Heavy Industries to build the ships and the Satlfoss-designed reactors. Founded by Bill Gates,TerraPoweris building a larger reactor, called Natrium, which is cooled by liquid sodium and features molten salt energy storage. The company broke ground on the first power plant in June 2024 in Wyoming. The Natrium design calls for the reactor to generate 345 megawatts of electricity. That’s smaller than other new nuclear plants today but larger than most SMR designs. But Natrium has a trick up its sleeve with its molten salt heat storage system. Since nuclear reactors operate best at a steady state, the Natrium reactor can continue breaking atoms when demand is low, and the extra energy is stored as heat in a vat of molten salt, which can be drawn upon later to generate electricity. Investors include Gates’ Cascade Investment fund, Khosla Ventures, CRV, and ArcelorMittal. X-Energylanded a hefty$700 million Series C-1last year led by Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund. At the same time, the SMR startup announced two development agreements that would see the deployment of 300 megawatts of new nuclear generating capacity in the Pacific Northwest and Virginia. The company’s high-temperature, gas-cooled reactors buck recent trends in the U.S. and Europe, where the design has been shunned in favor of other approaches. The company’s Xe-100 reactor is expected to generate 80 megawatts of electricity. Helium gas flows through the reactor’s 200,000 billiard ball-sized fuel “pebbles,” absorbing heat to spin a steam turbine.

    "title": "'It missed us by inches': Witnesses describe car driving into crowd at Liverpool FC parade",
    "article_text": "Witnesses have described the \"horrendous\" moment a car \"rammed\" into a crowd of people who were attending Liverpool FC's victory parade following their Premier League win. Merseyside Police said a number of pedestrians were hit by the vehicle in Water Street, Liverpool just after 18:00 BST. Dozens were injured, two of them seriously, with 27 treated in hospital. A 53-year-old white British man from the Liverpool area was arrested, police said, adding that he is believed to have been the driver. One eyewitness, BBC reporter Matt Cole, said the car missed him and his family \"by literally inches\". \"We had just moments before watched fireworks going off, the celebrations of the Liverpool bus passing us on the Strand,\" he said. He said an ambulance had just made its way through the \"dense\" crowd he was part of on Water Street, when \"there were screams ahead of us and suddenly this dark blue car just came through the crowd\". \"It just wasn't stopping - I managed to grab my daughter who was with me and jump out of the way. \"It missed myself and my family by literally inches.\" He said the ambulance acted like a \"natural barrier... that slowed the car down\", but that it had \"no intention - it appeared - of stopping\". He added that the car looked to be travelling at \"more than 20 [mph]\", but that he could not be sure it was not 30mph. \"As it passed me, it was being chased by a group of men who were trying to bang on the side of it and throw things at it,\" he explained, adding that the rear windshield had been \"completely smashed in\". Having moved to safety down a side street, he saw police \"running from all over, ambulances, police vans... more and more ambulances, more and more police vans - at one point then an entire squad of armed police cars stopped and people jumped out with rifles and again big medical packs on and began running towards the scene of the incident.\" He said his initial assumption was that the driver just wanted to \"barge through crowds because they didn't want to wait\". \"But suddenly then, the speed registered and the shouts of the people and the screams of the people registered, and at that point, yeah, adrenaline very much just kicks in\". Harry Rashid, 48, from Solihull, was at the parade with his wife and two young daughters when he witnessed the car pull up before it \"just rammed into all the people at the side of us\". He told PA news agency: \"It was extremely fast. Initially, we just heard the pop, pop, pop of people just being knocked off the bonnet of a car.... I saw people on lying on the ground, people unconscious. \"It was horrendous. So horrendous.\" Off-duty BBC reporter Dan Ogunshakin, who was in the city for the parade, said \"suddenly a lot of people started to surround\" a car, which was front of an ambulance that was moving through the crowd. He said he and his friend then noticed \"people were hitting the car and shaking the car and we wondered why this was suddenly happening\". The car then reversed and knocked people away from it, he explained, then \"it suddenly accelerated forwards\" straight towards the crowd of people. \"People scattered like bowling pins.\" \"What had once been an atmosphere of celebration and joy and happiness suddenly turned into fear and terror and disbelief,\" he said, adding it become \"hell on Earth\". Matthew O'Carroll, 28, from Runcorn said he had approached the top of Water Street when the car \"came past a parked police van at a decent speed\". \"People managed to get out of the way as he was beeping as he went through but as he went past, people were obviously very angry and so started running after the car. \"The back window of the car was already smashed. \"I thought that once it went past us, it was just someone that was trying to get away from something and would slow down when he got to more people.\" Another witness, Mike Maddra, was walking with a group of friends, when he saw a car \"speeding up\" and hitting pedestrians. He said the \"car turned left, mounted pavement, come towards us and runs towards the buildings\". He added that he thought he saw two people being hit, and that \"it looked deliberate\". \"It has just ruined the day really,\" he said.",

    "title": "Liverpool FC parade: What we know so far",
    "article_text": "A 53-year-old man has been arrested after a car hit a number of pedestrians in Liverpool city centre during the Premier League victory parade. Eyewitnesses and videos shared on social media have shown the vehicle driving through a crowd as people scatter. Details are still emerging but here is what we know so far. A car collided with a number of pedestrians on Water Street just after 18:00,  Merseyside Police said. In a statement the force said: \"We were contacted at just after 18:00 today, Monday 26 May, following reports a car had been in collision with a number of pedestrians on Water Street. \"The car stopped at the scene and a male has been detained.\" Police later said a 53-year-old white British man from the Liverpool area had been arrested and that he was believed to be the driver. The incident is not being treated as terror-related and is believed to be isolated, police said. The ambulance service said 27 people had been taken to hospital for treatment, with two, including one child, seriously injured. Another 20 people were treated for injuries at the scene. Four children were among the injured. Four people including a child were lifted from beneath the car, Merseyside chief fire  Nick Searle said. Video from the scene shows the car ploughing into the a group of people then speeding up before coming to a halt. Other footage shows people striking the car after it stopped, with the back windscreen shattered. Numerous emergency service vehicles attended the scene. One eyewitness, BBC reporter Matt Cole, described seeing a car coming through the crowd that \"just wasn't stopping\". He said it was being chased by a group of men \"who were trying to bang on the side of it and throw things at it\". He estimated the car was travelling at \"more than 20 [mph]\". He said his initial assumption was that the driver just wanted to \"barge through crowds because they didn't want to wait\". Another witness, Matthew O'Carroll, 28, from Runcorn, saw the car approaching the top of Water Street. He said the vehicle had been going at a \"decent\" speed and that the driver had been beeping as he went through the crowd. Water Street is near the Strand, where moments before the incident occurred Liverpool FC had paraded the Premier League trophy from the top of a bus. Thousands of people had come out to celebrate the team's victory. The incident happened about a mile before the parade's finishing point. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is being kept updated on the latest developments. He posted on X: \"The scenes in Liverpool are appalling - my thoughts are with all those injured or affected. \"I want to thank the police and emergency services for their swift and ongoing response to this shocking incident.\" Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the pictures were \"deeply worrying\". \"My thoughts are with all those affected, and the emergency services as they respond to what appears a horrific incident,\" she said. Liverpool FC said it was in contact with the police and its \"thoughts and prayers are with those who have been affected by this serious incident\", while rivalsEverton FC echoed the sentiment. Liverpool said in a statement: \"Our thoughts and prayers are with those who have been affected by this serious incident. We will continue to offer our full support to the emergency services and local authorities who are dealing with this incident.\" Liverpool's staff celebrations are understood to have been postponed because of the incident. The Premier League has also released a statement, saying \"everyone at the Premier League is shocked by the appalling events in Liverpool this evening, and our heartfelt thoughts go out to all those injured and affected. \"We have been in contact with Liverpool FC and have offered our full support following this serious incident.\" An off-duty BBC reporter who was attending the parade called it \"hell on Earth\".

    "title": "Greek coastguards charged over 2023 migrant shipwreck",
    "article_text": "A naval court in Greece has charged 17 coastguards over the deadliest migrant boat disaster in the Mediterranean Sea for a decade. Up to 650 people were feared to have drowned when the overcrowded Adriana fishing vessel sank near Pylos, off the Greek coast, in the early hours of 14 June 2023. Survivors later told the BBC that Greek coastguards had caused their boat to capsize in a botched attempt to tow it and then silenced witnesses. \"It has taken us two years just for these charges to come, even though so many people witnessed what happened,\" one of the survivors, a Syrian man we called Ahmad, said on Monday. The Greek authorities have always denied the claims against them. The Deputy Prosecutor of the Piraeus Naval Court has found that 17 members of the Hellenic Coast Guard should face criminal charges. Among them is the captain of the coastguard ship, the LS-920, who is charged with \"causing a shipwreck\", leading to the deaths of \"at least 82 people\". This corresponds to the number of bodies recovered, although it is thought as many as an additional 500 people drowned, including women and children who were all below deck. The disaster occurred in international waters - but within Greece's rescue zone. The then-Chief of the Coast Guard and the Supervisor of the National Search and Rescue Coordination Centre in Piraeus are among four officials charged with \"exposing others to danger\". The captain of the LS-920 is also charged with \"dangerous interference of maritime transport\" as well as a \"failure to provide assistance\" to the migrant boat. The crew of the ship are charged for \"simple complicity\" in all the acts allegedly committed by the captain. A coastguard ship had been monitoring the Adriana for 15 hours before it sank. It had left Libya for Italy with an estimated 750 people on board. Only 104 of them are known to have survived. We've been investigating since the day of the disaster and our series of findings has cast serious doubt on the official Greek version of events. Within a week, weobtained shipping datawhich challenged the claim the migrant boat had not been in trouble and so did not need to be rescued. A month later, survivors told usthe coastguard had caused their boat to sink in a disastrous effortto tow it and then forced witnessed to stay silent. Last year,a case against nine Egyptians was thrown out, amid claims they had been scapegoated by the Greek authorities. Earlier this year,audio recordings emergedwhich further challenged the official Greek version of events. We first met Syrian refugees, who we called Ahmad and Musaab to protect their identities, a month after the disaster. They said they each paid $4,500 (£3,480) for a spot on the boat. Ahmad's younger brother was also on board and did not survive. Musaab described to us the moment when - he alleged - the Greek coastguards caused their boat to sink. \"They attached a rope from the left,\" he said. \"Everyone moved to the right side of our boat to balance it. The Greek vessel moved off quickly causing our boat to flip. They kept dragging it for quite a distance.\" The men claimed that once on land, in the port of Kalamata, the coastguard told survivors to \"shut up\" when they started to talk about how the Greek authorities had caused the disaster. \"When people replied by saying the Greek coastguard was the cause, the official in charge of the questioning asked the interpreter to tell the interviewee to stop talking,\" Ahmad said. He said officials shouted: \"You have survived death. Stop talking about the incident Don't ask more questions about it.\" Today Ahmad - who is now living in Germany - said he felt vindicated by the charges that had been brought. \"I'm very happy they are eventually being held accountable for all that they have committed, but until I see them in prison nothing has been done yet,\" he said. \"To be honest, the Greek legal system is very unreliable.\" The joint legal team representing survivors and victims of the disaster said the decision to pursue a case against the 17 coastguards was a big step forward towards justice being done. In a statement it said: \"Almost two years after the Pylos shipwreck, the prosecution and referral to main investigation for felonies of 17 members of the Coast Guard, including senior officers of its leadership, constitutes a substantial and self-evident development in the course of vindication of the victims and the delivery of justice.\" It is understood the 17 men who have now been charged will be questioned in the coming weeks by the Deputy Prosecutor of the Piraeus Naval Court. The court will then decide whether to send them to full trial or dismiss the charges. It is not immediately clear what punishment the coastguards could receive if found guilty. Greece has previously told the BBC its Coast Guard fully respects human rights and has rescued more than 250,000 people at sea in the past decade. Former British soldier describes smuggling dozens of Vietnamese into marinas in English seaside towns. Dark kitchens are some of the places being targeted by immigration officers to find illegal workers. Those rescued include a child and their mother, who were airlifted to hospital in France. The prime minister promises numbers will fall 'significantly' under new immigration rules. Most of the children who attend were born in the UK and speak little or no Romanian.",

    "title": "Apprenticeship shake-up to shift focus to under-21s",
    "article_text": "The government is promising more training for under-21s in England, as it presses ahead with controversial plans to scrap funding for postgraduate apprenticeships. Only students under the age of 21 will qualify for funding for level 7 apprenticeships – the highest level, considered equivalent to a master's degree - under the plans confirmed on Tuesday. This means many higher apprenticeships would have to be completely paid for by employers. The Conservatives have previously described the proposals as a disaster which could undermine advanced NHS training. Apprenticeships in England are available for those aged 16 and over, and combine practical training in a job with study. They take between one and five years to complete, depending on their level. A level 2 apprenticeship is considered the equivalent of a GCSE, while 6 and 7 are considered equivalent to a bachelor's or master's degree. Overall the government is promising to create 120,000 more training opportunities for young adults, and those who need to retrain. An increase in a charge paid by employers recruiting from outside the UK will be used to create 45,000 training places, building on existing programmes aimed at helping adults get into work. The big shift in Tuesday's announcement is to pull funding from the highest level apprenticeships, equivalent to a postgraduate or masters degree. These level 7 apprenticeships are used by people training in a wide variety of roles, including accountants, tax advisors and solicitors, most of whom are already in work. They are also a significant part of some NHS advanced training, such as for district nurses who want to a more specialist qualification. Since an apprenticeship levy for large employers was introduced in 2017, there has been a boom in higher qualifications at degree or postgraduate level, called level 6 or level 7. However, the numbers of young adults starting entry apprenticeships at level 2 has fallen. Tuesday's announcement is an attempt to push more of the money generated by the apprenticeship levy paid to government towards those under the age of 21. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said \"When we invest in skills for young people, we invest in a shared, stronger economic future.\" But Neil O'Brien, shadow education minister, said: \"The decision to scrap higher apprenticeships will do damage to the public services, particularly the NHS. \"It will make it impossible for many young people who don't go university to enter the professions.\" Among the other changes are seven new foundation apprenticeships in sectors such as health and social care, engineering and construction. These are at the level of GCSEs and are intended to provide a broad introduction to work before students specialise. Young adults could then go on to study for specific jobs. Chachomwe Chiwaya, who is doing a level 2 apprenticeship in hospitality at Leeds City College, told BBC News the course and the experience of working front-of-house in a café has given her more self-belief. \"I've not always been as confident as I am now,\" the 21-year-old says. \"I've always been a shy kid growing up, so it takes a while for my confidence to grow. \"But with this apprenticeship, it gets me out of my comfort zone, it gets me talking to customers, and I've made some good relationships with them.\" She says she dreams of working abroad in a hotel, either as a receptionist or restaurant staff, or on a cruise ship - \"anything that let's me see the world\", she says. Isabel Hunt, 19, says she does not remember much talk of apprenticeships when she was at school, and felt like pupils were pushed towards college or university instead. She recently progressed to a level 3 hospitality apprenticeship at Leeds City College, and is working towards retaking her maths GCSE. \"It gives you so many opportunities,\" she says. \"You're getting the experience and learning on the job.\" She says she is keeping her options open but wants to stay in the hospitality industry going forward.

    "title": "Kremlin calls Trump 'emotional' after US president says Putin is 'crazy'",
    "article_text": "The Kremlin claimed Donald Trump was showing signs of \"emotional overload\" after he called Vladimir Putin \"absolutely crazy\" following Moscow's largest aerial assault on Ukraine. The US president said on Truth Social on Sunday that \"something has happened\" to Putin, after Russia killed 13 in Ukraine with 367 drones and missiles. \"He has gone absolutely crazy,\" Trump said. \"Needlessly killing a lot of people.\" Dmitry Peskov, Putin's spokesman, said the comments were \"connected to an emotional overload of everyone involved\". Germany's chancellor, Friedrich Merz, meanwhile said that Ukraine's allies had removed all range limits on supplied arms, amid reports he would give Kyiv Taurus missiles. Trump's comments followed Russia's largest combined aerial attack since its full-scale invasion of February 2022. At least 13 people were killed and dozens injured in Ukraine during the night between Saturday and Sunday after Russia fired 367 drones and missiles. Between Sunday evening and Monday morning, Russia launched 355 drones against Ukraine, killing 10. The Ukrainian air force said it was the largest attack yet conducted with drones alone. Peskov said the latest aerial assaults were a response to Ukrainian attacks on Russia's \"social infrastructure\". The Russian defence ministry said that air defence systems destroyed 20 Ukrainian drones over several Russian regions. Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine's president, said on Sunday there was no \"military sense\" to Russia's aerial attacks - rather they were \"an obvious political choice... by Putin, a choice by Russia... to continue the war and destroy lives.\" In an apparent response to the Russian attacks over the weekend, German chancellor Merz said there were \"no longer\" range restrictions on arms supplied to Ukraine. \"This means that Ukraine can now defend itself, for example, by attacking military positions in Russia... with very few exceptions, it didn't do that until recently. It can now do that,\" Merz said. Reuters reported that Zelensky was due to travel to Berlin on Wednesday, although this has not been confirmed. The BBC approached the Chancellery for comment on whether Merz's statement suggested an announcement was imminent on the supply of Taurus missiles - something that the previous German government refused to do. Last year, the UK said that Ukraine had the right to decide how to use British supplied weapons in its defence. In November, then-US president Joe Biden gave Ukraine permission to use long-range missiles supplied by the US to strike Russia,albeit with limitations. The Taurus missile has a range of about 500km - a far greater distance than other systems supplied by Ukraine's allies. Russia said supply of the weapon would be \"a dangerous move\". Speaking in New Jersey late on Sunday, Trump said of Putin: \"I've known him a long time, always gotten along with him, but he's sending rockets into cities and killing people, and I don't like it at all.\" He also said he was considering increasing US sanctions on Russia - something he has repeatedly threatened to do before. Trump posted his \"crazy\" remark shortly afterwards, adding on Truth Social: \"I've always said that he wants all of Ukraine, not just a piece of it, and maybe that's proving to be right, but if he does, it will lead to the downfall of Russia!\" But the US president also had strong words for Zelensky, saying that he was \"doing his country no favours by talking the way he does\". \"Everything out of his mouth causes problems, I don't like it, and it better stop,\" Trump wrote of Zelensky. Despite Kyiv's European allies preparing further sanctions for Russia, the US has said it will either continue trying to broker these peace talks, or \"walk away\" if progress does not follow. Peskov said on Monday that Russia was \"truly grateful\" to the Americans and \"personally to President Trump\" for their help in organising and launching this negotiation process. Last week, Trump and Putin had a two-hour phone call to discuss a US-proposed ceasefire deal to halt the fighting. The US president said he believed the call had gone \"very well\", adding that Russia and Ukraine would \"immediately start\" negotiations toward a ceasefire and \"an end to the war\". Ukraine has publicly agreed to a 30-day ceasefire but Putin has only said Russia will work with Ukraine to craft a \"memorandum\" on a \"possible future peace\" - a move described by Kyiv and its European allies as delaying tactics. The first direct Ukrainian-Russian talks since 2022 were held on 16 May in Istanbul, Turkey. Aside from a major prisoner of war swap last week, there was little or no progress on bringing a pause in fighting closer. Russia currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory. This includes Crimea - Ukraine's southern peninsula annexed by Moscow in 2014. The driver was taken to hospital with non-life threatening injuries. Authorities say Grant Hardin, 56, escaped prison wearing clothes \"designed to mimic law enforcement\". The King and Queen will be arriving in Canada on Monday for a visit seen as a symbol of support. An audit uncovers an alleged scam where applicants were required to pay more than the published fee. The US president has attended a Memorial Day ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, near Washington DC.",

    "title": "Israeli strike kills dozens sheltering in Gaza school, officials say",
    "article_text": "At least54 Palestinians have been killed - most of them in a school building sheltering displaced families - during Israeli air strikes on Gaza overnight, hospital directors have told the BBC. Fahmi Al-Jargawi School in Gaza City was housing hundreds of peoplefrom Beit Lahia, currently under intense Israeli military assault. At least 35 were reported to have been killed when the school was hit. Gaza's Hamas-run Civil Defence said multiple bodies, including those of children, were recovered – many severely burned, after fires engulfed two classrooms serving as living quarters. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had targeted \"a Hamas and Islamic Jihad command and control centre\" there. The IDF said the area was being used \"by the terrorists to plan... attacks against Israeli civilians and IDF troops\", and accused Hamas of using \"the Gazan population as human shields\". Video footage shared online showed large fires consuming parts of the school, with graphic images of severely burned victims, including children, and survivors suffering critical injuries. Faris Afana, Northern Gaza ambulance service manager, said he arrived at the scene with crews to find three classrooms ablaze. \"There were sleeping children and women in those classrooms,\" he said. \"Some of them were screaming but we couldn't rescue them due to the fires. \"I cannot describe what we saw due to how horrific it was.\" Local reports said the head of investigations for the Hamas police in northern Gaza, Mohammad Al-Kasih, was among the dead, along with his wife and children. Separately, a strike on a house in Jabalia in northern Gaza killed 19 people, according to the director of al-Ahli hospital Dr Fadel el-Naim. The Israeli military has not yet commented on what was being targeted. The twin attacks are part of a broader Israeli offensive that has escalated in the northern part of the enclave over the past week. The IDF said it hit 200 targets across Gaza in 48 hours as it continued its operations against what it called \"terrorist organisations\". Meanwhile, a senior Hamas official told the BBC on Monday that the group had agreed to the latest ceasefire proposal offered by US special envoy Steve Witkoff. However, Witkoff told Reuters that what he had seen was \"completely unacceptable\" and that the proposal being discussed was not the same as his. A Palestinian official familiar with the talks said the plan agreed to by Hamas includes the release of 10 Israeli hostages held by the group in two phases. In exchange, there would be a 70-day truce, a gradual partial withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, and the release of an agreed number of Palestinian prisoners, including several hundred serving long or life sentences. The BBC has approached the Israeli government for comment on the proposal. Israeli media quoted anonymous Israeli officials as saying the plan would be rejected. As mediation efforts continued, an Israeli strike on the home of a Palestinian doctor in Gaza killed nine of her 10 children on Friday. Dr Alaa al-Najjar's 11-year-old son was injured, along with her husband, Hamdi al-Najjar, who is in critical condition. The nine children - Yahya, Rakan, Raslan, Gebran, Eve, Rival, Sayden, Luqman and Sidra - were aged between just a few months old and 12. The Israeli military has said the incident is under review. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said two of its staff were killed in a strike on their home in Khan Younis the following day. The killing of Ibrahim Eid, a weapon contamination officer, and Ahmad Abu Hilal, a security guard at the Red Cross Field Hospital in Rafah \"points to the intolerable civilian death toll in Gaza\", the ICRC said, repeating its call for a ceasefire. On Sunday, the head of acontroversial US and Israeli-approved organisationplanning to use private firms to deliver aid to Gaza resigned. In a statement by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), executive director Jake Wood said it had become apparent that plans to set up distribution hubs would not meet the \"humanitarian principles\" of independence and neutrality. The UN and various humanitarian organisations have said they will not co-operate with the GHF, accusing it of being discriminatory over who will receive food. Israel imposed a total blockade on Gaza on 2 March that lasted 11 weeks before it allowed limited aid to enter the territory in the face of warnings of famine and mounting international outrage. The Israeli military body responsible for humanitarian affairs in Gaza, Cogat, said 107 lorries carrying aid were allowed into Gaza on Sunday. The UN says much more aid - between 500 to 600 lorries a day - is needed. Meanwhile, 20 countries and organisations met in Madrid on Sunday to discuss ending the war in Gaza. Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares called for an arms embargo on Israel if it did not stop its attacks. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to Hamas's cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. Fifty-seven are still being held, about 20 of whom are assumed to be alive. At least 53,939 people, including at least 16,500 children, have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry. Additional reporting by Helen Sullivan and Gabriela Pomeroy Officials say a 28-year-old with US citizenship had Molotov cocktails in his backpack and called for \"death to America\". A British surgeon working in Nasser Hospital said he had operated on the doctor's surviving 11-year-old. This has been a tumultuous week for the Jewish state, the BBC's Paul Adams writes. The UK, France and Canada condemned the expanded Israeli military operation in Gaza this week. Police say the victims, a young couple, were shot by a man who shouted \"free, free Palestine\".",

    "article_text": "Fake discounts, pressure selling, and other practices on Chinese fast-fashion website Shein breach the law, the European Union (EU) has said. The bloc said it has given Shein one month to respond to its findings or face fines based on its sales in the EU countries where it says it has breached the law. \"It's now for Shein to step up, respect the rules and bring its practices fully in line with EU consumer standards,\" said EU justice commissioner Michael McGrath. A Shein spokesperson said: \"Our priority remains ensuring that European consumers can have a safe, reliable, and enjoyable online shopping experience.\" The EU said on Monday its ongoing investigation from the EU's consumer rights enforcer found \"a broad range of practices with which consumers are confronted while shopping on Shein and that are in breach of EU law\". This included misleading information, deceptive product labels, misleading sustainability claims, and hidden contact details. It also found instances of pretending to offer better deals by showing price reductions that were not based on the actual prior prices, and fake deadlines to put consumers under pressure to buy. The EU has also asked Shein to make sure its product reviews and ratings are \"not presented to consumers in a misleading manner\". \"All companies reaching out to EU consumers must play by our rules. Today's action sends a clear message: we will not shy away from holding e-commerce platforms to account, regardless of where they are based,\" said McGrath. A Shein spokesperson said it has been \"working constructively with national consumers authorities and the EU Commission to demonstrate our commitment to complying with EU laws and regulations, and we are continuing to engage in this process to address any concerns\". Shein has come under fire for its business practices before, witha January BBC report revealing some staff were working 75-hour weeks, in breach of Chinese labour laws. That same month, Shein was accused of\"wilful ignorance\" by MPs in the UKafter its lawyer repeatedly refused to answer questions about where the retailer sources its cotton. In response to the BBC investigation into worker conditions, Shein said it is \"committed to ensuring the fair and dignified treatment of all workers within our supply chain\", and that it is investing tens of millions of dollars in strengthening governance and compliance. \"We strive to set the highest standards for pay and we require that all supply chain partners adhere to our code of conduct,\" it said.

    "title": "Swinney accuses Reform of racism over Sarwar advert",
    "article_text": "First Minister John Swinney has accused Reform UK of a \"racist attack\" on Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar. Both the SNP and Labour have complained to Facebook's parent company Meta about a Reform advert running on the site ahead of a South Lanarkshire by-election. The video features text claiming Sarwar \"will prioritise the Pakistani community\". Reform has denied the video is racist and said it has no plans to take it down. Speaking on the campaign trail ahead of the Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse by-election, Swinney said the advert was \"blatantly racist\". He called for Meta to remove the video, telling reporters: \"I don't want racism anywhere in any shape or form in our politics there's a responsibility on these social media companies to act.\" The first minister said: \"Anas Sarwar is a political rival of mine but he should not be subjected to that kind of racist attack.\" He urged politicians to \"stand in solidarity against\" Reform UK leader Nigel Farage. Scottish Labour had already described the advert as \"blatantly racist\". The party complained to Meta two weeks ago, while the SNP lodged a separate complaint on Monday. The SNP's chief executive, Carol Beattie, said in a letter to the social media firm that the video \"crosses the line into race-baiting and scapegoating\". She added that it was an attempt to \"provoke division, stir racial resentment, and marginalise Pakistani residents in Scotland\". The SNP urged Meta to remove the content and \"apply appropriate sanctions\". The party also asked for clarification on how the organisation how political advertising would be monitored \"to prevent the incitement of racial hatred.\" The Scottish Greens also described the Reform advert as racist, while the Liberal Democrats accused Farage's party of \"scummy tactics\". Meta has been asked to comment. Reform councillor Thomas Kerr accused Swinney and Sarwar of \"desperately trying to deflect attention away from the facts\". He said: \"This advert uses Mr Sarwar's own words - if he doesn't like them, he shouldn't use them. \"The SNP and Labour have both broken Scotland, it's no surprise they're now forming some sort of pathetic and panicky anti-Reform coalition.\" Voters will go to the polls in the Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse by-election on 5 June following the death of SNP MSP Christina McKelvie earlier this year. The candidates standing in the ballot are: Katy Loudon - SNP Davy Russell - Labour Richard Nelson - Conservative Ann McGuinness - Greens Aisha Mir - Liberal Democrat Ross Lambie - Reform Collette Bradley - Scottish Socialist Party Andy Brady - Scottish Family Party Janice Mackay - UK Independence Party Mark Wilkinson - Independent Reform UK also plans to scrap the two-child benefit policy, as part of plans to outflank the government. Reform UK defends its new team, saying their skills made them the \"best people for the job\". Lancashire's new councillors start their jobs, after the party's big wins in this month's local elections. Group leader Guy Aston says Ros Jones' proposed executive group \"holds no authority\". The work will be incorporated into another committee despite all other parties opposing the change.",

    "title": "The people who think AI might become conscious",
    "article_text": "Listen to this article. I step into the booth with some trepidation. I am about to be subjected to strobe lighting while music plays – as part of a research project trying to understand what makes us truly human. It's an experience that brings to mind the test in the science fiction film Bladerunner, designed to distinguish humans from artificially created beings posing as humans. Could I be a robot from the future and not know it? Would I pass the test? The researchers assure me that this is not actually what this experiment is about. The device that they call the \"Dreamachine\", after thepublic programmeof the same name, is designed to study how the human brain generates our conscious experiences of the world. As the strobing begins, and even though my eyes are closed, I see swirling two-dimensional geometric patterns. It's like jumping into a kaleidoscope, with constantly shifting triangles, pentagons and octagons. The colours are vivid, intense and ever-changing: pinks, magentas and turquoise hues, glowing like neon lights. The \"Dreamachine\" brings the brain's inner activity to the surface with flashing lights, aiming to explore how our thought processes work. The images I'm seeing are unique to my own inner world and unique to myself, according to the researchers. They believe these patterns can shed light on consciousness itself. They hear me whisper: \"It's lovely, absolutely lovely. It's like flying through my own mind!\" The \"Dreamachine\", at Sussex University'sCentre for Consciousness Science, is just one of many new research projects across the world investigating human consciousness: the part of our minds that enables us to be self-aware, to think and feel and make independent decisions about the world. By learning the nature of consciousness, researchers hope to better understand what's happening within the silicon brains of artificial intelligence. Some believe that AI systems will soon become independently conscious, if they haven't already. But what really is consciousness, and how close is AI to gaining it? And could the belief that AI might be conscious itself fundamentally change humans in the next few decades? The idea of machines with their own minds has long been explored in science fiction. Worries about AI stretch back nearly a hundred years to the film Metropolis, in which a robot impersonates a real woman. A fear of machines becoming conscious and posing a threat to humans is explored in the 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey, when the HAL 9000 computer attacks astronauts onboard its spaceship. And in the final Mission Impossible film, which has just been released, the world is threatened by a powerful rogue AI, described by one character as a \"self-aware, self-learning, truth-eating digital parasite\". But quite recently, in the real world there has been a rapid tipping point in thinking on machine consciousness, where credible voices have become concerned that this is no longer the stuff of science fiction. The sudden shift has been prompted by the success of so-called large language models (LLMs), which can be accessed through apps on our phones such as Gemini and Chat GPT. The ability of the latest generation of LLMs to have plausible, free-flowing conversations has surprised even their designers and some of the leading experts in the field. There is a growing view among some thinkers that as AI becomes even more intelligent, the lights will suddenly turn on inside the machines and they will become conscious. Others, such as Prof Anil Seth who leads the Sussex University team, disagree, describing the view as \"blindly optimistic and driven by human exceptionalism\". \"We associate consciousness with intelligence and language because they go together in humans. But just because they go together in us, it doesn't mean they go together in general, for example in animals.\" So what actually is consciousness? The short answer is that no-one knows. That's clear from the good-natured but robust arguments among Prof Seth's own team of young AI specialists, computing experts, neuroscientists and philosophers, who are trying to answer one of the biggest questions in science and philosophy. While there are many differing views at the consciousness research centre, the scientists are unified in their method: to break this big problem down into lots of smaller ones in a series of research projects, which includes the Dreamachine. Just as the search to find the \"spark of life\" that made inanimate objects come alive was abandoned in the 19th Century in favour of identifying how individual parts of living systems worked, the Sussex team is now adopting the same approach to consciousness. They hope to identify patterns of brain activity that explain various properties of conscious experiences, such as changes in electrical signals or blood flow to different regions. The goal is to go beyond looking for mere correlations between brain activity and consciousness, and try to come up with explanations for its individual components. Prof Seth, the author of a book on consciousness, Being You, worries that we may be rushing headlong into a society that is being rapidly reshaped by the sheer pace of technological change without sufficient knowledge about the science, or thought about the consequences. \"We take it as if the future has already been written; that there is an inevitable march to a superhuman replacement,\" he says. \"We did not have these conversations enough with the rise of social media, much to our collective detriment. But with AI, it is not too late. We can decide what we want.\" But there are some in the tech sector who believe that the AI in our computers and phones may already be conscious, and we should treat them as such. Google suspended software engineer Blake Lemoine in 2022, after he argued that AI chatbots could feel things and potentially suffer. In November 2024, an AI welfare officer for Anthropic, Kyle Fish, co-authored a report suggesting that AI consciousness was a realistic possibility in the near future. He recently told The New York Times that he also believed that there was a small (15%) chance that chatbots are already conscious. One reason he thinks it possible is that no-one, not even the people who developed these systems, knows exactly how they work. That's worrying, says Prof Murray Shanahan, principal scientist at Google DeepMind and emeritus professor in AI at Imperial College, London. \"We don't actually understand very well the way in which LLMs work internally, and that is some cause for concern,\" he tells the BBC. According to Prof Shanahan, it's important for tech firms to get a proper understanding of the systems they're building – and researchers are looking at that as a matter of urgency. \"We are in a strange position of building these extremely complex things, where we don't have a good theory of exactly how they achieve the remarkable things they are achieving,\" he says. \"So having a better understanding of how they work will enable us to steer them in the direction we want and to ensure that they are safe.\" The prevailing view in the tech sector is that LLMs are not currently conscious in the way we experience the world, and probably not in any way at all. But that is something that the married couple Profs Lenore and Manuel Blum, both emeritus professors at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, believe will change, possibly quite soon. According to the Blums, that could happen as AI and LLMs have more live sensory inputs from the real world, such as vision and touch, by connecting cameras and haptic sensors (related to touch) to AI systems. They are developing a computer model that constructs its own internal language called Brainish to enable this additional sensory data to be processed, attempting to replicate the processes that go on in the brain. \"We think Brainish can solve the problem of consciousness as we know it,\" Lenore tells the BBC. \"AI consciousness is inevitable.\" Manuel chips in enthusiastically with an impish grin, saying that the new systems that he too firmly believes will emerge will be the \"next stage in humanity's evolution\". Conscious robots, he believes, \"are our progeny. Down the road, machines like these will be entities that will be on Earth and maybe on other planets when we are no longer around\". David Chalmers – Professor of Philosophy and Neural Science at New York University – defined the distinction between real and apparent consciousness at a conference in Tucson, Arizona in 1994. He laid out the \"hard problem\" of working out how and why any of the complex operations of brains give rise to conscious experience, such as our emotional response when we hear a nightingale sing. Prof Chalmers says that he is open to the possibility of the hard problem being solved. \"The ideal outcome would be one where humanity shares in this new intelligence bonanza,\" he tells the BBC. \"Maybe our brains are augmented by AI systems.\" On the sci-fi implications of that, he wryly observes: \"In my profession, there is a fine line between science fiction and philosophy\". Prof Seth, however, is exploring the idea that true consciousness can only be realised by living systems. \"A strong case can be made that it isn't computation that is sufficient for consciousness but being alive,\" he says. \"In brains, unlike computers, it's hard to separate what they do from what they are.\" Without this separation, he argues, it's difficult to believe that brains \"are simply meat-based computers\". And if Prof Seth's intuition about life being important is on the right track, the most likely technology will not be made of silicon run on computer code, but will rather consist of tiny collections of nerve cells the size of lentil grains that are currently being grown in labs. Called \"mini-brains\" in media reports, they are referred to as \"cerebral organoids\" by the scientific community, which uses them to research how the brain works, and for drug testing. One Australian firm, Cortical Labs, in Melbourne, has even developed a system of nerve cells in a dish that can play the 1972 sports video game Pong. Although it is a far cry from a conscious system, the so-called \"brain in a dish\" is spooky as it moves a paddle up and down a screen to bat back a pixelated ball. Some experts feel that if consciousness is to emerge, it is most likely to be from larger, more advanced versions of these living tissue systems. Cortical Labs monitors their electrical activity for any signals that could conceivably be anything like the emergence of consciousness. The firm's chief scientific and operating officer, Dr Brett Kagan is mindful that any emerging uncontrollable intelligence might have priorities that \"are not aligned with ours\". In which case, he says, half-jokingly, that possible organoid overlords would be easier to defeat because \"there is always bleach\" to pour over the fragile neurons. Returning to a more solemn tone, he says the small but significant threat of artificial consciousness is something he'd like the big players in the field to focus on more as part of serious attempts to advance our scientific understanding – but says that \"unfortunately, we don't see any earnest efforts in this space\". The more immediate problem, though, could be how the illusion of machines being conscious affects us. In just a few years, we may well be living in a world populated by humanoid robots and deepfakes that seem conscious, according to Prof Seth. He worries that we won't be able to resist believing that the AI has feelings and empathy, which could lead to new dangers. \"It will mean that we trust these things more, share more data with them and be more open to persuasion.\" But the greater risk from the illusion of consciousness is a \"moral corrosion\", he says. \"It will distort our moral priorities by making us devote more of our resources to caring for these systems at the expense of the real things in our lives\" – meaning that we might have compassion for robots, but care less for other humans. And that could fundamentally alter us, according to Prof Shanahan. \"Increasingly human relationships are going to be replicated in AI relationships, they will be used as teachers, friends, adversaries in computer games and even romantic partners. Whether that is a good or bad thing, I don't know, but it is going to happen, and we are not going to be able to prevent it\".

    "title": "A self-created fairy story: The rise and fall of Michelle Mone",
    "article_text": "Michelle Mone spent 25 years building her business empire and public profile through the British media. A brilliant self-publicist, she was regularly described as one of the UK's most successful businesswomen. She was the plucky underdog who, through sheer grit and a knack for a good headline, pushed her Ultimo bra concept onto the marketplace and into the high street's biggest shops. She even claimed to have given Hollywood star Julia Roberts a cleavage. The story she told time and time again to a grateful media brought her fame, riches, and even a peerage. But Baroness Mone of Mayfair has now been stripped of the Conservative whip, is on leave from the House of Lords and a business connected to her is under investigation by the National Crime Agency. How did it come to that? That's the question a newtwo-part BBC Scotland documentaryseeks to answer. The Rise and Fall of Michelle Mone begins in 1999 as the then 28-year-old talks her way into Selfridges in London, and a deal to sell her gel-filled Ultimo bra. Born in her own words \"into nothing\", Mone was raised in the Dennistoun area of Glasgow. She left school at 15 with no qualifications but a determination \"to make something of myself\". Friends from the time describe her hard work ethic, energy and \"bubbly\" nature. \"No matter where you're from, look at me, you can do it,\" she would later say. She worked as a model and \"ring girl\" at boxing matches and moved into promotions and sales before setting up MJM International with husband Michael. They re-mortgaged their house and went £70,000 into debt developing the Ultimo Bra, which is when Mone turned up unannounced at Selfridges. Virginia Marcolin was the shop's lingerie buyer, and the person Mone had travelled to London to see. \"I thought: 'This girl is not what I'm used to dealing with'. She was kind of country bumpkin and a little bit like not overly refined, just very authentic. And this was just such a fresh, new product,\" she says. \"That was the start of it. It was her persistence.\" Mone's natural knack for promotion got them the deal but the cash-poor company needed funds to fulfil the order. They found an investor in Tom Hunter, who in 1998 had just sold his sportswear company JJB Sports for £280m. The man who made that introduction was Jack Irvine, former newspaper editor turned successful PR executive. He became a key figure in building Mone's early media profile. The newspapers and broadcasters were hungry for stories about her, and she was very happy to help. \"She had two driving forces,\" Irvine says. \"One was to be very rich and one was to be very famous.\" Coverage from that time stressed her humble roots, battle to succeed, new-found wealth, and the global success of her bra. Magnus Llewellin, now editor of the Times newspapers in Scotland, remembers one infamous story from the time. \"Stories would circulate around Michelle Mone. One of those was that her bra was used in the film Erin Brockovich, that Julia Roberts wore one of her bras,\" he says. \"If you actually bother to check, somebody involved in the actual making of the film came out and said an Ultimo bra wasn't used in the production.\" The truth is that the media, especially the Scottish media, helped create the Michelle Mone myth. And she had a gift for using that. \"The story was almost too good to debunk. A young woman fighting in a male-dominated business world, making a way for herself. That was a great story to tell,\" Llewellin says. After more than 20 years together as a couple and more than a decade in business, the Mones very publicly separated, divorcing in 2011. Michelle bought Michael out of the business and became the face and body of the brand, modelling her own lingerie. Behind the scenes at the company there were a number of employment tribunals, including one high-profile case in which a member of staff found a recording device in his office. Despite her legal challenges, Mone remained in the public eye, a regular feature on television programmes. And her knack for publicity led to her next move - into the world of politics. She had been a Labour supporter but defected to the Conservatives in 2010. Four years later she was a prominent voice in favour of the union during the independence referendum, going so far as to say she would leave Scotland in the event of a 'Yes' vote. In 2015, Prime Minister David Cameron made her his government's \"entrepreneurship tsar\". Within weeks it was announced she was to become a Conservative peer, as Baroness Mone of Mayfair. By then she had sold her interests in the company she had built. But her new roles brought increased scrutiny over her business record. Magnus Llewellin points out that MJM International never turned over more than £10.1m a year, and in 2012 lost more than half a million pounds. \"By that time the company was in real trouble,\" he says. Businessman Donald Anderson runs the Gap Group, a plant hire company which in 2024 had a turnover of £302.3m, employed more than 2,000 people, and made a pre-tax profit of £43.9m. He wrote to the prime minister at the time of Mone's appointment. \"Miss Mone is not a successful entrepreneur, she is a small time businesswoman with a PR exposure far in excess of any actual success,\" he wrote. He now says: \"If the only thing she achieved was self-publicity, I don't think that's a very good reason to put you into the House of Lords. If you follow that logic then the House of Lords will be full of influencers in the next 10 years.\" In 2016, Mone announced she was in a new relationship with Doug Barrowman, a billionaire businessman. They settled in the Isle of Man, and worked together in the booming crypto-currency sector. In 2020, the Covid pandemic struck. As the death toll rose, UK ministers sought out firms to urgently supply Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), even setting up a VIP lane to give priority to some suppliers. A company called PPE Medpro made it onto the VIP list. This caught the eye of campaigners who were concerned that firms on the list were run by people with connections to the Conservative Party. It emerged that PPE Medpro was controlled by people connected to Doug Barrowman. Mone, a Conservative peer, repeatedly denied any involvement in the business, the deal or the subsequent profits. Butthe Guardian uncovered a connectionto government ministers. The paper's David Conn says: \"We did our own freedom of information request, and we got the emails that she'd sent to Michael Gove and Lord Agnew saying that she was offering to supply PPE through 'my team in Hong Kong' and that it had gone through the VIP lane. \"And we also got some WhatsApp messages which Michelle Mone had sent about the PPE deals and she said she was sitting on the jet and it was about to take off, which we assumed was their jet, their private plane.\" The National Crime Agency (NCA) launched an investigation into PPE Medpro. Several of the couple's properties were raided. Two years into his investigation, David Conn received a leaked document showing Barrowman made at least £65m from the deals, with £29m of this paid into a trust of which Mone and her three adult children are beneficiaries. Throughout this time, Mone was uncharacteristically quiet. But that changed at the end of 2023 when she and Barrowman - by then married - released a PPE Medpro-funded documentary in which she admitted being a \"conduit\" between the company and ministers. They also agreed to appear on the BBC'sSunday with Laura Kuenssbergprogramme. On camera, Mone admitted she could one day benefit from the trust, and said they had done nothing wrong. When asked about lying to the press, she replied: \"That's not a crime. \"Saying to the press I'm not involved, to protect my family, can I just make it clear, it's not a crime.\" Laura Kuenssberg says: \"That's a phrase that will always stick with me. \"When she said that, I thought: 'There's a thing. There's a headline'.\" Michelle Mone lost the Conservative whip and has taken a leave of absence from the House of Lords. She has made no further media appearances. PPE Medpro is still under investigation by the NCA and the government is suing the company for £122m plus costs, claiming the medical gowns the company supplied \"did not comply with the specification in the contract\". The peer declined the offer to be interviewed for The Rise and Fall of Michelle Mone. In response to the programme, a statement said the couple had provided \"full and detailed statements to the NCA and cooperated with the investigation throughout\". It said they had never been arrested and no charges had been brought against them. The statement also defended PPE Medpro's delivery of PPE equipment to the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC). It continued: \"Baroness Mone, along with the whole of the Mone/Barrowman family, were beneficiaries of trusts... never direct recipients of PPE Medpro profits. \"The DHSC was fully aware of their involvement from the outset. It was a mistake to have misled the press.\" After the documentary was released, Mone's PR company gave a statement saying she was \"deeply disappointed\" in the BBC's decision to broadcast the programme, which she said used \"misleading and one-sided\" accounts of her life and career. Michelle Mone's public life was a self-created fairy story which many in business, politics, and especially the media, bought into. For Magnus Llewellin, there's a clear moral to this tale. \"What it does tell us about modern Britain is, we still like fairy tales. We want to believe those rags to riches tales. \"But once you step into the world of politics, things can get a bit trickier. \"It's a parable of excess, hubris, and then eventually nemesis.\" Laura Kuenssberg says: \"For Michelle Mone, public attention, knowing how to grab public attention, is an ability that she obviously always had in spades during her business career. \"But things went wrong for her and you can't turn that attention off.\" The Rise and Fall of Michelle Mone isavailable on iPlayerand is on BBC Scotland at 22:00 on Monday 26 May and BBC Two at 21:00 on Wednesday 28 May.

    "title": "Head of controversial Israel-backed Gaza aid group resigns",
    "article_text": "The head of an organisation set up to distribute aid in Gaza as part of a controversial Israel-backed plan has resigned, saying it could not work in a way that adhered to \"humanitarian principles\". Jake Wood quit the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) late on Sunday, saying it would not be able to fulfil the principles of \"humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence\". The plan, also backed by the US, will have private contractors delivering aid via Israel-designated distribution sites. It was criticised by the UN, which says it will not participate. The GHF said on Monday night that it had delivered its first aid shipments to Gaza and distribution to the Gazan people was under way. Under the GHF plan, Palestinians would be expected to collect boxes weighing up to 20kg (44lbs) containing food and basic hygiene items from four distribution points in southern Gaza. It is unclear how the weak or injured would be able to collect the aid. Israel insists the plan is needed to stop Hamas stealing aid, which the armed group denies doing. UN aid chief Tom Fletcher said it would force further displacement, restrict aid to only one part of Gaza and make \"starvation a bargaining chip.\" In his resignation statement, Wood, a former US marine, said: \"Two months ago, I was approached about leading GHF's efforts because of my experience in humanitarian operations. \"Like many others around the world, I was horrified and heartbroken at the hunger crisis in Gaza and, as a humanitarian leader, I was compelled to do whatever I could to help alleviate the suffering.\" He said he was \"proud of the work I oversaw, including developing a pragmatic plan that could feed hungry people, address security concerns about diversion, and complement the work of longstanding NGOs in Gaza.\" But, he said, it had become \"clear that it is not possible to implement this plan while also strictly adhering to the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence, which I will not abandon.\" In response, the GHF said it would \"not be deterred\" by Wood's resignation and would begin delivering aid on Monday, with an aim to reach one million Palestinians by the end of the week. The group said that critics \"who benefit from the status quo have been more focused on tearing this apart than on getting aid in, afraid that new, creative solutions to intractable problems might actually succeed.\" It added: \"Our trucks are loaded and ready to go.\" An Israeli official said \"the goal of this new approach is to eliminate the Gazan population's dependence on Hamas\". Israeli media reported that the first of four distribution centres would be opened by GHF on Monday morning. Last week, Israel eased an 11-week blockade on all food, fuel, medicine and other supplies entering Gaza, with the first aid trucks reaching civilians in recent days - but the UN has said it's a \"drop in the ocean of what's needed\". It says 57 children died from malnutrition during Israel's blockade - while the World Food Programme (WFP) warned last week that Gaza's entire population was \"on the brink of starvation\". Jan Egeland, Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council, told the BBC's Today Programme that the GHF is \"militarised, privatised, politicised\" and \"not in conformity with neutrality\". \"The people behind it are military – they are ex-CIA and ex-military people… Let's go back to the system that worked\" he said. The GHF has also come under intense scrutiny around its funding, origins and backing. On Monday evening, it announced John Acree, a former senior manager at USAID, had been named interim executive director. Over the weekend, an investigation byThe New York Timessuggested the group may have been conceived in Israel by a group of Israeli officials and military officers and their partners in the Israeli business sector. Responding to the plan earlier this month, UN children's fund spokesperson Jonathan Crick said: \"How is a mother of four children, who has lost her husband, going to carry 20kg back to her makeshift tent, sometimes several kilometres away?\" \"The most vulnerable people, including the elderly, people with disabilities, the sick and wounded, and orphans, will face huge challenges to access aid.\" Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to Hamas's cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. At least 53,939 people, including at least 16,500 children, have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Officials say a 28-year-old with US citizenship had Molotov cocktails in his backpack and called for \"death to America\". A British surgeon working in Nasser Hospital said he had operated on the doctor's surviving 11-year-old. This has been a tumultuous week for the Jewish state, the BBC's Paul Adams writes. The UK, France and Canada condemned the expanded Israeli military operation in Gaza this week. Police say the victims, a young couple, were shot by a man who shouted \"free, free Palestine\".",

    "article_text": "The Kremlin has rejected claims of potential Russian involvement in alleged arson attacks at properties connected to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, calling them \"ludicrous\". It comes after media reports that UK security officials are investigating a potential link following three incidents earlier this month. In response, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday: \"London tends to suspect Russia of [involvement in] all the bad things happening in Great Britain. \"As a rule, all these suspicions are groundless and not backed up with any evidence.\" Three men, two Ukrainian nationals and a Romanian man, have been charged as part of a police investigation into the attacks. Several UK newspapers have claimed MI5 is investigating the possibility the attacks were ordered by the Kremlin, citing unnamed Whitehall officials. Last week, Ukrainian national Petro Pochynok, 34, from north London,was charged by the Metropolitan Policewith conspiracy to commit arson with intent to endanger life. Two other men have also been charged in connection with the fires. Roman Lavrynovych, 21, has been charged with arson with intent to endanger life, while Stanislav Carpiuc, 26,  has been charged with conspiracy to commit arson with intent to endanger life. The three men, who have already appeared in court for initial hearings, have been remanded in custody until the next scheduled hearing at the Old Bailey in London on 6 June. On 8 May, a car the prime minister had sold to a neighbour caught fire on the Kentish Town street where he lived before moving to Downing Street. Three days later, firefighters dealt with a small fire at the front door of an Islington house, where Sir Keir lived during the 1990s and which has since been converted into flats. On 12 May, the fire brigade and police were called to a fire at the prime minister's private home on the same street as where the car fire took place. Sir Keirpreviously described the incidentsas \"an attack on all of us, on democracy and the values that we stand for\". Downing Street and the Metropolitan Police have so far declined to comment on reports that potential Russian involvement is being investigated. Trump said that Vladimir Putin had gone \"absolutely crazy\" following massive aerial attacks on Ukraine. A Russian couple living in Ukraine were so appalled by the invasion, they shared information about Russian forces in their town with Kyiv. At least 12 people were reported killed in Ukraine, with 13 regions hit by Russian air strikes. At least 13 people were killed the the latest Russian aerial attack across Ukraine Play for Ukraine in Reading hopes to provide a vehicle loaded with essential items for Ukraine.",

    "title": "North Korea arrests senior official over warship launch failure",
    "article_text": "North Korea has arrested a fourth official over thefailed launch of a new warshipthat has enraged the country's leader, Kim Jong Un. Ri Hyong-son, deputy director of the ruling Workers' Party's Munitions Industry Department, was \"largely responsible for the serious accident\" last week, state-run news agency KCNA said on Monday. The 5,000-ton destroyer hadtipped over and damaged its hull, in what Kim described as a \"criminal act\" that \"severely damaged the [country's] dignity and pride\". The vessel is being repaired under the guidance of an expert group, KCNA said. Mr Ri, who is part of the party's Central Military Commission, is the highest level official arrested over the incident so far. The commission commands the Korean People's Army and is responsible for developing and implementing North Korea's military policies. Over the weekend, Pyongyang alsodetained three officialsat the northern Chongjin shipyard, where the destroyer was built and where its launch failed. The officials were the chief engineer, its construction head and an administrative manager. Kim earlier said Wednesday's incident was caused by \"absolute carelessness, irresponsibility and unscientific empiricism\". It is not clear what punishment they might face, but the authoritarian state has been known to sentence officials it finds guilty of wrongdoing to forced labour and even death. It is uncommon for North Korea to publicly disclose local accidents, though it has done this a handful of times in the past after failed satellite launches. Some analysts believe Kim's swift and severe response was meant as a signal that Pyongyang will continue to advance its military capabilities. While such criticism is \"not surprising\" for a dictatorship, it is unusual that state media is openly reporting it, says Chun In-bum, a former commander of South Korea's special forces. \"I fear this might be a sign of confidence and a show of resilience,\" he says. \"With this new line of ships, North Korea seems to intend on challenging the sovereignty of the South in earnest.\" Michael Madden, a North Korea expert from the Stimson Center in Washington, sees Kim's response as a sign of the \"high priority\" his regime is putting into developing warships. The mishap may have resulted from officials \"trying to do too much at once\", he notes, saying that \"there seems to have been an unusual amount of internal pressure on the personnel and production units to get this all done\". Last week's shipyard accident comes weeks after North Korea unveiled a similar warship in another part of the country. Kim had called that warship a \"breakthrough\" in modernising North Korea's navy and said it would be deployed early next year. The vote comes after the impeachment and removal of former president Yoon Suk Yeol. While the college said its staff had \"followed protocol\", many decry an alleged invasion of privacy.

    "title": "HS2 investigating two firms supplying construction staff",
    "article_text": "The company building the HS2 rail line between London and Birmingham says it is investigating \"allegations\" about the practices of some \"labour suppliers\" to the project. HS2 Ltd is looking into two firms supplying workers to build the West Midlands section of the high-speed line. It is understood to relate to billing for the staff supplied. The Department for Transport said it would ensure \"any claims of wrongdoing in HS2's supply chain\" were \"thoroughly\" dealt with. The existence of HS2's investigation, which began earlier this yearwas first reported by the i newspaper on Monday. According to the paper, the matter relates to misclassification of staff and claims that inflated rates were being charged for them. It is understood the two firms being looked at were providing workers to Balfour Beatty Vinci, one of HS2's contractors. A HS2 spokesperson said it treated \"all whistleblower allegations seriously\", adding that Balfour Beatty Vinci \"had implemented additional monitoring and controls\". It is understood one of the labour suppliers remains suspended from new contracts while inquiries continue. A Department for Transport spokesman said the government and HS2 \"take all whistleblower allegations extremely seriously and have a zero-tolerance attitude towards fraud, bribery, and corruption\". \"We will therefore ensure any claims of wrongdoing in HS2's supply chain are thoroughly investigated.\" The police and HMRC are not believed to be involved. Work is currently under way to build the nearly 140-mile high-speed line between London and the West Midlands. The HS2 project was announced in 2009 to boost capacity on England's north-south rail links, aiming to reduce journey times, create jobs and boost the UK economy. The original plan was to build the line in two phases - with the first connecting London and Birmingham and the second adding two branches to Manchester and Leeds. But the project has suffered various setbacks and spiralling costs since it was announced and the decision was taken by the last Conservative government to scrap the second phase. The Labour government has said it will not reinstate it. Much of the work London-Birmingham section has been completed - with more than 75% of tunnelling complete, according to HS2 Ltd. Separately,the mayors of Greater Manchester and the West Midlands have revealed plansfor a new rail line linking their regions which would rely on private investment and cost less than the scrapped northern leg of HS2. Official estimates of how much HS2 will cost have changed several times over the years. Last October, the government announced that ministers would take a direct role in overseeing the building of the line to try to \"get a grip\" on rising costs. The government previously said costs had soared because of factors including \"poor project management, inflation and poor performance from the supply chain\". In 2012 it was estimated that HS2 Phase 1 (London to Birmingham) would cost £20.5bn (at 2019 prices). The government'smost recent estimate of the overall costis between £45bn and £54bn at 2019 prices - but HS2 management have estimated the figure to be more like £49bn to £57bn. According toa House of Commons research briefing,cost increases have been driven \"by high inflation, as well as scope changes, worse ground conditions than expected and optimism bias\". The flight crew shut down the engine as a precaution after being alerted to a technical issue. Violence broke out at the Birmingham City-Shrewsbury Town match in March. Police say they were called to Heathfield Road in Handsworth, Birmingham, at about 02:30 BST. It is hoped the artwork will capture \"community spirit\" as well as celebrating local rail heritage history. Gurdwaras in Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Dudley and Walsall also helped to put on the celebration.",

    "article_text": "A search and rescue specialist hired to recover a downed research balloon in what was supposed be a four-day job has finally returned home after spending more than 100 days in a West African prison. Paul Inch, 50, from Blaenau Ffestiniog, Gwynedd, and colleague Richard Perham, 29, from Bristol, had gone to Guinea to recover the equipment for a firm when they were arrested and accused of spying. \"It was scary - the worst thing I have ever experienced,\" said Mr Inch. Lord Collins of Highbury, UK government Foreign Office minister for Africa, welcomed the men's return after their \"lengthy ordeal\". The Guinean government has been asked to comment. \"We were threatened with all kinds of abuse,\" said Mr Inch, who works as a mountain bike guide, water safety officer, and as a volunteer with the Aberglaslyn Mountain Rescue. He described the conditions in the Conakry prison as \"horrific\", with 80 men sharing a toilet and shower. \"Sleeping through the night you'd have rats and mice and cockroaches crawling over your body,\" he toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast. Mr Inch said the water was contaminated so they washed with a disinfectant and were concerned about becoming unwell. He explained how he and his colleague had believed they \"had the right permissions  to be [in Guinea]... and then quickly found out that we hadn't\". \"We were in court and then told 'you're going to prison',\" he said. Mr Perham said: \"We had to literally fear for our lives each day. \"After we had been there for two months, the UK ambassador walked us to the prison gate, believing we were finally being released but a phone call to the prosecutor stopped it. \"We had to turn around and walk straight back in for another month. It was devastating.\" After their release on 11 April, the pair were stuck in Guinea for 42 more days. Mr Inch's partner, Cheryl Potter, said: \"Every single day has been a constant battle worrying about him.\" Mr Inch has thanked his supporters, the British Embassy and his local MP, Liz Saville Roberts, for their help to get them home. Ms Saville Roberts said the organisation that hired the pair had informed Guinean authorities that Mr Inch and Mr Perham \"had no role in operating the balloon, no knowledge of its technical contents, and no involvement in its flight or descent\". \"Their assignment was purely logistical: retrieving equipment under the understanding that all permissions had been granted,\" said the Plaid Cymru MP for Dwyfor Meirionnydd. \"This has been a nightmare for the two men and their families and friends who have been focused, resourceful and determined to ensure that never a day went by without seeking their release.\" A rare lichen's last refuge on ancient oak felled by a storm puts a unique forest on the brink. A historic mansion which was going to be sold could be saved if between £5m and £10m can be found. Moussa Dadis Camara, pardoned on health grounds, was less than a year into a 20-year sentence.

    "title": "'It missed us by inches': Witnesses describe car driving into crowd at Liverpool title parade",
    "article_text": "Witnesses have described the \"horrendous\" moment a car \"rammed\" into a crowd of people who were attending Liverpool FC's victory parade following their Premier League win. Merseyside Police said a number of pedestrians were hit by the vehicle in Water Street, Liverpool just after 18:00 BST. Dozens were injured, two of them seriously, with 27 treated in hospital. A 53-year-old white British man from the Liverpool area was arrested, police said, adding that he is believed to have been the driver. One eyewitness, BBC reporter Matt Cole, said the car missed him and his family \"by literally inches\". \"We had just moments before watched fireworks going off, the celebrations of the Liverpool bus passing us on the Strand,\" he said. He said an ambulance had just made its way through the \"dense\" crowd he was part of on Water Street, when \"there were screams ahead of us and suddenly this dark blue car just came through the crowd\". \"It just wasn't stopping - I managed to grab my daughter who was with me and jump out of the way. \"It missed myself and my family by literally inches.\" He said the ambulance acted like a \"natural barrier... that slowed the car down\", but that it had \"no intention - it appeared - of stopping\". He added that the car looked to be travelling at \"more than 20 [mph]\", but that he could not be sure it was not 30mph. \"As it passed me, it was being chased by a group of men who were trying to bang on the side of it and throw things at it,\" he explained, adding that the rear windshield had been \"completely smashed in\". Having moved to safety down a side street, he saw police \"running from all over, ambulances, police vans... more and more ambulances, more and more police vans - at one point then an entire squad of armed police cars stopped and people jumped out with rifles and again big medical packs on and began running towards the scene of the incident.\" He said his initial assumption was that the driver just wanted to \"barge through crowds because they didn't want to wait\". \"But suddenly then, the speed registered and the shouts of the people and the screams of the people registered, and at that point, yeah, adrenaline very much just kicks in\". Harry Rashid, 48, from Solihull, was at the parade with his wife and two young daughters when he witnessed the car pull up before it \"just rammed into all the people at the side of us\". He told PA news agency: \"It was extremely fast. Initially, we just heard the pop, pop, pop of people just being knocked off the bonnet of a car.... I saw people on lying on the ground, people unconscious. \"It was horrendous. So horrendous.\" Off-duty BBC reporter Dan Ogunshakin, who was in the city for the parade, said \"suddenly a lot of people started to surround\" a car, which was front of an ambulance that was moving through the crowd. He said he and his friend then noticed \"people were hitting the car and shaking the car and we wondered why this was suddenly happening\". The car then reversed and knocked people away from it, he explained, then \"it suddenly accelerated forwards\" straight towards the crowd of people. \"People scattered like bowling pins.\" \"What had once been an atmosphere of celebration and joy and happiness suddenly turned into fear and terror and disbelief,\" he said, adding it become \"hell on Earth\". Matthew O'Carroll, 28, from Runcorn said he had approached the top of Water Street when the car \"came past a parked police van at a decent speed\". \"People managed to get out of the way as he was beeping as he went through but as he went past, people were obviously very angry and so started running after the car. \"The back window of the car was already smashed. \"I thought that once it went past us, it was just someone that was trying to get away from something and would slow down when he got to more people.\" Another witness, Mike Maddra, was walking with a group of friends, when he saw a car \"speeding up\" and hitting pedestrians. He said the \"car turned left, mounted pavement, come towards us and runs towards the buildings\". He added that he thought he saw two people being hit, and that \"it looked deliberate\". \"It has just ruined the day really,\" he said.",

    "title": "'Poor' decision by PGMOL to pick Bramall for Villa game - Hackett",
    "article_text": "This video can not be played How referee error may have cost Villa Champions League football Professional Game Match Officials Limited made a \"poor management decision\" in appointing Thomas Bramall to officiate Aston Villa's defeat by Manchester United, says former referees' boss Keith Hackett. Villahave complained to referees' body PGMOLabout Bramall after he made a \"big mistake\" in their 2-0 defeat at Manchester United on Sunday that contributed to them missing out on the Champions League. Bramall blew for a foul when Morgan Rogers nudged the ball away from United goalkeeper Altay Bayindir before the Villa midfielder put the ball in the net. Bramall thought Bayindir had two hands on the ball, though television footage suggested otherwise, and because he stopped play before the ball crossed the line, the video assistant referee (VAR) could not intervene. Villa's complaint is that \"one of the most inexperienced referees in the Premier League\" was appointed to such an important match. Bramall, 35, first refereed in the Premier League in August 2022 and his games this season have largely been in either the top flight or the second tier, with 11 in the Premier League and 12 in the Championship. Of the 10 referees appointed for Sunday's final round of the Premier League, Bramall has officiated the second-fewest top-flight matches this season, above Lewis Smith, who took charge of his seventh game in Bournemouth's win over Leicester. In a response to a Talksport video on X of former Villa striker Gabby Agbonlahor criticising Bramall's performance, Hackett said PGMOL \"do not learn\". The former Premier League referee added: \"Our top referee Michael Oliver was operating VAR on a game. What a poor management decision.\" Hackett, who was chief of PGMOL under its former name Professional Game Match Officials Board, also told Football Insider he \"would have expected one of our top officials to have been appointed\" to the Manchester United-Aston Villa match. He added he was \"surprised and disappointed\" that Oliver was appointed VAR for Tottenham's defeat by Brighton and it was \"difficult to understand\" why he was not picked to referee \"a big game\" in Sunday's final round. Oliver has refereed 26 Premier League matches this season, behind only Anthony Taylor - who was in charge of Chelsea's win at Nottingham Forest - on 31. Villa issue complaint after refereeing 'big mistake' Controversy as Villa lose at Man Utd and miss out on Champions League PGMOL told BBC Sport it does not comment on why individual appointments for matches are made. According to the PGMOL appointments policy, all match officials must submit a declaration of interests form before the start of each season. Match officials, video assistant referees and assistant video assistant referees are only eligible to officiate games that do not involve a club for which they have a conflict of interest. This includes clubs they support, have played competitive matches for at first-team level or clubs from the same town or city, excluding London, where the official lives. The policy also states officials cannot be involved in a match that directly involves a club \"which has a strong association with a club for which an interest has been declared\". It is up to PGMOL's discretion to determine if a club has a strong association with that other club. PGMOL chief refereeing officer Howard Webb can also vary the appointments at his disrection. Given Newcastle lost to Everton on Sunday, if Villa had beaten Manchester United, they would have qualified for the Champions League in fifth instead. Oliver is a Newcastle fan so could not have taken charge of the Everton match. However, it is unclear if that also meant he was not appointed to officiate Villa - or Manchester City or the Forest-Chelsea match - because those sides were in the running with Newcastle for Champions League qualification. Oliver last took charge of a Premier League game involving Villa when Unai Emery's side beat Chelsea 2-1 in February. He is not the only experienced referee who was not appointed as the on-field match official for Sunday's final round. Chris Kavanagh, Simon Hooper, Peter Bankes and Samuel Barrott have all refereed 20 or more Premier League matches this season but were not in the middle for any of Sunday's 10 games. Barrott was the fourth official for Liverpool's draw with Crystal Palace, while Bankes was the VAR for Chelsea's win over Nottingham Forest. Former Premier League referee Chris Foy said Bramall's decision was an \"unfortunate incident\" but that many referees \"would have given a foul in that situation\". He told BBC Radio 5 Live's Monday Night Club he was \"impressed\" by Bramall's showing in Manchester City's 3-1 win over Bournemouth on 20 May - a match that featured a straight red card for each side. Foy added: \"He's been given the [Villa] game on merit, he was worthy of his appointment. \"Unfortunately we're talking about one decision because he made a really good decision to send the goalkeeper off and took his time to give the penalty. \"He was going really well but unfortunately we're talking about this one decision.\" Former Newcastle and Aston Villa goalkeer Shay Given said Bramall will \"learn\" and \"grow\" from this situation. \"Let's not forget Thomas Bramall is a human being,\" he added. \"I find it more difficult when VAR with all different angles make wrong decisions. This guy has just made a human error, it's more forgivable.\"",

Former France captain Poirot, 32, was seen in an altercation with the England flanker shortly after the full-time whistle was blown onBordeaux's 28-20 victory.

    "title": "Man Utd close to signing Wolves' Cunha",
    "article_text": "Matheus Cunha scored 15 goals in 33 Premier League appearances this season Matheus Cunha's transfer to Manchester United is at an advanced stage as the Wolves forward nears a Â£62.5m move to Old Trafford. BBC Sport understands United will be required to pay the full fee for the Brazil attacker in three instalments, during a two-year period. The two parties are closing in on a total agreement over personal terms, with sources indicating a deal over the forward's package is now a formality. Wolves are yet to receive a formal approach, but that is expected in the coming days. Cunha'srelease clause is worth Â£62.5m,meaning there is no requirement for lengthy club-to-club negotiations - provided United meet the specific terms of the buy-out. Well-placed sources have indicated that they will be required to pay the full amount by the end of the 2026-27 campaign. The first Â£20.8m will be paid upon purchase and the second instalment at the end of next season, with the final amount due in the summer of 2027. Cunha has made 92 appearances since arriving at Wolves, initially on loan, from Atletico Madrid in January 2023, scoring 33 goals for the club. The 25-year-old almost certainly played his last game for Wolves in Sunday's 1-1 draw with Brentford and has since taken to social media to post a message to supporters. He wrote: \"Individually it was the best season of my life. All of this was only possible because of all the dedication and love I have for this club. \"I became the Brazilian with the most goals in a Premier League season along with Roberto Firmino and Gabriel Martinelli. \"I made mistakes and got things right, but always because I lived this club so much. All I ever wanted was to do the impossible for Wolves. Another one is over. And thank you for all the affection.\" Latest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views Get Man Utd news notifications Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "Sick Raducanu 'really proud' of battling first-round win",
    "article_text": "Emma Raducanu is competing in her first French Open since 2022 French Open 2025 Dates:25 May-8 JuneVenue:Roland Garros Coverage:Live radio commentaries across 5 Live Sport and BBC Sounds, plus live text commentaries on the BBC Sport website and app Emma Raducanu says battling through sickness to set up a French Open second-round meeting with defending champion Iga Swiatek is one of the most satisfying performances of her career. The British number two earned a 7-5 4-6 6-3 victory against Chinaâs Wang Xinyu, despite needing to see the doctor on court towards the end of the first set. Raducanu, ranked 41st in the world, is making only her second appearance at Roland Garros after missing the past two tournaments with injury. \"I'm actually really proud of today's match, more so than I think a lot of the matches that I played recently or in general, because I woke up and I felt really sick,\" she said. \"To have come through that and overcome how I was feeling, I'm really happy with it.\" The 22-year-old recovered to serve out the opener at the second attempt, but Wang - ranked two places lower - rediscovered her quality to level, partly fuelled by a disputed line-call in the 10th game. Raducanu, who had her blood pressure taken on court in a lengthy stoppage, then left for a short break before the decider. The 2021 US Open champion looked invigorated on her return and quickly moved a double break ahead. The pair continued to trade breaks before Raducanu reasserted her authority - with the 17th break of the match - to secure a gruelling victory in two hours and 44 minutes. Raducanu's relief at coming through the joint longest clay-court match of her career showed as she wearily dropped her racquet to the ground. \"I was just fighting through. It was really difficult,\" Raducanu said. \"It didn't really go away throughout the whole match. \"I'm really happy because it would have been easy to let it drag me down.\" Boulter and Fearnley earn maiden French Open wins 'I hate disappointing people' - Osaka loses to Badosa Sinner overcomes late wobble to win Paris opener Victory was yet another example of Raducanu's ever-improving resilience. Raducanu has previously been accused of not showing enough determination to get through matches when she is not feeling 100% physically. Before the tournament the former world number 10 also described how she had felt pressured by previous coaches into playing when she knew she was not right. Raducanu suffered a back spasm in Strasbourg last week, using dry needling and heat therapy to help her recovery. While this issue was not enough to prevent her facing Wang, it was clear from the start Raducanu hadsome sort ofproblem. At the first changeover she looked anxiously towards her team of Jane O'Donoghue and Tom Welsh, who were providing support with main coach Mark Petchey having work commitments in his other role as a commentator. After eating a banana to raise her energy, Raducanu still looked a little dazed before eventually asking for the doctor. There was a five-minute wait as Emma Raducanu was checked out by the doctor However, she dug deep into her limited reserves to win a deciding set for the fourth time this season in eight attempts. \"I have had a lot more three-set matches this year and come out successful more than in the past, which gives me more confidence,\" Raducanu said. \"I think playing more matches has benefited me in the sense that I'm not out of competition for too long. \"At the same time, when I play matches, I'm really on and really intense, so it does take a lot out of me. \"Finding the perfect balance between being hungry and being ready to play and being fit enough is difficult.\" Raducanu can now focus on how to cause a shock against four-time French Open champion Swiatek, who cruised past Slovakia's Rebecca Sramkova 6-3 6-3.

    "title": "Nearly extinct ‘forgotten antelope’ photographed for first time in DRC",
    "article_text": "A photograph of Africa’s “forgotten antelope” has been published for the first time as the elusive creature dives towards extinction. Fewer than 100 Upemba lechwe are thought to remain, with an aerial survey in the Kamalondo depression of the southernDemocratic Republic of the Congohaving recorded 10 individuals. Though the herd cantered too quickly out of sight to be recorded, one stopped for an instant, looking up at the scientists recording them. This allowed Manuel Weber, of Upemba national park’s department of research and biomonitoring, to snap a quick picture, thought to be the first photo taken of a living Upemba lechwe since it was identified as a subspecies in 2005. The antelope stopped for “literally a few seconds”, Weber said. “The feeling was unbelievable, I barely slept the nights before we found it, very worried that we would not be able to do the survey, that we would not find any (in that case we would be responsible for the extinction of a species), and the need to get that photograph to generate the awareness needed to save them,” Weber said. Findingspublished in the African Journal of Ecologyprovide the first population update in more than 50 years. “This is a species on the very brink,” Weber, the lead author, added. “The fact that they’re still hanging on at all is extraordinary, but without urgent protection, they’ll vanish.” The Upemba lechwe is now considered one of the world’s rarest large mammals and is at imminent risk of extinction due to illegal poaching. The number one threat to its numbers is hunting, Weber said. “Up to 22,000 individuals were counted in the early 1970s, that was before the Upemba lechwe was described as a species. In the early 1990s, the meat of dozens was shipped every week to Bukama, the largest city in the area, along the Lualaba River. “I don’t see any problem with meat harvesting by the communities in the landscape, but this is only possible when we have viable populations. The question is, how do we get back to those?” Sign up toDown to Earth The planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential after newsletter promotion The authors urge rapid intervention to protect the last animals of their kind, and hope that this photograph helps galvanise attention and resources to the forgotten antelope. “I knew that we needed that photograph – otherwise we would have no way to get any media attention for the cause, and I was devastated after the first day, since we did connect with a few Upemba lechwe, but they were running for their life, so no way to capture them on camera,” Weber explained. “It was in the morning of the second day, that a single individual stopped for just a few seconds – long enough for me to press the trigger – before running off like the other individuals we have seen. “We hope this image becomes a rallying cry,” Weber adds. “Because this may be our only chance to save this species.”",

    "title": "Malawi battles mpox as cases of the infectious disease surge in Africa",
    "article_text": "Malawi’s ministry of health hasannounced three new cases of mpox in the capital, Lilongwe, bringing the number of confirmed cases to 11 since the country’s first was reported in April. Malawi is one of 16 countries inAfricareporting mpox outbreaks as health officials battle with vaccine shortages as well as limited testing and hospital capacity. The Public Health Institute ofMalawisaid the patients were aged between 17 and 41. “Investigations are under way to establish the possible source of infection and trace contacts,” the department said in a statement last week. The first cases in Malawi come after US government aid cuts to healthcare, including HIV programmes, badly hit the country and raised fears of an escalation of infectious diseases. HIV medication programmes have been severely depleted by the cuts. “A commonality about these cases is that some were immunocompromised,” said Richard Mvula, spokesperson for the Lilongwe district health office. Health officials had reported that patients who had been on ART (antiretroviral therapy) had been forced to stop taking their medication because of the drug shortages. HIVcan worsen the risk and severity of mpox, while effective HIV treatment can help manage the risk. People living with HIV, especially those with uncontrolled viral loads, may experience a more severe form of mpox. Malawi had been on alert since theglobal mpox outbreakbegan in 2022 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and several other African countries. The news of the first cases last month prompted fears of an outbreak. While most cases have been restricted to Lilongwe, a two-year-old was found with the condition in Mangochi district, about 150 miles (240km) from the capital. While recorded cases remain low in Malawi, one of the poorest countries in the world, mpox has surged in the region overall. The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC)reports 52,082 casessince the beginning of 2025, with more than 1,770 deaths during the outbreak as a whole. In a briefing to journalists last week, Africa CDC officials said they were seeing different patterns of transmission between countries. In Sierra Leone, where cases are rising “exponentially”, the clade IIb form of the virus is circulating. In the DRC and its neighbours it is clade Ia and Ib that dominate. They said the continent would need about 6.4m doses of vaccine, but was still far from having that available, with only 1.3m received so far. They also highlighted a lack of testing capacity in many countries, and warned that in Sierra Leone patients were being treated two to a bed. Malawi’s health system faces many challenges, including long distances to clinics, insufficient funding, a shortage of equipment and a lack of qualified personnel.In March this year, the Joint UN Programme on HIV and Aids drew attention to the immediate risks of the US funding cuts on HIV programmes in Malawi. The programme cited thousands of HIV prevention drugs (PrEP) which were expiring. It said the government has instructed the remaining implementer to continue with the scaling up of injectable PrEP but to only recruit new pregnant and lactating women. The US government had been providingmore than $350m (£282m) to Malawiannually, according to the US Department of State. Knowledge of mpox around the country is low, reminiscent of the Covid-19 outbreak where myths were rife and people resorted to tree leaves and herbs to cure the symptoms. Thousands of people died. A series of interviews across the capital showed most people have no knowledge of mpox. In central Lilongwe, taxi driver Steven Banda outlined what he knew. “I came across an official from the ministry of health who was explaining about it and advised that we should be careful since it is dangerous. She described the symptoms including swellings, and mentioned some of the districts affected. I’m not aware of any cases in my area or seen anyone suffering from the disease. We don’t know much about it,” he said. Dr Victor Mithi, the president of Malawi’s Society of Medical Doctors, said there is need for significant vigilance among practitioners within hospitals to make sure that “as we perform our day-to-day clinical procedures, we are able to screen those patients that may be having this condition”. “It is a big concern because in Malawi, most people live in crowded houses and still believe that as a form of expression of love, you need to shake hands, you need to hug people and all those things which are basically the risk factors in the transmission of this disease.” Mithi said that with the lessons drawn from Covid-19 and other infectious diseases, Malawi had the capacity to manage mpox, at clinical and community level. “The challenge exists though because of the withdrawal of the US aid; the capacity of our healthcare system is no longer the same. Almost 60% of our healthcare system is donor dependent, of which more than 50% of the donor aid was coming from [the US]. So the withdrawal means that our healthcare system is completely shaken, we are left in a state where we didn’t build internal capacities to sustain ourselves,” Mithi added.",

    "title": "Crown questions to fore as king visits Canada amid tensions with Trump",
    "article_text": "The decision by King Charles to formally open Canada’s parliament on Tuesday reflects his role as a “steadfast defender” of the country amid threats to its sovereignty, says prime minister Mark Carney. But Indigenous leaders say the rare visit is also a reminder that Canada’s founding relationship between the monarchy and the country’s first peoples cannot ever be “forgotten or displaced or broken”. Charles, Canada’shead of state, arrives in Ottawa on Monday, and will on Tuesday open Canada’s 45th parliament by giving the speech from the throne in the country’s senate. The visit marks the first time a king of Canada has ever undertaken a ceremonial speech from the throne. The last time a monarch opened a new parliament was in 1957, when Queen Elizabeth gave the throne speech. She subsequently gave a speech in 1977 as part of her silver jubilee tour of Canada. Carney’s invitation to Charles comes against the backdrop of Donald Trump’s repeated threats that the US should annex Canada and make it the 51st state. But when the king gives the throne speech laying out the new government’s goals and its plans to achieve them, he will be tightly constrained by what he can say. “Because we have a constitutional monarchy, the king can only operate inside a box that is defined by parliament – because we don’t want a king, or any unelected person, affecting policy and laws,” said Justin Vovk, a royal historian and author. “Any influence the monarch exerts is done through subtlety.” Vovk points to Elizabeth’s “brooch diplomacy” and her decision touse fashion statementsto telegraph support – or opposition – for political positions and leaders. When she met Trump in 2019, shewore a brooch gifted by Barack and Michelle Obamaand the following day displayed a snowflake brooch given to her by the governor-general of Canada amid tensions between Trump and then prime minister Justin Trudeau. In a similar vein, Charles recently wore a British admiral’s uniform with the insignia of the Canadian military and later planted a red maple tree on the grounds of Buckingham Palace, both actions seen as tacit support for Canada. But a lack of official public statements from the king on threats to Canada’s sovereignty is a reminder that the monarchy relies on the softest of soft power to make its point. “The monarchy is always playing this game of catch-up because they live in a time-delayed bubble. They can’t act until they are given the advice and the permission from the prime minister. Everything is filtered through bureaucratic channels and so by the time the sovereign is able to make a gesture, it usually comes somewhat after the fact ,” said Vovk. “It takes the monarchy time to catch up with the media and the expectations of a constantly changing world.” The US ambassador to Canada Pete Hoekstra told CBC News his country was “thrilled” the king is visiting – but said there were more straightforward ways to make his point. “If there’s a message in there, there’s easier ways to send messages. Just give me a call. [Mark] Carney can call the president at any time.” During his visit, Charles and his wife Camilla will meet community groups and take part in a game of street hockey, where he is expected to drop the puck. But the visit is also expected to once again revive questions over whether Canadians still want a monarch as their head of state. “Seeing the royal family in person always stirs up a level of interest in the royal family. And despite the waning interest, it’s much harder to be acrimonious to somebody when you see them in person. But every time we have a major royal event, it does raise questions about the system of government we have. Does it work best for Canada?” said Vovk. A majority of Canadians say they want the system of a constitutional monarchy abolished, but under the 1982 Constitution Act, severing ties with the monarchy would require Canada obtain the approval from the commons and the senate, as well as the unanimous consent of all 10 provinces. Thelast task is near impossible:provinces would fear that changes to the constitution could mean surrendering powers to the federal government. That has not quieted a growing chorus of critical voices. Before Charles’s coronation, the leader of the separatist Bloc Québécois said it wastime for Canada to sever its tieswith “incredibly racist” and “slave-driven” British monarchy. “It’s a thing of the past. It’s almost archaeological. It’s humiliating,” Yves-François Blanchet told lawmakers in 2022 during a speech in parliament, adding his party had been “forced” to swear allegiance to a “conquering” empire, rendering their oaths to the crown “meaningless”. Late last year, municipal councillors in the Yukon territoryrefused to swear or affirmthey would “be faithful and bear true allegiance to His Majesty King Charles III” and his “heirs and successors according to law” as protest over the colonial history of displacement of Indigenous people. But Perry Bellegarde, the former national chief for the Assembly of First Nations, said such frustrations reflect a failure of the crown to implement the terms of treaties signed between Indigenous peoples and Great Britain centuries ago. “The crown never passed a treaty implementation act. Instead, they passed the Indian Act to control our people. But just because the crown has done immense harm, it doesn’t mean you forget about the treaty,” he said. “Our elders always said, ‘As long as the sun shines, rivers flow and the grass grows, the treaty will remain in effect for children and generations now and those yet unborn.’ That’s the covenant. It cannot ever be forgotten or displaced or broken.” In 2001, Bellegarde and the late elder Gordon Oakes gave Charles, then Prince of Wales, the Cree name kīsikāwipīsimwa miyo ōhcikanawāpamik, meaning “the sun watches over him in a good way”. Bellegarde met Charles last week at Canada House in London ahead of the visit. Indigenous leaders will meet the king when he arrives and ahead of his speech from the throne, a young Métis musician will perform and an Inuk elder will light thequlliq, a ceremonial fire. “These are powerful symbols. But it’s also recognition of the power Indigenous peoples have to self-determination as defined by the constitution,” said Bellegarde. “To have the king visit, to have our treaty partner travel here to meet with us, it reflects the foundations of this country. And it’s also a reminder for everyone:the honour of the crownin these agreements must also always be upheld.” This article was amended on 26 May 2025. The speech that Queen Elizabeth gave in 1977 to lawmakers was part of her silver jubilee tour of Canada, not diamond jubilee as an earlier version said. And the Indian Act was mistakenly referred to as the “Indiana Act”. And 1957 was the year in which a monarch opened a new session of parliament for the first time, not the last time.",

    "title": "Emmanuel Macron says video of wife pushing him shows them ‘joking around’",
    "article_text": "Emmanuel Macron has denied he and his wife, Brigitte, had an altercation after a viral video promoted by Russian state media and French far-right accounts appeared to show her pushing him in the face as they prepared to get off a plane in Vietnam. The video, shot by an Associated Press camera operator, shows the French president appearing in the doorway of the plane at the start of a visit to Hanoi. His wife’s hand appears to shove him, causing him to step back before recovering and waving. Brigitte Macron’s body is not visible and her husband told reporters afterwards the gesture was playful. But the Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, seized on the footage, writing on Telegram that the president had received “a right hook”. “Did the first lady decide to cheer up her husband with a gentle pat on the cheek and miscalculated her strength?” she asked in a mocking post. “Did she want to fix his collar but ended up reaching the beloved face?” Zakharova added, after the Russia Today TV channel and associated social media accounts had repeatedly aired the clip. “Here’s a hint: maybe it was the ‘hand of the Kremlin’.” Macron told reporters in Hanoi he and his wife were “joking around, as we do quite often”. An Élysée Palace official told French media the scene showed “a moment of closeness. But that was enough to feed the conspiracy theorists.” Another Elysée sourcesaid the couplewere “decompressing one last time before the start of the visit, larking around”. Macron “loves playing jokes like on his wife before official occasions, and she always responds like this … It wasn’t even a slap.” Macron noted that other videos of him had been misinterpreted. People “have thought I shared a bag of cocaine, tussled with the Turkish president, now that I’m having a domestic dispute with my wife … None of this is true. Everyone needs to calm down,” he said. Zakharova and the US conspiracy theorist Alex Jonesthis month wrongly accusedMacron, the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, and the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, of using drugs on a train to Kyiv, claiming a crumpled tissue was a bag of cocaine. Macron told reporters in Hanoi the internet accounts making the claims were “familiar”, allying Russians with French extremists, adding that commentators had “explained this morning that my diplomacy was that of a battered husband”. France andVietnamon Monday signed deals on Airbus planes, defence and other pacts worth €9bn (£7.55bn) as the Macrons embarked on the first formal visit by a French presidential couple to the country’s former colony in nearly a decade. The deals with Vietnam come amid trade turmoil prompted by Donald Trump’s US tariffs and cover the purchase of 20 Airbus planes, cooperation on nuclear energy, defence, rail and maritime transport, satellites and vaccines.",

    "title": "Holiday bookings to Japan are down - could a 90s manga comic’s earthquake prediction be to blame?",
    "article_text": "A grim prediction made in a manga first published a quarter of a century ago is being blamed for a dramatic fall in holiday bookings toJapanfrom several Asian countries. Flight reservations toJapanfrom some of its key tourism markets have reportedly plummeted, with some linking the fall to The Future I Saw, a Japanese graphic novel based on the “prophetic” dreams of its author, Ryo Tatsuki. The cover of the original, published in 1999, refers to a “great disaster” occurring in March 2011 – the date Japan experienced a deadlyearthquake and tsunami. In a new edition containing additional material that was published in 2021, Tatsuki said the next major disaster would occur on 5 July 2025. Her claim has fuelled sensationalist social media posts warning people to stay away from Japan. While there is no scientific basis to the claims that are fuelling online speculation, Tatsuki’s dreams have been given credence by her previous reference to March 2011, when anearthquake and tsunami killed more than 18,000 peoplein north-east Japan and triggered the triple meltdown atFukushimaDaiichi nuclear power plant. The impact of her latest prediction is being felt most in South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, which used ForwardKeys data to gauge the impact on airline bookings. Average bookings from Hong Kong were down 50% year-on-year, it said, adding that those between late June and early July had plummeted by as much as 83%. A travel agency in Hong Kong said the manga had already affected people’s holiday plans, with bookings to Japan during the April-May spring break down by half from last year. Greater Bay Airlines said it was initially puzzled that reservations for spring were lower than in previous years, given that demand is usually high during the cherry blossom-viewing season in Japan and the Easter holidays in Hong Kong. “We expected around 80% of the seats to be taken, but actual reservations came to only 40%,” said Hiroki Ito, the general manager of the airline’s Japan office, told the Asahi Shimbun recently. The airline – along with Hong Kong Airlines – has reduced services to Japan, even as officials pleaded with travellers to ignore the rumours. Yoshihiro Murai, the governor of Miyagi – one of three prefectures hardest hit by the 2011 disaster – said the unfounded story had started to affect tourism to the region and implored people to ignore them. The trend is out of sync with atourism boomthat has seen record numbers of people visit Japan since the end of the Covid-19 pandemic. A record 3.9 million people visited in April, encouraged by a weaker yen, while the government is hoping the annual number will grow to 60 million by the end of the decade. The public broadcaster NHK said the manga had spawned more than 1,400 videos on YouTube – which have together been viewed more than 100m times – some of which added to the sense of alarm with predictions of a volcanic eruption and a meteor strike. The re-published version has sold almost 1m copies, it added. Japan is one of the mostearthquake-pronecountries in the world due to its location on the Pacific’s seismically hyperactive “ring of fire”. But experts point out it is impossible to predict the timing and location of earthquakes with any accuracy. Concern that the country could soon be struck by a major earthquake intensified last August, when the then prime minister, Fumio Kishida,cancelled an overseas tripafter seismologists warned that the risk of a “megaquake” occurring off the country’s Pacific coast had increased after an earlier quake. In April, a government taskforce said a quake of up to magnitude-9 in the Nankai Trough, located off Japan’s Pacific coast, would kill as many 298,000 people and destroy more than 2 million buildings, adding that there was a roughly 80% chance of such a quake happening in the next 30 years. Tatsuki, meanwhile, has warned people not to take her predictions literally. In a recent interview with the Mainichi Shimbun, the artist said she was pleased that her work had raised awareness of the need to prepare for natural disasters, but added: “It’s important not to be unnecessarily influenced … and to listen to the opinions of experts.”",

    "article_text": "New Zealand’s minister for resources, Shane Jones, said he will not be guilt-tripped by “apocalyptic images” of mining and its effects on the environment put forward by his critics, as he embarks on a major mining push. Jones, a member of the minor populist coalition party New Zealand First, wants todouble mineral exports to $3bn over the next decade, to boost economic growth and minimise the country’s reliance on imported resources, even if it results in environmental trade-offs. “People just conjure up these apocalyptic images because they don’t want this type of activity in New Zealand, because it flies in the face of an alternative vision. “I like to say to those people, you’ve met your match in me, because you’re not going to guilt trip me,” Jones told the Guardian. “Those people who have sought to deify our wilderness … those days are over. We are not going to sit around and read poetry to rare lizards, whilst our current account deficit goes down the gurgler,” Jones said. The government’s mining plan represents jobs and economic stability to some but has been met with strong opposition from others, who believe it will endanger New Zealand’s unique environment and species. Due to its isolation, New Zealand has high rates of endemic biodiversity, however some species are in worrying decline, witha high proportion threatened, or at risk of extinction. The mining strategy includes adding coal and gold to the “critical minerals list” – a selection of minerals considered essential to New Zealand’s economy, national security or technological needs. Elevenmining proposals to dig up coal, gold and mineral sands are being considered under the new fast-track process – acontroversial “one-stop shop”consenting regime for infrastructure and mining projects deemed nationally significant. The government says the process will include a description of the project’s impacts on the environment, which the decision-making panel must consider. But the scheme passed into law in 2024 amid anger it bypasses environmental regulations, shuts out public consultation and throws a lifeline to so-called ‘zombie’ projects that have been rejected in the courts and languishing for years, including a proposal tomine iron sands off Taranaki’s seabedrejected by the supreme court. Other controversial projects include a goldmine near the Coromandel under conservation land, which is home to the rare Archey’s frog, and two mines on the South Island’s West Coast: a goldmine critics fear willthreaten rare birds, and a coalmine onecologically significant land. The fast-track legislation promptedthousands to march in protestin 2024 and nearly 30,000 public submissions on the bill. This year, targeted protests have been springing up around some of the proposed mining sites. Nicola Toki, the chief executive of Forest & Bird, the country’s largest conservation organisation says the government has “declared a war on nature” and adds the mining push does not square with the way New Zealand sees itself. “When governments push on the things that define us, the New Zealand public does push back,” Toki says. But Jones told the Guardian his opponents’ distrust of miners and fears for the environment are misplaced and regulation should not be so disproportionate that companies abort their project. The minister claimed the “secular state has become victim to religiosity” over the environment. “People no longer go to church, but they treat snails and other critters in a way that historically would [not] have enjoyed religious veneration,” Jones tells the Guardian. “I’m not going to agree with that.” The country could no longer afford to maintain “that level of naivety in the face of major geopolitical changes”, he said, adding that it made no sense to import coal, when it could be produced in New Zealand. “It generates GST, it generates pay, it generates jobs, it generates corporate tax, but more importantly, it deepens the well of human capital,” Jones said. Further, the minister said he will campaign to “overcome the regulations obstructing mining activity on [conservation land]” ahead of the 2026 election. Glenn Banks, a professor in geography at Massey University, is less optimistic about the financial gains to be made from mining in New Zealand, saying volatility in the industry makes it hard to regulate – and rely on – foreign investment. “You get a lot of cowboys jump in on the boom and then walk away when prices aren’t good.” The inclusion of coal and gold on the critical minerals list is also “out of step with international definitions” Banks said. Critical minerals overseas are largely those considered to be instrumental for the development of renewable energy. Neither coal or gold fit that bill, he said. Labour’s spokesperson for resources, Megan Woods, said public scrutiny and careful assessment of environmental risks are essential to gaining the social licence for mining, but this government was “throwing those out” with the fast-track process. “I think that is to the detriment of New Zealand.”",

    "article_text": "A German court has convicted four former Volkswagen managers of fraud and given two of them prison sentences for their part in the “dieselgate” emissions test-cheating scandal that eruptedalmost a decade ago. The former head of development Heinz-Jakob Neusser received a suspended jail term of one year and three months from the court in the city of Braunschweig, according to the news agency Bloomberg. A former head of drive electronics, named only as Hanno J, was given a sentence of two years and seven months, German media reported. The heaviest sentence, of four years and six months, was given to the former head of diesel motor development Jens H, while the fourth defendant was given a suspended sentence of one year and 10 months. The defendants can appeal against the rulings. The scandal began in September 2015 when the US Environmental Protection Agency issued a notice of violation saying Volkswagen had rigged engine control software that enabled diesel cars to pass emissions tests while emitting far more pollution in actual driving. The company has paid more than $33bn (£24bn) in fines and compensation to vehicle owners. Two VW managersreceived prison sentences in the US. The former head of the company’s Audi division Rupert Stadler was given a suspended sentence of 21 months and a fine of €1.1m (£920,000); his sentence is still subject to appeal.

    "title": "Germany and Ukraine’s other allies scrap range limits on arms sent to Kyiv",
    "article_text": "The German chancellor has said that Germany, along with Ukraine’s other main western supporters, will remove range restrictions on weapons delivered to Kyiv for the first time, to enable it to defend itself against Russia. Friedrich Merz said Germany, Britain, France and the US had lifted the restrictions to enable Ukraine to be better able to hit military targets on Russian territory. “There are no longer any range restrictions on weapons delivered to Ukraine – neither by the British, nor by the French, nor by us, nor by the Americans,” he said on Monday, following Russia’slargest drone attack on Ukraineof the war to date. “This means that Ukraine can now defend itself, for example, by attacking military positions inRussia… with very few exceptions, it didn’t do that until recently. It can now do that.” In response, the Kremlin described the decision as “dangerous”, saying it would be detrimental to reaching any sort of peace agreement. “If these decisions have indeed been made, they are completely at odds with our aspirations for a political settlement,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. Merz, who has been in power for just under three weeks, would, however, not be drawn on whetherGermanywas preparing to send its long-range Taurus missiles to Kyiv. In opposition he had advocated for giving the missiles to Ukraine, which his predecessor, Olaf Scholz, had refused to do. Since entering office, Merz has taken a more cautious approach, saying Germany was in danger of giving too much away to Moscow if it talked openly about its plans, and arguing that Putin, a fluent German speaker, should not be able to find out what Berlin’s intentions were simply by watching the German TV news. Merz said last week he preferred the approach of “strategic ambiguity”. However, there is speculation in Berlin that he may be on the verge of making a public statement committing to the delivery of longer-range weaponry, possibly Taurus. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy is to visit the German capital on Wednesday, it was announced on Monday morning. Merz justified the change in policy of Germany and its allies, saying only by lifting the range restrictions was Ukraine in a position to be able to defend itself. “We call it in the jargon ‘long-range fire, which is to say to equip Ukraine with weapons with which it can strike at military goals beyond its borders,” Merz said, speaking at the Europaforum conference of the broadcaster WDR. He called this the “decisive difference between the military leadership of the aggressor Russia and Ukraine: whilst the latter has military goals in its sights, Russia is targeting civilians.” Western leaders have previously been pronounced in their insistence that to increase the weapons’ range was too provocative and in danger of escalating the conflict with the nuclear power, which has said the use of long-range weapons would be interpreted as the direct involvement in the war of the country that provided them. In his discussion with WDR, Merz was particularly acerbic in his criticism of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, saying his dismissive approach to engaging in talks that might lead to an end in fighting revealed his intention to prolong the war. “Putin obviously sees offers of talks as a sign of weakness,” he said. Sign up toThis is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion Hopes that the Vatican might provide a possible setting for negotiations after the Italian government said that the pope was prepared to organise talks, were dashed after the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said it would be “inelegant” for the Catholic church to act as a mediator between two Orthodox Christian countries. Merz seemed to suggest that diplomatic options had been all but exhausted, even as his parliamentary rivals on the right and the left have accused him and other leaders of not having done enough to negotiate a peace. “After the last three weeks, no one can seriously accuse us of not having exhausted all available diplomatic means,” Merz said. Ukraine’s supporters had “done everything” they could, he said, short of “raising a white flag”. “If even an offer to meet at the Vatican does not get [Putin’s] approval, then we must be prepared for this war to last longer than we all wish or can imagine,” he added. Until now, Germany, the second biggest deliverer of weapons to Ukraine after the US, had not delivered any weapons to Ukraine that had a range beyond 70km (43 miles). During the election campaign leading up to the 23 February poll, Merz said he was prepared to consider delivering Taurus missiles when in office, but only in conjunction with Germany’s western allies, which had either already delivered similar weapons or had access to them and were intending to do so.",

    "title": "EU hopes for quick deal to resolve US trade war after Trump delays 50% tariffs",
    "article_text": "EU leaders have expressed hopes for a quick deal to resolve the trade war with the US after Donald Trump announced he wasdelaying his threatened 50% tariffs for the blocuntil 9 July. The US president said on Sunday he would pause the border tax due to be imposed on 1 June, whichhe had announced two days earlier, after what he called a “very nice call” with Ursula von der Leyen. The European Commission president persuaded Trump to delay the duties by more than a month to give the two sides more time to negotiate. Her chief spokesperson, Paula Pinho, said the pair had agreed “to fast-track the trade negotiations and to stay in close contact”. Von der Leyen initiated the call, the EU spokesperson said, adding “there was, it seems, a mutual intention to speak to each other”. The EU trade commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, is due to speak to the US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, later on Monday. Thepair last spoke on Friday, after Trump’s latest tariff threat. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said on Monday he hoped Washington and Brussels could get to the lowest tariffs possible. “The discussions are advancing,” he told reporters during a trip to Vietnam. “There has been a good exchange between President Trump and President Von der Leyen and I hope we can continue on this road and return to the lowest possible tariffs that will allow for fruitful exchanges.” Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, who is deemed to have one of the closest relationships with the White House among EU leaders, was reported by local media to be trying to organise a meeting between Trump and European leaders in early June. Ireland’s foreign minister, Simon Harris, said there was “no time to waste” to find a deal that was good for the US and EU economies. “These contacts at the highest political level present the opportunity for negotiations to move forward. This is our priority. We want to see meaningful and substantive talks,” he said. Speaking on Monday, the commission confirmed thatthe EU’s “zero-for-zero” offerto eliminate tariffs on cars and industrial goods in transatlantic trade remained on the table. “We believe that is a very attractive starting point for a good negotiation that could lead to benefits on both sides of the Atlantic,” the trade spokesperson Olof Gill said. The commission declined to comment on the detailed talks between Trump and von der Leyen. The commission president hada brief exchange with Trumpat the pope’s funeral last month, her first since his return to the White House. Analysts have suggested the US president, who has repeatedly voiced hostility towards the EU and multilateral institutions, prefers to deal with national leaders. Trump initially announced a 20% levy on EU goods being sold into the US as part of his “liberation day” tariffs unveiled on 2 April, but a week later he reduced that to 10% to allow for time for talks. However on Friday, he claimed negotiations were “going nowhere”, upped the rate to 50% and brought the deadline forward to 1 June. Sign up toBusiness Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion European markets rose on Monday on the news the EU now faces a 10% duty until 9 July, with the Stoxx Europe 600 index reversing Friday’s losses. US markets were closed for a public holiday on Monday, but futures rose on the U-turn news. The flip-flopping on border taxes has left many businesses unsure of what plans to make, with many withdrawing their financial forecasts in response. Trump’s 25% tariffs on steel, aluminium and cars remain in place. Šefčovič held a video conference on Monday with the chief executives of the carmakers Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, BMW and Stellantis to reassure them. The EU hassuspended its retaliatory tariffs on €21bn(£18bn) of US agricultural and industrial goods in Republican states, but they will kick in on 14 July without a deal. The European Commission is also consulting member states and European industry on a further round of retaliatory tariffs targeting €95bn (£80bn) of US goods, including bourbon, cars and industrial machinery. The commission has previously said it has not ruled out targeting US tech firms or banks, a potent but politically explosive target, as the US runs a €109bn (£91bn) trade surplus with the EU in service industries. Trump is more focused on the US trade deficit in goods, worth €198bn (£166bn) in 2024. Speaking before Trump’s latest round of on-off tariff threats, a senior EU diplomat said all options for retaliation were on the table, but stressed the wish for a settlement: “At the moment we still want to be de-escalatory and in a negotiating mood.”",

Russia’s attack came despite Donald Trump’s warning on Sunday night that if Vladimir Putin attempts to conquer all of Ukraine it will lead to the “downfall” of Russia. In the same post, the US president said Putin was “absolutely CRAZY” after a weekend of deadly Russian drone and missile strikes on Ukraine.

The European Union has rejected a Russian request for consultations on its carbon border adjustment package, a World Trade Organization document showed on Monday, citing Russia’s “war of aggression” againstUkraineas the reason. Russia requested consultations with the EU over its carbon border levy earlier this month at the WTO – the first step in a dispute before formal proceedings begin. “The European Union is of the view that the consultations requested by the Russian Federation cannot be fruitful and cannot lead to a mutually satisfactory solution of (the) matter at hand,” an EU document submitted to the WTO on 26 May read. A top Kremlin official on Monday scoffed at a report thatRussiacould be involved in recent arson attacks on the private home of British prime minister Keir Starmer, a building where he once lived and a car that he had owned. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was responding to a Financial Times report that said UK security officials were looking into whether Russia was involved in the attacks. The Associated Press was not been able to independently confirm the FT report that relied on unnamed senior UK government figures. But Peskov, who the London-based paper said did not respond to a request when it published the story Friday, was asked about the report at his regular press briefing Monday. “London tends to suspect Russia of anything bad that happens in the UK,” Peskov said. “As a rule, all these suspicions are groundless, unsubstantiated and often laughable.” No one was injured in the fires that occurred on three nights between 8 May and 12 May in north London, authorities said. Three men with ties toUkraineface arson charges and are being held without bail before a hearing 6 June in London’s Central Criminal Court. A prosecutor said there was no explanation for the crimes and no official has publicly said Moscow is behind the fires.

Ukraine has previously received long-range missiles from Washington, London and Paris but Kyiv was initially only allowed to use them against Russian military targets in occupied Ukrainian territories. My colleaguesPeter BeaumontandPjotr Sauerhave filed a report about Russia’s continuing attacks on Ukraine and the diplomatic reaction to the assaults.Here is an extract from their piece: Russia has massively scaled up its domestic production of drones such as the Shahed, meaning it is no longer reliant upon Iran for its supply as it was when the weapons were first deployed even as it has developed sophisticated new tactics for their use, making them an increasingly potent weapon. Analysts are split, however, whether the heavy bombing of Ukrainian cities is a tactic in its own right, to demoralise the Ukrainian home front, or is part of a wider push on the battlefield going into the summer amid Ukrainian and western intelligence assessments that Russia intends to continue fighting through this year. The Netherlands will send the last one of 24 promised F-16 fighter jets toUkraineon Monday, defence ministerRuben Brekelmanssaid on Sunday on a Dutch television talkshow. The first 23 Dutch F-16 jets were delivered from last summer. The Netherlands has also provided fighter jets to a training centre in Romania for Ukrainian pilots and crew. The F-16 fighter jets that Ukraine has received from its western partners to help fight Russia’s invasion have been the frontline combat planes of choice for the Nato alliance for 50 years. Analysts say the F-16s enhance Ukraine’s military strength, especially by upgrading its air defences and enabling it to hit distant targets with sophisticated weaponry. Denmark’s prime ministerMette Frederiksensaid on Monday that Russia’s attacks onUkraineover the weekend proved that Moscow is not interested in peace, Reuters reports. Reuters reports that, despite the chancellery in Germnay declining to comment, several sources have confirmed to it that Ukraine’s presidentVolodymyr Zelenskyyis expected to visit Berlin on Wednesday. It was first reported by news outlet Spiegel, who said Zelenskyy would meet with chancellorFriedrich Merzand German presidentFrank-Walter Steinmeier. Emmanuel Macron said Monday he hopes Donald Trump’s anger at Moscow “translates into action”. Speaking to reporters in Hanoi, AFP reports the French president said: President Trump realises that when President Putin said on the phone he was ready for peace, or told his envoys he was ready for peace, he lied. We have seen once again in recent hours Donald Trump express his anger. A form of impatience. I simply hope now that this translates into action. In a post to social media yesterday, the US president saidVladimir Putinhad gone “crazy” and that an attempt to conquer all of Ukraine “will lead to the downfall of Russia!”. The Kremlin has repeatedly rejected proposals for a 30-day ceasefire from Kyiv and its western allies, but the unwillingness of the Trump administration to press ahead with wider sanctions against Russia over the war inUkrainehas been the subject of some dismay in European capitals. Reuters has a quick snap, citing Der Spiegel, thatVolodymyr Zelenskyywill visit Berlin on Wednesday. French presidentEmmanuel Macron, who is on a diplomatic trip to Vietnam, has been asked about Russia’s continuing attacks. He said he thinks Donald Trump is realising aspects of Vladimir Putin’s lies regarding Ukraine, adding that he hopes the US president’s anger at Putin will “translate into action” (presumably meaning sanctions, along with the EU). We will give you more comments as they come in. Last month, Ukrainian presidentVolodymyr Zelenskyysaid China was supplying weapons to Russia, including gunpowder and artillery, and that Chinese representatives were involved in weapons production on Russian territory. He citedreporting by Ukrainian security and intelligence agencies. China dismissed the accusations as “groundless” in response, with the country’s foreign minister saying Beijing has been trying to push for a ceasefire in the war and have been promoting peace talks. As my colleague Dan Sabbaghnotes in this story, Russia makes heavy use of Chinese-made components in its arms industry, and Ukraine does so to some extent. Both sides make significant use of Mavic drones from the Chinese manufacturer DJI, though Kyiv is trying to reduce its dependence on products from Beijing. In February 2022, China and Russia declared a“no limits” partnershipwhenVladimir Putinvisited Beijing to meetXi Jinpingshortly before he launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine has said thatChinais supplying a range of important products to Russian military plants, the chief of Ukrainian foreign intelligencetold Ukrinform news agency. Oleh Ivashchenkosaid: There is information that China is delivering machines, special chemicals, gunpowder, and components specifically to military-purpose enterprises. We have confirmed data on 20 Russian factories. Here is a snippet of the Ukrinform report, which we have not yet independently verified. According to Ivashchenko, at least five instances of “aviation-related cooperation” with China were recorded in 2024–2025, involving equipment, spare parts, and documentation. Additionally, six major shipments of special chemicals were identified. The intelligence chief also noted that as of early 2025, 80% of critical electronics used in Russian drones originate from China. This includes cases of mislabeled items, deceptive product naming, and the use of shell companies to smuggle necessary components for microelectronics production from China into Russia. Russia’s defence ministry said earlier today that air defence systems had downed 96 Ukrainian drones, including six over theMoscowregion. Moscow’sDomodedovoandZhukovskyairports temporarily halted flights, Russia’s aviation watchdog Rosaviatsia said. Dmitry Peskovsaid the latest drone and missile attacks onUkraine– the heaviest recorded so far in the war - are in reaction to Kyiv’s attacks on Russian infrastructure. “We have seen how the Ukrainians have been hitting our social infrastructure, peaceful infrastructure. This is a response strike. It’s a strike against military facilities, military targets,” the Kremlin spokesperson has beenquoted by BBC Newsas having said.",

    "title": "World’s oldest fingerprint may be a clue that Neanderthals created art",
    "article_text": "One day around 43,000 years ago, a Neanderthal man in what is now centralSpaincame across a large granite pebble whose pleasing contours and indentations snagged his eye. Something in the shape of that quartz-rich stone – perhaps its odd resemblance to an elongated face – may have compelled him to pick it up, study it and, eventually, to dip one of his fingers in red pigment and press it against the pebble’s edge, exactly where the nose on that face would have been. In doing so, he left behind what is thought to be the world’s oldest complete human fingerprint, on what would appear to be the oldest piece of European portable art. The discovery, which could enrich our understanding of howNeanderthalssaw and interpreted the world, has come to light after almost three years of research by a team of Spanish archaeologists, geologists and police forensic experts. The dig team noticed there was something odd about the stone – which is just over 20cm in length – as soon as they found it while excavating the San Lázaro rock shelter on the outskirts of Segovia in July 2022. It did not look like something that had been used as a hammer or an anvil; it didn’t look like a tool at all. “The stone was oddly shaped and had a red ochre dot, which really caught our eye,” said David Álvarez Alonso, an archaeologist at Complutense University in Madrid. “We were all thinking the same thing and looking at each other because of its shape: we were all thinking, ‘This looks like a face’. But obviously that wasn’t enough. As we carried on our research, we knew we needed information to be able to advance the hypothesis that there was some purposefulness here, this was a symbolic object and that one possible explanation – although we’ll never know for sure – is that this was the symbolisation of a face.” Determined to test their conviction that the red mark was a human fingerprint placed deliberately between the indentations that could have been the eyes and mouth of a face, the team enlisted the help of other experts. Further investigations confirmed that the pigment, which contained iron oxides and clay minerals, was not found elsewhere in or around the cave. “We then got in touch with the scientific police to determine whether we were right that the dot had been applied using a fingertip,” said Álvarez Alonso. “They confirmed that it had.” The print, they concluded, was human and could be that of an adult male. “Once we had that and all the other pieces, context and information, we advanced the theory that this could be apareidolia[catching sight of a face in an ordinary, inanimate object] which then led to a human intervention in the form of the red dot,” said the archaeologist. “Without that red dot, you can’t make any claims about the object.” Álvarez Alonso argues that the dot’s existence raises questions that all point in the same direction. “It couldn’t have been a coincidence that the dot is where it is – and there are no markings to indicate any other use,” he said. “So why did they bring this pebble from the river to the inside of the cave? And, what’s more, there’s no ochre inside the cave or outside it. So they must have had to bring pigment from elsewhere.” The team’s findings, reported in the journalArchaeological and Anthropological Sciences, reinforce the idea that Neanderthals – who died out some 40,000 years ago –were capable of acts of artistic and symbolic creation, meaning modern humans were not the first to use art as a means of expression. Sign up toThis is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion “The fact that the pebble was selected because of its appearance and then marked with ochre shows that there was a human mind capable of symbolising, imagining, idealising and projecting his or her thoughts on an object,” the authors write. “Furthermore, in this case, we can propose that three fundamental cognitive processes are involved in creating art: the mental conception of an image, deliberate communication, and the attribution of meaning. These are the basic elements characterising symbolism and, also prehistoric – non-figurative – art. Furthermore, this pebble could thus represent one of the oldest known abstractions of a human face in the prehistoric record.” Álvarez Alonso and his colleagues are looking forward to the debate that their discovery will reignite over whether modern humans were the first artists. “We’ve set out our interpretation in the article, but the debate goes on,” he said. “And anything to do with Neanderthals always prompts a massive debate. If we had a pebble with a red dot on it that was done 5,000 years ago by Homo sapiens, no one would hesitate to call it portable art. But associating Neanderthals with art generates a lot of debate. I think there’s sometimes an unintentional prejudice.” Still, said the archaeologist, he and the rest of the team believed the most logical explanation was that someone, a very long time ago, “saw something special in this pebble”, picked it up and set about imbuing it with meaning. “Why would a Neanderthal have seen it differently from the way we see it today?” he asked. “They were human, too. The thing here is that we’re dealing with an unparalleled object; there’s nothing similar. It’s not like art where, if you discover a cave painting, there are hundreds more you can use for context. But our assertion is that the Neanderthals had a similar capacity for symbolic thought to Homo sapiens – and we think this object reinforces that notion.”",

    "title": "UK must impose sanctions on Israel to meet legal obligations, say more than 800 lawyers",
    "article_text": "The UK must impose sanctions on the Israeli government and its ministers and also consider suspending it from the UN to meet its “fundamental international legal obligations”, more than 800 lawyers, academics and retired senior judges, including former supreme court justices, have said. Ina letter to the prime minister, they welcome Keir Starmer’s joint statement last week with the leaders of France and Canada warning thatthey were prepared to take “concrete actions”against Israel. But they urge him to act without delay as “urgent and decisive action is required to avert the destruction of the Palestinian people of Gaza”. The signatories, including the former supreme court justices Lord Sumption and Lord Wilson, court of appeal judges and more than 70 KCs, say that war crimes, crimes against humanity and serious violations of international humanitarian law are being committed in Palestine. There is mounting evidence of genocide, which is either being perpetrated or at a minimum at serious risk of occurring, the letter states, highlighting recent comments by the Israeli finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, who said Israel’s armywould “wipe out”what remains of Palestinian Gaza. The signatories tell Starmer: “All states, including the UK, are legally obliged to take all reasonable steps within their power to prevent and punish genocide; to ensure respect for international humanitarian law; and to bring to an end violations of [the right to self-determination]. The UK’s actions to date have failed to meet those standards … The international community’s failure to uphold international law in relation to the occupied Palestinian territory contributes to a deteriorating international climate of lawlessness and impunity and imperils the international legal system itself. Your government must act now, before it is too late.” The UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, last week announcedthe suspension of negotiationsover a new free trade deal with Israel, but the two-page letter, backed by a 35-page legal memorandum, says he must go further, faster by reviewing existing trade ties, suspending the 2030 roadmap for closer UK-Israel partnership and imposing trade sanctions. The legal experts call on him to immediately sanction Israeli ministers or senior officials in the Israel Defense Forces who they accuse of having incited genocide or supporting and sponsoring illegal settlements. They note that so far financial sanctions and travel bans have beenlimited to individual settlers, settler outposts and settler organisations. The Israeli prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, has previously said: “The charge of genocide levelled against Israel is not only false, it’s outrageous, and decent people everywhere should reject it.” The letter, also signed by the former court of appeal judges Sir Stephen Sedley, Sir Anthony Hooper and Sir Alan Moses, a former chair of the bar of England and Wales (Matthias Kelly KC) and of the bar of Northern Ireland (Brian Fee KC), says Israel has been responsible for “an unparalleled assault on the United Nations”. It points to Israel’s banning of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, which it calls the “backbone of aid” for the Palestinian people, from operating in the occupied territory and “attacks on UN premises, property and personnel”. These acts are said to “go beyond isolated breaches. They amount to a broader challenge to the UN charter system itself.” Accordingly, as a permanent member on the UN security council, the signatories say the UK should consider initiating proceedings that provide for suspension of a member state. Moses said: “We, in the UK, cannot expect peace unless we fulfil our obligations under international law. That is what upholding the rule of law means. It is an exercise in futility for a government to say it upholds the rule of law, if it then does nothing to demonstrate it.” Prof Guy Goodwin-Gill, a signatory and emeritus fellow of All Souls College, University of Oxford, said: “Now is the time for the UK to show its commitment to the rule of law and to a future in which Palestinians can freely fulfil their right to self-determination. Everyone must be free from persecution, from displacement and ethnic cleansing, from the devastation and death deliberately inflicted on them in their homes, schools and hospitals, in their farms and villages. No one should ever be a refugee in their own land.” Lammy’s strongest intervention on Israel to date came amid anger at Israel’s refusal to allow thousands of aid trucks access tostarving Palestinians. While an 11-week blockade has officially been lifted, the letter says that the limited aid allowed in “remains gravely insufficient to address the unfolding humanitarian catastrophe”. More than53,000 Palestinians have been killedby the Israeli offensive in Gaza since 7 October 2023 when a Hamas attack on southern Israel killed 1,200 people. An Israeli strike early on Monday on a school turned shelter, while people inside were sleeping, killed 36, according to health officials. Also on Monday, one of Israel’s staunchest allies, Germany, added to international condemnation, with the chancellor,Friedrich Merz, saying the harm inflicted on civilians “can no longer be justified as a fight against Hamas terrorism”. In order to meet its legal obligations, the UK is also urged in the letter to secure an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza, the resumption of aid and the lifting of Israel’s ban on Unrwa. Finally, it says the UK should confirm that it would executethe international criminal court’s arrest warrantsagainst the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his former defence minister, Yoav Gallant. The letter increases the pressure on Starmer to act in the same week that the attorney general, Lord Hermer KC, is due to deliver the Rusi thinktank’s annual security lecture on “the condition of the international-rules-based-order”. Many Labour and Tory backbenchers have already said that the suspension of talks on the free trade deal does not go nearly far enough. Aprevious letterfrom members of the UK legal community sent last year said the UK was breaching international law by continuing to arm Israel. Weapons sales are not addressed in the latest missive because the issue isawaiting judgment by the high court in Londonafter a legal challenge.",

    "title": "Gaza’s youngest influencer aged 11 among children killed by Israeli strikes",
    "article_text": "Eleven-year-old Yaqeen Hammad, Gaza’s youngest influencer, is among the dozens of children killed byIsraelin recent strikes, as its forces intensify their military offensive across the Palestinian territory. Known for her bright smile and volunteering efforts, Yaqeen was killed on Friday night after Israeli forces shelled the al-Baraka area of Deir al-Balah in northernGaza, amid intense fighting in the region. Yaqeen and her older brother, Mohamed Hammad, delivered food, toys and clothing to displaced families, Al Jazeera has reported. She was also Gaza’s youngest influencer, offering practical survival tips for daily life under bombardment, such as advice on how to cook with improvised methods when there was no gas. In one social media post, Yaqeen wrote: “I try to bring a bit of joy to the other children so that they can forget the war.” She played an active role in the Ouena collective, a Gaza-based non-profit organisation dedicated to humanitarian relief. She often accompanied her older brother, Mohamed, a humanitarian worker, and together they distributed aid – food, toys and clothing. They often visited camps and makeshift shelters for displaced families. In each place they went, she tried to spread cheer and comfort to the children.

When news of her death spread online, there was an outpouring of messages of grief and tributes from activists, followers and journalists. Mahmoud Bassam, a photojournalist in Gaza, said: “Her body may be gone, but her impact remains a beacon of humanity.” “Instead of being at school and enjoying her childhood, another tribute read on X, she was active on Instagram and participating in campaigns to help others in Gaza. No words. Absolutely no words.” Israel has intensified its air campaign in Gaza in recent days. Its airstrikes killed at least 52 people on Monday, including 31 in a school turned shelter that was struck as people slept, igniting their belongings, according to local health officials. On Sunday, Israeli attackskilled at least 38 people, health officials said, bringing the death toll to more than 100 over the weekend. Yaqeen died during the same series of strikes across the territory that killed nine of a paediatrician’s 10 children sparking outrage within the international community.",

    "title": "Thousands of Israelis join violent, racist march through Jerusalem’s Muslim quarter",
    "article_text": "Thousands of Israelis have joined a state-funded march through the Muslim quarter of the Old City in Jerusalem, where large groups chanted racist slogans including “Gaza is ours”, “death to the Arabs” and “may their villages burn”. The annual march, paid for and promoted by the Jerusalem city government, celebrates Israel’s capture and occupation of East Jerusalem and its holy sites in the war of 1967. The Israeli takeover is not recognised internationally. The Jerusalem municipality advertises the event, known as the flag march, as a “festive procession”, part of a broader programme of events celebrating the “liberation” of the city. The march has been marred by racism and attacks on Palestinians for years, and is preceded by a campaign of violence in the Old City that in effect shuts down Palestinian majority areas, particularly in the Muslim Quarter. From before midday on Monday small groups of young Israeli men attacked and harassed shopkeepers and passersby inside the city, spitting at women in hijabs, stealing from cafes, ransacking a bookshop and entering at least one home by force. “Shut now, or I can’t protect you,” a police officer told cafe owner Raymond Himo, when he protested about teenagers in religious Zionist dress stealing drinks. On Monday, shops had mostly closed by 1pm, hours earlier than in previous years, with residents barricaded in their homes. Aviv Tatarsky, a researcher with the Ir Amim non-profit that works for an equitable Jerusalem, said: “It deprives people of their economic livelihood, makes them feel unsafe in their surroundings. Symbolically it sends a message: ‘You don’t belong here, we are the ones who own this place.’” From midday, groups of Jewish men inside the city shouted racist chants including “may their villages burn”, “Mohammed is dead” and “death to Arabs”. Those slogans were picked by larger groups of mostly men that began arriving in the late afternoon. Women approached the Western Wall on a separate march, which is largely divided by gender for religious reasons. One large group arriving at the Damascus Gate chanted “Gaza is ours”, and carried a large banner reading “Jerusalem 1967,Gaza2025”, in effect threatening full military annexation of the strip to echo the capture of East Jerusalem. Another banner read a “without a Nakba there is no victory”, referring to the forcible expulsion of about 700,000 Palestinians when the state of Israel was created in 1948. The procession is coordinated by “Am K’Lavi”, a non-profit whose only activity is organising the flag day march. It is chaired by Baruch Kahane, the son of Meir Kahane, a Jewish supremacist Rabbi who founded the Kach party. Banned as a political party in Israel in the 1980s under anti-terror legislation, it is now a far-right movement. Some marchers wore T-shirts with the party’s symbol of a clenched fist in a star of David. Others wore shirts with the names of their high schools, which had organised group outings to the march. Despite the history of violence at the march there was a relatively light police presence inside the Old City, and they did little to protect many of the Palestinians targeted with violence. Activists from the group Standing Together, who stood as human shields in front of attackers protected only by purple gilets identifying them as members were often the only barrier preventing the violence escalating. The far-right national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir was among the crowds arriving at the Old City around sunset. He had earlier made an inflammatory trip to pray at al-Aqsa mosque in its compound, where officially Israel does not permit Jewish believers to carry out religious rituals. The prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, hosted a cabinet meeting in Silwan, in occupied East Jerusalem. He ignored warnings from the Shin Bet security service that it would be an inflammatory move, Israeli media reported. The flag march is already seen as a violent and deeply provocative expression of Jewish control of Jerusalem, which has in the past triggered broader conflict. Violence at the same eventhelped spark the 11-day war between Israel and Hamas in 2021. Danny Seidemann, an Israeli attorney specialising in the geopolitics of Jerusalem, described Netanyahu’s cabinet meeting as political “pyromania”. “The ridge to the south of the ramparts of the Old City, literally in the shadow of the Old City, is indeed the location of biblical Jerusalem. But it is also a contemporary Palestinian neighbourhood,” Seidemann said. “The past is being weaponised by biblically motivated settlers to displace Palestinians, demolish their homes and recreate their vision of a renewed pseudo-ancient Israel. This is the site, the most contested and volatile in Jerusalem, is where Netanyahu has decided to ‘celebrate’.”",

    "title": "UK food inflation rises for fourth month in a row as steaks beef up prices",
    "article_text": "Food inflation in the UK has risen for the fourth month in a row, figures show, driven by increases in the cost of fresh produce, including steak. The annual rate of food price rises hit 2.8% this month, after a 2.6% rise in April, according to the latest shop price data from the British Retail Consortium (BRC). However, prices overall remained in deflation – 0.1% cheaper than a year ago and unchanged from last month – with the cost of non-food goods falling, particularly for electricals as retailers cut prices to drum up business before apotential hit from Donald Trump’s tariffs. The BRC’s monthly shop price index, carried out in conjunction with the research firm NielsenIQ, found that fresh food was the biggest contributor. “Fresh foods were the main driver, and red meat eaters may have noticed their steak got a little more expensive as wholesale beef prices increased,” said Helen Dickinson, the BRC chief executive. The cost of non-food goods fell by 1.5% compared with May last year, but the BRC warned that the rate of deflation was slowing in categories such as fashion and furniture as retailers began to pull back on promotions. The BRC said the overall deflationary market was coming under pressure as retailers absorbed a £5bn cost hit from last month’s increase in employer national insurance contributions, and the rise in the “national living wage”. Later this year, retailers will also have toabsorb a £2bn risein costs relating to a new packaging tax. The BRC said the cost increases could force retailers to pass on price rises to consumers, meaning households will have to “brace themselves for more difficult times ahead as prices rise faster”. The shop price data follows a surge in inflation across the wider economy. Last week, the Office for National Statistics reporteda larger than expected jump in annual inflation to 3.5% in April. The increase, to the highest rate in more than a year, followed dramatic increases in water bills, energy costs and council tax. Sign up toBusiness Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion The increase was fuelled by higher payments for gas, electricity, water and transport that led to last month being called“awful April”. Last Friday, the energy regulator Ofgem said the cap on gas and energy chargeswould fall 7% from July, the equivalent of £129 a year for the average home on a typical dual-fuel bill. The rare dose of good news, and a further expected reduction expected when Ofgem reassesses the cap again in September, has led some analysts to say this trend should limit the rise in inflation this year. The Bank of England forecast earlier this month that inflation would peak at an average 3.5% over the summer months.",

    "article_text": "Holidaymakers in countries hit the hardest by Donald Trump’s trade tariffs are taking the US off their list for trips abroad, according to online travel booking data. Findings from the hotel search site Trivago also suggest that UK and US travellers are increasingly choosing domestic holidays amid concerns over an uncertain economy. The company has seen double-digit percentage declines in bookings to the US from travellers based in Japan, Canada and Mexico. The latter two countries were the first on Trump’s tariff hitlist when heannounced tariffs of 25% on 1 February. Canadians in particular were incensed at Trump’s repeated suggestions that its northern neighbour would bebetter off annexed as the 51st state of the US. According to Trivago’s findings, which were shared with PA Media, demand among Germans was also “down heavily”, with hotel bookings in the US showing a single-digit percentage decline. Germany is the largest economy in the EU, which Trump has repeatedly threatened with increased tariffs, most recently saying on Sunday he had“paused” a 50% taxhe intended to introduce next month. There has not been a significant change in the numbers of UK holidaymakers travelling to the US. The UK has so far faced some of the lightest tariffs globally and last month struck a“breakthrough” trade deal with the US. Businesses operating in its $2.6tn tourism industry are becoming increasingly concerned about a“Trump slump”due to the turmoil the president’s tariff war is causing on the global economy. Last month, the federal government’s National Travel and Tourism Office released preliminary figures showingvisits to the US from overseas fell by 11.6% in Marchcompared with the same month last year.

    "title": "Nearly 50 injured after car ploughs into crowd at Liverpool FC victory parade",
    "article_text": "Liverpool FC’s Premier League victory parade descended into chaos on Monday evening after a car collided with pedestrians in the city centre leaving nearly 50 people injured including children. A 53-year-old white British man believed to be the driver of the vehicle was arrested at the scene of the collision on Water Street in the heart of the city, metres from the Royal Liver Building and the town hall, after roads had been reopened following the main parade. Scenes of jubilation with thousands of Liverpool fans lining the streets to celebrate their club’s Premier League victory were rapidly replaced with scenes of fear and confusion as emergency services arrived on the street at about 6pm. At a late-night press conference, North West ambulance service confirmed 27 people were taken to hospital, with two of the injured including one child sustaining serious injuries. In addition, 20 patients were treated at the scene near Water Street. Four children were injured in total. ACC Jenny Sims, with Merseyside police, said the incident is not being treated as terrorism and they are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident. The prime minister said the scenes were “appalling”, while Liverpool FC offered its “thoughts and prayers” to those affected by the incident. Footage showed police cordons in place around the heavily littered road, with a large police presence, ambulances and a fire engine also at the scene. Upsetting images captured a person being taken away on a stretcher and a man walking with his arm around a police officer for support. It is understood that approximately 30 people were treated for injuries or shock in an Italian restaurant opposite Liverpool town hall, around the corner from the scene of the collision. Les Winsper, 55, who witnessed the incident, said: “People started banging on the [car] windows. Then they smashed the windows and he’s panicked and put his foot down. He then hit someone and that person has gone in the air and he’s ploughed through the rest of them. I’ve never seen anything like it.” He added the first victim was thrown “about 20 feet” in the air by the collision. Winsper’s friend, Craig Steward, 52, said there was “chaos” with “people crying, children crying, shaking”. He added: “I personally think he’s hit someone by mistake and then he’s put his foot down. It was the worst thing I’ve seen in my life, you see it on TV. That’s why all the kids are crying, because they witnessed it. I’m traumatised.” Both men said the incident lasted 20 to 30 seconds. St John ambulance workers were among the first at Water Street to treat those injured, some of whom are believed to be in a critical condition. A reporter at the scene saw two “distressed” volunteer medics being comforted by colleagues as they made their way from the scene. Outside the police cordon, Sonny Singh, 40, said he saw an injured teenager and dozens of people run past him “crying and angry” shortly after the collision. “People were running, screaming … I saw a boy, probably about 15, holding his leg and bleeding. There were loads of people there,” he said, adding that he had heard the vehicle hit dozens of fans. Singh, from Leicester, had been celebrating with his two sons, aged nine and 13. Matt Cole, a BBC reporter who attended the parade with his family, witnessed the incident. He told BBC News: “There were screams ahead of us and suddenly this dark blue car just came through the crowd. It just wasn’t stopping. I managed to grab my daughter who was with me and jump out of the way. “It missed myself and my family by literally inches. We then turned and watched what happened momentarily behind us before running. “It was being chased by a group of men who were trying to bang on the side of it and throw things at it. The back of the rear windshield had been completely smashed in, but it just had no intention of stopping.” He added: “An entire squad of armed police cars stopped, and people jumped out with rifles and again big medical packs on and began running to the scene of the incident.” One eyewitness said the vehicle reversed before “what seemed like an incredibly deliberate” acceleration into a crowd of people on Water Street. Harry Rashid, 48, from Solihull, was at the parade with his wife and two young daughters when he witnessed the collision. “It happened about 10 feet away from us … The vehicle came to our right. It emerged from just right next to an ambulance, which was parked up. This grey people carrier just pulled up from the right and just rammed into all the people at the side of us. “It was travelling south, down Water Street, straight towards the Strand, which is where the docks are. It was extremely fast. Initially, we just heard the pop, pop, pop of people just being knocked off the bonnet of a car. Rashid described how crowds began trying to smash the car windows: “Then he stalled for a few seconds, probably about 10 seconds. Then the crowd that was a bit further back started rushing at him trying to smash his windows. “But then he put his foot down again and just ploughed through the rest of them, he just kept going. It was horrible. And you could hear the bumps as he was going over the people. Then my daughter started screaming and there were people on the ground. “It looked clearly deliberate.” Rashid continued: “They were just innocent people, just fans going to enjoy the parade. There were hundreds and thousands of us there because this is probably the busiest part of Liverpool. We were shocked, couldn’t believe it.” Emergency services arrived at the scene “within seconds”, he said. “Ambulances were already there. There was one right next to where this occurred, so there was a paramedic inside there. “But then they started arriving within seconds, they’re all trying to get to the crowd and negotiate the crowd, which is very difficult to do, you see, because there’s that many people, they’ve constantly been trying to move. “I just wanted my kids to get off the road regardless because I couldn’t trust whether there’s a follow-up attack or something like that. Because you are just exposed there on the pavement. “I saw people lying on the ground, people unconscious. It was horrendous. So horrendous.” Natasha Rinaldi, who was watching the parade from her friend’s living room, said: “People were very angry and shocked, and then the police intervened. And then we heard the ambulances coming.” North West ambulance service said the scene was cleared by about 9.30pm. Keir Starmer and the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, are being kept updated about events. Starmer said: “The scenes in Liverpool are appalling – my thoughts are with all those injured or affected. I want to thank the police and emergency services for their swift and ongoing response to this shocking incident. “I’m being kept updated on developments and ask that we give the police the space they need to investigate.” In a statement posted on social media, Liverpool FC said: “We are in direct contact with Merseyside police regarding the incident on Water Street which happened towards the end of the trophy parade earlier this evening. “Our thoughts and prayers are with those who have been affected by this serious incident. “We will continue to offer our full support to the emergency services and local authorities who are dealing with this incident.” Steve Rotheram, mayor of the Liverpool city region, said: “Our hearts go out to all of those affected, especially those who have been injured. Thank you, as ever, to the first responders for their professionalism and swift action. “This is a difficult day for our city region, but we stand together.” A spokesperson for the north west ambulance service said: “NWAS is supporting an incident in Liverpool city centre, following reports of a road traffic collision. “We are currently assessing the situation and working with other members of the emergency services. Our priority is to ensure people receive the medical help they need as quickly as possible.”",

    "title": "Trump peppers Memorial Day speech with personal boasting and partisan attacks",
    "article_text": "Donald Trump honored the sacrifices of US military veterans in the traditional presidential Memorial Day speech at Arlington national cemetery, but also peppered his address on Monday with partisan political asides while talking up his own plans and achievements. The US president laid a wreath and paid tribute to fallen soldiers and gave accounts of battlefield courage as tradition dictates, from prepared remarks, after saluting alongside his vice-president, JD Vance and defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, who both served in Iraq. But Trump also veered off into rally-style personal boasting and brief partisan attacks during the solemn event. “Those young men could never have known what their sacrifice would mean to us, but we certainly know what we owe to them. That valor gave us the freest, greatest and most noble republic ever to exist on the face of the earth,” he said of those killed in military service. Then he went on: “A republic that I am fixing after a long and hard four years. That was a hard four years we went through.” The president continued with ananti-immigrationstatement that chimes withhis agenda, though without directly mentioning his predecessor, Democratic president Joe Biden who served between Trump’s first term and the Republican’s return to the White Housethis January. “Who would let that happen? People pouring through our borders unchecked. People doing things that are indescribable and not for today to discuss,” Trump said. It was a nod to his Truth Social platform on Monday morning wherehe posteda tirade against judges who hold up his deportation aims, chiefly because of his ignoring due process obligations, as “monsters” and again attacked undocumented immigrants, using sweeping disparagements. At Arlington, he added, to cheers from supporters in the crowd: “We will do better than we’ve ever done as a nation, better than ever before. I promise you that.” Drawing attention to airmen lost in a raid over Vietnam and to a soldier lost to a suicide bombing in Iraq, while family members listened to the speech at the cemetery on the outskirts ofWashington DC, Trump said: “These warriors picked up the mantle of duty and service, knowing that to live for others meant always that they might die for others. They asked nothing. They gave everything. And we owe them everything and more.” “The greatest monument to their courage is not carved in marble or cast in bronze – it’s all around us, an American nation 325 million strong, which will soon be greater than it has ever been before,” he said. “It will be.” He also used the solemn occasion to promote the celebration next month of the US army’s 250th anniversary, which he said “blows everything away, including the World Cup and including the Olympics, as far as I’m concerned”. Both events – the soccer World Cup next year, and the next summer Olympics in 2028 – are set to be held in the US within the span of Trump’s second term. Trump said: “We have the World Cup and we have the Olympics. I have everything. Amazing, the way things work out. God did that – I believe that,” he remarked of the timing. He added that “in some ways I’m glad I missed that [consecutive] second term” because then he wouldn’t have been president for these milestones. He then returned to honoring fallen soldiers. Trump also said on Monday he is considering taking a further $3bn of grant money away from Harvard University and giving it to trade schools across the US, while a former president of Harvard and current professor there, Drew Gilpin Faust,warned thatAmerican freedoms and democracy were at risk. At Arlington,Hegsethreferenced men who sacrificed their lives for the nation but made no reference to women.

    "article_text": "President honors fallen soldiers but also says ‘God did that’ when taking credit for US hosting world sports events PresidentDonald Trumpsaid on Monday he is considering taking $3bn of grant money away from Harvard University and giving it to trade schools across the United States. His comments, which were made on Truth Social, come less than a week after his administration blocked Ivy League school from enrolling foreign students. He wrote: I am considering taking Three Billion Dollars of Grant Money away from a very antisemitic Harvard, and giving it to TRADE SCHOOLS all across our land. What a great investment that would be for the USA, and so badly needed!!! Here’s a recap of today’s developments: Donald Trump used the traditional presidential Memorial Day speech at Arlington national cemetery to talk up his own plans and achievements.The president laid a wreath and paid tribute to fallen soldiers but also veered off into rally-style personal boasting and brief partisan attacks during the solemn event. EU leaders expressed hopes for a quick deal to resolve the trade war with the US after Trump announced he was delaying his threatened 50% tariffs for the bloc until 9 July.The US president said on Sunday he would pause the border tax due to be imposed on 1 June, which he had announced two days earlier, after what he called a “very nice call” with European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen. Trump issued a pardon for a former Virginia sheriff who was convicted last year of federal bribery charges.Scott Jenkins, who had been the sheriff of Culpeper county, Virginia, was set to report to jail on Tuesday after he was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison for accepting more than $75,000 in bribes in exchange for appointments as auxiliary deputy sheriffs. Trump also said he is considering taking a further $3bn of grant money away from Harvard University and giving it to trade schools across the US.Former president of Harvard and current professor Drew Gilpin Faust warned that American freedoms and democracy were at risk. Trump suggested Russian leader Vladimir Putin had “gone crazy” after Moscow launched its third consecutive night of massive drone strikes against Ukraine, killing at least six people.In a Truth Social post on Sunday, Trump railed against Putin while also criticising the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, for calling out US inaction against Russia. Former congressman Charles Rangel of New York died on Monday at the age of 94.An outspoken, gravel-voiced Harlem Democrat who spent nearly five decades on Capitol Hill, Rangel was a founding member of the Congressional Black caucus and the first African American to chair the powerful House ways and means committee. The FBI will launch new investigations into the 2023 discovery of a bag of cocaine at the White House during Joe Biden’s term,and the leak of the supreme court’s draft opinion overturning Roe v Wade in 2022. The FBI will also investigate pipe bombs discovered at Democratic and Republican party headquarters before the 6 January 2021 Capitol riot. The Trump family media company plans to raise about $3bn to spend on cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin,according to a Financial Times report. The Trump Media & Technology Group, which is behind the Truth Social app and controlled by the president’s family, aims to raise $2bn in fresh equity and another $1bn via a convertible bond, the paper said, citing sources. Former Virginia sheriffScott Jenkins, who has been pardoned byDonald Trump,was convicted in December 2024 of one count of conspiracy, four counts of honest services fraud and seven counts of bribery concerning programs receiving federal funds. In apress releasein March, acting US attorney Zachary T Lee said: Scott Jenkins violated his oath of office and the faith the citizens of Culpeper County placed in him when he engaged in a cash-for-badges scheme. We hold our elected law enforcement officials to a higher standard of conduct and this case proves that when those officials use their authority for unjust personal enrichment, the Department of Justice will hold them accountable. The release says that Jenkins accepted more than $75,000 in bribes in exchange for appointing numerous northern Virginia businessmen as auxiliary deputy sheriffs within his department. Donald Trumphas issued a pardon for a former Virginia sheriff who was convicted last year of federal bribery charges. Scott Jenkins,who had been the sheriff of Culpeper County, Virginia, was set to report to jail on Tuesday after he was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison. Jenkins was convicted by a jury in December 2024 for accepting more than $75,000 in bribes in exchange for appointments as auxiliary deputy sheriffs. In a Truth Social post on Monday, Trump wrote: Sheriff Scott Jenkins, his wife Patricia, and their family have been dragged through HELL by a Corrupt and Weaponized Biden DOJ. He said Jenkins was a “victim of an overzealous Biden Department of Justice” and a “wonderful person”, adding: He will NOT be going to jail tomorrow, but instead will have a wonderful and productive life. Donald Trumphonored the sacrifices of US military veterans in the traditional presidential Memorial Day speech at Arlington national cemetery, but also peppered his address on Monday with partisan political asides while talking up his own plans and achievements. The US president laid a wreath and paid tribute to fallen soldiers and gave accounts of battlefield courage as tradition dictates, from prepared remarks, after saluting alongside his vice-president,JD Vance, and the defense secretary,Pete Hegseth. But Trump also veered off into rally-style personal boasting and brief partisan attacks during the solemn event. Fallen soldiers’ valor “gave us the freest, greatest and most noble republic ever to exist on the face of the earth … a republic that I am fixing after a long and hard four years. That was a hard four years we went through,” the US president said. He continued with ananti-immigrationstatement that chimes withhis agenda, though without directly mentioning his predecessor, Democratic presidentJoe Biden, who served between Trump’s first term and the Republican’s return to the White Housethis January. “Who would let that happen? People pouring through our borders unchecked. People doing things that are indescribable and not for today to discuss,” Trump said. It was a nod to his Truth Social platform on Monday morning, wherehe posteda tirade against judges who hold up his deportation aims, chiefly because of his ignoring due process obligations, as “monsters” and again attacked undocumented immigrants, using sweeping disparagements. Full reporthere. US congressmanEugene Vindmansaid more a little earlier about Donald Trump’s seeming epiphany about Vladimir Putin’s ill-intent over Ukraine. “Up to now, Putin has mainly got what he wanted from Trump in the US – chaos. I always said it would take three to six months [for Trump] to figure out that the Russians are not interested in peace,” Vindman, a Democrat representing Virginia in the House of Representatives, told CNN in an interview. Vindman, who serves on the House armed services committee, said he was not surprised that instead of Trump admitting that he had read Putin inaccurately the US president was giving the impression that it was the Russian president who had suddenly changed. “The Russians are not our friends and they [the Trump administration] need to pressure Russia,” Vindman said. He said bipartisan resolve was building in the US House and Senate in support of Ukraine’s continued efforts to resist Russia and the need for a peace that Ukraine can accept. Vindman firstgained a national profileafter he and his brother, Alexander Vindman, played a central role in Donald Trump’s first impeachment. The Vindman brothers, who both held senior roles on Trump’s national security council, were dismissed after raising concerns about the then president’s alleged efforts to pressure Ukraine into investigating Trump’s political rival, Democrat Joe Biden, who went on to beat him in the 2020 presidential election, and his son Hunter Biden. Eugene Vindman won a seat in Congress in the 2024 election last November, when Trump regained the White House. Freshmen member of CongressEugene Vindman, who was fired byDonald Trumpduring his previous administration after playing a role in the president’s impeachment over efforts to extortVolodymyr Zelenskyy, has taken a wry look at Trump’s latest comments suggesting that the Russian president,Vladimir Putin, hassuddenly “gone crazy”with his latest military attack on Ukraine. Vindman also doubted that Russia wants peace, more than three years after it invadedUkraine. “They are not intimidated byDonald Trump, I’m not sure they take it [his comments] seriously,” the Virginia Democratic lawmaker told CNN on Monday. He said Trump’s suddenly angry words about Putin after years of defending him are “right now, frankly, meaningless”. Vindman said: “There has been no shift in Putin, he is the same person he has been for decades, what we are seeing is a very slow and painful learning process for this president [Trump].” After European trade commissionerMaroš Šefčovičsaid moments ago that he had a “good call” with the US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, Šefčovič pledged that hewould remain in “constant contact” with his American counterpart. The two men spoke on the phone the day after Donald Trump delayed a threat to impose a 50%tariffon theEuropean Union, after a phone call with the European Commission president,Ursula von der Leyen. EUleaders have expressed hopes for a quick deal to resolve the trade war with the US afterDonald Trumpannounced he wasdelaying his threatened 50% tariffs for the blocuntil 9 July. The US president said on Sunday he would pause the border tax due to be imposed on 1 June, whichhe had announced two days earlier, after what he called a “very nice call” withUrsula von der Leyen. The European Commission president persuaded Trump to delay the duties by more than a month to give the two sides more time to negotiate. Her chief spokesperson, Paula Pinho, said the pair had agreed “to fast-track the trade negotiations and to stay in close contact”. Von der Leyen initiated the call, the EU spokesperson said, adding “there was, it seems, a mutual intention to speak to each other”. The French president,Emmanuel Macron, said on Monday he hoped Washington and Brussels could get to the lowest tariffs possible. “The discussions are advancing,” he told reporters during a trip to Vietnam. There has been a good exchange between President Trump and President Von der Leyen and I hope we can continue on this road and return to the lowest possible tariffs that will allow for fruitful exchanges. Italy’s prime minister,Giorgia Meloni,who is deemed to have one of the closest relationships with the White House among EU leaders, was reported by local media to be trying to organise a meeting between Trump and European leaders in early June. The EU’s trade chief,Maroš Šefčovič,said he held “good” calls with the US commerce secretary,Howard Lutnick,and the US trade representative,Jamieson Greer. The EU Commission remains “fully committed to constructive and focused efforts at pace” towards an EU-US deal, Šefčovič wrote on X. Šefčovič and Lutnick last spoke on Friday. Since then,Donald Trumphas announced he will pause his threatened 50% tariffs on the EU until 9 July. TheFBIwill launch new investigations into the 2023 discovery of a bag of cocaine at the White House duringJoe Biden’s term, as well as into pipe bombs discovered at Democratic and Republican party headquarters before the 6 January 2021 Capitol riot by supporters ofDonald Trump,and the leak of thesupreme court’s draft opinion before the historic overturning of national abortion rights with the Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision that overturnedRoe v Wadein 2022. Dan Bongino,a rightwingpodcaster turned deputydirector of the FBI, made the announcementon X, where he said he had requested weekly briefings on any progress in looking into the old cases. The incidents have been popular talking points on America’s political right wing and among conspiracy theorists. Bongino said that he and the FBI director,Kash Patel,had been evaluating “a number of cases of potential public corruption that, understandably, have garnered public interest” and had made a decision “to either re-open, or push additional resources and investigative attention, to these cases”.",

    "title": "Man swims 62 miles around Martha’s Vineyard to press for protections for sharks",
    "article_text": "A British-South African endurance athlete crossed the finish line of his 62-mile (100km) multiday swim around Martha’s Vineyard on Monday, becoming the first person to swim all the way around the island off the coast of Cape Cod. Lewis Pugh, 55, began swimming multiple hours a day in the 47F (8C) water on 15 May to raise awareness about the plight ofsharks– as the filmJawsnears the 50th anniversary of its cinematic release. The swimmer and campaigner has said he wants to change public perceptions and encourage protections for sharks, which are at risk from human threats and which he said the hit film wrongly maligned as “villains, as cold-blooded killers”. Pugh hauled himself out of the water on Monday at the Edgartown Harbor lighthouse on Martha’s Vineyard, near whereJawswas filmed, which tells a story of a fictional, man-eating great white shark terrorizing a New England tourist coastal destination given the name of Amity Island. “We’ve been fighting sharks for 50 years,” he said after completing the last 1.2 miles of the swim. “Now, we need to make peace with them.” In total, Pugh swam for about 24 hours over 12 days. His first stop in Edgartown after greeting cheering fans on the beach as he completed his feat was at an ice-cream shop, where he enjoyed a cone of salted caramel and berry brownie. Pugh said this was among his most difficult endurance swims in an almost 40-year career, which says a lot for someone who has swum near glaciers, including on Mount Everest, and volcanoes. He’s swum among hippos, crocodiles and polar bears. Pugh was the first athlete to swim across the north pole and complete a long-distance swim in every one of the world’s oceans. He said he expected the swim to be difficult because of the low water temperature, the distance and the fact that it was happening during the start of the shark migration season. But the weather proved the most challenging element of all. “It’s been a long journey, it really has, 12 days, cold water, constant wind, waves and then always thinking of what may be beneath me. It’s been a big swim. A very big swim,” he said. “When you swim for 12 days, you leave as one person and I think you come back as a different person with a new reflection on what you’ve been through.” Day after day, Pugh entered the island’s chilly waters wearing just trunks, a cap and goggles, enduring foul weather as a nor’easter storm dumped 7 in of cold, pounding rain on parts of New England and flooded the streets on Martha’s Vineyard, the famous and beautiful island off southern Massachusetts where some prominent politicians, including former US president Barack Obama,choose to relaxand the history of whale hunting is almost visceral. Some days, Pugh was only able to make it a little over half a mile before wind and waves made it impossible to see beyond an arm’s length in front of him. In some cases, he had to make up lost distance by swimming multiple legs in a day. “I was just getting really cold and swallowing a lot of sea water, not making headway and then you’re constantly thinking: ‘Are we taking the right route here? Should we go further out to sea? Should we get closer in?’” he said. “And meanwhile you’re fighting currents.” But Pugh, who has been named a United Nations patron of the oceans and often swims to raise awareness for environmental causes – said no swim is without risk, and that drastic measures are needed to get his message across: about 274,000 sharks are killed globally each day, a rate of nearly 100m every year, according to the American Association for the Advancement of Science. On Monday, Pugh called the decimation of sharks an “ecocide”. “I think protecting sharks is the most important part of the jigsaw puzzle of protecting the oceans,” he said. Jaws was released in the summer of 1975, based on the book, and setting new box office records. Both director Steven Spielberg and author Peter Benchley expressed regret that many viewers became so afraid of sharks. Both later contributed to conservation efforts.

    "title": "Charles Rangel, former Harlem congressman, dies aged 94",
    "article_text": "Former US congressman Charles Rangel of New York, an outspoken, gravel-voiced HarlemDemocratwho spent nearly five decades on Capitol Hill and was a founding member of the Congressional Black caucus, died on Monday at the age of 94. His family confirmed the death in a statement provided by City College of New York spokesperson Michelle Stent. He died at a hospital inNew York, Stent said. A veteran of the Korean war, Rangel defeated legendary Harlem politician Adam Clayton Powell in 1970 to start his congressional career. During the next 40-plus years, he became a legend himself – dean of the New York congressional delegation, and, in 2007, the first African American to chair the powerfulHouseways and means committee. He stepped down from that committee amid an ethics cloud, and the House censured him in 2010 after a House ethics committee conducted a hearing on 13 counts of alleged financial and fundraising misconduct over issues surrounding financial disclosures and use of congressional resources. He was convicted by Congress of 11 violations, but he continued to serve in the House until his retirement in 2017. Rangel was the last surviving member of the Gang of Four, Black political figures who wielded great power inNew YorkCity and state politics. The others were David Dinkins, New York City’s first Black mayor; Percy Sutton, who was Manhattan borough president; and Basil Paterson, a deputy mayor and secretary of state of New York. Rangel’s distinctive gravelly voice and wry sense of humor made him a memorable character not just in politics but in the rest of his life and environs. The Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, paid tribute on X, calling Rangel a “great man, a great friend, and someone who never stopped fighting for his constituents and the best of America”. “The list of his accomplishments could take pages, but he leaves the world a much better place than he found it,” Schumer posted. The House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, also praised Rangel. “Charlie Rangel was a phenomenal patriot, hero, statesman, leader, trailblazer, change agent and champion for justice,” he posted on X. Jeffries, a fellow New Yorker, called Rangel “the Lion of Lenox Ave”, an iconic street at the heart of Harlem, and said he was a transformational force of nature. “Harlem, NYC & America are better today because of his service. May he forever rest in power,” Jeffries posted. Rangel was known for fiercely looking out for his constituents, sponsoring empowerment zones with tax credits for businesses moving into economically depressed areas and developers of low-income housing. “I have always been committed to fighting for the little guy,” Rangel said in 2012. He was known as one of the most liberal representatives in the House, loudest in opposition to the Iraq war, which he branded a “death tax” on poor people and minorities. In 2004, he tried to end the war by offering a bill to restart the military service draft. Republicans called his bluff and brought the bill to a vote. Even Rangel voted against it. A year later, Rangel’s fight over the war became bitterly personal with the then US vice-president, Dick Cheney, Republican president George W Bush’s running mate and a prime defense hawk. Rangel said Cheney, who has a history of heart trouble, might be too sick to perform his job. “I would like to believe he’s sick rather than just mean and evil,” Rangel said. After several such verbal jabs, Cheney hit back, saying Rangel was “losing it”. The Harlem lawmaker first entered the House in 1971. In 1987, Congress approved what was known as the “Rangel amendment”, which denied foreign tax credits to US companies investing in apartheid-eraSouth Africa, where the wealthy ruling white minority held power by heavily oppressing the Black majority. Rangel was born on 11 June 1930. During the Korean war, he earned a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star. A high school dropout, he went to college on the GI Bill, getting degrees from New York University and St John’s University School of Law. The Associated Press contributed reporting",

    "title": "Former Harvard president urges people to ‘speak out’ against threats to US democracy",
    "article_text": "A recent former president ofHarvard Universityurged people to “speak out” in defense of “foundational threats” to values such as freedom, autonomy and democracy in the US, as those whose deaths for such causes in war were being honored on Memorial Day. Drew Gilpin Faust, the first female president of Harvard, also warned on Monday of US constitutional checks and the rule of law being “at risk” under the current administration, even asDonald Trumpissued a fresh threat against the elite university as it seeks to repel his assaults on its independence and funding. “We are being asked not to charge into … artillery fire but only to speak up and to stand up in the face of foundational threats to the principles for which [the US civil war dead] gave the last full measure of devotion. We have been entrusted with their legacy. Can we trust ourselves to uphold it?” Faust wrote in a guest opinionessayfor the New York Times. She highlighted, in particular, the principles fought and died for by Union soldiers in the US civil war and the roles played by assassinated US president Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass, the abolitionist and leading Black civil rights leader of the 19th century. “We must honor these men,” she wrote. Faust, who led Harvard between 2007 and 2018 and still teaches there, did not mention the US president by name but she referred to his position and made a direct link between the civil war and now. Noting that about 2.7 million men, mostly volunteers, in 1861-1865 “took up arms to preserve the Union as a beacon of democracy at a time when representative government seemed to be fading from the earth”, she went on to warn: “Today democracy is once again under worldwide threat, assailed as disorderly and inefficient by autocratic leaders from Budapest to Moscow to Beijing, leaders our own president openly admires.” Faust said that Lincoln regarded the Confederacy’s split from the Union, when southern states seceded in order to defend slavery and evade federal government intervention, as a “direct assault” on government by the majority “held in restraint” by constitutional checks. “Those structured checks and the rule of law that embodies and enacts them are once again at risk as we confront the subservience of Congress, the defiance of judicial mandates and the arrogation of presidential power in a deluge of unlawful executive orders,” she wrote in her essay. Critics of Trump lament congressional Republicans’ acquiescence to the president’s expansions of his authority and challenges to constitutional constraints, Democrats’ lackluster resistance, and the administration’s defiance of court orders over various anti-immigration extremes and partisan firings of federal officials and watchdogs without cause. Meanwhile, Trump has repeatedly accused Harvard of antisemitism and bias against Jewish students and attacked its efforts towards greater diversity on campus, and the administration has further demanded cooperation with federal immigration authorities, while harnessing federal powers to try to punish the university. Last Friday,Harvard suedprominent government departments and cabinet secretaries for what it said was a “blatant violation” of the US constitution when the Trump administration announced it would revoke federal permission for the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based institution to enroll international students. A federal judgeissued an injunctionwithin hours, temporarily blocking such a ban. Sign up toThis Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration after newsletter promotion Harvard hadpreviously suedin April over what it said was Trump’s attempt to “gain control of academic decision-making” at the university and the administration’sthreat to reviewabout$9bn in federal funding. On Monday, Trump posted on his social media platform: “I am considering taking Three Billion Dollars of Grant Money away from a very antisemitic Harvard, and giving it to TRADE SCHOOLS all across our land,” adding: “What a great investment that would be for the USA.” By Monday afternoon the president had not followed up with action or further explanation or statements. Harvard’s current president,Alan Garber, who is Jewish, has called the Trump demands “illegal” and said the administration was trying “to control whom we hire and what we teach”. Faust, a historian and research professor at Harvard, who was also its first president to have been raised in the US south, concluded her essay by acknowledging that those who fought in the US civil war did, in fact, save the nation and subsequently gave opportunities to the generations that followed. “They were impelled to risk all by a sense of obligation to the future,” she wrote, adding that “we possess a reciprocal obligation to the past” and that “we must not squander what they bequeathed to us”.",

    "title": "Trump wants Netanyahu to be on same page on Iran: Top US official",
    "article_text": "Washington, DC –United States Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem says she delivered a message from PresidentDonald Trumpto Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the two countries should be aligned on how to approach Iran. Noem, who concluded a visit to Israel on Monday, told Fox News that her talks with Netanyahu were “candid and direct”. Her comments come days after US and Iranian officials held theirfifth roundof nuclear talks in Rome. “President Trump specifically sent me here to have a conversation with the prime minister about how those negotiations are going and how important it is that we stay united and let this process play out,” she said. On Sunday, Trump suggested that the talks were progressing well. “We’ve had some very, very good talks with Iran,” the US president told reporters. “And I don’t know if I’ll be telling you anything good or bad over the next two days, but I have a feeling I might be telling you something good.” Last week, CNNreported, citing unidentified US officials, that Israel was preparing for strikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities, despite the US-led talks. Iran has promised to respond forcefully to any Israeli attack, and accused Netanyahu of working to undermine US diplomacy. Iranian Minister of Foreign AffairsAbbas Araghchisaid last week that the Israeli prime minister is “desperate to dictate what the US can and cannot do”. Israel has been sceptical about the nuclear negotiations, and Netanyahu has been claiming for years that Iran is on the cusp of acquiring anuclear bomb. Israeli officials portray Iran – which backs regional groups engaged in armed struggle against Israel – as a major threat. On Monday, Noem said that the US understands that Netanyahu does not trust Iran. “The message to the American people is: We have a president that wants peace, but also a president that will not tolerate nuclear Iran capability in the future. They will not be able to get a nuclear weapon, and this president will not allow it,” she said. “But he also wants this prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to be on the same page with him.” A major sticking point in the talks has been whether Iran would beallowed to enrichits own uranium. US officials have said they want Iran not just to scale back its nuclear programme, but also to completely stop enriching uranium – a position that Tehran has said is a nonstarter. Enrichment is the process of altering the uranium atom to create nuclear fuel. Iranian officials say enrichment for civilian purposes is a sovereign right that is not prohibited by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Tehran denies seeking a nuclear weapon, while Israel is widely believed to have an undeclared nuclear arsenal. During his first term, in 2018, Trump nixed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which had seen Iran scale back its nuclear programme in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions against its economy. Since then, the US has been piling sanctions on Iran. Tehran has responded by escalating its nuclear programme. On Monday, Iranruled outtemporarily suspending uranium enrichment to secure an interim deal with the US. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baqaei stressed that Iran is not buying time with the talks. “We have entered the course of talks seriously and purposefully with the intention of reaching a fair agreement. We have proved our seriousness,” Baqaei was quoted as saying by the Tasnim news agency.",

    "article_text": "A British man has been arrested after he drove his car into a crowd of Liverpool football fans celebrating their team’s Premier League victory, hospitalising some 27 people, including four children. Police said they believe the “53-year-old white British man from the Liverpool area” acted alone in the car ramming in the city in northwest England on Monday. They said the incident was not being investigated as an act of terrorism. Some 20 people were treated at the scene for minor injuries, while ambulance officials said 27 people were taken to hospital. One child and one adult were in a serious condition. Four of the victims, including a child, were trapped under the van, and firefighters had to lift the vehicle to free them. “We believe this to be an isolated incident, and we are not currently looking for anyone else in relation to it. The incident is not being treated as terrorism,” temporary Deputy Chief Constable Jenny Sims told reporters. Videos of the incident posted on social media showed a dark-coloured car swerving into the crowds in Liverpool at the end of the celebrations as players showed off the trophy on an open-topped bus through the city. Several people were thrown into the air. When the car stopped, angry fans converged on it and began smashing the windows as police officers intervened to prevent them from reaching the driver. Harry Rashid, who was at the parade with his wife and two young daughters, told The Associated Press news agency that the car began ramming people about 3 metres (10ft) away from him. “It was extremely fast,” he said. “Initially, we just heard the pop, pop, pop of people just being knocked off the bonnet of a car.” Rashid added that the driver kept going after the crowd charged his vehicle, and “just ploughed through the rest of them”. He said it looked deliberate and he was in shock and disbelief. “My daughter started screaming, and there were people on the ground,” he said. “They were just innocent people, just fans going to enjoy the parade.” The incident followed a large celebration in the city centre, where hundreds of thousands of dancing, scarf- and flag-waving fans braved wet weather to line the streets and watch Liverpool’s players display the Premier League trophy atop two buses bearing the words “Ours Again”. The hours-long procession – surrounded by a thick layer of police and security – crawled along a 10-mile (16km) route and through a sea of red smoke and rain. Fireworks exploded from the Royal Liver Building in the heart of the city to seemingly signal the end of the parade. Liverpool last won the trophy during the COVID pandemic when celebrations were not permitted due to lockdowns. Peter Jones, who had travelled from the Isle of Man to celebrate Liverpool’s victory, said he heard the car smash into the crowd and saw at least a half-dozen people down. “We heard a frantic beeping ahead, a car flew past me and my mate, people were chasing it and trying to stop him, windows smashed at the back,” Jones said. “He then drove into people, police and medics ran past us, and people were being treated on the side of the road.” The incident “cast a very dark shadow over what had been a joyous day”, Liverpool city’s council leader, Liam Robinson, said on social media. Police were unusually quick to give a description of the man they arrested, in a possible decision to prevent misinformation from flooding social media. Last July, a teen in the nearby town of Southport killed three girls in a stabbing rampage at a dance class and wounded 10 others, including two adults. An incorrect name of the suspect was spread on social media and people said he was an asylum seeker. In fact, he had been born in the United Kingdom. Rioting then spread across England and Northern Ireland, targeting Muslims and refugees in hotels of asylum seekers and lasted about a week. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he was being kept updated about the latest incident in Liverpool. “The scenes in Liverpool are appalling – my thoughts are with all those injured or affected. I want to thank the police and emergency services for their swift and ongoing response to this shocking incident,” he said on social media. “The city has a long and proud history of coming together through difficult times. Liverpool stands together and the whole country stands with Liverpool.” We are in direct contact with Merseyside Police regarding the incident on Water Street which happened towards the end of the trophy parade earlier this evening. Our thoughts and prayers are with those who have been affected by this serious incident. We will continue to offer…pic.twitter.com/xreiSqiEnL — Liverpool FC (@LFC)May 26, 2025 Liverpool FC said on X it was in direct contact with police. “Our thoughts and prayers are with those who have been affected by this serious incident,” the team said.

    "title": "Volvo to cut 3,000 jobs amid trade uncertainty",
    "article_text": "Swedish automaker Volvo is set to cut 3,000 white-collar jobs amid restructuring efforts as prices begin to rise due to tariff-driven uncertainty. The company announced the news on Monday. The layoffs come as the Swedish automaker tries to resurrect its rock-bottom share price and drum up better demand for its cars by restructuring part of its business and cutting costs. CEO Hakan Samuelsson, who was recently brought back to the role after heading the company for a decade until 2022, unveiled a programme in April to slash costs by $1.9bn (18 billion Swedish crowns), including a substantial cut to Volvo’s white-collar staff, who make up 40 percent of its workforce. “It’s white collar in almost all areas, including R&D  [research and development], communication, human resources,” Samuelsson told the Reuters news agency. The layoffs represent around 15 percent of the company’s office staff, Volvo Cars said in a statement, and would incur a one-time restructuring cost of $160m (1.5 billion crowns). Volvo Cars’ new CFO Fredrik Hansson told Reuters that while all of its departments and locations would be impacted, most of the redundancies will happen in Gothenburg. “It’s tailored to make us structurally more efficient, and then how that plays out might vary a bit depending on the area. But no stone is left unturned,” Hansson said. Withmost of its production basedin Europe and China, Volvo Cars is more exposed to new United States tariffs than many of its European rivals, and has said it could become impossible to export its most affordable cars to the US. The company said in a press release that it would finalise a new structural setup by the third quarter of this year. Volvo withdrew its financial guidanceas it announced its cost cuts last month, pointing to unpredictable markets amid weaker consumer confidence and trade tariffs causing turmoil in the global auto industry. The layoff announcement comes only days after US President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 50 percent tariff on imports from the European Union from June 1. On Monday, however, he backed away from that date, restoring a July 9 deadline to allow for talks between Washington and Brussels. As a result, Volvo’s CEO said the move would make it harder for it to sell one of its electric vehicles (EVs) — the EX30 EV that is made in Belgium — in the US market.",

    "title": "King Charles III arrives in Canada amid tension with Trump",
    "article_text": "King Charles III, the British monarch, has arrived in Canada for a two-day visit that officials say aims to assert support for the country’s sovereignty amidPresident Donald Trump’scalls for annexing the United States’s northern neighbour. The monarch’s trip, which started on Monday, comes at the invitation of Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney,whose party wonthe general election last month amid Trump’s threats. Charles is the ceremonial head of state in Canada, which remained a Commonwealth realm after gaining independence from Great Britain in 1867. The king is to open parliament in Ottawa on Tuesday with a “Speech from the Throne” – the first such address to be delivered by a British monarch in Canada since 1977. While the British monarch has refrained from interfering in politics in recent decades and remained a symbolic figure, Charles is expected to deliver a message of support for Canada against Trump’s statements. Later on Monday, Carney said Canada is “honoured” to welcome Charles and his wife Queen Camilla, adding that the royal visit highlights “the vitality of our constitutional monarchy and our distinct identity”. “To that end, the Speech from the Throne will outline the government’s ambitious plan to act with urgency and determination, and to deliver the change Canadians want and deserve: to define a new economic and security relationship with the United States … to bring down the cost of living, and to keep communities safe,” Carney said in a statement. Canadian officials haveforcefully rejectedTrump’s comments about making their country the 51st US state as a trade row between the two countries continues. Canada’s envoy to the United Kingdom, Ralph Goodale, told reporters last week that “the king, as head of state, will reinforce the power” of Carney’s message that Canada is not for sale. Governor General Mary Simon, the monarch’s ceremonial representative in Canada, also said the royal couple’s visit holds “profound significance”. “It reaffirms the enduring constitutional bond that has shaped Canada’s journey into a proud and independent nation,” Simon, who is the first Indigenous person to hold the position, said in a statement. Charles’s trip will be his first visit to the former British colony since becoming king in September 2022. Barbara Messamore, professor of history at the University of the Fraser Valley, said as the monarch of Canada, Charles visits the country “as a Canadian”. “The reaction to the king’s visit has been very positive,” Messamore told Al Jazeera. “We don’t always all agree on our form of governance, but we’ve made it very difficult to change that fundamental aspect of our Canadian constitution.” Justin Vovk, royal historian at McMaster University, stressed that the king is unlikely to make any explicit statements against Trump during his visit. “If people are expecting to hear Donald Trump’s name mentioned or ‘the 51st state’ mentioned, they are going to be disappointed,” Vovk told Al Jazeera. “The King has a very small constitutional box that he has to operate in.” He added that expressions of support for Canada will “be couched in very generic terms”. On Monday, the royal couple greeted supporters at a park in Ottawa and met vendors and artists.The kingalso participated in a ceremonial puck drop to launch a street hockey demonstration before planting a tree at Rideau Hall in another part of the city.",

    "title": "French farmers protest in Paris for law loosening environmental regulations",
    "article_text": "French farmers have disrupted highway traffic around Paris and rallied in front of parliament to protest against amendments filed by opposition lawmakers to a bill that would loosen environmental regulations on farming. Members of France’s leading farming union, the FNSEA, parked about 10 tractors outside the National Assembly on Monday to put pressure on MPs, who began debating the legislation in the afternoon. The legislation, tabled by far-right MP Laurent Duplomb, proposes simplifying approvals for breeding facilities, loosening restrictions around water use to promote irrigation reservoirs and reauthorising a banned neonicotinoid pesticide used in sugar beet cultivation that environmentalists say is harmful to bees. The proposed law is part of a wider trend in numerous European Union states to unwind environmental legislation as farmers grapple with rising costs and households struggle with the cost-of-living crisis. More than 150 farmers from the Ile-de-France, Grand Est and Provence-Alpes-Cote d’Azur regions gathered peacefully in front of the National Assembly, drinking coffee and eating croissants, after blocking the main roads around the capital. “This bill to lift the constraints on the farming profession is very important to us,” FNSEA Secretary-General Herve Lapie told the AFP news agency. “What we are asking for is simply to be able to work in a European environment: a single market, a single set of rules. We’ve been fighting for this for 20 years. For once, there’s a bill along these lines. … We don’t have the patience to wait any longer.” The FNSEA and its allies say the neonicotinoid pesticide acetamiprid, which has been prohibited in France since 2018 due to environmental and health concerns, should be authorised in France like it is across the EU because it is less toxic to wildlife than other neonicotinoids and stops crops from being ravaged by pests. Environmental campaigners and some unions representing small-scale and organic farmers say the bill benefits the large-scale agriculture industry at the expense of independent operators. President Emmanuel Macron’s opponents on the political left have proposed multiple amendments that the protesting farmers said threatened the bill. “We’re asking the lawmakers, our lawmakers, to be serious and vote for it as it stands,” Julien Thierry, a grain farmer from the Yvelines department outside Paris, told The Associated Press news agency, criticising politicians from the Greens and left-wing France Unbowed (LFI). Ecologists party MP Delphine Batho said the text of the bill is “Trump-inspired” while LFI MP Aurelie Trouve wrote in an article for the French daily Le Monde that it signified “a political capitulation, one that marks an ecological junction”. FNSEA chief Arnaud Rousseau said protests would continue until Wednesday with farmers from the Centre-Val de Loire and Hauts-de-France regions expected to join their colleagues. Protests are also expected in Brussels next week, targeting the EU’s environmental regulations and green policies. Farmers across France and Europe won concessions last year after railing against cheap foreign competition and what they say are unnecessary regulations.",

    "title": "Far-right Israelis storm Al-Aqsa, UNRWA compounds amid Jerusalem Day march",
    "article_text": "Right-wing Israelis in Jerusalem have stormed the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound and a United Nations facility for Palestinian refugees as anannual march took placemarking Israel’s conquest of the eastern part of the city. Some Israelis chanted, “Death to Arabs” and “May your village burn,” as they marched through the alleyways of Jerusalem’s Old City on Monday, going through the Muslim quarter to mark “Jerusalem Day”, which commemorates the Israeli occupation and annexation of East Jerusalem after the 1967 war. Thousands of heavily armed police and border police were dispatched in advance because settlers regularly assault, attack and harass Palestinians and shops in the Muslim quarter. The settlers live in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem in settlements and outposts, which are illegal under international law. Groups of young people, some carrying Israeli flags, were seen on Monday confronting Palestinian shopkeepers, passers-by and schoolchildren as well as Israeli rights activists and police, at times spitting on people, lobbing insults and trying to force their way into houses. Police detained at least two youths, according to AFP journalists at the scene. A small group of those rallying, including an Israeli member of parliament, stormed a compound in East Jerusalem belonging to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA. Israel has banned the agency from working in occupied Palestinian territory and in Israel, impacting the life-saving work that it has been carrying out for more than 70 years in areas that include the besieged and bombarded Gaza Strip. UNRWA West Bank coordinator Roland Friedrich said about a dozen Israeli protesters, including Yulia Malinovsky, one of the legislators behind an Israeli law that banned UNRWA, entered the compound, climbing its main gate in view of Israeli police. Last year’s procession, held during the first year of Israel’s assault on Gaza, saw ultranationalist Israelis attack a Palestinian journalist in the Old City and call for violence against Palestinians. And four years ago, the march contributed to the outbreak of an 11-day war in Gaza. Earlier on Monday, Israel’s far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, and other politicians were among more than 2,000 Israelis who stormed the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound and surrounding areas. Ben-Gvir released a video on his X account from the site – Islam’s third holiest – saying he “prayed for victory in the war, for the return of all our hostages, and for the success of the newly-appointed head of the Shin Bet – Major General David Zini”. Negev and Galilee Minister Yitzhak Vaserlauf and Knesset member Yitzhak Kreuzer were among those accompanying the ultranationalist minister. Backed by armed police, Ben-Gvir has carried outsimilar provocative moves in the compoundbefore, often at sensitive junctures in Israel’s war on Gaza, to advocate for increased military pressure and to block all humanitarian aid entering Gaza. The Jerusalem Waqf – the Islamic authority that oversees the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, known to Muslims as al-Haram al-Sharif (the Noble Sanctuary) – decried the storming of the compound by Ben-Gvir and other members of the Israeli Knesset and called for a halt to all “provocative activities” in the area. Under the management of the Jordan-appointed Waqf, only Muslims are allowed to pray at the compound. Al Jazeera’s Nida Ibrahim said the march is aimed at asserting Israeli dominance over the city. “Videos show Israeli citizens inside the Old City of Jerusalem attacking Palestinian shops and throwing objects at them,” Ibrahim said, reporting from Doha, Qatar as Al Jazeera has been banned from reporting in Israel and occupied East Jerusalem. “This is again a reminder that no one has immunity.”",

    "title": "The most dangerous weapon in South Asia is not nuclear",
    "article_text": "When India launched Operation Sindoor and Pakistan replied with Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos, the world braced for escalation. Analysts held their breath. Twitter exploded. The Line of Control – that jagged scar between two unfinished imaginations of nationhood – lit up again. But if you think what happened earlier this month was merely a military exchange, you’ve missed the real story. This was a war, yes, but not just of missiles. It was a war of narratives, orchestrated in headlines, hashtags, and nightly newsrooms. The battlefield was the media. The ammunition was discourse. And the casualties were nuance, complexity, and truth. What we witnessed was the culmination of what scholars call discursive warfare — the deliberate construction of identity, legitimacy, and power through language. In the hands of Indian and Pakistani media, every act of violence was scripted, every image curated, every casualty politicised. This wasn’t coverage. It was choreography. On May 6, India struck first. Or, as Indian media framed it, India defended first. Operation Sindoor was announced with theatrical pomp. Twenty-four strikes in twenty-five minutes. Nine “terror hubs” destroyed. Zero civilian casualties. The villains — Jaish-e-Muhammad, Lashkar-e-Taiba, “terror factories” across Bahawalpur and Muzaffarabad in Pakistan – were said to be reduced to dust. The headlines were triumphalist: “Surgical Strikes 2.0”, “The Roar of Indian Forces Reaches Rawalpindi”, “Justice Delivered”. Government spokespeople called it a “proportionate response” to the Pahalgam massacre that had left 26 Indian tourists dead.Defence Minister Rajnath Singhdeclared: “They attacked India’s forehead, we wounded their chest”. Cinematic? Absolutely. Deliberate? Even more so. Indian media constructed a national identity of moral power: a state forced into action, responding not with rage but with restraint, armed not just with BrahMos missiles but with dharma – righteous duty and moral order. The enemy wasn’t Pakistan, the narrative insisted — it was terror. And who could object to that? This is the genius of framing. Constructivist theory tells us that states act based on identities, not just interests. And identity is forged through language. In India’s case, the media crafted a story where military might was tethered to moral clarity. The strikes weren’t aggression — they were catharsis. They weren’t war — they were therapy. But here’s the thing: therapy for whom? Three days later, Pakistan struck back. Operation Bunyan Marsoos — Arabic for “iron wall” — was declared. The name alone tells you everything. This wasn’t just a retaliatory strike; it was a theological assertion, a national sermon. The enemy had dared to trespass. The response would be divine. Pakistani missiles reportedly rained down on Indian military sites: brigade headquarters, an S-400 system, and military installations in Punjab and Jammu.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharifproclaimed that Pakistan had “avenged the 1971 war”, in which it had capitulated and allowed Bangladesh to secede. That’s not battlefield strategy. That’s myth-making. The media in Pakistan amplified this narrative with patriotic zeal. Indian strikes were framed as war crimes, mosques hit, civilians killed. Photographs of rubble and blood were paired with captions about martyrdom. The response, by contrast, was precise, moral, and inevitable. Pakistan’s national identity, as constructed in this moment, was one of righteous victimhood: we are peaceful, but provoked; restrained, but resolute. We do not seek war, but we do not fear it either. The symmetry is uncanny. Both states saw themselves as defenders, never aggressors. Both claimed moral superiority. Both insisted the enemy fired first. Both said they had no choice. The symmetry was also apparent in the constructed image of the enemy and the delcared victims. India portrayed Pakistan as a terror factory: duplicitous, rogue, a nuclear-armed spoiler addicted to jihad. Pakistani identity was reduced to its worst stereotype, deceptive and dangerous. Peace, in this worldview, is impossible because the Other is irrational. Pakistan, in turn, cast India as a fascist state: led by a majoritarian regime, obsessed with humiliation, eager to erase Muslims from history. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the aggressor. India was the occupier. Their strikes were framed not as counterterrorism but as religious war. In each case, the enemy wasn’t just a threat. The enemy was an idea — and an idea cannot be reasoned with. This is the danger of media-driven identity construction. Once the Other becomes a caricature, dialogue dies. Diplomacy becomes weakness. Compromise becomes betrayal. And war becomes not just possible, but desirable. The image of the Other also determined who was considered a victim and who was not. While missiles flew, people died. Civilians in Kashmir, on both sides, were killed. Border villages were shelled. Religious sites damaged. Innocent people displaced. But these stories, the human stories, were buried beneath the rubble of rhetoric. In both countries, the media didn’t mourn equally. Victims were grieved if they were ours. Theirs? Collateral. Or fabricated. Or forgotten. This selective mourning is a moral indictment. Because when we only care about our dead, we become numb to justice. And in that numbness, violence becomes easier the next time. What was at stake during the India-Pakistan confrontation wasn’t just territory or tactical advantage. It was legitimacy. Both states needed to convince their own citizens, and the world, that they were on the right side of history. Indian media leaned on the global “war on terror” frame. By targeting Pakistan-based militants, India positioned itself as a partner in global security. Sound familiar? It should. It’s the same playbook used by the United States in Iraq and Israel in Gaza. Language like “surgical”, “precision”, and “pre-emptive” doesn’t just describe, it absolves. Meanwhile, Pakistan’s media leaned on the moral weight of sovereignty. India’s strikes were framed as an assault not just on land, but on izzat, honour. By invoking sacred spaces, by publicising civilian casualties, Pakistan constructed India not as a counterterrorist actor but as a bully and a blasphemer. This discursive tug-of-war extended even to facts. When India claimed to have killed 80 militants, Pakistan called it fiction. When Pakistan claimed to have shot down Indian jets, India called it propaganda. Each accused the other of misinformation. Each media ecosystem became a hall of mirrors, reflecting only what it wanted to see. The guns fell silent on May 13, thanks to a US-brokered ceasefire. Both governments claimed victory. Media outlets moved on. Cricket resumed. Hashtags faded. But what lingers is the story each side now tells about itself: We were right. They were wrong. We showed strength. They backed down. This is the story that will shape textbooks, elections, military budgets. It will inform the next standoff, the next skirmish, the next war. And until the story changes, nothing will. And it can change. Narratives constructed on competing truths, forged in newsrooms and battlefields, performed in rallies and funerals, are not eternal. Just as they were constructed, they can be deconstructed. And that can happen only if we start listening not to the loudest voice, but to the one we’ve learned to ignore. So the next time war drums beat, ask not just who fired first, but who spoke last. And ask what story that speech was trying to tell. Because in South Asia, the most dangerous weapon isn’t nuclear. It’s narrative. The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.",

    "title": "Hezbollah holds firm in Lebanon’s municipal elections",
    "article_text": "Beirut, Lebanon –As southern Lebanon continues to suffer fromsporadic Israeli attacksdespite aceasefiresigned in November between Israel and the Lebanese group Hezbollah, establishment parties have emerged as the biggest winners of municipal elections. Voting took place overfour weeks, starting in Mount Lebanon – north of the capital, Beirut – followed by the country’s northern districts, Beirut and the eastern Bekaa Valley, and concluding on Saturday in southern Lebanon. While Hezbollah, a Shia Muslim political and armed group, suffered setbacks to its political influence and military capabilities during 14 months of war with Israel, the group’s voter base was still intact and handed it and Amal, its closest political ally, victories across dozens of municipalities. “The Hezbollah-Amal alliance has held firm and support among the Shia base has not experienced any dramatic erosion,” Imad Salamey, a professor of political science at the Lebanese American University, told Al Jazeera. Despite establishment parties winning the majority of seats across the country, candidates running on campaigns of political reform and opposition to the political establishment also made inroads in some parts of the country, even winning seats in municipalities in southern Lebanon, where Hezbollah historically has enjoyed strong support. In Lebanon, there is no unified bloc of reformists although political actors and groups that emerged during the 2019 antigovernment protests over the economic crisis are referred to locally as “el-tagheyereen”, or change makers. “Alternative Shia candidates in some localities were able to run without facing significant intimidation, signalling a limited but growing space for dissent within the community,” Salamey said. The fact the elections were held at all will be seen as a boon to the pro-reform government ofPrime Minister Nawaf Salam, who came to power in January, say analysts. The polls, initially set for 2022, were delayed three times due to parliamentary elections, funding issues and the war with Israel, which started in October 2023. Critics, however, argued the elections favoured established parties because the uncertainty over when they would be held meant candidates waited to build their campaigns. As recently as March, there were still proposals to delay the elections until September to give candidates a chance to prepare their platforms after Lebanon suffered through the war and a two-month intensification by Israel from September to November, which left the country needing $11bn for recovery and reconstruction, according to theWorld Bank. The war left Hezbollah politically and militarily battered after Israel killed much of its leadership, including longtimeSecretary-General Hassan Nasrallahand his successor Hachem Safieddine. The war reordered the power balance in Lebanon, diminishing Hezbollah’s influence. Many villages in southern Lebanon are still inaccessible, and Israel continues to occupy five points of Lebanese territory that it has refused to withdraw from after the ceasefire. It also continues to attack other parts of the south, where it claims Hezbollah still has weapons. With their villages still destroyed or too dangerous to access, many southerners cast ballots in Nabatieh or Tyre, an act that recalls the 18-year Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon that ended in 2000. During the occupation, elections for southern regions under Israeli control were also held in other cities still under Lebanese sovereignty. Hezbollah has given up the majority of its sites in the south to the Lebanese army, a senior western diplomat told Al Jazeera and local media has reported. The recent post-war period also brought to power a new president, army commander Joseph Aoun, and the reform camp’s choice for prime minister, Salam, former president of the International Court of Justice in The Hague. Municipal elections are not seen as an indicator of the country’s popular sentiment due to low voter interest and local political dynamics differing from those at the national level. Some analysts dismissed the results, calling them “insignificant” and added that next year’s parliamentary elections would more accurately reflect which direction the country is headed. Voter turnout was lower in almost every part of the country compared with 2016, the last time municipal elections took place. The places it fell included southern Lebanon, where 37 percent of the population voted. In 2016, 48 percent of its voters cast ballots. This was also true in most of the Bekaa Valley, an area that also was hit hard during the war and where Hezbollah tends to be the most popular party. In the north, voter turnout dropped from 45 percent in 2016 to 39 percent in 2025. In Beirut, the turnout was marginally higher – 21 percent in 2025 compared with 20 percent in 2016. Many people in southern Lebanon are still living through the war as Israel continues to carry outattackson areas like Nabatieh. While some in and from the south have questioned Hezbollah’s standing and decision to enter into a war with Israel on behalf of Gaza when they fired rockets on the Israeli-occupied Shebaa Farms territory on October 8, 2023, others still cling to their fervent support for the group. “The municipal elections confirmed that Hezbollah and the Amal Movement remain strong,” Qassem Kassir, a journalist and political analyst believed to be close to Hezbollah, told Al Jazeera. “The forces of change are weak, and their role has declined. The party [Hezbollah] maintains its relationship with the people.” Although reform forces did win some seats, including in Lebanon’s third largest city, Sidon, they were largely at a disadvantage due to a lack of name familiarity, the short campaign time and misinformation circulated by politically affiliated media. Claims of corruption and contested election results marred voting in parts of the north, where many candidates from traditional political parties dominated. In Beirut, forces for change were dealt a heavy blow. After receiving about 40 percent of the vote in 2016, which still was not enough to earn them a municipal seat, the reformist Beirut Madinati (Beirut My City) list won less than 10 percent of this year’s vote. The defeat took place despite the worsening living conditions in the capital, which critics blamed on establishment parties, including those running the municipality. “The municipality lives on another planet, completely detached from the concerns of the people,” Sarah Mahmoud, a Beirut Madinati candidate, told Al Jazeera on May 18 on the streets of Beirut as people went out to vote. Since aneconomic crisistook hold in 2019, electricity cuts have become more common, and diesel generators have plugged the gap. These generators contribute to air pollution, which has been linked to cardiovascular and respiratory ailments in Beirut andcarries cancer risks. Despite the criticisms and degraded living situation in the city, a list of candidates backed by establishment figures and major parties, including Hezbollah and Amal, but also their major ideological opponents, including the Lebanese Forces and the right-wing Kataeb Party, won 23 out of 24 seats. This list ran on a platform that stoked fears of sectarian disenfranchisement and promised sectarian parity. Municipalities, unlike Lebanon’s parliament, do not have sectarian quotas. The unlikely coalition of establishment parties, which was similar to the successful list in 2016 that aligned establishment parties against reform candidates, puzzled some in the capital. In separate incidents, television reporters confronted representatives from Hezbollah and the Lebanese Forces, drawing angry and confrontational reactions from them but little clarification as to why they’d align with an avowed enemy. Bernard Bridi, a media adviser for the list, said its priority was to bring in a foreign consultancy that would advise the municipality on how to manage Beirut like other major international capitals. She added that the opposing parties decided to unify because the stakes are so high this year after years of economic suffering, particularly since the war. Critics, however, accused the establishment parties of trying to keep power concentrated among themselves rather than let it fall to reformists who could threaten the system that has consolidated power in the hands of a few key figures and groups in the post-civil war era. “The question is what are you fighting for,” Karim Safieddine, a political organiser with Beirut Madinati, said, referring to the establishment list. “And if they can tell me what they’re fighting for, I’d be grateful.” Now the nation’s eyes will turn to May next year as parties and movements are already preparing their candidates and platforms for parliamentary elections. In 2022, just more than a dozen reform candidates emerged from Lebanon’s economic crisis and subsequent popular uprising. Some speculated that the reform spirit has subsided since thousands of Lebanese have emigrated abroad –close to 200,000 from 2018 to 2021 alone– and others have grown disillusioned at a perceived lack of immediate change or disagreements among reform-minded figures. Many Lebanese will also have last year’s struggles during the war and need for reconstruction in mind when heading to the polls next year. Some have started to question or challenge Hezbollah’s longtime dominance after seeing the group so badly weakened by Israel. Others are doubling down on their support due to what they said is neglect by the new government and their belief that Hezbollah is the only group working in their interests. “Taken together, these developments imply a future trajectory where Shia political support for Hezbollah remains solid but increasingly isolated,” Salamey explained, “while its broader cross-sectarian coalition continues to shrink, potentially reducing Hezbollah’s influence in future parliamentary elections to that of a more pronounced minority bloc.”",

    "title": "ECB’s Lagarde says euro could be viable alternative to US dollar",
    "article_text": "The euro could become a viable alternative to the US dollar as the global standard currency for international trade, according to European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde. In a speech in Berlin, Germany, Lagarde said on Monday that theerratic economic policyof the United States has spooked global investors into limiting their exposure to the dollar in recent months. Many have opted to invest in gold, withoutseeing a viable alternative. “The ongoing changes create the opening for a ‘global euro moment’,” she said. Lagarde said investors seek “geopolitical assurance in another form: they invest in the assets of regions that are reliable security partners and can honour alliances with hard power”. “The global economy thrived on a foundation of openness and multilateralism underpinned by US leadership … but today it is fracturing.” The dollar’s role has been on the decline for years and now makes up 58 percent of international reserves, the lowest in decades, but still well above the euro’s 20 percent share. Any enhanced role for the euro must coincide with greater military strength that can back up partnerships, Lagarde said. Europe should also make the euro the currency of choice for businesses invoicing international trade, she said. This could be supported by forging new trade agreements, enhanced cross-border payments and liquidity agreements with the ECB. Theeuro’s global role has been stagnantfor decades now since the European Union’s financial institutions remain unfinished and governments have shown little appetite to embark on more integration. For this, Europe needs a deeper, more liquid capital market, must bolster its legal foundations, and needs to underpin its commitment to open trade with security capabilities, Lagarde argued. Reforming the domestic economy may be more pressing, however, she said. The euro area capital market is still fragmented, inefficient and lacks a truly liquid, widely available safe asset that investors could flock to. “Economic logic tells us that public goods need to be jointly financed. And this joint financing could provide the basis for Europe to gradually increase its supply of safe assets,” Lagarde said. Joint borrowing has been taboo for some key eurozone members, particularly Germany, which fears that its taxpayers could end up having to pay for the fiscal irresponsibility of others. If Europe succeeded, the benefits would be large, Lagarde said. The investment inflow would allow domestic players to borrow at lower cost, insulate the bloc from exchange rate movements and protect it against international sanctions.",

    "title": "More than 95 percent of Gaza’s agricultural land unusable, UN warns",
    "article_text": "Less than five percent of the Gaza Strip’s cropland is able to be cultivated, according to anew geospatial assessmentfrom the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the United Nations Satellite Centre (UNOSAT). The FAO described the situation as “alarming” on Monday, warning that the destruction of agricultural infrastructure amid Israel’s war on Gaza is “further deteriorating food production capacity and exacerbating the risk of famine”. The joint assessment found that more than 80 percent ofGaza’stotal cropland has been damaged, while 77.8 percent of that land is now inaccessible to farmers. Only 688 hectares (1,700 acres), or 4.6 percent of cropland, remains available for cultivation. The destruction has extended to Gaza’s greenhouses and water sources, with 71.2 percent of greenhouses and 82.8 percent of agricultural wells also damaged. “This level of destruction is not just a loss of infrastructure – it is a collapse of Gaza’s agrifood system and of lifelines,” said Beth Bechdol, FAO’s deputy director-general. “What once provided food, income, and stability for hundreds of thousands is now in ruins. With cropland, greenhouses, and wells destroyed, local food production has ground to a halt. Rebuilding will require massive investment –  and a sustained commitment to restore both livelihoods and hope.” The findings follow the release of the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis earlier this month, which warned that Gaza’s entire population is facing a critical risk of famine after 19 months of war, mass displacement, and severe restrictions on humanitarian aid. While Israel announced last week that it would allow “minimal” aid deliveries into Gaza, humanitarian organisations have warned that the trickle of supplies is failing to reach Gaza’s starving population. Meanwhile, Israeli air attacks continue to kill dozens of Palestinians every day in Gaza. On Monday, Israeli forces bombed a school-turned-shelter in Gaza City, sparking a fire and killing at least 36 Palestinians, including several children. More than 50 people were killed in Israeli attacks across the enclave since dawn, according to health officials.",

    "article_text": "Thousands of right-wing Israelis have marched through occupied East Jerusalem to celebrate Israel’s occupation of the city in 1967 following the Six-Day War. They made their way through Palestinian neighbourhoods, chanting “death to Arabs” and anti-Islamic slogans. Police forces were dispatched in advance, as the settlers regularly assault and harass Palestinians in the Muslim quarter. Right-wing Israelis also stormed the headquarters of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) in the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood. Last year’s procession, held during the first year of the Gaza war, saw ultranationalist Israelis attack a Palestinian journalist in the Old City and call for violence against Palestinians. Four years ago, the march contributed to the outbreak of an 11-day war in Gaza.",

    "title": "Ukraine accuses China of supplying Russian arms industry",
    "article_text": "Ukraine has data that confirms China is supplying Russia’s arms industry, according to the head of Kyiv’s foreign intelligence service. Oleh Ivashchenko said in an interview published by the Ukrinform news agency on Monday that Ukraine can “confirm” that China is providing important materials and equipment to 20 Russian military factories. Beijing has regularly denied accusations from Kyiv that it is aiding Moscow’s war against its neighbour. Last month, Ukraine accused China of direct military assistance to Russia’s arms industry. Ivashchenko said that the country’s intelligence agency can now confirm those reports. “There is information that China supplies tooling machines, special chemical products, gunpowder, and components specifically to defence manufacturing industries,” he said. “We have confirmed data on 20 Russian factories.” Although China has sought to project an image of neutrality and denies any involvement in the war, it has increasedtrade and economic cooperationwith Russia since its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Meanwhile, Western countries have imposed sweeping sanctions on Moscow. Ukraine has regularly suggested China is supporting the war, and has said thatBeijing has sent soldiersto fight alongside Russian forces. Last month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky made his firstpublic accusationthat China is supplying gunpowder and materials to Russia’s arms manufacturers, while also accusing Chinese citizens of helping in the production of drones. China rejected the claim as “groundless,” but Kyiv has since imposed sanctions on three Chinese entities. Ivashchenko said that Ukrainian intelligence had information on at least five cases of Russian-Chinese cooperation in the aviation sector between 2024 and 2025, including the transfer of equipment, spare parts and technical documentation. He added that there were six cases involving “large shipments” of specialty chemicals, but did not provide further details. “As of early 2025, 80 percent of critical electronic components found in Russian drones originated in China,” Ivashchenko added. “At the same time, there are facts of product substitutions, deceptive product names; there are shell companies through which everything necessary for the production of microelectronics is supplied.” The comments came as Ukraine’s Air Force said Russia had launched arecord number of dronesagainst Ukraine overnight on Sunday. Russian forces deployed 298 drones and 69 missiles, according to the report, but the Air Force said it was able to down 266 drones and 45 missiles. Al Jazeera was not able to independently verify the figures. Ukraine said that the attack was the largest of the war in terms of weapons fired.",

    "title": "Romania’s President Dan sworn in amid far-right claims of stolen election",
    "article_text": "Pro-EuropeanNicusor Danhas been sworn in as Romania’s new president amid persisting claims from the far right that his election was illegitimate. The centrist promised on Monday to usher in a “new chapter” in Romania amid hopes that his inauguration could help bring an end to months of political crisis. However, his pro-Russian and nationalist rival George Simion maintained that the May 18 election represents a “coup d’etat”. In the run-up to the election, which was marred by the annulment of November’s initial vote due to Russian interference, Dan promised to quash corruption and reaffirm Romania’s commitment to the European Union and NATO. In his inauguration speech, he said he would fix Romania’s economic and political woes and be a president “open to the voice of society”. “The Romanian state needs a fundamental change within the rule of law, and I invite you to continue to be involved in order to put positive pressure on state institutions to reform,” he said. “I call on political parties to act in the national interest.” The May election rerun was held months after the Constitutional Court voided the previous election. Far-right, pro-Russian Calin Georgescu had won the most votes in the first round of November’s vote but was thrown out of the race after allegations of electoral violations and Russian interference, which Moscow has denied. Simion, leader of the far-right Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR), took his place and led the polls for weeks before a surge in the final days of the campaign pushed Dan past the post. Since the result was announced, Simion has repeatedly alleged, without providing evidence, that the election was rigged through foreign interference. However, the Constitutional Court validated the results on Thursday after rejecting an appeal from Simion to annul the vote. Lawmakers from the AUR boycotted the swearing-in ceremony, calling it “legitimising a national treason” while Simion condemned the court’s decision as a “coup d’etat”. Authorities remain on alert with protests expected by supporters of the far right. Dan’s victory over Simion was heralded around Europe with the outcome viewed as crucial to maintaining Romania’s place within Western alliances, especially as the war continues in neighbouring Ukraine. “We won the Romanian presidential elections. People rejected isolationism and Russian influence,” Dan said on Sunday at a rally in Poland for liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, who willface nationalist Karol Nawrockiin a presidential run-off on June 1. However, significant challenges lie ahead for Dan as Romania faces political and economic crises. He must first nominate a prime minister who can garner the support necessary to form a new government as widespread rejection of the political class has propelled figures like Georgescu and Simion into leading challengers. Dan is expected to meet Ilie Bolojan, who had been serving as interim president. The member of the pro-EU National Liberal Party has been tipped as a possible prime minister. As for Romanians struggling economically, Dan made few promises on Monday. “Put simply, … the Romanian state is spending more than it can afford,” the new president said. “It is in the national interest for Romania to send a message of stability to financial markets,” he said. “It is in the national interest to send a signal of openness and predictability to the investment environment.”",

    "article_text": "Real Madrid’s Kylian Mbappe has ended his first season in Spain by collecting the European Golden Shoe award. Mbappe, who also won the Pichichi Trophy for being the top goal scorer in La Liga, scored twice in Real’s final league game on Saturday to overtake Sporting Lisbon’s Viktor Gyokeres at the top of the weighted table, which counts only league goals. Mbappe, 26, ended with 31 league goals and became the third Real Madrid player to win the award after Hugo Sanchez and Cristiano Ronaldo. The last Frenchman to collect the Golden Shoe was Thierry Henry, who won it in 2004 and 2005 with Arsenal. Mbappe could have been caught on Sunday while he was in Monaco watching the Formula One Grand Prix. Mohamed Salah, who needed a hat-trick in English champions Liverpool’s last league game, scored once to finish third with 29 goals. Robert Lewandowski of Barcelona, already certain to finish ahead of Real Madrid in the race for the Spanish league title, scored twice on Sunday at Bilbao. He achieved a total of 27 goals for fourth place in Europe and second in the Pichichi. The Pole won the Golden Shoe twice with Bayern Munich and claimed the Pichichi in 2023. Last year’s Golden Shoe winner, Harry Kane, finished fifth with 26 Bundesliga goals to go with his league champions medal at Bayern. Mateo Retegui with 25 for Atalanta was the top Serie A player in sixth place. Gyokeres outscored Mbappe with 39 goals, but the table is weighted. Each goal in the “big five” European competitions – La Liga, Premier League, Bundesliga, Ligue 1 and Serie A – is doubled. For the next 16 ranked leagues, goals are multiplied by 1.5. Below that, a goal is just a goal. In the final calculations, the top five in the rankings were as follows: Mbappe (62 points), Gyokeres (58.5), Salah (58), Robert Lewandowski (54) and Harry Kane (52). Mbappe, the top scorer in the 2022 World Cup, hit 43 goals in all competitions for Real this season.",

    "article_text": "﻿A ‘necessary price adjustment’ for Nikon products is coming on June 23rd, but we don’t know how much it might be. ﻿A ‘necessary price adjustment’ for Nikon products is coming on June 23rd, but we don’t know how much it might be. byAndrew Liszewski After months of remaining quiet about how President Donald Trump’s tariffs on Chinese-made goods may affect its business, Nikon has announced a “necessary price adjustment” for its products that will come into effect for the US starting on June 23rd, 2025. The company hasn’t shared any specifics on which of its imaging products will see a price increase, or how much the increases may end up being, but it could mean this is the time to grab hardware like therecent Z5 IIif you’ve been eyeing it. “At Nikon, we remain committed to providing the highest quality imaging products and value to our customers,” Nikon said in astatement posted Friday. “Due to the recent tariffs, a necessary price adjustment for products will take effect on June 23, 2025. We will be carefully monitoring any tariff developments and may adjust pricing as necessary to reflect the evolving market conditions. We wish to thank our customers for their understanding and know that we are taking every possible step to minimize the impact on our community.” Earlier this month, during a presentation where the company shared its latest financial results, Nikonsaid(pdf) the tariffs could reduce its profits for the upcoming fiscal year by 10 billion yen, or around $70 million, asreported byPetaPixel. Nikon is not the first or only camera gear company to announce price increases as a result of the US tariffs. The Australia-based Blackmagic Design startedcharging more for its digital cinema cameraslast month while also announcing that the tariffs made its plans to build a factory in Dallas, Texas, financially unviable. During the announcement for its own Q1 financial results in late April, Canon told analysts that it was planning to raise prices and was “in the process of estimating the timing and amount of the increase,”according toDPReview. The company also said its price increases would be limited to the US, but that could change if the tariffs triggered a wider global recession. Other camera makers that have recently raised prices includeSonyandLeica, while Fujifilm temporarily paused US preorders for several of its cameras, including the budget-friendlyX-M5and the still popularX100VI, thecompany toldDPReviewin late April. Lens maker Sigma has alsoannounced pricing adjustments, but like Nikon, those aren’t going into effect immediately and will instead start on June 2nd, 2025.

    "title": "The Last of Us opens up a whole new perspective for its next season",
    "article_text": "The last few minutes of the season 2 finale are an important indication of where the story is going. The last few minutes of the season 2 finale are an important indication of where the story is going. byAndrew Webster The Last of Usjust wrapped up its second season, and the finale ends in a way that sets up a major change for the show. It’s one that reflects a similar shift in perspectivethat fans of the game it’s adaptingwill remember well: one designed to make viewers see the story in a whole new way. This story contains spoilers for the first two seasons ofThe Last of Us, as well as both games. After the relative peace and respite of season 2’s penultimate episode, which tracked Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie’s (Bella Ramsey) shifting relationship over the course of several years, the finale gets back to the dark stuff. Namely, Ellie’s quest to find and kill Abby (Kaitlyn Dever),who murdered Joel as revenge for killing her own father. Despite being caught in a literal warzone in Seattle, and having a pregnant girlfriend who just suffered a grievous injury,andlistening to a speech from Jesse (Young Mazino) about the importance of thinking about the good of their community as a whole, it seems nothing can stop Ellie in her own quest for revenge. So when she learns Abby might be in a nearby aquarium, she abandons everything to go there, only to accidentally kill two of Abby’s friends, one of whom is pregnant herself. This moment is pivotal in that it really drives home just how determined Ellie is, and how much violence she’s willing to create and endure in pursuit of revenge. But it’s also not the end of the episode. The last two minutes suddenly shift to Abby in a massive settlement inside of a baseball stadium. After following Ellie’s three-day-long quest, we see Abby alongside the words “Seattle: Day One.” For those who have playedThe Last of Us Part II, this mirrors the structure of the game. In the first half of the game, Abby is a villain to be chased, before players take control of her to see the same period of time through her eyes, turning her into a character that you can both hate and sympathize with, much as Ellie steadily becomes. According to co-showrunner Craig Mazin, one of the challenges of re-creating this moment came down to the differences between games and television. The team wanted to get a similar feeling across, even knowing that it wouldn’t hit quite as hard. “We can’t reproduce the shock of becoming a person,” Mazin said during a press Q&A ahead of the finale. “In the games you are Joel, you are Ellie, you are Abby. When that shift happens it’s jarring because you have been someone. But here we’re watching everybody equally on a screen.” He added, “What we’re doing is honoring the notion that there’s a time period where one person experiences it one way, and another is experiencing it so wildly different, and yet they converge.” The suggestion is thatseason 3will largely follow Abby’s side of the story, something that Neil Druckmann, co-showrunner and also creative director of the games, alluded to. “Had we ended this season somewhere else, like a few moments before, I think we wouldn’t be making the right promise of what this is about,” Druckmann said. “We’re telling you that next season, one, there is just an epic nature to what’s about to happen, and two, this other story is going to be really important.” This doesn’t mean there won’t be Ellie in season 3 — or Joel, for that matter — as the TV show has been fairly liberal withshifting moments around to better suit its own style of storytelling. So it’s very unlikely that season 3 will be solely, or even primarily, from Abby’s perspective. But learning her side of the story will be important, particularly for how it both mirrors and differs from Ellie’s perspective and makes viewers root for or against both parties. “We understand that both Ellie and Abby are moving forward in trouble,” explained Mazin. “They are in moral trouble, because their certainty is beginning to fail them, and we can see it here with Ellie for sure. Because faced with the consequences of the thing she’s done, and the people that didn’t deserve to die dying, she’s starting to feel maybe a swing of the pendulum.” Even still, adding in a third major character to sympathize with will mark a major shift for the show going forward, much as killing off Joel was for season 2. And Mazin believes this is a core part of the structure of the series. “This show is going to be a different show every season,” he said.

    "title": "How to scan documents using your iPhone",
    "article_text": "﻿Create backups and clear out the clutter using your phone. ﻿Create backups and clear out the clutter using your phone. byDavid Nield Converting paper documents into digital formats means you’ve got backups of your paperwork should you ever need them. It can also help you clear out a substantial amount of clutter from your home or office — perhaps a whole filing cabinet’s worth. It’s now easier than ever to scan documents using today’s phones — a large flatbed scanner is no longer needed as it was in the past. Receipts, business cards, bills, and any other kind of printed material can be stored digitally. If you’ve got an iPhone, you can do this straight from the built-inNotesorFilesapps. If those don’t quite give you the features you need, there are third-party alternatives that will do the job as well. The process of scanning a document is similar in both Notes and Files. To get started in Notes, open or create a note, then tap the paperclip icon at the bottom, thenScan Documents. In Files, tap the three dots (top right), thenScan Documents. This gets you into the scanning interface. By default, you’ll be in auto mode — frame the document in the camera viewfinder, and when it’s lined up, a picture is automatically taken. Line up the next page, and after a moment, another capture is made. TapAuto(top right) to switch to manual mode, which lets you take each snap using the shutter button manually. TheAutobutton changes to readManual, and you can tap it again to switch back to automatic mode. You’ll see a couple of icons at the top. The lightning bolt lets you control the flash, while the three circles lets you switch betweenColor,Grayscale,Black & White, andPhotofor the scanning mode. When all the documents and pages have been captured, tapSave. In Notes, the pages you’ve scanned are then added to the current note, and in Files the pages are saved together as a PDF file (you may be asked where you want to save your file). Apple’s Continuity suite of features includes a useful little trick that lets you scan documents from your Mac using an iPhone. As with other Continuity features, you must be signed in to the same Apple account on both devices for this to work, and both devices need to have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth turned on. This works in Finder, Mail, Messages, Notes, Keynote, Numbers, Pages, and TextEdit on macOS. There are three options, depending on the app you’re in: All three methods will launch the document scanner on your iPhone — at which point you’re back to the interface we covered in the previous section. When you tapSaveon your iPhone, the documents show up in your Mac app. The process in iOS and macOS is very straightforward, but plenty of other apps do document scanning too, if you need them. A couple that I use regularly areGoogle DriveandDropbox, so you might find they suit you better if those apps are where you tend to keep your digital archives. With Google Drive, tap the scan document icon in the lower right corner (it looks like a page with a frame around it). This takes you to a camera interface that matches the one you get in Notes and Files, but when you tapSave, you get to choose where in your Google Drive you want the scanned PDF uploaded to. You get a few more options with Dropbox: Tap the blue+(plus) button at the bottom, thenScan files. There’s theAutoandManualtoggle switch again, but as soon as a page is captured, you get taken to a new screen where you can edit the borders of the scan or rotate it, and add further pages. When that’s sorted, you’re able to choose where in your Dropbox you want the scanned PDF to be saved, and how much compression to apply.

    "title": "How I shorted $TRUMP coin (and got to have dinner with the President)",
    "article_text": "“A lot of people put on the same hedge trade as I did, because they didn’t wanna take risk on the coin.” If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. byTina Nguyen If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. Last month, Donald Trump pushed the boundaries of government and financial ethics by announcing a contest: whoever bought and held the highest amount of the $TRUMP meme coin for an entire month would win an invite to a private dinner with the President. That dinner took place on Thursday at the Trump National Golf Course in Virginia, with attendeesreportedly dropping nearly $394 million on $TRUMPin order to win the privilege. According to an analysis byThe Guardianof the winners’ wallets, over half of them lost money participating in this contest. But that’s only if you’re analyzing the wallets visible on the contest site’s leaderboard. The real money was being made elsewhere. “Bet you 10 percent of dinner participants are doing this” I interviewed an enthusiastic crypto trader who figured out how to win the contest without losing any money: buy enough $TRUMP to get onto the leaderboard — and then in a separate wallet on a separate exchange, buy $TRUMP perpetual futures that would be profitable if (or as he saw it,when) the value of $TRUMP dropped. Yes, he didThe Big Short,except with Donald Trump’s meme coin. “Bet you 10 percent of dinner participants are doing this,” he told me before the contest ended. “Everyone knows $TRUMP price will fall inevitably as more supply comes online in the future and gets dumped on retail.” When I spoke to him again after the dinner, he told me that “the majority of people I spoke with, particularly the crypto traders and folks who are very close to the crypto ecosystem, are like, ‘Yeah, I dumped this. I already sold the coin.’” “A lot of people put on the same hedge trade as I did, because they didn’t wanna take risk on the coin,” he added. I can’t reveal his name, his position on the leaderboard, how much he spent, or the dates of specific trades he made. I can say that he did this for shits and giggles. But as he told me, when there’s such a clear and obvious set of financial incentives behind the $TRUMP dinner contest, it’s worth making the gamble. Did it pay off? “Um, I basically was flat,” he said. “I originally wanted to make some money, but I think the shorting I did — it wasokay?” He did, however, get a free dinner out of it. The following interview has been edited for clarity. Let’s just start from the beginning. What made you want to enter this? I think meme coins have a lot of staying power because humans just want things to gamble on. What was fascinating when the Trump token launched in January right before the inauguration, was that it effectively was like a black hole that sucked money away from all these other tokens in the ecosystem. That’s why the Trump token ran up to some preposterous number immediately after it was dropped. When I saw this competition launch, it was clear that there was going to be a tremendous amount of grift in this space, and the presidential family was only interested in self-enrichment and all that. It was clear that there was going to be a tremendous amount of grift in this space But putting that aside, I’ve just been interested in the Trump token and I think I’ve just been structurally bearish, because the Trump token has a bunch of supply that’s currently controlled by, effectively, the Trump family and the associates. It’s only a matter of time before the supply unlocks. When that supply unlocks, in the crypto community, people call this dumping: they’ll just dump it onto retail and that’s how they get their exit liquidity. So that’s one way the Trump family can make money. The other way is obviously whenever there’s trades that happen, the trading fees also accrue to the family. I know that the Trump token is going to go down. If you put a gun into my head and ask, what will the price be two years from now? It’s going to be much lower than where it is today. When this contest launched, I was like, okay, this is clearly a way for the affiliates and the Trump family to find a way to drive up the price temporarily. And having been in this space for a while, it’s clear that these events only drive the price up for a period of time and then people lose interest. Unless you feed them something else, it’s going to drop. Everyone expects the token to dump They launched the contest right around when the first tranche of Trump tokens were going to unlock, which was supposed to be 90 days after the launch of the token back in January. And so this whole contest was kind of timed at an apt moment where it’s like, okay, supply’s going to unlock. Everyone expects the token to dump. But then, on Twitter, they agreed to delay the unlock for another 90 days. But once the unlock happens and they start dumping,that’swhen the price is going to drop a lot. So this contest was interesting. I was like,okay, well, I feel like I can put on a trade here where I’m not taking on any real risk and I think it’ll be cool to meet random people at this dinner and see who else is interested. It seems like there are a lot of folks from out of the country who are flying in to attend the dinner, and a lot of crypto whales. There’s one that I follow, he’s mentioned in his Telegram that he’s one of the big holders. He’s talked these last few days about how he’s preparing for this dinner. So talk me through how you generated the funds to buy the Trump coin. Did you use your own personal funds? I use my personal funds. All the crypto trading I do is with my personal funds. Some of the trading I do is on Coinbase through a centralized exchange. And the rest of the trading I do is on chain through self-custody wallets. When this opportunity came up, the only way you can actually be in a position to be in the top 220 is if you own $TRUMP tokens in a self-custody wallet. Some of the exchanges, including Coinbase, allow you to buy the $TRUMP token, but that would not count towards this contest. What I did was I moved stablecoins like USDC to my Solana wallet, and then I used a decentralized exchange to buy the $TRUMP token. The way the contest works is you have to register your wallet before you are counted towards the ranking system. And unfortunately, I did that like a couple days late, so I had to size up a little bit more to ensure that I could catch up to the people who had registered a couple days prior. But that’s a nuance. So explain the process of shorting $TRUMP coin on a secondary market. Like how does one do that? I am a dumb person who only understands shorting markets through watchingThe Big Short. Basically when you short, you’re hoping that the price goes down, right? And the mechanism of shorting here is slightly different thanshorting stocks, but we don’t need to go into the specifics here. The way to short [crypto] is, you can do it in two ways. One is through a centralized exchange that offers, effectively, shorting services. And what I mean here by shorting services is, there is a “perpetual future” that is offered at these exchanges. When I talk about exchanges that offer this, it’s mostly going to be like Binance or Bybits and some of the bigger exchanges outside of the US. Coinbase is very far behind when it comes to offering derivative products that goes above and beyond just buying the token. I couldn’t do it through Coinbase, and I can’t short through an exchange like Binance, because there’s a lot of restrictions around who can actually use Binance. I’m in the US and Binance has very strict VPN rules. I can’t just open a Binance account and short. The only real way for me was to short on a decentralized exchange So the only real way for me was to short on a decentralized exchange, which has actually become really popular in the last year or so. It’s like the same concept as shorting on Binance, but you can do it on chain. I use a service called Hyper Liquid, which is a very popular decentralized exchange. And on this exchange, they offer derivative products that basically track the movement of different tokens. And so they offer, effectively, $TRUMP perpetual futures, and you can effectively initiate a short position through that. I’m happy to go into the details if you want, but that’s like the high level. Yeah, yes, pleasepleasetell me these details. So that is basically how to set up the short position. Conceptually, there’s a few things to keep in mind. First thing is: because I’m shorting in a separate wallet that’s completely detached from $TRUMP,  I have to put up additional capital in another wallet to do this. It’s not like I can just use my $TRUMP tokens as collateral and use the same pool of money to short. And the way shorting works and the way perpetual futures work in general is you put up a certain margin. So let’s keep it simple: say I put up $100k in margin and I choose to short the $TRUMP token. Now, if $TRUMP goes up in price, then I’m hurting, because I’m betting on the token falling. If the $TRUMP token doubles in price, well, then I will have lost a hundred thousand dollars in which case, my margin gets wiped out and this [futures] contract will have to be closed because I’ve lost all my money. If the token goes down in price, that’s when I profit — as long as I close out the position in the green. So you basically are juggling two wallets. One is the wallet in which you’re holding all this $TRUMP coin.  The other one is like, how would you describe it? Is that the money that you’re generating in order to pay for participating in the contest? The most important wallet here is the Solana wallet with the $TRUMP tokens, because that’s what’s being used by the contest organizers to determine who makes the top 220. But as I mentioned earlier, I am structurally bearish on the $TRUMP token and I wouldn’t want to go for dinner and like, see my money go down when the $TRUMP token goes down in price. I decided I wanted to basically put on a hedge, where, using the other wallet and the short position, I’m basically agnostic to any sort of price movement. That’s the reason why I set up the other wallet. I could have taken on the price risk, but that’s pretty risky, because typically what happens with these events is that as we get close to the end of the contest date, people start dumping the $TRUMP tokens. The value of the $TRUMP token will have gone down — let’s say it went down to 90,000 — it would be offset by the short wallet, which would be like 110,000. And then they add up to 200,000, which is how much I hypothetically put in from the start. Did youmakemoney off of this? Um, I basically was flat. I originally wanted to make some money, but I think the shorting I did — it wasokay? I basically just broke even on this entire trade Let me take a step back. So initially I shorted the same amount as the token. But then as the time went on, as we got close to the contest end date, I decided to increase the size of the short position, because I thought that based on the thesis I had, people are going to start selling because there’s nothing to look forward to. And so I increased that size. But it just so happened that towards the end of the contest was also when the crypto markets started ripping after May 8th. So net-net, I think I basically just broke even on this entire trade. Define the crypto markets “ripping.” May 8th was basically the Thursday right before that weekend when the US representatives were going to meet the Chinese representatives in Switzerland [for tariff negotiations]. That day was also when theUK deal announcementwas made. And so the market basically took that as a bullish sign, and then that got parlayed into the positive euphoria of the US-China negotiations. Everything started going up. Okay. So every market just started getting bullish. Yeah, all the tokens ran up a lot. If you look at the token price, $TRUMP coin on May 7th was roughly 11 bucks, and then on May 9th it was like 14 bucks. Over time that token has come down in price. But yeah, it ran up 40 percent in the span of like two days. What was the strategy going into the end game?  Because it sounds like it was super volatile around the end and that’s why you needed to increase your short position. I thought that towards the end, I could opportunistically make some profits by shorting more than I owned, if that makes sense. [The previous week, the contest organizers announced a new incentive for winners to not sell the coin before the dinner: a rare “TRUMP DIAMOND HANDS” NFT.] What is the point of encouraging people to godiamond handsby offering this NFT? So I think this goes back to the incentives of Trump’s affiliates, right? They have a lot of supply that they own. Last I looked, they own eighty percent of the supply. But all of that, as with many other [crypto] projects, gets locked up and only gets released over time, so that you don’t have all this supply pressure on day one. Because then no one wants to buy the token. The whole point of the NFT and this subsequent rewards program that they’ve talked about, but haven’t given the details for, is to incentivize people to hold the token longer. The longer people hold the token, then the price arguably would not fall as much. The only way to keep the price high is if you introduce all these little games to keep retail engaged The eventual setup, I’m sure, whether that’s in three months or in a year or two, is that the affiliates will then have their supply unlock, and they will want to sell. They obviously want to sell at a higher price. And the only way to keep the price high is if you introduce all these little games to keep retail engaged and interested in holding tokens. How do you get the NFT now? Do you have to rebuy all the coin? Yeah, my understanding based on that tweet they sent is, they basically look at your wallet holdings on the day of the dinner and compare that to your wallet holdings on the last day of the contest. And so if those match or if you own more, then they’ll give you an NFT. I was kind of dumb. What I should have done was, right before the 1:30PM cut off, I should have sold like, 90 percent of my tokens. In this way, on the dinner day, I would only have to buy 10 percent of what I bought previously, and I think I would qualify for this NFT. Wow. Have people done that? Well, the NFT hasn’t been dropped yet. I don’t know the specifics. There are definitely people who sold before the end of the deadline, and that’s clear from even looking atthat leaderboard page, right? There’s one column with current holdings and a bunch were zeroed out, but they are still in the top 220 because it’s a time-weighted calculation. Why did they do time-weighted calculations rather than like, just a cumulative amount of money you held at the end? I think this goes back to solving not only how much do you hold, but how long do you hold it for, and rewarding people differently. So if you held $60 over the entire stretch of the contest, you should be rewarded more than someone who held like $200 for one day on the last day. I think the time-weighted calculation effectively is trying to normalize for that. They also gave me a call the same day, which I thought was spam for a second How have the organizers been in their interactions with you for the contest and for the dinner and everything? They emailed me the day of, as soon as the contest ended, saying that I had made it into the top 220. And they also gave me a call the same day, which I thought was spam for a second. But when the voicemail thing came up, I’m like,oh, this is actually a real thing.So I picked up the phone and then they just confirmed that I got the email and that I would have to do a KYC [Know Your Customer check, part of anti-money laundering regulatory compliance for banks, crypto exchanges, and other entities] in order to qualify for the dinner. Please give us your data, references, whatever. Yeah, nothing that sophisticated. They outsourced it to another party and I just provided my name, my nationality, where I live. No social security number or anything like that. Plus my birthday. and I think they just ran like an external check to make sure that I wasn’t a criminal or anything like that. I feel like it was pretty light vetting How thoroughly do you think they’re been vetting you, how professional has the process been? I feel like it was pretty light vetting. I talked to someone about, let’s say, getting into the White House and it’s a lot more strict in terms of, you have to show your passport and all that. And here, you don’t really have to do that. You just have to show your ID at the door. At least that’s what they said. And as long as your ID matches the information you gave, you’re fine. So I don’t think the security is that strict, per se, but it’s good enough, I guess. Have you participated in any contests like this or heard of anything similar? No, I have not. That’s wild. This is rather innovative if one thinks about it in a “divorced from most governmental ethics” manner. Did you read about how it’s possible that Trump just doesn’t show up to this? I did see something that basically said, yeah, based on the terms and conditions,the president does not have to be there,I think. Honestly, I think a lot of people aren’t really there to see Trump. I could be totally wrong, but I get the sense from, let’s say, like looking at the crypto whales’ Telegram, that [they’re] more interested in just meeting other crypto folks so that [they] can network. If Justin Sun is there, that’s pretty good, right? Like being able to talk to him and maybe, you know, get his contact information and all that. I think for me and probably other people, we’re more interested in seeing if there’s any other interesting news that comes out of this dinner. I will have my wallet ready, and if some great news gets dropped at the dinner, that could potentially positively influence the $TRUMP token price or any other token price, I will buy it on the spot and try to profit. This is something that other attendees are thinking about doing too? I can’t say with certainty, but based on that one Telegram guy, it seemed like it was implied. Like, if they announced a rewards program for a Trump thing – say, the NFT will be used for this, and then the rewards will give you some really impressive thing in three months, that could probably move the price. Then I would take on a short-term trade literally at the dinner table. That’s why after the $TRUMP token dropped right before inauguration, I finally decided to download Truth Social That’s a first mover advantage right there. In crypto, half of it is just being a first mover advantage. That’s why after the $TRUMP token dropped right before inauguration, I finally decided to download Truth Social. I only follow Trump. He’s the only guy I follow and I have notifications on, which actually served me well. Was it April 9th when he sent out that tweet saying that tariffs are now delayed for 90 days? That was first out on Truth Social and I saw that immediately, and I’m like, oh,time to trade my equities, because I will be first to the news.So he’s dropped some nuggets for sure on his account. So the dinner itself is a good money making opportunity? Possibly. It’s hard to say, but in the event that it does, there is some information that gets dropped, that could be actionable. Is there anything you’re particularly proud of about the process of executing this short? I don’t know if there’s anything I’d really brag about or be like, super proud of. I think this hedge trade, for someone who’s pretty involved in crypto, would be fairly obvious. Net-net, I think I broke even because I did basically go a bit big around my short towards the end of the contest. So that made up for some of the fees I had to pay and whatnot. I’m pretty happy. I feel like I didn’t take on any risk and I’m able to go to this dinner. That’s probably a win in my books. One thing is, if I had real capital, I would have tried to make the top 25. That requires a lot of money, which I don’t have. I don’t really care about seeing Trump at all. I care more about seeing who else is there, of the top 25 I think it’s like a couple million. I think you’d have to have 200,000 tokens, so yeah, roughly like two, three million USD.  And if you want to not take on the risk of the token price moving, you’d want to take a short position of roughly the same size. It would be like a four or five million dollar capital outlay to make it happen. But the benefit of being in the top 25 is you get to meet Trump, and also get to be in a more intimate networking session, which I would actually enjoy being at. I don’t really care about seeing Trump at all. I care more about seeing who else is there, of the top 25. What was the minimum size of the wallet that made 220, do you know? It’s hard to say because what someone could have done is they could have bought a lot initially, and then halfway through they sold most of them, because they were pretty confident that they would make the top 220, because it’s time weighted.[Calculating out loud omitted.]I guess only fifty thousand [if you held the total amount from day one through the end]. Honestly, that’s not a lot. It’s not.  Realistically that number is probably higher. The thing is, this is not like a $50,000 disbursement where you’re never seeing that money again. After the dinner, you could choose to sell your token. Now, maybe the price will have moved from when you first bought it to when you sold it, but the actual loss, or potentially profit, is not obvious. Oh, that makes this some really interesting campaign finance implications. I guess the one thing I’ll say is, the Trump team probably won’t sell for a couple months at very least. And so whatever happens between now and then theoreticallydoesn’treally impact the team, right? Because if they had not launched this dinner contest and they did nothing, and then right before the unlock happens, they launch another campaign or they do something weird like this, then that will immediately pump up the price because crypto is so reflexive. And they can then sell into the strength of the price movement, theoretically. But here, I think what they want to do is actually show that this $TRUMP token has utility, and that it’s actually useful rather than just being a meme coin. And this is one way of making the $TRUMP token worth holding, because it’s not just a meme. If you buy it, you can go to dinner, you can earn points. You can get an NFT. It’s basically the playbook that a lot of folks will potentially run if they’re launching a meme coin with utility value. Oh, utility value is definitely a good way of saying it. Yeah, utility value in the sense that yeah, you can go to dinner, you can get an NFT, you can earn points that will get you something in the future. But yeah, this is a little bit different from memes like Pepe or Doge or Shiba Inu. Those have zero utility values. They’re literally just a meme. You can’t go to a dinner if you own a lot of it. It’s just a meme. The morning after the dinner: How are you? How was your crazy night out? It was good. And yeah, there was a sponsor who wanted to do an afterparty afterwards. They basically rented out the rooftop bar on top of the Marriott. I stayed out until 1 AM. But it was good. The actual event was quite interesting. The protestsoutside the dinnerobviously were just kind of off-putting. I was like,damn, should I really walk into this thing? I’ve actually never been to the Trump National. How is it as a venue? It’s on the Potomac River. When you are in the club you can see the really nice golf course and then the river is right there. The room was long and the podium was right up in the front and the tables were almost set up in a way where there were many rows of tables, but not that many columns, if it makes sense. I didn’t recognize this until maybe like, after an hour in, but people started taking seats because they wanted to be closer to the podium. And eventually, I’m like, damn, I gotta get a seat. But all that didn’t end up mattering because when Trump walked in, basically like a celebrity, everyone rushed up to the front and pulled out their phones and started recording. Who did you meet that was interesting or fun? Justin Sun was there, it was just that everyone wanted to talk to him. I guess the only thing I could do was just say hi to him. There were a bunch of international folks. A few folks were from Poland, who came all the way here from Portugal, where they now live. There was a lot of Asian people there. I met some folks from South Korea. Some guys from France, Italy. There was this hedge fund manager from Croatia who came just to check this out. Some guy from Sweden. There were also some market-making firms, like really big in crypto, like Wintermute. And then another guy who works at Kronos Research. The organizers also brought some folks, like the founder of theMoonshotapp. I guess Moonshot had partnered with folks with the $TRUMP launch back in January. He said he didn’t buy any tokens because none of the employees are allowed to trade [the meme coins on their own platform, because it would be a conflict of interest], and so he was just invited by the organizers. [According toCrunchbase, Moonshot, an app that enables users to purchase meme coins, was acquired by Jupiter, a Solana trading platform. No named individuals appear to be publicly associated with either enterprise, althoughJupiter’s founderis apparently someone going by the name “Meow.” The guest interviewed by The Verge did not recognize Meow from photos. – Ed.] There were a bunch of folks in the crypto ecosystem, now that I think about it, who actually had effectively insider knowledge that Trump was gonna launch a coin. They didn’t know exactly what that was gonna be, but they knew it was coming and it was gonna be a real coin. For the first hour or two [after the announcement], people were wondering if Trump’s account got hacked. I just thought that was interesting, that it was effectively prewired to a lot of folks. Ah, so like: if those people knew, then they had that first mover advantage for that full hour – that it was a legitimate coin? Yeah, the public didn’t know whether it was an intentional drop or if some hackers hacked the Twitter account. I ended up meeting one of the top winners, and he was telling me how he hedged his trade Did you find any really diehard MAGA people there? I’m sure that there were a couple of folks. I just never got a chance to speak with someone who’s like, super pro-Trump. I’d say the majority of people I spoke with, particularly the crypto traders and folks who are very close to the crypto ecosystem are like,yeah, I dumped this. I already sold the coin.A lot of people put on the same hedge trade as I did, because they didn’t wanna take risk on the coin. I ended up meeting one of the top winners, and he was telling me how he hedged his trade. So effectively, he was taking on no price risk. Now the only thing is when you short these tokens, there’s a funding cost, but because he had such a big position the funding was actually pretty significant.  So he said he paid, I don’t know, like $50,000 in funding costs, but to him it was still worth it, especially since he gota watch that’s supposedly worth $100,000if you’re in the top four. Wait, they gave outwatches? Yeah. When Justin went up and gave the speech, after that, he got the watch. Honestly $50,000 to meet the president and get a watch that’s twice that amount, is a pretty good deal. Yeah. I had no idea yet that there’s a TrumpWatches.com. I think the host referenced this — like, if you want a watch, just go on the website. I was like, this is real? And then I actually went on the website and it turned out it is. Swiss-made chrono movement – oh my God, there are so many watches. Do you see that one on the very front page? They gave out two of those as prizes for raffle winners. Oh, that’s only $500, man. Yeah, I know, right? Lame. I guess you can’t yet buy the $100,000 watch on this website. They were specially designed and they only were able to have two ready for the event, and the other two will get shipped to the winners. [The website currently lists the “Crypto President Tourbillon Watch” for pre-order, claiming that “only 10” have been made. – Ed.] Did people post photos or selfies, or was there a sense of discretion? There were obviously crypto traders who didn’t wanna give their real names, and some folks who were trying to be camera shy and avoid the limelight, but I feel like for the most part, people were taking selfies and they were just having a good time. And there were photographers walking around taking photos of everyone. And then at the end, this was after Trump and after all the gifts were given out, the host was like, everyone put on your hat that you got — it’s in my bag, it’s a Trump meme dinner hat — let’s all put it on and take a photo and then hashtag “trumpmemedinner” or whatever. [The White House is refusing to release the guest list with names of attendees. The New York Times has since said that it has acquireda copy of that list. Although photos of the gifted hats have circulated on social media, no related hashtag seems to have taken off. – Ed.] Oh, okay, so they actually encouraged you to put it on the Internet. I guess the host took the photo and it was like a selfie or something. The other funny moment was during the Trump speech. For the most part, it was just him talking about his campaign, and about how he beat Biden, and blah, blah, blah, how we were in a terrible place with crypto before he got elected and now we’re in a great place. That sounds exactly like a thing Trump would say. That was pretty accurate. At one point, the microphone made a cracking sound and then he was like,whoops, my ear.and he made a joke referencing the assassination attempt. How did you figure out about the afterparty? Was it the official afterparty? A lot of folks were saying there was gonna be some afterparty exclusive to VIPs, like the top 25 holders. There were a few folks who were trying to get into this party, but then it turns out it was actually not that exclusive. This MemeCore group, the number two holder, they rented out space at the rooftop of this Marriott and effectively invited everyone. So when you were leaving the venue, they had a couple buses that would come every 10 minutes and they were like,yeah, feel free to take this bus and we’ll take you to the after-party.A lot of people ended up going. [On TikTok, an attendee wearing a giant mask of what appears to be the MemeCore mascot, was accused of covering his face “to hide their identities” at “Trump’s crypto bribery event.” – Ed.] How was the afterparty? Was it well funded? They had an open bar, free drinks. It was fine, nothing like that noteworthy.

    "title": "Nick Clegg says asking artists for use permission would ‘kill’ the AI industry",
    "article_text": "Meta’s former head of global affairs said asking for permission from rights owners to train models would “basically kill the AI industry in this country overnight.” Meta’s former head of global affairs said asking for permission from rights owners to train models would “basically kill the AI industry in this country overnight.” byMia Sato As policy makers in the UK weigh how to regulate the AI industry, Nick Clegg, former UK deputy prime minister and former Meta executive, claimed a push for artist consent would “basically kill” the AI industry. Speaking at an event promoting his new book, Clegg said the creative community should have the right to opt out of having their work used to train AI models. But he claimed it wasn’t feasible to ask for consent before ingesting their work first. “I think the creative community wants to go a step further,” Clegg saidaccording toThe Times.“Quite a lot of voices say, ‘You can only train on my content, [if you] first ask’. And I have to say that strikes me as somewhat implausible because these systems train on vast amounts of data.” “I just don’t know how you go around, asking everyone first. I just don’t see how that would work,” Clegg said. “And by the way if you did it in Britain and no one else did it, you would basically kill the AI industry in this country overnight.” The comments follow a back-and-forth in Parliament over new legislation that aims to give creative industries more insight into how their work is used by AI companies. An amendment to theData (Use and Access) Billwould require technology companies to disclosewhat copyrighted works were used to train AI models. Paul McCartney, Dua Lipa, Elton John, and Andrew Lloyd Webber are among thehundredsof musicians, writers, designers, and journalists whosigned an open letterin support of the amendment earlier in May. The amendment — introduced by Beeban Kidron, who is also a film producer and director — has bounced aroundgaining support. But on Thursday members of parliamentrejected the proposal, with technology secretary Peter Kyle saying the “Britain’s economy needs both [AI and creative] sectors to succeed and to prosper.” Kidron and othershave saida transparency requirement would allow copyright law to be enforced, and that AI companies would be less likely to “steal” work in the first place if they are required to disclose what content they used to train models. Inan op-ed in theGuardianKidron promised that “the fight isn’t over yet,” as the Data (Use and Access) Billreturnsto the House of Lords in early June.

    "title": "Nintendo&#8217;s bold new era is full of safe bets",
    "article_text": "A new console, theme parks, movies, and even a museum — as the company expands, it’s less interested in taking risks. byAndrew Webster A new console, theme parks, movies, and even a museum — as the company expands, it’s less interested in taking risks. byAndrew Webster Nintendo is entering a new era. While most everyone associates the company with video games, for the last few years the brand behind Mario has been steadily expanding itself into something much larger. “I think people view Nintendo as a gaming company, but we have always thought of ourselves as an entertainment company,” Nintendo’s senior managing executive officer, Shinya Takahashi,told me in 2023. Design legend Shigeru Miyamoto echoed the same ideaat the opening of Nintendo’s first museum last year. “What I wanted to express with this museum is that we are first and foremost an entertainment company,” he said. To that end, Nintendo has entered into new areas like theme parks and Hollywood films. At the same time, it’s now attempting to maintain its foothold in games withthe launch of the Switch 2, a follow-up to its most successful home console to date. Each of these moves is a bold bet designed to broaden Nintendo’s scope — but each one does that in the safest possible way. As Nintendo gets more ambitious, it’s also getting less risky. The Switch 2 is the most obvious example. It’s right there in the name. Instead of switching things up with a left field idea like the Wii’s motion controls, Nintendo is sticking with what works. The Switch 2 retains the same form factor as its predecessor, but with a bigger screen, more powerful internals, and redesigned controllers. Given that the Switch has sold more than 150 million units over the last eight years,it makes sense for Nintendo to be a little boring here, and simply refine a concept that it knows works. It even plays most of the same games. The first two major first-party exclusives for the console —Mario Kart WorldandDonkey Kong Bananza— feed into this idea, with new features built largely around the Switch 2’s enhanced power. InMario Kartit’s a large open world that connects its race tracks, whileDonkey Konglets you smash the world around you to open new areas and pathways. That safeness points to a larger way of thinking within Nintendo beyond its next console. Each of Nintendo’s recent big bets had a similar amount of risk-aversion to it. When the company finally decided to exorcise the ghosts ofthe live-actionSuper Mario Bros.movie from the ’90s, it partnered with Illumination, the animation studio behind existing hits likeMinionsandThe Secret Life of Pets, which had previously been trusted with Dr. Seuss adaptationsThe GrinchandThe Lorax. The result of this partnership,The Super Mario Bros. Movie, was a playful homage that stuck closely to the source material. Itearned more than $1 billionand isgetting a sequel next year. Theupcoming live-actionLegend of Zeldamovieis a touch riskier, but there Nintendo recruited Wes Ball, a relatively unheralded director who nonetheless has a track record of successfully stewarding action franchises likePlanet of the ApesandMaze Runner. In both instances, Miyamoto — the guy who created bothSuper MarioandThe Legend of Zelda— is involved, serving as a producer. That involvement is a key part of this expansion. Nintendo is attempting to mitigate risk by remaining deeply involved in all of these new ventures. That’s one way to avoid a movie where Bowser — sorry, King Koopa — is Dennis Hopper playing some kind of evolved dinosaur, and Bob-ombs walk around wearing Reebok sneakers. Miyamoto has made a point to be a part of these new initiatives,dating back to when Nintendo released its first proper mobile game withSuper Mario Run. This includes Nintendo’s theme parks. It started withSuper Nintendo World at Universal Studios Japan in Osaka, and the company has since expanded with a locations in Los Angeles and Orlando, with another planned in Singapore. Much like its partnership with Illumination (which is under the Universal Pictures umbrella) Nintendo once again joined forces with a known quantity, one with a track record of re-creating fictional worlds ranging fromHarry PottertoJurassic Park. “We had this shared idea of trying to create something new and impressive, and the idea of wanting to create something that’s truly interactive,”Miyamoto told me in 2023 about the collaboration between Nintendo and Universal. “In that sense, our involvement wasn’t just a matter of reviewing assets or reviewing designs. But really trying to get down to the nitty-gritty of how people are going to experience this, and what their experiences are going to be. And we had a lot of meetings to discuss and nail down what we wanted to accomplish here.” A similar ethos runs throughthe official Nintendo museum in Kyoto. It exists at a much smaller scale than most of Nintendo’s other ventures; there’s only one location, with no announced plans to expand, and it’s unlikely to bring in significant revenue compared to a feature film or home console. But it’s also designed to be a pure expression of the vision of itself that Nintendo wants to present to the world. And that vision is squeaky clean. While there are plenty of interesting details about Nintendo’s history, including the time long before video games even existed, there’s nothing new to learn about any of the company’s failings or controversies at the museum. It doesn’t even explore any of the people who have worked at the company over the last century. Without any of that messy dirt, the museum is yet another safe bet. So far, this approach has been working. The Switch’s success has allowed Nintendo to operate from a position of strength, and it has parlayed that into successful ventures in other areas. Early interest in the Switch 2 seems to suggest this won’t change any time soon. It’s understandable that the company doesn’t want another flop like the Wii U or Virtual Boy, but at the same time some of its most notable successes came from zigging when others zagged. The one piece of Nintendo hardware that has sold more units than the original Switch is the Nintendo DS,a strange little handheld with two screens that supplanted the iconic Game Boy line. Whereas the Switch was once a trailblazer,it’s now facing increased competition as the leader of a fast-growing category of devices. There’s a careful balancing act here. If you play it safe all the time, you run the risk of becoming boring. That’s fine in small doses, but for a company that succeeds largely on its creative instincts, being seen as dull is about the worst possible future for Nintendo. Maybe the company is relying on its games to exude its wilder, more inventive instincts, or smaller projects likea charming alarm clockorDIY cardboard accessories. The bigger Nintendo becomes, the more it has to lose — and right now it seems intent on not messing with that.

    "title": "Trump calls Putin \"absolutely crazy\" as Russia hammers Ukraine",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 26, 2025 / 7:24 PM EDT/ CBS/AP Kyiv, Ukraine— Russia launched its biggest drone attack on Ukraine overnight since the more thanthree-year warbegan, a Ukrainian official said Monday. President Trump said Russian leader Vladimir Putin had gone \"absolutely crazy\" in stepping up his country'sbombing of Ukrainejust as the U.S. tries to broker a peace agreement. Russia's Sunday night attack included the launch of 355 drones, Yuriy Ihnat, head of the Ukrainian air force's communications department, told The Associated Press. The previous night, Russia fired 298 drones and 69 missiles of various types in what Ukrainian authorities said was the largest combined aerial assault during the conflict. Overall, from Friday to Sunday, Russia launched around 900 drones at Ukraine, officials said. The escalation appeared to thwart hopes that Mr. Trump's peace efforts might lead to a breakthrough in the near term, as Putin looks determined to capture more Ukrainian territory and inflict more damage. Russia has this month broken its record for aerial bombardments of Ukraine three times. The expansion of its air campaign came after Kyiv in March accepted an unconditional 30-day ceasefire proposed by the U.S., but Moscow effectively rejected it. Russia is also still pushing along the roughly 620-mile front line, where it has made slow and costly progress, and is assembling its forces for a summer offensive, Ukraine and military analysts say. Mr. Trump made it clear he is losing patience with Putin. \"I've always had a very good relationship with Vladimir Putin of Russia, but something has happened to him. He has gone absolutely CRAZY!\" the U.S. president wrote Sunday night in a post on his Truth Social platform. Putin is \"needlessly killing a lot of people,\" Mr. Trump said, pointing out that \"missiles and drones are being shot into Cities in Ukraine, for no reason whatsoever.\" He warned that if Putin wants to conquer all of Ukraine, it will \"lead to the downfall of Russia!\" But Mr. Trump again expressed frustration with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, too, saying that he's, \"doing his Country no favors by talking the way he does.\" Zelenskyy reacted to the overnight Russian strikes in his own social media post on Monday, saying: \"Only a sense of complete impunity can allow Russia to carry out such attacks and continually escalate their scale. ... There is no significant military logic to this, but there is considerable political meaning.\" He repeated his call for tighter international economic sanctions on Russia as a way of ending the war, because Russia's \"desire to fight must be deprived of resources.\" The Russian government appeared to downplay Mr. Trump's remarks about Putin as an emotional outburst, however some European leaders, who have been frustrated for months by the U.S. presidentrepeating Kremlin talking pointsabout the war and ridiculing Zelenskyy's government, seemed to take some hope by the change in tack. At the Kremlin, Putin's chief spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday that, \"the start of thenegotiation process [with Ukraine], for which the American side has done a lot, is a very important achievement. We are very thankful to the Americans and to President Trump personally for assistance in organizing and launching this negotiation process. This is a very important achievement. … Of course, at the same time this is a very crucial moment, which is associated, of course, with the emotional overload of everyone, absolutely, and with emotional reactions. We follow this very closely.\" French President Emmanuel Macron, however, told reporters during a visit to Vietnam that it seemed Mr. Trump appeared to be realizing that Putin had \"lied\" to him about wanting to find a diplomatic resolution to the war. The French leader said his hope was that Mr. Trump's anger at Moscow \"translates into action,\" and he called for Ukraine's international partners to set a firm deadline for Moscow to agree to a ceasefire, with the threat of \"massive sanctions\" should Putin continue to refuse. Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz, meanwhile, told his country's broadcaster WDR that \"Putin obviously sees offers of talks as a sign of weakness,\" stressing the Kremlin's rejection of proposed direct talks with Ukraine at the Vatican as evidence that \"we must be prepared for this war to last longer than we all wish or can imagine.\" Merz said several of Ukraine's partners had already dropped restrictions on allowing their military aid to be used for strikes deep inside Russia. \"There are no longer any range restrictions on the weapons delivered to Ukraine. Not from the British, nor the French, nor from us … and not from the Americans either,\" Merz said Monday. \"This means Ukraine can now also defend itself by attacking military targets in Russia. For a long time, it couldn't do that, and with a few exceptions, it didn't. We call this long-range fire, meaning equipping Ukraine in such a way that it can also strike military targets in the hinterland — and that is the decisive, qualitative difference in Ukraine's warfare: Russia is attacking civilian cities without any regard, bombing cities, hospitals, and nursing homes. Ukraine does not do that.\" The European Union's top diplomat, foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, earlier described the latest attacks on Kyiv as \"totally appalling\" and said the bloc intended to impose more sanctions on Russia. Mr. Trump has threatened massive sanctions on Moscow, too, but so far hasn't taken action. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin makes decisions that are necessary to ensure Russia's security and that the attacks were Moscow's response to deep strikes by Ukraine. Russia and Ukraineswapped hundreds more prisonersSunday in the third and last part of a major exchange that was a rare moment of cooperation between the warring nations. Russia's Defense Ministry said each side exchanged 303 soldiers, following the release of 307 combatants and civilians each on Saturday, and 390 on Friday — the biggest total swap of the war. In their talks held in Istanbul earlier this month, Kyiv and Moscow agreed to swap 1,000 prisoners of war and civilian detainees each. The exchange has been the only tangible outcome of those direct talks to date. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "title": "Man arrested after allegedly driving into crowd at Liverpool parade",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 26, 2025 / 6:41 PM EDT/ CBS News A 53-year-old man was detained Monday after he allegedly drove a vehicle into a crowd at the Liverpool Football Club trophy parade in Liverpool, England, injuring over two dozen people. Police were called to the scene in the city center, more than 200 miles northwest of London, at about 1 p.m. ET (6 p.m. local time) following reports of a car colliding with \"a number of pedestrians,\"the Merseyside Police initially said on social media. A 53-year-old White British man from the Liverpool area was arrested shortly after the incident, according to Assistant Chief Constable Jennifer Sims. Sims said at a news conference that she believes the man who was arrested was the driver of the vehicle. Investigators also believe the incident was isolated and no other suspects are being sought. The incident is not being treated as terrorism, Sims said. \"It is vital that people do not speculate or spread misinformation on social media,\" she said, asking people to refrain from sharing any distressing footage of the incident. David Kitchen of the North West Ambulance Service said 27 patients were taken to the hospital, including four children. Three of the victims were being treated for serious injuries, Kitchen said at the same news conference. First responders rescued three adults and a child who were trapped under a vehicle, according to Merseyside Fire Chief Nick Searle. Liverpool FC said inan earlier statement, \"We are in direct contact with Merseyside Police regarding the incident on Water Street which happened towards the end of the trophy parade earlier this evening. Our thoughts and prayers are with those who have been affected by this serious incident.\" Tens of thousands of fans had gathered for the parade Monday, lining the streets to watch Liverpool's players display the Premier League trophy. Liverpool's last league title came in 2020 but pandemic restrictions prevented a celebration at the time. Harry Rashid, who was at the parade with his wife and two young daughters, told The Associated Press a car began ramming people about 10 feet away from him. \"It was extremely fast,\" Rashid said. \"Initially, we just heard the pop, pop, pop of people just being knocked off the bonnet of a car.\" Another witness, Luke Dutch, told CBS News the driving seemed \"definitely intentional\" and the \"driver just shut the door and didn't seem to care\" before running over people. Photos from the scene showed multiple ambulances and first responders, and an ambulance service said it was responding to the incident. North West Ambulance Service \"is supporting an incident in Liverpool city centre, following reports of a road traffic collision,\" the organization said in a statement. \"We are currently assessing the situation and working with other members of the emergency services. Our priority is to ensure people receive the medical help they need as quickly as possible.\" U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmerwrote on social mediathat \"the scenes in Liverpool are appalling.\" \"My thoughts are with all those injured or affected,\" he wrote. \"I want to thank the police and emergency services for their swift and ongoing response to this shocking incident.\" The Merseyside Police said an investigation into the collision was underway. Police identified the suspect as White, in a possible decision to prevent misinformation from flooding social media. \"We would ask people not to speculate on the circumstances surrounding tonight's incident on Water Street in Liverpool city centre,\" the police wrote on social media. \"Extensive enquiries are ongoing to establish the circumstances leading up to the collision.\" Last summer, a teen in the nearby town ofSouthportkilled three girls in a stabbing rampage at a dance class and wounded 10 others, including two adults. An incorrect name of the suspect was spread on social media and people said he was an asylum seeker. In fact, he had been born in the U.K. Rioting spread across England and Northern Ireland, targeting Muslims and refugees in hotels of asylum seekers, and lasting about a week.

    "title": "What to know about symptoms of the new COVID variant, booster restrictions",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 26, 2025 / 1:24 PM EDT/ CBS News Cases of thenew COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1, linked to a large surge in China, havebeen detectedin multiple locations across the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"CDC is aware of reported cases of COVID-19 NB.1.8.1 in China and is in regular contact with international partners,\" a CDC spokesperson said in a statement last week. The spokesperson said that, so far, too few U.S. sequences have been reported of NB.1.8.1 to be included in the agency'svariant estimatesdashboard. But hospitalizations abroad have raised questions about the new variant, its symptoms and more. Here's what to know, according to experts. NB.1.8.1 is associated with symptoms that are \"broadly similar to those seen in earlier strains of the virus,\" Subhash Verma, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine, told CBS News in an emailed statement. Commonly reported symptoms include respiratory issues such as cough and sore throat, as well as systemic effects like fever and fatigue, he said. \"Data indicates that NB.1.8.1 does not lead to more severe illness compared to previous variants, although it appears to have a growth advantage, suggesting it may spread more easily,\" Verma said. \"In other words, it is more transmissible.\" Authorities in Hong Kongsaythere is no evidence that the variant, a descendant of the XDV lineage of the virus, is more severe than previous strains. Dr. Amy Edwards, assistant professor of pediatrics at the School of Medicine at Case Western Reserve University who specializes in infectious diseases, also told CBS News there is some evidence in the lab that this variant binds more tightly to human cells, which means it is easier to transmit. But, that doesn't mean it leads to more severe infection. \"What they're seeing in China, Hong Kong and some other areas where this variant has really surged, is an increase in hospitalization, but that seems to be more to do with just a standard summer surge that we've been seeing,\" Edwards explained, adding the available data is still preliminary, but that the variant \"doesn't seem to be more severe.\" Despite the latest variant displaying high transmissibility, the Trump administration is planning to limit booster vaccine access to some groups. Last week, theFood and Drug Administrationsaid it will continue approvingCOVID-19 vaccineupdates for seniors and those with anunderlying medical condition, including pregnancy or diabetes, but will require vaccine makers to conduct major new clinical trials before approving them for wider use. The decision means many Americans without underlying conditions may not have access to updated shots this fall. Verma said these restrictions could have several significant public health impacts. \"Although over 100 million Americans are still expected to qualify under these criteria, the administration's decision introduces new barriers for the broader population,\" he said. \"One immediate concern is that the FDA's requirement for updated clinical trials could delay access to boosters for lower-risk groups, discouraging some individuals from seeking vaccination. The new policy may also create confusion and reduce vaccination rates if people are uncertain about their eligibility or worried about insurance coverage, particularly with high-cost manufacturers planning to charge.\" Edwards said the recommendation updates remain unclear. \"Some of the language around pre-existing conditions is pretty loose,\" she explained. \"The other thing is, it's not clear what variants are going to be in this year's vaccine, especially with some question around what kind of vaccine trials are going to be allowed.\" The new COVID-19 vaccination framework was laid out by the FDA's new leadership under Health and Human Services SecretaryRobert F. Kennedy Jr., who has publiclyraised doubts about vaccines. \"We had heard Secretary Kennedy say, we're not going to take away your vaccines, we're going to be super transparent. And in fact, what is happening is people are going to lose access to vaccines,\" Dr. Céline Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News,told \"CBS Mornings Plus\"following the FDA's announcement about vaccine approvals. With questions about vaccine access up in the air, Edwards said there are still strategies for prevention. \"Good cough and sneezing hygiene, good hand washing, staying home if you're not feeling well to keep other people from catching what you've got,\" Edwards advised. \"If you're a little under the weather, but well enough to be out and about, wearing a mask.\" Despite some controversy around mask wearing, Edwards said they can prevent spread by keeping your germs to yourself. \"One of the places where masks have long been known to be the most effective is in preventing someone who's ill from passing that infection to other people,\" she said. \"So if I've got a slight sore throat, little bit of sniffles, obviously, that might not be enough to keep me home, but if I put a mask on, I can reduce the risk that I would transmit whatever I'm carrying to other people. And that's not just for COVID. That's any respiratory virus.\" Authorities in Hong Kong have also begun urging residents to mask when in public transportation or crowded places as cases have climbed.

    "article_text": "While Sean “Diddy” Combs’ federal trial has been rife with drama, cringe and explosive comments, lawyers not involved in the case say prosecutors have yet to prove that the music mogul is guilty of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking, the two most serious charges brought against him in a five-count indictment. Combs has pleaded not guilty to one count of racketeering conspiracy; two counts of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion; and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. About a dozen people have taken the stand so far in the trial, which will enter its third week Tuesday. “I’m not seeing the development of a racketeering enterprise,” said veteran criminal defense attorney Tama Beth Kudman. “I’m not seeing the thread that creates an enterprise with a unified purpose.” On the racketeering conspiracy charge, prosecutors must prove Combs was involved in a criminal enterprise with a group of people engaging in criminal acts, multiple lawyers said. For the sex trafficking charges, prosecutors must demonstrate that R&B singer Casandra “Cassie” Ventura, Combs’ former girlfriend, was forced to travel across state lines and commit sex acts. Attorney Rachel Maimin, a former federal prosecutor for the Southern District of New York, stressed patience because it’s still early in a trial that is expected to last eight weeks. “This is a very long trial, and all of the evidence doesn’t come in through one witness,” said Maimin, now a criminal defense attorney with Lowenstein Sandler LLP. “Just because the evidence hasn’t been presented yet doesn’t mean they don’t have it.” Prosecutors will eventually present all their findings and tie everything together in their closing arguments, she added. However, Thursday’s testimony from Grammy Award-winning rapper Kid Cudi, whose real name is Scott Mescudi, 41, could move the needle forward. He alleged that Combs and one of his employees broke into his home, and that his Porsche was torched in his driveway with a Molotov cocktail. The alleged crimes occurred in 2011 and 2012. Mescudi said he suspected Combs was involved in the car bombing because the mogul had learned about Mescudi’s romantic relationship with Ventura. Although Combs has not addressed the bombing directly, Ventura alleged in a2023 civil lawsuitagainst him that he told her he would blow up Mescudi’s car. The lawsuit was settled privately without Combs admitting any wrongdoing. The testimony about the car bombing could be key as the prosecution tries to show that Combs’ alleged criminal enterprise engaged in arson. The government does not need to prove that Combs himself threw the Molotov cocktail or that he participated in the act of arson, said Mark Lesko, a former federal prosecutor who led the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York. “That’s the essence of the conspiracy charge, that the co-conspirators, they don’t have to actually commit the act,” Lesko said. “They have to enter into some sort of agreement that involves the criminal conduct, ultimately.” While Mescudi’s testimony could help the prosecution’s case on racketeering, some outside lawyers believe more evidence is needed to prove Combs used his financial and business resources to carry out the bombing. “I don’t think that puts them over the goal line,” said Mark Zauderer, a veteran trial and appellate lawyer in New York, referring to Mescudi’s testimony. “That could be a building block for something to come.” Several lawyers not involved in the case said the prosecution was smart to make Ventura its first witness, because it set the stage for the trial. But prosecutors will need more evidence to make the sex trafficking charge stick, the lawyers said. Ventura’s testimony in the trial’s first week depicted Combs as an abusive boyfriend and music mogul in full control of her personal life and musical career. Combs’ lawyers pushed back on the assertion. The physical abuse was backed up on the stand by singer Dawn Richard, and while it may indicate domestic violence occurred, it does not prove racketeering or sex trafficking, the outside lawyer said. Sharay Hayes, an exotic dancer who testified he performed sex acts for Combs and Ventura about a dozen times, said Ventura seemed comfortable in the situations and their so-called “freak offs” appeared consensual. Forensic psychologist Dawn Hughes testified in court that domestic violence victims fall prey to psychological, sexual and emotional abuse, as well as financial dependence, making it harder for them to fight back or get away. What the court has seen, at least in part, is a willingness by Ventura to participate in the freak offs with Combs, Kudman said, citing text messages from Ventura to Combs presented as evidence in court. If Ventura participated out of fear of being abused or beaten, it could mean she was forced, but that will be for the jury to decide, Kudman said. “The bottom line here is I’m not seeing any points in time where this converts from willing participation into trafficking,” Kudman said. “She seems to be a willing participant in these sex acts. You literally have to prove she was being trafficked and forced to commit a sex act.” Zauderer said he agrees the government “has yet to prove its case on sex trafficking.” “I think the government knows that to get a conviction,” he said, “it has to do much more than paint him [Combs] as a bad guy.”",

    "title": "Some small businesses are swearing off tariff price hikes. It's costing them.",
    "article_text": "When Jeremiah Chamberlain and his wife, Harriet, started their 3D-printing business in March last year, tariffs weren’t high on their list of challenges to prepare for. “We didn’t expect to have this type of panic arise,” said Chamberlain, the owner-operator of Corvidae Creations in Hammond, Louisiana. But in the months since President Donald Trump took office andkicked off a freewheeling global trade war, Chamberlain has spent a few thousand dollars more on 3D printers from China. Chinese-made goods currently face a U.S. tariff rate ofat least 30%,down temporarily from 145%just weeks ago. Chamberlain has already ditched a Chinese supplier after it raised the cost of bulk filament orders from $14.99 to $17.99 per roll. Leaning only on American and Canadian filament vendors has actually saved money, Chamberlain said, allowing him to lower some prices — and the Chinese firms wound up walking back some of their own price hikes anyway. But he’s had to do without certain color options since making the switch. “The whole point of it, when we went into the toy production, was to make a durable, affordable toy for families and children,” he said, referring to his lineup of dragons, possums and dinosaurs. “Nothing’s going to make me raise prices unless it’s a matter of me having to shut the business down totally.” The company is one of many across the country promising not to raise prices on customers despite Trump’s import taxes. Some large corporations,like Home Depot, have ruled out price hikes for now, saying they have the flexibility to adapt. Others, includingNikeandWalmart, plan to raise some prices, while Target this week called doing soa “very last resort.”Many other businesses are trying to hold firm, too, asconsumers grow more pessimisticand hunt harder for bargains. The online clothing and home goods seller Quince recently told customers it’s committed to keeping prices steady “for as long as we can,” despite sourcing many items from China. A White House spokesperson didn’t respond to a request for comment. Main Street shopsand other small operators say they feel boxed in by the trade war. Some have been trying in the meantime to leverage“anti-tariff” promotionsand other sales gambits. Many see theever-changing U.S. dutiesas an existential threat that they’ll need customers’ help to survive. In a Main Street Alliance survey of small-business owners this spring, 81.5% said they’d have to raise prices to handle tariffs, and 31.5% said they’d lay off workers. “When you go back and forth from 10% to 140% to 30%, and now you’ve got a blanket ambient tariff regime, it is impossible to plan,” said Richard Trent, executive director of the advocacy group, which represents over 30,000 small businesses. “Small-business owners are operating on such thin margins. The least that we could do is give them a modicum of stability.” Some entrepreneurs see their duty to customers much the same way. “I won’t be raising prices,” said Carla Minervini, who runs All Fired Up, a pottery studio in Pawleys Island, South Carolina. “I cannot do that to my community.” Like Chamberlain, Minervini is doing her best to adapt. She has reassessed her product assortment and is working to sub in smaller versions of certain pieces or find alternatives in different shapes. She also stocked up on materials earlier this year, anticipating price increases from tariffs. Her main supplier — which is based in the U.S. but imports items from China — announced a 7.25% across-the-board price hike starting in June, she said. Another supplier flagged coming increases, too, but hasn’t indicated when or by how much. I would sell everything off and close my business and make a new life for myself before I would increase my prices. Carla Minervini, owner of All Fired Up pottery studio, Pawleys Island, S.C. Minervini is unwavering, though. “I would sell everything off and close my business and make a new life for myself before I would increase my prices,” she said. For Dan Jones and his wife, Ashley, tariffs have meant fewer hands helping with Jeans Day Apparel, the clothing company they co-own in McCordsville, Indiana. The business — currently a side gig alongside the Joneses’ full-time jobs — sells custom tees, pants and accessories for schools, sports teams and events. Jones said costs for supplies like ink, printing paper and clothes have gone up 3% on average since March. But rather than raise prices, he and Ashley let go of the handful of high schoolers who typically help out part time to make apparel for $12 to $15 an hour. “We have to be able to cut costs somewhere, and labor is the easiest place,” he said. The trims mean more work for Dan and Ashley, eating into their family time and pushing back plans to move the company out of the garage and into a storefront. “We just don’t know what the future looks like,” he said. “It’s the unknown that’s very scary.” Amy Grows, a retired U.S. Forest Service forestry technician and owner of Camas Creek Soap Company in Sagle, Idaho, doesn’t want to impose across-the-board price hikes. “I don’t think I need to do that to people,” she said. “It’s just soap.” To keep her bars at about $6 apiece for as long as she can, Grows joined the wave of businesses and consumersthat stockpiled goodsearlier this year, hoping to get ahead of tariffs. But her suppliers have already warned of potential price increases, so she plans to reduce the varieties of soap she makes by around 25%, focusing on top-selling items. She’s also swapping out palm and olive oils for cheaper alternatives wherever she can. “I’m trying to make a little money for me and give people a good product that they can afford,” Grows said. Last month, all four of Amelia Morgan’s U.S. suppliers announced 20% price hikes on the plaques, trophies and other components her awards business depends on. Recognitions Awards and More, based in Aviston, Illinois, can’t eat the added costs of those materials for long, Morgan said. She has held off on raising her own prices for weeks but expects she’ll need to finally give in sometime next month. “We’ve got people who depend on us to be able to pay the mortgage, be able to buy groceries, make car payments,” Morgan said of the six workers she and her husband employ. “We have to make sure that we stay profitable.”",

    "title": "A double amputee who served in Iraq is pushing lawmakers to end the 'wounded veterans tax'",
    "article_text": "WASHINGTON — When Army veteran Dan Nevins was forced to medically retire from the military after losing both his legs in combat, he thought he’d be financially taken care of by the country that he served. But Nevins soon discovered the so-called “wounded veterans tax” — an unofficial term for a federal policy that prohibits certain injured veterans from receiving both their full retirement pay and disability compensation. “I was told I could not receive both,” Nevins told NBC News in an interview. “And I was like, ‘Wait a minute. That’s not what I thought was going to happen.’” It’s an issue that affects around 50,000 veterans, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, costing them each about $1,900 per month. Under current federal policy, veterans who have less than 20 years of service and a disability rating under 50% get a dollar taken out of their retirement for every dollar they receive in disability compensation. The disability rating is assigned by the Veterans Affairs Department and assesses how much an injury or disability may impact a veteran’s health and ability to function. And now, Nevins is pushing lawmakers in Washington to change that. In 2004, when Nevins was deployed to Iraq as a squad leader, an improvised explosive device detonated beneath his vehicle. The blast killed his platoon sergeant, and eventually both of Nevins legs would be amputated below the knee because of the injuries he sustained. “People say when you’re about to die your life flashes before your eyes. That wasn’t really my experience. It was more like a slideshow of things left undone,” said Nevins, who still wears a bracelet every day to honor his platoon sergeant. “The last sort of vision, it was my 10-year-old daughter, but she was all grown up and dressed in white head to toe, and walking down the aisle without her dad. And I was like, ‘I’m alive. I have to do something to keep it that way.’” After a painful and lengthy recovery process, which included 36 surgeries and an 18-month stay at Walter Reed Hospital, Nevins started to live his life again. That included learning some new skills, such as becoming a certified yoga instructor. But because of his injuries, Nevins left the military earlier than anticipated. That is when, to his surprise, Nevins learned that he would not be receiving his full retirement pay. “It’s a tragedy really,” Nevins said. “So many people are cutting what we would all take for granted out of their lives, just so they can survive. And I mean, it’s not a ton of money, but it will help and really change lives and families for the better.” Congress is making a renewed push to eliminate the offset with a bipartisan bill, dubbed the Major Richard Star Act, that would give wounded veterans their full retirement benefits and disability pay. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., is spearheading the effort in the Senate, where it has 71 co-sponsors, while Rep. Gus Bilirakis, R-Fla., is leading the bill in the House, where it has 274 co-sponsors. “Veterans are retired early because of the wounds and the injuries they receive, and they’re entitled to disability compensation for them, but then their retirement pay is reduced dollar for dollar because of that disability compensation,” Blumenthal told NBC News. “They’re being penalized for being wounded. ... It’s about simple justice and fairness.” But the bill is costly: The CBO estimated in 2022 that the legislation would have cost $9.75 billion from 2024 to 2033. And at a time when the Trump administration is looking to trim government spending — including at the Veterans Affairs Department — cost concerns could stand in the way of passage. A spokesman for the VA said it does not typically comment on pending legislation, but vowed that no health care or benefits for veterans will be cut. The Department of Defense did not return a request for comment. Blumenthal said he sees “a number of paths” for the bill. He plans to offer it as an amendment to an annual defense policy bill later this year. And in the coming weeks, Blumenthal is going to try to bring it up under unanimous consent and “see who has the nerve to come forward and say we should deny our veterans basic fairness.” Ahead of Memorial Day, Nevins traveled to Washington to advocate for the bill. He appeared at a press conference alongside Marine Corps veteran Jamel Daniels, who also lost his leg in combat. The two got to know each other during their respective recoveries and even did wheelchair races in the hospital hallways, according to Nevins. Now, Nevins and Daniels are fighting for a legislative fix in the halls of the Capitol. And Nevins says his message to Congress is simple: honor the country’s commitment to veterans. “We should keep our promises,” Nevins said. “I teach my kids to keep their promises, even when it’s not convenient for them.”",

    "title": "Harvard revokes tenure from professor famous for ethics studies, first time in 80 years",
    "article_text": "Harvard University revoked the tenure of Harvard Business School professor Francesca Gino after years of data fraud allegations, a university spokesperson confirmed. Gino, widely known forresearching honesty and ethical behavior, was placed onadministrative leavein 2023 aftermultiple allegationsof falsifying data surfaced. A spokesperson for Harvard provided no additional details, noting that it does not discuss personnel matters. Gino also did not immediately respond to a request for comment. No professors are known to have lost their tenure at Harvard since the 1940s, when the American Association of University Professors formalizedrules of termination, according toThe Harvard Crimson, the student newspaper. Gino started working at Harvard Business School in 2010 as an associate professor of business administration, according toher extensive résumé, updated in June 2023. From 2018 to 2021, she was the head of the Negotiations, Organizations and Markets Unit. Gino’s research has been widely featured in the media, such as The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal andNBC News. In 2021, three professors and behavioral researchers with a blog site,Data Colada, began examining a number of studies Gino co-authored over a decade and shared evidence they believed proved fraudulent data with the business school. According to a 2023 blog post in which the researchers posted their evidence, the rest of their interactions with the university after they shared their 2021 report were confidential. Gino was placed on unpaid administrative leave in June 2023 after an 18-month internal investigation found she was responsible for \"research misconduct,\" according to a$25 million lawsuit Gino filedagainst Harvard and Data Colada. She lost her titled professorship and was removed from all teaching and research duties, the suit read. The suit claimed the investigation was conducted in adherence with a new employment policy that was created just for her. A federal judge dismissed the defamation allegations of Gino's suit in September but allowed claims that Harvard breached its contract with Gino by disciplining her in ways that violated its own tenure policies,the Crimson reported. Gino launched a websitededicated to the lawsuit, with the last update in March 2024 reading: \"Harvard shared their case. And while my lawyers have discouraged me from speaking out, I just need to say that I did not — ever — engage in academic fraud. \"Once I have the opportunity to prove this in the court of law, with the support of experts I was denied through Harvard’s investigation process, you’ll see why their case is so weak and that these are bogus allegations,\" the statement continued.",

    "article_text": "A mother and daughter accused of operating an unlicensed day care facility in California were charged with involuntary manslaughter after a 3-month-old child in their care died, the Monterey County Sheriff's Officesaid Sunday. Authorities were dispatched Friday morning to an address in Royal Oaks, a community near Salinas, where a child was not breathing, the sheriff's office said. The infant was given lifesaving treatment at the scene and was taken to a hospital but was pronounced dead a short time later, authorities added. As many as 30 children of various ages were under the care of Maria Marquez, 62, and her daughter Johanna Marquez, 35, according to the sheriff's office. Detectives \"were able to gather sufficient details to arrest the two operators of the unlicensed day care business for involuntary manslaughter believed to have resulted in the death of the three-month-old infant,\" the sheriff's office said in a news release. The suspects, who remained Monday in the Monterey County Jail, also face charges of felony child endangerment and operating a child day care facility without a license. Their bail was set at $50,000 each. It was not immediately clear whether they have legal representation. The sheriff's office said Monday its investigation continues. The California Department of Social Services' Community Care Licensing Division regulates the number of children permitted at a day care site and sets certain requirements for staff members, including pediatric CPR and first-aid training and child development courses. Child deaths in licensed child care centers in California are rare, with three reported from 2017 to 2023, according tostate social services data. \"There are certain trainings that the individuals that work and operate those facilities have to go through, and they're constantly being inspected by the state licensing board,\" Sheriff's Commander Andres Rosastold NBC affiliate KSBWof Salinas. \"So those standards that they have to meet are what give you a little bit more peace of mind that your child is safe at this particular location.\"",

    "title": "At least 27 hurt as van hits pedestrians at parade celebrating soccer win in Liverpool, England",
    "article_text": "A car collided with a number of pedestrians in thecenter of Liverpool in northwest England, injuring at least 27, officials said Monday, as thousands lined the streets to celebrateLiverpool Football Club’s English Premier League titlewin. At least 27 people, including four children, were hospitalized for their injuries, North West Ambulance Service Head of Service David Kitchin said. Of those people, one adult and one child have serious injuries, Kitchin said. Twenty more people were treated at the scene for minor injuries, Kitchin said. Additional patients have shown up at local hospitals, as well. Fire crews lifted the vehicle, which video showed was a minivan, off four people who were trapped underneath, including a child, said Nick Searle, chief fire officer for Merseyside Fire and Rescue. They were all taken to the hospital. Describing it as a “major incident” on X, Merseyside police said the car “stopped at the scene\" and a man was detained. In a later statement, police said “the suspect was white, British and from the Liverpool area.” It added that he was 53 years old. Assistant Chief Constable Jenny Sims said at a news conference Monday evening that officials believe the arrested man is the one who was behind the wheel. Sims said officials and investigators are working to understand what happened leading up to the collision, which he said is not being investigated as an act of terrorism. She said that it was an isolated incident and that officials are not looking for anyone else in connection with it. Video showed emergency vehicles and police cordons around a heavily littered road. Social media video verified by NBC News from before the collision and several streets away shows people yelling at the van, kicking it and trying to open its doors as the driver moves it back and forth. Verified video of the ramming appears to show the van moments later, a large crowd surrounding it as paradegoers continue to hit its exterior. Then, the video shows the vehicle speeding up and driving through the crowd, knocking down a number of pedestrians. It continues to plow through the fan-filled streets, and there are a large number of people who appear to be injured lying on the ground. After the car comes to a stop, the video shows angry Liverpool fans swarming it once again, pounding on its windows and exterior as police rush to break up the scene. Another social media video from street level and verified by NBC News appears to show the aftermath of the ramming. Police navigate the large and crowded streets. In the video, witnesses say the driver knocked over at least six people. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the scenes “appalling”on X. “My thoughts are with all those injured or affected,” he said, adding that he was “being kept updated on developments.” Eyewitness Natasha Rinaldi told British broadcaster Sky News, NBC News' international partner, that “people sounded desperate” and that she saw the car had “run over people.” “Then people started rushing to go after the driver and they tried to break the car. The police did everything to block and to push people away,” Rinaldi said. “We could just hear screams and screams. We were very confused.” “Some of my friends were down there, and the car was so near them. It was a horrible scene; nobody was expecting it.” Harry Rashid, 48, of Solihull, told the PA news agency that he was at the parade with his wife and two young daughters. “It happened about 10 feet away from us,” he said. “We were just in a crowd, and we had no control over where we would be, because it was a very narrow street.” “The vehicle came to our right. It emerged from just right next to an ambulance, which was parked up. This gray people carrier just pulled up from the right and just rammed into all the people at the side of us,” he added. Liverpool FC said in a statement on X that it was in contact with the police. “Our thoughts and prayers are with those who have been affected,” it said. It had been a particularly joyous Monday for Liverpool supporters, celebrating the Reds’ title in a proper manner denied to them five years ago. Liverpool last finished atop the Premier League in 2020, in a season derailed by the Covid-19 pandemic. There was no victory parade to toast that title-winning club. The club is no stranger to tragedy, as the1989 Hillsborough disasteris still burned into the memories of Liverpool supporters. Liverpool’s FA Cup semifinal match against Nottingham Forest on April 15, 1989, was stopped because of a crush of fans at Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield. Nearly100 Reds supportersdied in the worst sports tragedy in English sports history. During Monday night's news conference, Liverpool City Councilman Liam Robinson referred to the collective unity of the city in the face of tragedy. “Liverpool is a city with a proud history of coming together and supporting each other during challenging times,” he said.",

Southwest Flight 168 was approaching Denver International Airport on Sunday evening from Tampa when it was hit by a lightning strike, the media team for the airport said in a statement. Emergency crews responded to the plane, which landed and made it to the gate safely, the airport said. No injuries were reported. Southwest said that it was \"possible\" lightning struck the plane and that the aircraft has been taken out of service so its maintenance teams can inspect it.

Chief Marine Diesel Engineer Raymond Feige, 59, died in the explosion at the North River Wastewater Resource Recovery Facility in West Harlem, the DEP said in a statement Monday. The incident occurred at around 10:30 a.m. Saturday on a boat carrying raw sewage that was docked. \"Ray was a respected engineer and a steady, beloved colleague who will be deeply missed,\" DEP Commissioner Rohit T.

He \"brought deep technical expertise and unwavering dedication\" to the city's wastewater operations, the agency said. The diesel engineer was pronounced dead at the scene after being found unconscious in the river. Another DEP employee was taken to the hospital, and a third at the scene refused medical treatment. The DEP said the explosion was caused by an accident on the boat, which is still under investigation. The agency said there appears to have been no impact on plant operations or the environment.",

    "article_text": "PARIS —Naomi Osakastill wore the pink accessories in her hair inspired by “sakura” — cherry blossoms — and there were streaks on her cheeks where tears had rolled, when she sat down for aFrench Opennews conference after her first-round loss to Paula Badosa on Monday. Osaka’s red eyes welled as she answered a few questions before needing a break and briefly leaving the interview room following the 6-7 (1), 6-1, 6-4 exit against the 10th-seeded Badosa. “As time goes on, I feel like I should be doing better. But also — I kind of talked about this before, maybe a couple years ago, or maybe recently, I’m not sure — I hate disappointing people,” said Osaka, who owns four Grand Slam trophies from the hard courts of the U.S. Open and Australian Open but never has been past the third round on the red clay of Roland-Garros. Then, referring to her current coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, who used to work with Serena Williams, Osaka said: “He goes from working with, like, the greatest player ever to, like, ‘What the (expletive) is this?’ You know what I mean? Sorry for cursing. I hope I don’t get fined.” Osaka, who was born in Japan and moved to the United States as a young child, was undone Monday by 54 unforced errors. That was twice as many as Badosa, whose best showing at a major wasa semifinal run at the Australian Openin January and who reached the quarterfinals at Roland-Garros in 2021. After taking the opening set, Osaka was treated by a trainer for hand blisters and also took time to clip her sakura-themed fingernails on the sideline. She attributed the blisters, which also bothered her at the Italian Open this month, to “the friction of clay, because I don’t have blisters on any other surface.” Osaka’s powerful serves and groundstrokes are dulled by the clay, and that showed against Badosa. Osaka was broken five times and finished with nearly as many double-faults, five, as aces, seven. Once ranked No. 1 and currently No. 49, Osaka withdrew from the French Open in 2021 before her second-round match, explaining that she experiences“huge waves of anxiety”before speaking to the media and revealing she had dealt with depression. She then took multiple mental health breaks away from the tour. She helped usher in a change in the way athletes, sports fans and society at large understood the importance of mental health. A year ago at Roland-Garros, Osaka played one of her best matches since returning to action after becoming a mother, coming within a point ofupsetting eventual tournament champion Iga Swiatek. On Monday, after taking a break from questions, she returned to field one query from a Japanese journalist with an eye to the next major tournament, Wimbledon, which begins on grass on June 30. “I don’t necessarily know my grass-season schedule right now,” Osaka said. “I wasn’t really expecting to lose in the first round.”",

    "article_text": "Billy Joel's wife shared a message from the iconic musician's Instagram page Monday, thanking fans for their love and support amid herhusband's brain disorder diagnosis. Joel, 76, canceled his upcoming concert dates Friday and shared he was diagnosed withnormal pressure hydrocephalus, or NPH, a condition in which cerebrospinal fluid builds up inside the skull and presses on the brain. Alexis Roderick Joelsaid Mondaythat their family is \"so grateful for the wonderful care and swift diagnosis we received.\" The condition has been \"exacerbated by recent concert performances, leading to problems with hearing, vision and balance,\" said astatement posted on Joel's Instagram on Friday. It is most commonly diagnosed in older adults, usually around age 70. Joel is receiving treatment for the condition, including \"specific physical therapy,\" the statement said. Doctors told NBC News that NPH is often treatable and can even be reversed. \"Bill is beloved by so many, and to us, he is a father and husband who is at the center of our world,\" Roderick Joel continued. \"We are hopeful for his recovery. We look forward to seeing you all in the future.\" The message accompanied a photo of the couple with their two young daughters, Della and Remy. Joel's diagnosis comes after a February fall during a show in Uncasville, Connecticut. A video posted to TikTok showed Joel throwing his microphone and microphone stand into the crowd before losing his balance and falling onto his side. He then rolled onto his back, paused and attempted to stand up on his own. It is not clear if this fall was related to the NPH diagnosis, and doctors said no one knows what causes the condition. NPH can cause memory loss, bladder control issues and trouble walking. Oftentimes, patients are diagnosed after seeing a doctor over concerns that they are developing dementia. Joel's ex-wife Christie Brinkleyalso shared her well-wishesfor the \"Piano Man\" singer over the weekend in an Instagram post featuring videos of Joel and their daughter, Alexa Ray Joel, at a recent concert. \"You turn an arena of strangers into a living room full of friends as we all sway in unison,\"Brinkley wrote in the post. \"I'm sure I'm speaking for everyone in that room when I say, please take good care of yourself, we all want you back in that white hot spotlight, you're OUR piano man. And we're always in the mood for your melodies. And we all hope you're feeling alright!\"",

    "article_text": "Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino said Monday that his agency will revive or devote more resources into several investigations of unsolved cases from the Biden administration that have \"garnered public interest\" and have long ignited claims of corruption byallies and supporters of President Donald Trump. Bongino identified three cases that he said pointed to \"potential public corruption,\" including an investigation into a pair of pipe bombs that were found near the Democratic Party and the Republican Party headquarters Jan. 6, 2021, and thediscovery of a bag of cocaineat the White House in 2023. A third case Bongino said would be further reviewed was the 2022 leak of the unpublished Supreme Court decision ending federal protections for abortion rights. That probe was closed after a roughly eight-month investigation which included forensic analysis but was unable to identify a person responsible. \"We made the decision to either re-open, or push additional resources and investigative attention, to these cases,\" Bongino wrote ina post on X. \"I receive requested briefings on these cases weekly and we are making progress,\" he added. The fresh attention to the cases comes as the bureau faces pressure to investigate claims that Trump's allies, including Bongino himself, have promoted: that the Biden administration and deep state actors weaponized the Justice Department. Before he was sworn in earlier this year, Bonginoaccusedthe FBI of lying about not knowing the identity of the pipe bomber, saying, the agency “just doesn’t want to tell us because it was an inside job.” The FBI in Januaryreleased video linked to the pipe bombs,that it said depicted a masked suspect planting bombs outside the Republican and Democratic headquarters in Washington a day before the Capitol riot. Bongino has also questioned the discovery of the bag of cocaine that was uncovered in the White House in July 2023, suggesting shortly after the incident that the cocaine belonged to a Biden family member. He wrote thenon X, \"there’s absolutely ZERO chance anyone other than a family member brought that cocaine inside the White House complex.\" The Secret Service briefly investigated the incident and ended its probe after officials said that it had not detected usable DNA or fingerprints and that security footage had not produced leadsbeyond a too-expansive list of 500 staffers and visitors.",

    "article_text": "Charles Rangel, the Democratic former congressman from New York who championed his Harlem community on Capitol Hill for almost five decades, died Monday, his family said. He was 94. City College of New York spokesperson Michelle Stentconfirmed Rangel's death in a statement, saying he died at a hospital in New York. Politicians and supporters remembered Rangel, known as Charlie, for his years in public service and deep roots in New York City. He was born in Harlem and was first elected to Congress in 1970, representing a congressional district that was first drawn up in the 1940s and allowed the neighborhood's majority Black voters to send one of their own to Washington. Rangel served for so long that he earned the nickname the \"Lion of Lenox Avenue,\" referring to one of Harlem's primary corridors. \"Charlie Rangel was a great man, a great friend, and someone who never stopped fighting for his constituents and the best of America,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.,said Monday on X. \"The list of his accomplishments could take pages, but he leaves the world a much better place than he found it.\" New York Mayor Eric Adamssaid on Xthat he was \"sad to lose a dear friend and exemplary model of devotion and courage.\" The Rev. Al Sharptoncalled Rangela \"trailblazing legislator and an unshakable force in American politics.\" Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo also honored Rangel as his \"mentor and friend.\" \"He had that Harlem fire in his heart and a joy in his soul that no battle could extinguish,\" Cuomo said in a statement, adding that \"he never forgot where he came from.\" Rangel, a veteran of the Korean War, was a high school dropout but eventually went to college on the G.I. Bill, getting degrees from New York University and St. John's University Law School. In 1970, he defeated legendary Harlem politician Adam Clayton Powell to start his congressional career. During the next 40-plus years, he became a legend himself — a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus, dean of the New York congressional delegation and, in 2007, the first Black chair of the influential Ways and Means Committee. \"I have always been committed to fighting for the little guy,\" Rangel said in 2012. Two years earlier, he hadstepped down from the Ways and Means Committeeamid an ethics cloud. The House would later censure him in a 333-79 vote, citing nearly a dozen ethics violations that included breaching a gifts ban, improper use of influence and failure to disclose income. After the censure, Rangel rose before his colleagues in sorrow. \"I know in my heart I am not going to be judged by this Congress,\"he said. \"I'll be judged by my life in its entirety.\" Rangel remained in Congress and won the 2012 primary. His Harlem district overwhelmingly voted him in again as Barack Obama won a second presidential term. Despite the political stain later in his career, his time in Congress was exceedingly busy. According to the City College statement, Rangel sponsored 40 bills and resolutions that became law. His significant legislative accomplishments include championing the national Empowerment Zone program, the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit and the Affordable Care Act, which Obama signed into law in 2010. Rangel was chairman of the Ways and Means Committee when the Affordable Care Act was being heavily debated in Congress, and he was under pressure from the ethics investigations. In a 2009interview with Time, he was defiant when he was asked about his legacy. \"Well, as Rhett Butler once said in 'Gone With the Wind,' if I'm gone, quite frankly, I don't give a damn,\" he told the magazine. Rangel served in Congress until 2017, when he retired. He lamented toThe New York Times in 2016, when his eventual successor, Rep. Adriano Espaillat, was poised to become the first Dominican American elected to Congress, that he feared that meant his Harlem district would no longer have a Black representative. \"Can you tell the people in Boston that some day you won't have an Irish congressman?\" Rangel said. Rangel was the last surviving member of the so-called Gang of Four — a group of Black political figures who wielded great power in city and state politics. The others were David Dinkins, New York's first Black mayor; Percy Sutton, who was Manhattan Borough president; and Basil Paterson, a deputy mayor and New York secretary of state. The Congressional Black Caucus said in a statement Monday that its 61 members were mourning the loss of Rangel. \"His legacy is one of tireless advocacy, historic firsts, and dedication to justice and equality,\" the caucus said. \"May he rest in power and everlasting peace.\" Rangel is preceded in death by his wife, Alma, a social worker whom hemet in a Harlem ballroomin the 1950s;she diedin 2024. The couple shared two children.",

As of Monday afternoon, hundreds of flights had been delayed in the United States, with dozens of others canceled, according to data onFlightAware.com. TheDallas-Fort Worth area, which has seen several rounds of thunderstorms and gusting winds over the weekend and into Monday, has been themost affected by those delays, the flight tracking site said. Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, American Airlines' largest hub, said it was expecting to serve about 1.4 million travelers over the holiday. Over the weekend, lines of hundreds of people deep snaked around the airport's terminals. Delays also continued into Monday at Denver International Airport after thunderstorms caused a temporary ground stop Sunday. Officials said a Southwest Airlines flight originating from Tampa, Florida, that landed in Denver on Sunday night may have been struck by lightning; no injuries were immediately reported. It was also the first Memorial Day and major holiday travel weekend sincethe requirementthat passengers have either REAL IDs or passports for domestic flights went into effect this month. The storms Sunday produced more than 180 severe weather reports, including six preliminary tornadoes in New Mexico and Texas. Extremely large hail, some up to 6 inches, was also reported near Afton, Texas, east of Lubbock. Isolated severe weather threats are expected to continue from Texas through the Deep South and parts of Florida into Tuesday, according to forecasts. Through Memorial Day, a severe thunderstorm watch was in effect for parts of Louisiana and Mississippi. Eleven million people were at risk for damaging winds and large hail across parts of Texas, including Abilene, Austin and San Antonio; Louisiana; and Alabama. There's also a continued chance of isolated tornadoes. In addition, 12 million people remain under flood threats across the South into Tuesday morning, with the alerts stretching across the Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana regions. NBC affiliate WESH reported that thepotential for pop-up stormsMonday across Florida, a popular holiday destination, could lead to ground stops late in the day at Orlando International Airport. Officials said about a million people were expected to pass through the airport over the weekend, and the high volume could potentially lead to delays. AAAexpects a record 45.1 million peopleto travel at least 50 miles from home over the long holiday weekend. But most people — an estimated 38 million people, according to the association — are doing so by car. And they're benefiting from gas averaging $3.18 per gallon — the lowest Memorial Day price in more than four years, AAA reported. For the majority of the United States, outdoor cookouts and travel plans home should remain on track. Seasonal temperatures were anticipated across the Northeast with sun and clouds, while conditions were dry in the western third of the country.",

    "article_text": "A former Arkansas police chief serving decades in prison for first-degree murder and rape escaped from prison Sunday in a \"makeshift\" law enforcement uniform,Arkansas Department of Corrections officialssaid in a statement. Grant Hardin, 56, the former Gateway police chief, escaped at about 3:40 p.m. from the North Central Unit in Calico Rock, officials said. As of Sunday night, the search for Hardin continued. On Monday, Rand Champion, a Corrections Department spokesperson, said in aninterview with NBC affiliate KAIT of Jonesborothat the investigation is ongoing and \"using a lot of different manners,\" including canine units and drones. He added that rainy weather Monday is making the search difficult. Another challenge is Hardin's background in law enforcement, which “makes it a little bit trickier” because he may know what officers are looking for and understand their search tactics, Champion said. Champion said, however, that officials believe Hardin could be nearby. \"We feel confident based on information that we have, and just the experience of our tracking crews, that he is still fairly close to the unit,\" Champion told KAIT. Champion told the station that officials “have a fairly good timeline of what happened.” While officials did not provide details about how Hardin escaped, the statement says he \"was wearing a makeshift outfit designed to mimic law enforcement when he escaped the facility.\" \"He was not wearing a Department of Corrections uniform, and all DOC-issued equipment has been accounted for,\" the statement added. Champion said the uniform Hardin was wearing \"is not a traditional inmate-issued uniform, that's not traditional correctional officer-issued uniform, or any other uniform that we have.\" \"It is something that he put together and was able to use that to mimic a law enforcement officer to be able to leave the premises,\" Champion said, according to the station. He said officials are still looking into how Hardin was able to get materials to make the phony uniform. Hardin has been serving a 30-year sentence on first-degree murder charges at North Central Unit since 2017, as well as a 50-year sentence in a separate rape case. \"He is to be considered extremely dangerous and should not be approached,\" the Stone County Sheriff's Officesaid on social media. Hardin pleaded guilty to the murder of Gateway city water employee James Appleton, 59, inOctober 2017.Appleton was talking to his brother-in-law, then-Gateway Mayor Andrew Tillman, when he was shot in his car Feb. 23, 2017, according to an affidavit filed in the case. Hardin was the police chief of the small town near the Missouri border for about four months in early 2016. According to NBC affiliate KNWA of Fayetteville, he also previously worked as a police officer, a county constable and a corrections officer. In February 2018, a DNA sample linked Hardin to a 1997 cold case rape of teacher Amy Harrison at Frank Tillery Elementary School. Hardin pleaded guilty to the rape, as well, and was sentenced to 50 years in prison. The Corrections Department and the Division of Community Corrections are working with local, state and federal law enforcement to follow leads on Hardin's whereabouts. The search is a joint effort between the Corrections Department and Arkansas State Police. \"Officials continue to utilize a variety of means to track Hardin, as well as investigating the events that led up to his escape,\" the statement read. \"Further updates will be provided as they become available.\" Authorities ask anyone with information about Hardin's whereabouts to contact law enforcement.",

The FBI wants to revive or invest more resources into cases that Bongino said pointed to \"potential public corruption,\" including the investigation into a pair of undetonated pipe bombs left near the Democratic National Committee and Republican National Committee headquarters on Jan. 5, 2021, and thediscovery of a bag of cocaineat the White House over July 4 weekend in 2023. The third case getting renewed scrutiny is the 2022 leak of the unpublished Supreme Court Dobbs decision, which ended federal protections for abortion. Aneight month investigationinto the leak, ordered by Chief Justice John Roberts, was unable to identify the person responsible. \"Shortly after swearing in, [FBI Director Kash Patel] and I evaluated a number of cases of potential public corruption that, understandably, have garnered public interest. We made the decision to either re-open, or push additional resources and investigative attention, to these cases,\" Bongino posted on X. He continued, \"I receive requested briefings on these cases weekly and we are making progress. If you have any investigative tips on these matters that may assist us then please contact the FBI.\" NPR reached out to the FBI for additional information, but did not hear back before this story published. The pipe bomb case has remained open since the devices were discovered over four years ago. In January, theFBI released new detailsand a video showing a potential suspect leaving the pipe bombs outside the DNC and RNC buildings the night before the riot at the U.S. Capitol. Authorities said they conducted 1,000 interviews, reviewed 39,000 video files and sifted through some 600 tips — but thealleged bomberremains elusive. The White House cocaine case began when the drug was found stashed in a cubby hole near the Situation Room, where officials store cell phones during meetings. The U.S. Secret Service stopped looking for the owner of the dime bag of cocaine about 10 days after it was first discovered on July 2, 2023, citing a lack of physical evidence. Prior to taking a role at the FBI, Bongino had suggested the cocaine belonged to a member of the Biden family. A few days after it was found, hewrote on X, \"There's absolutely ZERO chance anyone other than a family member brought that cocaine inside the White House complex.\" President Biden and his family were away at the time and the West Wing is frequented by visitors and tours.

The King was met at the airport in the nation's capital, Ottawa, by dignitaries, including Canada's new prime minister,Mark Carney, and the country's first indigenous governor general, Mary Simon, who is the king's representative in Canada. Carney, who was elected on an anti-Trump platform in April, asked the king to visit shortly after he became leader of the Liberal political party. At the time, Trump had imposed tariffs on Canada and was taunting to annex the country. In a statement, Carney said the king's visit was an historic honor that matches the weight of the times. \"It speaks to our enduring tradition and friendship, to the vitality of our constitutional monarchy and our distinct identity, and to the historic ties that crises only fortify,\" Carney said. Carney and the king are due to have a meeting during the visit. Well wishers wave flags before the arrival of Britain's King Charles III and Queen Camilla at a Lansdowne Park community event in Ottawa, Canada, on Sunday.Dave Chan/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption On Tuesday, King Charles will read a speech from the throne to open a new session of Canada's parliament, the first time a monarch has done that since 1977, when Queen Elizabeth addressed the senate. It will be a largely ceremonial event, but it underlines a distinct difference in how the democracies of the U.S. and Canada differ. Canada is a constitutional monarchy and the king is the country'shead of state. The speech from the throne lays out the Canadian government's plans for the future. Although read by Charles, it will be written by Carney's office and is expected to robustly defend Canada's sovereignty — much as the prime minister did on the campaign trail. This is Charles' first trip to Canada since hewas crowned kingin 2023. An earlier trip planned for last year was cancelled after he wasdiagnosed with cancer. He has often spoken warmly about Canada and its people, calling them \"outward-looking, big-hearted people\" during a visit in May 2022. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "article_text": "Jackie Northam President Trump speaks to reporters before boarding Air Force One at Morristown Municipal Airport in Morristown, N.J., on Sunday.Manuel Balce Ceneta/APhide caption President Trump has sharply criticized President Vladimir Putin for unleashing a storm of drone and missile attacks on Ukrainian cities Sunday evening, saying he was \"not happy\" with the Russian leader defying efforts to secure a ceasefire to end the three-year war. Trump told reporters Sunday that Putin is killing a lot of people. \"I don't know what the hell happened to Putin,\" Trump said. \"I've known him a long time, always gotten along with him but he's sending rockets into cities and killing people, and I don't like it at all.\" When asked if he would consider more sanctions on Russia, Trump said \"absolutely.\" Trump went further in a social media post late Sunday, saying Putin \"has gone absolutely CRAZY!\" and was needlessly killing a lot of people. The Ukrainian Air Force said the Russian attack was the largest aerial assault of the war, with Russia unleashing355 dronesand nine cruise missiles on dozens of Ukrainian cities, including the capital, Kyiv. At least 12 people were killed and dozens injured in the attacks. The Kremlin played down Trump's remarks. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov suggested Trump's comments could be blamed on \"emotional overload,\" and thanked Trump for his efforts to end the war. \"We are really grateful to the Americans and to President Trump personally for their assistance in organizing and launching this negotiation process,\" Peskov told reporters when asked about Trump's remarks. \"Of course, at the same time, this is a very crucial moment, which is associated, of course, with the emotional overload of everyone absolutely and with emotional reactions.\" Sunday's attack followed heavy Russian bombardment on several Ukrainian cities a day earlier. More missiles rained down on Ukraine overnight into Monday. The attacks came as Russia and Ukraine carried out a prisoner exchange, but it was only a flicker of good news in the war. There has been little sign of progress in securing a ceasefire, even after a more than two-hour phone call between Trump and Putin last week.Ukraine has agreed to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire, proposed by the U.S., but Putin rejected it. Writing on social media Sunday, Trump suggested Putin has larger aspirations. \"I've always said that he wants ALL of Ukraine, not just a piece of it,\" Trump wrote. \"But if he does, it will lead to the downfall of Russia!\" Trump also had strong words for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, with whom he's had a prickly relationship. \"Everything out of his mouth causes problems.

    "title": "5 years after anti-police protests, initiatives for officer mental health have traction",
    "article_text": "By Katja Ridderbusch Jonnie Moeller-Reed is the wellness officer at the Marietta Police Department in suburban Atlanta. In her role, she oversees programs that build resiliency and help cops who struggle with stress, burnout and trauma.Katja Ridderbuschhide caption ATLANTA — A day rarely goes by when Officer Jonnie Moeller-Reed's eyes don't fall on a small, framed photograph on the bookshelf in her office. It shows two smilingyoung men in casual, colorful shirts and shorts. Both died by suicide in the past few years. Looking at the photo of her late colleagues \"is my daily reminder of what truly motivates me,\" says Moeller-Reed, her voice quivering ever so slightly. Moeller-Reed is a law enforcement veteran of 25 years and the wellness officer at the Marietta Police Department in suburban Atlanta. It's a new position the agency created a year ago. The move is part of a larger trend that's tied to the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May 2020. Waves of anti-police protests swept the country, exacerbating the already poor state of officers' mental health and bringing the issue onto a broader public radar. \"It was a catalyst moment — not just for social and racial justice in the U.S., but also for police officers' mental health,\" says Andy Carrier, a retired Georgia State Trooper and licensed clinical social worker. The widespread anti-police sentiments contributed to a wave of resignations among law enforcement officers, creating a vicious cycle of understaffed departments and overworked and burned-out cops, adds Carrier, who is also chief operatingofficer ofValor Station, a mental health treatment facility in Augusta, Ga., that exclusively serves first-responders. There had been concern for the mental health of law enforcement officers long before George Floyd became a household name. For example, officer wellness had been a pillar in the findings of President Obama's 2015 Task Force on 21st Century Policing. Research shows police officers are more likely tosuffer from cardiac deathat a much younger age than the general public. Rates ofdepression, burnoutand post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, are significantly higheramong police officers than in the civilian population. Some studies suggest that30% of cops struggle with substance abuse—alcohol dependenceis at the top of the list. In recent years, more police officers have died by suicide than were killed in the line of duty, according to the first-responder advocacy groupFirst H.E.L.P. Among the states leading officer wellness initiatives are New York, New Jersey, California and Texas, where larger public safety agencies have created dedicated wellness units and state legislatures have mandated and funded wellness initiatives for first-responders. Georgia is also among the more forward-thinking states, Carrier says. The average law enforcement officer in the United States is exposed to 188 traumatic events over the spanof their career,research suggests, compared with the average civilian adult experiencing two to three over their lifetime. There is also the cumulative stress of police work: the daily drips of violence, misery and death; the relentless staccato of calls that can spiral from mundane to dramatic in a split second. The year 2020 was \"a catalyst moment for police officers' mental health,\" says Andy Carrier, a retired Georgia State Trooper, licensed clinical social worker and chief operating officer of Valor Station in Augusta, Ga.Katja Ridderbuschhide caption \"The trauma builds up over thousands of shifts,\" says Matthew Carpenter, a former officer with the New York City Police Department, who holds a Ph.D. in behavioral science and is the co-founder of Valor Station. In addition to the job-related trauma, there are also organizational stressors, whichstudiessuggest most police officers consider to be even greater: internal investigations, staff shortages, long hours andrequired overtime work, Carpenter says. Frustration, fatigue and burnout typically hit cops at the 10- to 15-year mark on the job, Carrier adds. That's when \"innocence becomes cynicism, curiosity becomes arrogance and compassion becomes callousness,\" he says. Officer Austin Turner has been a Marietta patrol officer for close to four years. The 34-year-old has worked the evening shift for most of the time. It's typically the busiest shift, with calls ranging from domestic violence to traffic accidents to shootings. \"It's high volume, fast, back-to-back, with hardly any time to process what you've just experienced,\" Turner says. \"It takes a toll after a while.\" After four years on the job, Marietta Police Officer Austin Turner noticed that the cumulative stress of police work was making him short-tempered and appear less empathetic. He took some time off and spoke with the agency's peer support team.Katja Ridderbuschhide caption There's also the horror of one particular night that has stayed with him. In September 2022, two deputies from a neighboring agency were ambushed and killed while serving a warrant. Turner was among the responding officers, and he remembers the images of his slain colleagues. As a cop, \"if you hear a tone-out, your heart rate immediately jumps up,\" he says, referring to an alert sound during radio traffic that signals a high-priority call. Feeling increasingly burned out and on edge, Turner says, he was at times short-tempered when interacting with members of the public, and he may have come across as unempathetic. He remembers being constantly hyped up, and it took him hours to decompress when he got home. He recently took time off to spend with his family and switched from the evening shift to the day shift. He also started speaking with a member of the agency's peer support team — fellow cops who have received specialized mental health training and are legally and ethically bound to keep conversations confidential. Marietta, a 142-officer department, provides other services to help cops deal with the stressors of the job. There are mental health debriefings for officers who have been involved in a critical incident, such as a shooting or an infant death. The agency also offers Brazilian jiujitsu training. Initial data provided by the department suggest that practicing the martial art not only helpsboost officers' physical and mental health, but also enables cops to use less force during an arrest or altercation. In 2023, the department became one of the few agencies in the country to open adedicated wellness roomfor its officers. The small space is outfitted with a massage chair, dimmable lights, aromatherapy oils and a sound-immersion system. Here, cops can decompress after a stressful event or take a brief time-out during a draining shift. Wellness Officer Moeller-Reed, who holds a master's degree in forensic psychology, recently helped launch a pilot program with a local farm that offers therapeutic programs with horses. In a public safety job, \"you have to be very self-aware; you've got to be cognizant of the energy you're putting out to the public,\" she says. Interacting with animals, and horses in particular, can serve as a bellwether and teach officers self-regulation. If a horse turns away or doesn't cooperate, it tells the officer to stop and ask themselves, \"What kind of vibe am I putting off? Am I being too tense? Too aggressive? Too anxious?\" she explains. Another part of Marietta's approach to wellness is education — for recruits and working cops, as well as their families. It's impossible to truly prepare new officers for what they are going to experience once they hit the road, Moeller-Reed says. \"But you can educate them about how stress manifests itself physically and mentally, and you can teach practical coping skills.\" That's also the goal of theGeorgia Public Safety Resiliency Program, a three-day class that's mandated for recruit training in the state. It's based on a course originally designed by the U.S. Air Force and taught, with variations, across the country. The class takes a hands-on and holistic approach by addressing mental, physical, social, spiritual and financial challenges and stressors. On a crisp spring day, 89 cadets gathered in the concrete courtyard at the Georgia Public Safety Training Center in Forsyth, about 80 miles south of Atlanta\"I was happy to see the class on the schedule, because it is something we can use right away as we hit the ground running,\" said cadet Jenna Golonka. The 31-year-old has two young children and was eager to learn about work-life balance. \"I want to be present at home and in my job,\" she said. Mental health and wellness training at the police academy is important to lay a foundation of awareness, says police researcher Matthew Carpenter. But it should be reinforced throughout an officer's entire career, which often spans more than 20 years. Places like Valor Station exist for first-responders who are struggling with severe depression, anxiety, PTSD and substance abuse. The nonprofit facility opened in April, joining others in Maryland, Utah, Florida, California and Texas. Valor Station offers a month-long residential treatment program, including individual and group talk therapy, as well aseye movement desensitization and reprocessing. EMDR is proven to be particularly effective in treating military veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder. Valor Station in Augusta, Georgia is a residential treatment facility exclusively for police officers and other first responders who are struggling with PTSD, depression, substance abuse and other mental health issues. The non-profit opened in April, joining a small number of similar centers around the country.Katja Ridderbuschhide caption The stigma of seeking help for mental and emotional hardship remains a major barrier in the male-dominated world of law enforcement, Carpenter says, but it is slowly fading, as a younger generation of officers is more open to embracing the concept of mental wellness. To make an impact, therapists and counselors must be \"culturally competent,\" meaning they need to understand the world police officers operate in, Carpenter says. Otherwise, it's counterproductive. \"If, for example, a therapist puts out a bunch of crayons and tells officers to draw the river of life, most cops will say, 'Are you freaking serious?' \" he says, laughing. That's why at Valor Station, most of the clinical staff are former police officers or military veterans. Moeller-Reed says her advice to police officers who find themselves worn down after years of relentless stress is \"be honest to yourself. Realize if the job has changed you, and not in a good way.\" She briefly looks at the photograph of her two colleagues. \"We see ourselves as the fixers and the helpers and the problem solvers, and it's just hard for us to ask for help,\" she says, wearily shrugging her shoulders. \"But if we can humble ourselves to do that, I think we can save a lot of lives.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "The CFPB wanted medical debt to be left off credit reports. That's changed under Trump",
    "article_text": "Vanessa Romo A U.S. District Court judge in the Eastern District of Texas has twice ordered a stay of the medical debt rule, which was supposed to take effect on March 15. It is now delayed to start on July 28.Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Imageshide caption David Deeds is in financial trouble, and he's hoping a federal court in Texas can help get him out of it. Deeds, who is 62 and owes tens of thousands of dollars in medical debt from cancer treatment, is involved in acomplicated lawsuit filed by credit industry groupsover the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's medical debt rule. The rule,finalized in Januaryjust weeks before the end of the Biden administration,would have banned the reporting of medical debt from credit reports.At the time,the agency reported15 million Americans would benefit from the change, removing $49 billion in medical debt from records. Itwas set to go into effect in March. But new leadership appointed by President Trump now runs the CFPB. And the agency hasn't just reversed its position on the consumer protection rule — last month, itjoined forces with the plaintiffswho filed the suit trying to block it. The agency has not returned a request for comment from NPR. Over the last few months, Judge Sean Jordan from Texas' Eastern District has twice ordered a stay, delayingthe rule's start date to July 28. He is likely to make a ruling on whether or not to vacate it by mid-June. The outcome of the suit, filed on the same day the rule was issued, has important financial implications for Deeds, as well as the millions more whose medical debt has negatively impacted their credit scores. \"My credit was and is very important to me, because it is necessary to secure housing, transportation, and employment, and make sure that I'm never homeless again,\" Deeds said in anaffidavitfiled on Feb. 24, by a consumer advocacy group intervening in the lawsuit. In 2023, Deeds was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer — and found himself in a situation he had sworn to never be in again. A decade prior, at age 50, he had been homeless, he wrote in his affidavit. But in the years that followed, he turned things around: With a home and a truck-driving job, he built himself a safety net. And there was a tangible marker of that effort: His credit score had soared from abysmal to officially \"good,\" he said. But his cancer put him out of work, and his health insurance was insufficient to cover the medical bills from several surgeries, he wrote. The money he'd saved over the years quickly dwindled, leaving several outstanding bills — one of which ended up on his credit report. His credit score dropped into the 500s. \"Once my financial troubles started, the situation just avalanched,\" Deeds wrote. The medical debt rule appeared like a lifeline. But it might be short-lived. In a motion filed at the end of April, CFPB, the defendant, joined the plaintiffs, the Consumer Data Industry Association and the Cornerstone Credit Union League, to \"request that the Court enter a final judgment holding unlawful and vacating the Medical Debt Rule because it exceeds the Bureau's statutory authority.\" \"We believe that Congress is the only one who can act on this and determine whether or not it can be on the credit report,\" Dan Smith, CEO and president of the Consumer Data Industry Association, told NPR. \"Our intention here is to protect the credit reporting system. To ensure that it is as complete and accurate as possible,\" he said. Borrowing and lending are all part of the same ecosystem, Smith said. \"And so if there are certain data that is prohibited from being included, then the lender is unable to make a fair and accurate assessment of a consumer's ability to repay a loan. And the entire premise of the credit reporting system is to help facilitate more lending to all consumers.\" A comprehensive picture of a person's financial status is beneficial to both lenders and borrowers, he stressed. Anything short of that \"puts the consumer at risk of default unnecessarily. You do not want to put a consumer into a loan they can't afford,\" Smith added. In the lawsuit, the groups note that the three largest credit bureaus — Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax — have already adoptedsignificant policy changesin removing medical collection items from reports. They no longer list paid medical debts, unpaid medical debt less than a year old (up from the previous benchmark of six months) or medical collections under $500. Various advocacy groups have taken up the mantle on behalf of consumers. On May 9, Jordan granted a request by the National Consumer Law Center to represent Deeds and Harvey Coleman, a father from the District of Columbia who has been mired in medical expenses stemming from his daughter's illness, among others. \"The prior version of the agency went through a tremendous amount of work and process and time and consideration to put the rule in place,\" Jennifer Wagner, an attorney with the National Consumer Law Center, told NPR. The formal rulemaking process took about two years to complete, beginning in 2023. Over that time, more than74,000 people weighed in with public comments, which Wagner said included feedback from the American Hospital Association, the American Medical Association and the American Cancer Society, all supporting the rule. The CFPB also conducted several studies before moving to finalize the rule. The most recent one,from 2024, concluded that \"medical debt may be less predictive of whether a consumer will pay a future loan, because medical debts can occur and are collected through unique circumstances and practices. For example, consumers often have limited ability to control the timing and types of medical services that are required.\" A2014CFPB study found that eliminating medical debt from records would lead to the approval of approximately 22,000 additional affordable mortgages every year and boost credit scores by an average of 20 points. (Smith and other groups who oppose the rule note that the data that was used in the 2014 study came before the big three credit reporting bureaus voluntarily changed medical debt reporting practices.) Wagner also pushed back on the CFPB's assertion that the previous agency exceeded its authority. On the contrary, she argued, the agency's new leaders are trying to eschew the guidelines set by the Administrative Procedures Act, by pursuing litigation rather than going through \"the appropriate notice-and-comment rulemaking.\" As of 2024, abouta dozen states have existing regulations prohibiting or limiting certain effects of medical debtin some form, according to Third Way, a center-left think tank. For example, Arizonarestricts debt collectors' ability to garnish wages, including for medical debt. In Connecticut, state leaders have established aprogram that buys medical debtfrom collection agencies and hospitals for a penny on the dollar. A law in Minnesotaprohibits hospitals from sending bills to collectionsuntil they have screened patients for coverage or financial assistance. AndCalifornia,New Yorkand Colorado have already banned most kinds of medical debt from being included in credit reports. In light of the current hodgepodge of differing laws, Wagner said, a federal medical debt rule \"basically just levels the playing field across the country.\" \"So instead of people in New York and California getting the benefits of not having medical debt show up on their credit report, it's going to bring in people all throughout the country — in West Virginia and Alabama — where people could really benefit from this as well.\" But credit trade groups contend that, similar to the CFPB bypassing Congress, state legislators have also overstepped their authority. For now, millions of people remain in credit score limbo, including David Deeds, whose score in the 500s is considered somewhere between \"poor\" and \"fair.\" Sarah Chenven, CEO of Working Credit, a nonprofit that helps consumers build or repair their credit scores, told NPR that even the difference of one or two points could add up to thousands of dollars over the life of a loan. \"If you're on the wrong side of the line, then things are just going to be more expensive. So, if you get a car loan, you're going to get a car loan at 25% interest rather than 5%. And that's going to cost you $200 to $300 more a month … we call it expense inequality: paying more for products that should cost less,\" Chenven explained. People whose credit scores are below 600 are considered a bad risk for lenders. \"They often do not have access to any financial products … the only options available to you are going to be more predatory products,\" she said. The holy grail for many of her clients, she said, is a FICO Score of 660. \"It's really only when you get to that prime credit score that you see any kind of material impact in your life,\" Chenven said. \"That's when you start to see better rates. That's when you start to have access to better options for housing. That's when you have more options and opportunities to pursue your financial goals.\" It's possible that consumers could see a jump in their scores in just a few weeks. Judge Sean Jordan is expected to make a ruling on whether or not to vacate the medical debt rule by June 11. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "article_text": "Quil Lawrence Iraq war veteran Irving Webb moves his belongings as sanitation workers clear the sidewalk, where he spent some nights in April, outside the Los Angeles VA campus.Quil Lawrence/NPRhide caption On a cool weekday morning last month, just steps away from some of California's fanciest boutiques and bistros, Irving Webb was desperately trying to break camp as sanitation workers with shovels cleared the sidewalk he's been living on for the last few nights. The Iraq war veteran sweated through his white T-shirt, heaving his belongings into a shopping cart. \"I've been here for five years,\" he says, \"and they're freaking killing me. This is like the fifth time in the last month.\" \"Here\" is outside the gate of the VA's sprawling West LA campus. Los Angeles has the highest number of homeless veterans in the country — which is surprising, since it's also got a massive, 388-acre Veterans Affairs campus that was donated in 1888 as a soldiers' home. In recent decades though, it's been used for somequestionable leases, includingathletic fields for the private Brentwood School and UCLA's baseball stadium. Lawsuits have forced the VA to start building housing, but it's been slow. Political pressure resulted in a sort of refugee camp temporary shelter on a parking lot inside the gates. If those tiny homes are full, overflow beds get assigned as available. \"I used to do that all the time. It doesn't work for me. This is what works for me,\" says Webb, even as his camp gets swept off the sidewalk and into a garbage truck. \"You'll have veterans that show up in the evening, and there's not enough room. There's nowhere for them to go,\" said Rob Reynolds, an Iraq veteran and advocate for LA's homeless vets. It's often the neediest veterans that are hardest to help, Reynolds said. He says if the VA had moved faster building housing on the property there would be more options for vets of different eras, or with problems like mental illness or substance abuse. \"Housing on this property is very important for some people that have severe disabilities because they can be right next to the hospital. They can be right next to where they get their mental health care,\" he said. Tiny homes sit adjacent to what was previously Veterans Row on the campus of the West Los Angeles Veterans Affairs Medical Center in October 2023.Alex Welsh for NPRhide caption Now anexecutive order from the White House on May 9has given Reynolds new hope that the housing could finally be coming. \"The VA campus in West Los Angeles will become the National Center for Warrior Independence with facilities and resources to help our veterans earn back their self-sufficiency,\"the order reads. It directs the VA secretary to create a plan within 60 days to house 6,000 veterans on the campus by 2028. But the order came without consultation with Los Angeles VA officials, according to three current and former government employees who spoke to NPR on condition of anonymity in order to discuss internal communications. VA spokesman Pete Kasperowicz said details would be forthcoming but did not answer specific questions. One detail that is included in the order plan has raised questions. The number, 6,000 veterans, is about twice the current number of homeless vets in LA. It's not clear if that means the Trump administration might use the LA campus to house veterans from across the country. In the pastVA officials opposedputting so many troubled veterans – even just from LA – in one place. They said it could be likeredlining, and make the campus into a sort of ghetto, where no one would want to live. Democrat Brad Sherman, who represents West LA in Congress, says the lack of specifics makes him doubt the order is serious. For example, the order says the construction will be paid for with \"funds that may have been spent on housing or other services for illegal aliens.\" A mural dedicated to veterans near the campus of the West Los Angeles Veterans Affairs Medical Center in October 2023.Alex Welsh for NPRhide caption \"It seems like just kind of a campaign press release saying President Trump loves veterans and hates undocumented immigrants,\" said Sherman. Many of the delays to construction on the VA campus were legal issues with the VA getting into the housing business. Advocates in LA have raised funds throughpublic-private partnershipsthat have taken years to put together. Sherman said he'll be pleased if the Trump administration does fund more construction. \"I hope very much that he comes forward with a plan to provide what could be as much as $3.3 billion to build 6,000 units of housing,\" he said. Reynolds, the Iraq vet and advocate, embraced the news. \"The executive order is the morally correct thing to do. There's no reason that we should have thousands of veterans sleeping on the streets of Los Angeles when we have nearly 400 acres of land that was donated to house them, so I'm very thankful that President Trump took this position,\" said Reynolds. While they await the fine print, advocates in LA are dreaming that their larger plans for the campus could be fully funded – which include not just getting vets off the streets, but services and long-term housing in a real neighborhood with parks and stores and a stop on the metro. \"We don't care who takes credit as long as it's done properly,\" said Steve Peck, with the West LA Veterans Collective. In the background, another effort to build housing on the campus is still playing out. Last year a judgeordered the VA to immediately build hundredsof new temporary housing units. But then the government appealed, and a three judge panel of the Ninth Circuitheard arguments in April. So far the Trump administration has not dropped the government's appeal, which demands less than half the housing units just mandated by the executive order. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "The European Space Agency will beam the famous 'Blue Danube' waltz into space",
    "article_text": "Rebecca Hersher A European Space Agency antenna located at Cebreros, near Avila, Spain, will transmit the waltz into space.ESAhide caption Johann Strauss II's popular orchestral piece \"By the Beautiful Blue Danube\" has been inextricably linked to space since it wasused in the 1968 classic film2001: A Space Odyssey. The waltz played as a fictional spaceship docks with a space station, with expansive views of the Earth and the distant stars. This week, the piece will take a more literal place among the stars when the European Space Agency broadcasts it into space. On Saturday, the Vienna Symphony Orchestra will perform the piece live, while a radio antenna in Spain beams the music out. The \"Blue Danube\" broadcast is celebrating the 50th anniversary of the ESA's creation, as well as 200 years since Strauss' birth. The waltz was notably absent when NASA launched27 pieces of music, as well as other sounds and images, on matching \"Golden Records\" on the Voyager 1 and 2 missions in 1977. The Voyager 1 probe is the first human-made object to leave the solar system. Both probes arestill flying out into deep space today. The ESA says it aims to rectify that historical overlook. \"The absence of the most famous of all waltzes from the 1977 Voyager Golden Record is a cosmic mistake,\" Norbert Kettner, the director of the Vienna Tourist Board, said in a statement. Strauss was from Austria, and the Vienna Tourist Board is helping the space agency arrange the broadcast. A piece by another famous Austrian composer, Mozart, was included on the Voyager Golden Record. The radio antenna in Spain where the piece is being broadcast is about 115 feet across, and is operated by the ESA. It supports uncrewed European missions to study the surface of Mars, create a map of the stars and take up-close pictures of the sun. On Saturday, it will take a break from that work. The Vienna Symphony Orchestra's performance will belivestreamed online. The audio of the performance will be converted into an electromagnetic wave. That wave, which is not audible to humans, will be transmitted into space at the speed of light, in the direction of Voyager 1. The music will be moving so quickly that it will overtake the probe, which was launched in 1977 and left the solar system in 2012, in just 23 hours. \"This demonstrates that our technology can transmit not only scientific data but also human art over long distances,\" said Josef Aschbacher, the director general of the ESA, in an announcement about the broadcast. This is not the first time humans have beamed music deep into space. Last year,NASA sentthe Missy Elliott song \"The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly)\"to Venus. And in 2008, NASA celebrated its 50th anniversary bysending \"Across the Universe\"by The Beatles into deep space. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "The key to a successful egg drop experiment? Drop it on its side",
    "article_text": "Eggs are less likely to crack when dropped horizontally vs. vertically, contradicting conventional wisdom. Egg drop competitions are a staple of high school and college physics classes. The goal is for students to build a device using bubble wrap, straws, or various other materials designed to hold an egg and keep it intact after being dropped from a substantial height—say, ten meters (nearly 33 feet). There's even a \"naked egg\" version in which a raw egg is dropped into a container below.  The competition is intended to teach students about structural mechanics and impact physics, and it is not an easy feat; most of the dropped eggs break. MIT engineering professor Tal Cohen decided to investigate why the failure rate was so high and reported her team's findings ina paperpublished in the journal Communications Physics. \"The universal convention is that the egg should be in a vertical orientation when it hits the ground,\"Cohen told Physics Magazine. But their results from controlled trials simulating the egg drop challenge in the lab calls this conventional wisdom into question. It is not an unreasonable assumption to make. Another popular physics party trick is to walk on several cartons of eggs without breaking them. Typically it only takes about five and a half pounds of force to crack a single eggshell, much less than the average adult human. As Iwrote for Slateback in 2012, \"The key is to align the eggs so that the narrow pole is pointing upward, and step in such a way to distribute your weight over the entire surface area, to avoid overloading any one eggshell.\" (Being barefoot also helps.) In fact, I noted at the time a surprisingly long history of scientific studies of eggshells and how cracks propagate, particularly in the 1950s and 1960s, when they served as useful models for failure analysis when building airplanes. The toughness comes from the egg shell's structure; it is made up mostly of calcium carbonate (calcite) crystals, similar to tooth enamel or sea shells,  embedded within a protein matrix. The egg shell is strengthened further by a thin inner collagen layer. This tends to keep damage localized as cracks spread little by little rather than one clean break. Cohen et al. give a shoutout in their introduction to Jonathan Swift'sGulliver's Travels, specifically the longstanding quarrel between the people of Lilliput and Blefuscu on the best orientation for cracking an egg. Of course, there is the classic chef's one-handed egg-cracking technique—immortalizedin the 1954 romantic comedy,Sabrina—which involves holding the egg between the fingers and thumb and rapping the edge sharply against the rim of the bowl to achieve a clean break. Alas, this usually ends in a crushed eggy mess when attempted by amateurs. (Practicing with a golf ball can improve one's skill.) MIT scientists have previously studied precisely how much force to apply to the center of an egg. Specifically, the scientists devised a mathematical formula linking the ovoid geometry of the eggshell and its rigidity—a property that, along with strength (a related but distinct concept), accounts for how much force a given object can withstand before breaking. It's the narrow tip that is the most crack-resistant part of the egg, since the shell becomes more rigid the more the egg curves. That's why pressing down on both the bottom and top of an egg with your fingers won't work. But turn the egg horizontally and press right at the center, and the shell cracks easily. So what's going on with these latest MIT findings? To find out, Cohen et al. bought 180 chicken eggs—Costco's Kirkland Signature brand— and conducted their own egg drop experiments in the lab. They dropped 60 eggs each from three different heights (8, 9, and 10 millimeters) onto a hard surface in three different orientations: horizontal, vertical on the sharp end, and vertical on the blunt end. They also subjected an additional 60 eggs to compression tests to determine the force required to break the eggs in both the vertical and horizontal orientations. The results: over half of the eggs broke when dropped vertically from an 8-millimeter (31-inch) height, regardless of which end of the egg was pointing downwards. Yet less than ten percent of the horiztonally-dropped eggs broke. The eggs broke when the force exceeded 45 Newtons, an impressive per-egg load bearing capacity that is independent of its orientation. There was a key difference, however, between how vertically and horizontally  squeezed eggs deformed in the compression experiments—namely, the former deformed less than the latter. The shell's greater rigidity along its long axis was an advantage because the heavy load was distributed over the surface. (It's why the one-handed egg-cracking technique targets the center of a horizontally held egg.) But the authors found that this advantage when under static compression proved to be a disadvantage when dropping eggs from a height, with the horizontal position emerging as the optimal orientation.  It comes down to the difference between stiffness—how much force is needed to deform the egg—and toughness, i.e., how much energy the egg can absorb before it cracks. Cohen et al.'s experiments showed that eggs are tougher when loaded horizontally along their equator, and stiffer when compressed vertically, suggesting that \"an egg dropped on its equator can likely sustain greater drop heights without cracking,\" they wrote. \"Even if eggs could sustain a higher force when loaded in the vertical direction, it does not necessarily imply that they are less likely to break when dropped in that orientation. In contrast to static loading, to remain intact following a dynamic impact, a body must be able to absorb all of its kinetic energy by transferring it into reversible deformation.\" \"Eggs need to be tough, not stiff, in order to survive a fall,\" Cohen et al. concluded, pointing to our intuitive understanding that we should bend our knees rather than lock them into a straightened position when landing after a jump, for example. \"Our results and analysis serve as a cautionary tale about how language can affect our understanding of a system, and improper framing of a problem can lead to misunderstanding and miseducation.\" DOI: Communications Physics, 2025.10.1038/s42005-025-02087-0(About DOIs).

    "title": "Where hyperscale hardware goes to retire: Ars visits a very big ITAD site",
    "article_text": "Watching memory DIMMs get sorted likeWonkachildren inside SK TES' facility. \"The biggest risk is data escape.\" Eric Ingebretsen, chief commercial officer atSK TES, an IT asset disposition provider, tells me this early on during a tour of a 128,000-square-foot facility in Fredericksburg, Virginia. He will restate this a few times. A big part of this site's pitch to its clients, including the \"hyperscale\" customers with gigantic data centers nearby, is that each device is labeled, tracked, and inventoried for its drives—both obvious and hidden—and is either securely wiped or destroyed. The process, commonly called ITAD, is used by larger businesses, especially when they upgrade fleets of servers or workers' devices. ITAD providers ensure all the old gear is wiped clean, then resold, repurposed, recycled, or destroyed. In keeping with the spirit of client confidentiality, I could not take photos or videos during my visit, record our talks, or capture anything beyond what I could scribble in my notepad. (The images in this post are provided by SK TES and were not taken during my visit). I did, however, see some intriguing things and learn about what happens to all the drives and rack-mounted gear we call \"the cloud\" once anything gets more than a few years old. The loading docks at SK's facility are essentially divided into two: one section for thehyperscalersand one for everything else. SK is discreet about its clients, but given itsnorthern Virginia location, you can make some guesses about some of the online-selling, search-result-providing, software-providing firms this site is servicing. Pallets arrive in big, shrink-wrapped squares, as tall as my shoulders, with break-once security seals. Each device has its serial number assigned to an asset tag, one that will follow that unit through the whole facility. Laptops and desktops head to a retail station on a long roller line. At that spot, workers—the kind exceedingly familiar with all the BIOS startup keys—run an automatedBlanccosystem to reset them at the firmware level. Workers sometimes have to dig deeper, like getting into a switch or router with SSH or undoing a RAID setup to enable programmed wiping. The details of each unit—CPU, memory, HDD size—are taken down and added to the asset tag, and the device is sent on to be physically examined. This step is important because \"many a concealed drive finds its way into this line,\" Kent Green, manager of this site, told me. Inside the machines coming from big firms, there are sometimes little USB, SD, SATA, or M.2 drives hiding out. Some were make-do solutions installed by IT and not documented, and others were put there by employees tired of waiting for more storage. \"Some managers have been pretty surprised when they learn what we found,\" Green said. With everything wiped and with some sense of what they're made of, each device gets a rating. It's a three-character system, like \"A-3-6,\" based on function, cosmetic condition, and component value. Based on needs, trends, and other data, devices that are cleared for resale go to either wholesale, retail, component harvesting, or scrap. If a device has retail value, it heads into a section of this giant facility where workers do further checks. Automated software plays sounds on the speakers, checks that every keyboard key is sending signals, and checks that laptop batteries are at 80 percent capacity or better. At the end of the line is my favorite discovery: full-body laptop skins. Some laptops—certain Lenovo, Dell, and HP models—are so ubiquitous in corporate fleets that it's worth buying an adhesive laminating sticker in their exact shape. They're an uncanny match for the matte black, silver, and slightly less silver finishes of the laptops, covering up any blemishes and scratches. Watching one of the workers apply this made me jealous of their ability to essentially reset a laptop's condition (so one could apply whole new layers of swag stickers, of course). Once rated, tested, and stickered, laptops go into a clever \"cradle\" box, get the UN 3481 \"battery inside\" sticker, and can be sold through retail. That includes buyers of reconditioned hard drives, and boy, are there a lot of drives moving through this site. Once a drive is verified through its SMART data to be worth grading and refurbishing, it's put into one of more than two dozen wiping bays, each holding about 192 drives (with a special bay handling some M.2 and other non-HDD sizes). If the bays were completely full, 5,632 drives could be wiped concurrently. The month before I visited, the site had processed about 58,000 drives, according to Ingebretsen. There are also stacks and stacks of memory and CPUs in this non-retail corner of the site. I walked by one box labeled \"SR1Y5\" (i.e., Intel Xeon E5-2676 v3 chips), and he confirmed there were 3,600 units inside. Nearby, in the memory-testing section, I find the memory machine that will stick in my own memory the rest of my life: theRoboFlex-II Handler. You drop RAM DIMMs or SODIMMs into one of its two bays, and it tests the pins on each stick. Each stick is rated \"Good\" or \"Bad\" and kicked in the appropriate direction by a 90-PSI air blast. I asked the workers at this station if they think aboutthe entirely relevant scene fromWilly Wonka & the Chocolate Factory. They do, and quite often. Where does all this stuff go? SK TES sells retail devices like laptops, desktops, and mobile devices through its\"Stock Must Go\" brandon eBay and elsewhere. Chips and memory are typically bought up by laboratories, crypto miners, data centers, and a lot of high-volume overseas customers. There are steady enterprise customers for the drives, usually putting them back into datacenters. It's something like $2.5 million in sales each month, an SK TES representative told me. Credit:\n\n          \n          SK TES The other business—the thing that makes ITAD \"disposition\" instead of just \"refurbishing\"—is dismantling and handing off devices for shredding.The Financial Times has reported that Amazon and Microsofthave100 percent data shredding policies, with Google also shredding much of its drive turnover.The US National Renewable Energy Laboratoryestimated in 2022that by 2025, roughly 50 million end-of-life data center drives would be shredded every year. ITAD businesses like SK TESmake the pitchthat companies can create revenue to reinvest in operations through offering gear for refurbishment. SK TES representatives told me that most of the Virginia site's customers are \"focused on reuse,\" while \"a small portion\" of equipment is shredded and sent off-site to be recycled. The site, built on the guts of a mattress factory, was put up specifically to handle the high volumes of server racks and HDDs coming in from data centers. It has a staff of 165, though it fluctuates a bit between big server hauls and downtime. The full-fledged site had been open one year when I visited. The biggest challenge, Ingebretsen told me, was getting power everywhere it needed to go inside the facility as volume fluctuated and needs expanded. Data centers are massive and growing, to the point of creating entire sub-industries that employ dozens of people to handle their tech turnover. The Northern Virginia Technology Council industry group puts this region's data center growth at500 percent between 2015 and 2023, and it continues, thoughsome pushback is happening. Many data centers were accessed to allow me to navigate to SK TES's site via Apple Maps and write this post, and for you to read it. It reminds me of the adage—made popular by the CEO of GPS maker TomTom—that you are not stuck in traffic, you are the traffic. After my tour, I got my phone back from security, talked a bit with Ingebretsen, then headed out to my car. I spent a few minutes jotting down the most notable things I'd seen inside, then looked up and out the windshield. There was a black tarp wrapped around a chain-link fence of the lot next door, with logos announcing the construction of a new data center. Data centers are everywhere—and nowhere in particular.

From Viking fare in Berk to lab concoctions in the Dark Universe, here are some of the most outrageous things we tried. Okay, we had to try the DK Crush Float because we needed to get the barrel mug it came in. Never mind the tasteâwhich was a pungent pineapple soda and banana ice-cream assault on the palette. You’ll feel like you got the barrel cracked open into your mouth along with it, complete with caramel popcorn pieces and shards of chocolate. It’s a lot. But if those flavors are your thing, you do you. Special mention: there’s a plant-based green shell for vegan representation. Hands down the best handy meal at Epic Universe: the mac and cheese cones at Hooliganâs Grog & Gruel. They come in various combination toppings including Goldfish crackers, PB&J (pork, bacon and jam), and Dragon Fire Chicken (spicy). They’re incredible and easy to eat. Special mention: The Mead Hall’s Yaknog, which is basically a cinnamon forwardicedhot chocolate, and Stormflyâs Catch of the Day, a decorated chocolate mousse filled fish (just the shape, not the flavor) served on a bed of colorful crispy cereal (think Fruity Pebbles). The Burning Blade is the most metal themed food location in the park. It’s a fun, themed tavern with drinks that pay homage to the Universal Monsters. The Monocaine mocktail is fizzy and greenâand is inspired by what turns the Invisible Man invisible. It also comes in a souvenir lab beaker and does not in fact make you invisible enough to rideMonsters Unchainedmultiple times. Special mention: the Frankenstein’s Monster head-shaped pretzel that comes with a white cheese dipping sauce, available atÂ  De Lacey’s Cottage. (We brought it into the Burning Blade Tavern for photo purposes.) The Pizza Moon locale is a delightfully tasty and gorgeous spot withA Trip to the Moonaesthetics, where you can keep cool and eat some darn good pizza pies. We loved the Pizza Lunare, which features a purple ube crusted dough and is topped with melty bÃ©chamel, fromage de lune ricotta, pancetta, and roasted garlic.

    "title": "‘The Last of Us’ Showrunners Talk That Shocking Cliffhanger and Season 3 Teases",
    "article_text": "The wait betweenseasons one and two ofThe Last of Uswas brutal, but at least that story had ended. We wanted to see what was next for Joel and Ellie, but it wasn’t absolutely necessary. That’snot the case for season two, though, which ends right smack in the middle of the story, with a cliffhanger that’s sure to frustrate many viewers. It’s all but assured thatthe wait for season three will be worse. In the meantime, you are probably wondering a few things about not just the end of season two, but what’s to come in season three. And, thankfully, showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann were happy to talk about that. Below, we’ll tell you whatThe Last of Usteam had to say about the season two cliffhanger, whether that was always the ending, how things might be changing for season three, and some of the questions you should be asking as you wait. Season two ofThe Last of Usends in the middle of a key moment between Ellie and Abby before flashing back a few days to Abby. The implication, much as it is in the video game, is that we are about to see Abby’s story moving ahead, and that’s absolutely the plan. “We often talk about what are we promising the audience going forward?” Druckmann said in a press conference. “So, for example, it was important for Craig in episode five that we show Joel in that last scene, because then there’s a promise of where we’re going to next. And had we ended the season somewhere else, maybe like a few moments before, I think that we wouldn’t be making the right promise of what this is about. And we’re telling you next season, well, one is that there’s just an epic nature to what’s about to happen. But this other story is going to be really important coming back to Joel and Ellie and everything that you’ve seen so far.” In the game, though, the audience has a natural pain and discomfort when the point of view shifts from Ellie, a character you have been playing as, to then playing as her sworn enemy, Abby. Mazin admits it’s one place a show comes up short compared to the video game but they hope they did as good a job as possible to duplicate it. “We can’t… reproduce the shock of becoming another person,” he said. “In games, you are Joel. You are Ellie. You are Abby. And when that shift happens, it is jarring because you have been someone. But here we are watching everybody equally on a screen. We may identify with them from time to time in different ways, and we may be conflicted, but we’re not them. So when we go to a scene where we’re somebody else, there’s the normal thing of, ‘Whoa, I’m suddenly with Jeffrey Wright in a weird, creepy kitchen. And I’m watching him torture somebody.’ That’s a little jarring, but it’s never going to be what a video game can do when you shift perspective in a massive way like that. So I think what we do, and what we’re doing correctly, is honoring the notion that there is a time period where one person experiences it one way, and another person is experiencing it so wildly different, and yet they converge. It’s a convergent storm… And that’s what matters. But can we reproduce that gut-punch feeling? No. And I think if we had chased it, we probably would have fallen on our faces.” So if the show couldn’t match that moment in the same way, was there ever a discussion of changing things? Maybe ending it differently? There was, but not for long. “Honestly, we were open to a different ending,” Mazin admitted. “We talked about it a lot. We considered everything. Of course, you want to play around. Like maybe we should just interlace the stories. Maybe we should just go back and forth. Maybe we should try this. Maybe we should try that. And then in the end, I just remember saying, ‘Isn’t this part of the genetics of how this story functions?’ It’s just part of the genetics. Now, what it means is we have to take risks as a television show and HBO has to back us taking risks. But then again, we did just kill Pedro Pascal. They understand that this show is going to be a different show every season, which is sort of a tricky thing to do when you’re a hit show. You keep asking people like, ‘I know you love this. We’re taking it away and giving you this now.’ And then hopefully they go, ‘Oh, well, you know what? We actually really like this.’ ‘Oh, that’s nice. Now we’re giving you this now’ because that’s how the story works.” And so, in season three, the point of view will certainly shift to Abby. But, does that mean Bella Ramsey’s Ellie won’t be in season three? “I remember when people were asking about season two, they were like, ‘And what about Joel and when he dies?’ I’m like, ‘Whoa, whoa, whoa. What do you mean ‘When?’ ‘If!'” Mazin says. “The [third] season will arrive, and it will do what it does. Even if I thought I knew now exactly how it was going to go. I’m experienced enough to know that two weeks from now, we may have a different idea of how it should go. All I can say is we haven’t seen the last of Kaitlyn Dever, we haven’t seen the last of Bella Ramsey, we haven’t seen the last of Isabela Merced, and we haven’t even seen the last of a lot of people who are currently dead in the story.” Druckmann added, “Whether you will see them on screen or not, their presence will be there throughout.” Finally, season two may have focused on Ellie’s story, and season three might focus on Abby’s, but so much else is happening too. There’s Isaac and the WLF. The Serephites. Their war. And Mazin wants fans to be aware of all of that. “I think [all those other stories] bode well for next season,” he said. “I have so many questions and I think and I understand that the audience does too. I sort of want to assure them that those questions are correct and will be answered. ‘What is going on? How did that war start? How did the Seraphites start? Who is the prophet? What happened to her? What does Isaac want? What’s happening at the end of episode seven? What is this explosion? What is all of it?’ All of it will become clear.” When specifically? We don’t know. In 2027 perhaps?

    "article_text": "This article is part of Gizmodo Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. Dyson is compared to Apple on a regular basis for a reason: Both brands have built their businesses onreputations for innovation, design excellence and an image of prestigethat sets them apart from the pack. Similar to Apple, Dyson rarely offers discounts on its products and it rather opts to present an image of premium and pricing strategy that adds strength to the value and appeal of its products. That is the strategy which renders genuine deals on Dyson products rare, even during gigantic sale events like Black Friday. For a brief moment in time, this high-tech hair dryer can befound on Amazon for $399, which is $100 less than its standard price of $499. This is anall-time record low price, and it’s a one-time chance for anyone who’s considered purchasing a premium hair styling device. See at Amazon Dyson Supersonic hair dryer is the “crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me” of Dyson hair care technology. What sets it apart from others is its ability to adapt and evolve based on your individual styling patterns. With smart attachments pre-programmed with recommended airflow and temperature, the Supersonic takes much of the guesswork out of styling.The settings can be fully personalized and the tool remembers themso you get the same tailored experience every time you style with it. You will love the Supersonic Wave+Curl diffuser which has two modes to suit different hair types and styling outcomes. On Dome mode, air is drawn into the dome and dispersed throughout the hair for natural waves or curls for a defined and sleeker finish. This is great for that person who wants to embrace their natural texture and achieve professional-grade results at home. With Diffuse mode, air is gently diffused through longer prongs, penetrating deeper into hair to create textured, voluminous curls and coils. The Hyperdymium motor creates a powerful jet of focused air athigh velocity, quickly and efficiently drying your hair without having to overheat. That is crucial since excessive heat can ruin your hair, dry it out, and remove shine. The Supersonic Nural also featuresDyson’s Air Multiplier technology that draws in air from its surroundings and amplifies airflow by three times. It also constantlytracks the temperature of the air and controls it accordingly to prevent excessive heat exposure. This maintains the natural shine of your hair intact and reduces the risk of heat damage to a minimum which makes it a perfect choice for a person who likes to style their hair frequently or has hair health problems. All else equal, the Dyson Supersonic Nural Hair Dryer on Amazon for $399 is a deal that’s hard to beat. At its all-time low price point, it’s an opportunity to buy one of the most highly-rated and prestigious hair dryers available for sale at a significant discount.

    "title": "The Cast of ‘Rick and Morty’ on That Mind-Warping Season 8 Premiere",
    "article_text": "Rick and Mortykicked off itseighth seasonlast night on Adult Swim. While “Summer of All Fears” did frame itself around why it’sveryimportant to return a borrowed phone charger, it was really about several other themes that run much deeperâin grandRick and Mortyfashion. Early in the episode we learn that Rick has imprisoned Summer and Morty in aMatrix-style simulation as punishment for taking his phone charger. It’s classic Rick to use wild science to overreact to something so petty, but less expected was the fact that he accidentally left his grandkids brain-jacked into another reality for the equivalent of 17 years. On the outside world, it’s been the length of a drunken Rick nap. But when Summer and Morty emerge, they’ve bothlivedthose yearsâyes, they were virtual; yes, there sure was an awful lot of talk about phone chargersâand have the equivalent emotional damage to go with that. Morty is more haunted than Summer; his simulated life involved a prison stint, then military service complicated by a growing attachment to his squad mates. Even worse, he had to endure being repeatedly killed in battle and regenerating, with the agony of watching his friends die (and stay dead) until he was the last man standing. Summer, however, quickly figures out that to crack Rick’s matrix, she’s going to have to make phone chargers obsolete inside the simulated world. It takes 17 years, but she does it, and emerges from the experience feeling like a confident 34-year-old tech CEO. Beth encourages Rick to let the kids hold onto their memories when they first emergeâsomething he advises againstâand for a good chunk of the episode, we see what happens when the siblings are restored to their teen bodies, but with their new “life experiences” intact. Summer, who immediately recreates the short haircut she had as a thirtysomething, handles things pretty well at first. “I love that she is able to think on her feet and that the character can adapt to any given set of circumstances,” voice actor Spencer Grammer told io9 at a recentRick and Mortypress day. “And eventually, basically topples over Rick’s intentionality in some way, right? Like she always is a foil to his evil in some ways. And also saves them too. I think that’s been my favorite thing [about playing Summer], trying to play her in such a way that she feels like she is figuring it out like in the moment, but just happens to be very good at doing it. That’s probably been my favorite part of her.” Though Summer and Morty have a healthy amount of sibling rivalry,Rick and Mortyfans have seen over the years that they usually end up having each other’s backs in the end. Harry Belden, who plays Morty, jokingly chalked that up to “trauma bonding,” since they both get put through the wringer being part of Rick’s adventures. That bond serves the characters well when Morty’s lingering “Summer of All Fears” shell shock drives him to very nearly blow up the closest nuclear power plant. Summer stops him by coming clean about just how manipulative she was of his experiences in the matrix. She had to be, she explains, because she was desperately trying to figure out how they could escape. âIsn’t that whatever great sibling relationship isâlike, you’ve survived your parents, the experience of your parents. So somehow you are bonded in that no matter what. Even if you end up becoming very different people, no matter what you share that experience [of] trying to figure out how to be human beings,âGrammer said.âOddly, Summer and Morty are very capable at being adults, it seemsâwell, maybe not so much Morty in that episode, but he was sacrificed [in “Summer of All Fears”] for their good. And she takes responsibility for that, which I think is the biggest thing about being a grown-up is that you do make mistakes, but you take responsibility for them and you ask for forgiveness.â She added, “It’s nice to be able to show that. It’s a pretty in-depth, meaningful episode for the first episode of the season. We have some lighter ones as we go along, but [the premiere is] a pretty interesting take on what we all go throughâand, you know, capitalism at large.âÂ For Belden’s part, “I want to see the venting sessions between Morty and Summer [about] all the horrible things Rick has done to them that we haven’t seen on screen.” Elsewhere in “Summer of All Fears,” we get a new perspective on Summer and Beth’s relationship. At first, Beth is thrilled by this newly mature version of her teen daughterâthough that wears thin rather quickly. “Obviously over the past 80 episodes their relationship has evolved so much,” Sarah Chalke, who plays Beth, explained. “But I think in that episode in particular we get to see a whole new dynamic between Beth and Summer. It was really fun to play because they’re sort of interacting more as peers. I think Beth really loved that and then hadn’t really run the play in her head of where that could go and the downsides to thatâwhich Rick obviously sees right away.” In the end, Chalke said, “That eventually comes around to realizing the best part about your childhood is your childhood, in being 17 and not knowing how hard it’s going to get, and wanting Summer to have the benefit of that for the rest of her life. It was a fun episode to get to do.â New episodes ofRick and Mortyarrive Sundays on Adult Swim. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "Crypto Investor Arrested After Being Accused of Kidnapping and Torturing Italian Tourist",
    "article_text": "A crypto investor from Kentucky was arrested in New York City this week after being accused of kidnapping and torturing an Italian tourist. John Woeltz, 37, was taken into custody after his alleged victim, a 28-year-old man, broke loose from Woeltz’s ritzy Nolita apartment and alerted a nearby traffic agent, telling them that he had been a prisoner inside the investor’s pad for two weeks,according to reports. The traffic officer swiftly alerted police, who arrested Woeltz, news outlets have reported. The alleged victim, who has since been hospitalized and whom authorities have declined to name, initially met up with Woeltz at his expensive apartment on May 6th, after the tourist arrived in the city, the New York Postwrites. It wasn’t long afterward that the man was allegedly plunged into a weeks-long ordeal in which he was subjected to horrifying torture techniques. Some outletshave reportedthat the victim is Woeltz’s former business partner. Woeltz was arraigned on Saturday morning and charged with assault, kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment and criminal possession of a firearm,CNN writes. He is being held without bail. Much about the criminal case remains unclear. The New York Timesreports thata 24-year-old woman named Beatrice Folchi was also arrested alongside Woeltz and was similarly charged with kidnapping and unlawful imprisonment. However, Folchi was apparently seenout on the streetsof New York not long afterward, and told the New York Post that shehad not been arrested. âEverything is going to be told but with a lawyer â I canât make any comments right now,â Folchi told the outlet. Another man, identified by police as an âunapprehended male,â is also thought to have participated in the torture activities, the newspaper writes. It is unknown who this person is or where they may be. Not long after the alleged victim arrived at the apartment, Woeltz is accused of stealing the man’s passport and cellphone. Woeltz and the other unidentified male then allegedly interrogated the victim, asking for his crypto wallet password. When the man refused to give it to them, police say they proceeded to imprison and torture him through a variety of horrifying and diabolical methods,according to multipleoutlets. Police found Polaroids inside the apartment of the man being tied up and tortured, the New York Posthas reported. In the photos, the man could be seen bound with electrical tape and, in one image, had a gun pointed at his head, the Post writes. Police also recovered a gun from the apartment. Sources interviewed by the Post claim to have additional information about the alleged ordeal that the tourist went through. Those hair-raising allegations include: Since being taken captive, the tourist had been bound with an electric cord, Tased while his feet were put in water, pistol whipped, forced to take cocaine and threatened to have his limbs cut off with an electric chainsaw, the sources said. The nightmare erupted from a dispute over cryptocurrency, in which the suspect allegedly tried to extort millions of dollars from the man by unleashing a litany of horrific tortures, according to sources. When reached for comment by Gizmodo on Friday, a NYPD public information merely provided the following statement: “On Friday May 23rd, 2025, at approximately 937 hours in the vicinity of Mulberry Street and Prince Street, a 28-year-old victim approached an on-duty traffic agent and alerted him that he was a victim of an assault.” Gizmodo also reached out to Woeltz’s attorney for comment.

    "title": "‘Doctor Who’ Plays a Weird Waiting Game for the Beginning of Its End",
    "article_text": "There are a lot of parallels between “Wish World” and last year’s“The Legend of Ruby Sunday.”They are both, of course, penultimate episodes of their respective seasons ofDoctor Who. They are also both built around the return of a classicÂDoctor Whovillain, and paying off a mysterythat had played outthroughout their respective seasons. Unfortunately they also both share a pretty fatal parallel: they’re both aimless waiting games that have little meat on their bones as they count down to a last minute cliffhanger reveal. “Wish World” has even more of a problem than “The Legend of Ruby Sunday,” however. That latter episode could at least hinge some tension and atmosphere on the fact that we didn’t already know that the last moments were building up to the reveal of Sutekh’s return (unless you read the rumors, that is). “Wish World,” for the most part (more on that later), is building up to a dramatic moment its audience already knows while its main character doesn’t: for the Doctor to encounterthe returned Rani, and understand what that may mean. And that just makes it a veryweirdexperience, even before you get to the mechanics of howÂDoctor Whois ticking down to that big reveal. The titular world of “Wish World” is a contemporary Earth before its apparently fated obliteration, except it’s a sideways version of it. Thanks to the help of a convenient magic baby the Rani goes and picks up in medieval Bavaria in the opening momentsâthe seventh son of a seventh son of a seventh son, which doesn’t feel very Evil Science Villainess of her, especially when the baby just essentially starts letting her bend reality in whatever way she wantsânoted Utter Bastard Conradfrom “Lucky Day” is the apparent benevolent dictator of the world, broadcasting from a bone palace upon high in London to decide the state of the world, weather, and creepily pleasant lives of everyone in it with a little help from this magic wunderkind. Those subjects include the Doctor and Belinda, who are now Mr. John Smith and hisÂwifeBelinda, living a retro-modern nuclear family dream with their baby daughter Poppy as Belinda revels in being a stay-at-home mom and Mr. Smith goes to work at UNIT, now a unifiedÂinsuranceteam rather than a vanguard against alien threats. The creepy vibe of this overtly heteronormative existence is in part the point, it turns out: everyone makes very pointed acknowledgements about the role of women being good daughters, good wives, and then good mothers, and when “Mr. Smith” passingly describes a male co-worker (none other than Colonel Ibrahim, blissfully unaware of who he’s meant to be) as handsome, reality almost turns in on itself around him, as if the mere thought of something not cisgender or heterosexual is an affront to this world that Conrad has wished up for everyone. It turns out we can also add “Hates Disabled People” to the Bumper List of Conrad’s Shitty Bigotries, because aside from retrograde thoughts about women and queer people, his bigotry around disabled people has led to an underground society of disabled people who, because they are “unseen” by Conrad in so much that he doesn’t ever think or care about them, are practically invisible to the world around them… except Ruby Sunday, who’s likewise unaffected by what’s going on around her, letting her team up with Shirley and her friends in the disabled camp to start trying to figure out what’s going on. Good job Conradreally sucksin some very specific ways! This is just about where “Wish World” checks out of trying to tell much more of a story, which is a shame, because the weird creepy vibes are quite good, even if they also mean continued exposure to Conrad (again, no disrespect to Jonah Hauer-King, he’s justincrediblygood at playing a man with utterly rancid vibes). After “Mr. Smith” has his brush with the curse of fatal compulsory heterosexuality (spurred on again by a wild, random returning cameo fromJonathan Groff’s Rogue, who gets a message out to the Doctor to help him doubt the nature of the Wish World by basically saying “I am gay and in a hell dimension but please remember thatyou like men!”), his entire role in the episode is to sit around swirling with doubt about the nature of his existence until he remembers that he’s the Doctor. After she links up with Shirley, Ruby’s “investigation” essentially slams the brakes on its own momentum so the two of them can basically look up from below the giant bone palace as it sits above London. And then there’s the Rani, or rather the Ranis plural, who are sitting up in that aforementioned bone palace, who are also largely just biding their time, as the latest incarnation of the renegade Time Lady practically begs the Doctor to figure out the world that she’s dominating through Conrad is a falsehood, so he can remember who he is, and more importantly, whoÂsheis. But it’s a weird vibe of the less intentional sort than those given off by Conrad’s Bigot Paradise. The episode is, essentially, ticking down until you get to that moment of realization between the Doctor and the Rani, even after she spends much of the third act of “Wish World” expositing to his face in an attempt to get the artifice to crumble around him once and for all. But because we already know that she’s the Rani, and that the Doctor is not an insurance salesman named John Smith, there’s no tension or mystery in what’s being built towards, you’re just a knowing audience waiting for the shoe to drop for the show’s protagonist, a shoe you’ve known all along is going to drop. At least “The Legend of Ruby Sunday” had the mystery of Susan Triad to build a sense of dread around, even if there wasn’t much more to the episode beyond thatâall “Wish World” has is a compelling creepy concept it largely discards halfway through and then a literal ticking clock as we wait for the episode’s final moments. So it turns out “Wish World” needs to throw in another mystery reveal right at the last moment, because the Doctor realizing who the Rani is is not that much of an actual reveal to us any more. It turns out the Rani’s big ticking clock counting down to May 24 has been powered by collecting the doubts of anyone who’s questioned Conrad’s reality, the Doctor included, juicing up the Vindicator the Doctor and Belinda have charged throughout the season even further to rip a hole through Earth and reality itself… opening up a dimension where none other than Omega, the ancient, godlike co-founder of Time Lord society (well,Timeless Child stuffnonwithstanding!), awaits. Admittedly “Wish World” does get the leg up on “Legend of Ruby Sunday” by putting its “devastating destruction of pretty much everyone but our hero that will be inevitably undone next episode” momentbeforethe cliffhangerthis time, as we watch Earth splinter apart and collapse into the underverse, seemingly blipping everyone but the Doctor, Conrad, and the Ranis out of existence, Belinda included. But the Omega reveal is more confusing than it is shocking in the moment, because it feels like it comes out of nowhere after the episode builds towards an already dramatically compromised reveal. Sure, we don’t knowwhythe Rani is doing all this weird stuff with Conrad and a magic baby, but the episode never treats that as a mystery to interrogate, it’s just ticking in the background while the Rani yearns for the Doctor to recognize her. So when Omega is invokedâwe don’t see him, it’s just his name being droppedâwhat could’ve been something “Wish World” built to just largely comes out of left field (unless you already happened to see that Russell T Daviesteased on Instagramlast week that there was a mystery third party in the villainous mix between Conrad and the Ranis, but should you have to check the showrunner’s social media for suitable dramatic tension?). The Rani and the Doctor’s encounter is all that “Wish World” was building toward up to that point, and because it’s building up to it for all of its runtime, the moment itself doesn’t really get to sit beyond the climactic final minutes, robbing it of what little tension could remain. And so again, we’re left waiting to see if next week’s grand finale will retroactively make this week’s preparation feel worth the clock-ticking… and if we reallyneeded the Rani’s returnto herald Omega, and all the implications that then has for the Time Lords and Gallifrey at large beyond that. ThatÂfeelslike a lot to dig into, at least. Imagine if we’d gotten a two-part finale that actually leveraged its time to do just that? Want more io9 news?

    "article_text": "This article is part of Gizmodo Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. There are 3 options when it comes to kids and the internet and social media. Let them go unrestricted and potentially subject them to all of the many online dangers, take a hard line and try to keep them off entirely, or find a way to allow and monitor responsible and safe usage. The third option is ideal, and the Bark Watch is one of the most effective and powerful tools for keeping kids safe that we’ve seen. It’s a stylish and durable smartwatch that closely resembles an Apple Watch, but it has no apps or social media or web access, and it allows parents to monitor the texts, photos, videos, and contact lists on their kids’ phones, along with their location. The Bark Watch has 24/7 GPS location tracking, and can be used to text or make video calls, but only to contacts approved by parents. See at Bark It’s almost a given that your kids will eventually be fully online, but the Bark Watch is an outstanding way to get their online presence off to a safe start.It’s a standalone device that can be used for phone calls, video calls, and texting. If your kid already has a phone and you’re rethinking allowing it, their number can be ported onto the Bark Watch free of charge. The parent then downloads the Bark app from the iOS App Store or Google Play site, and they have access to their kids’ data, texts, photos, contacts â everything that could become problematic in a world of unfettered internet exposure. One of Bark’s truly ingenious features is how it uses AI to detect bullying, depression, suicidal ideation, online predators, and other hazards, and sends an alert to the parent’s phone. The GPS location function lets parents see where their kid is 24/7, and the Bark Watch has a one-button SOS function that lets the child call for help if needed. The Bark Watch itself is built to withstand the rigors and everyday abuse that kids put their tech devices through. It’s sturdy and has an IP68 waterproof rating to keep it running even as your kids are out being kids. And it performs great as a phone either in voice or video mode, and takes great photos and videos so your kid can enjoy the perks of sharing them digitally â but only with your approval and oversight. The Bark Watch can be purchased for $7 per month, and the Bark service is $15 per month. Porting an existing phone number to the watch is free. A Bark Premium membership can be extended to allow parents to also monitor their kids’ tablets and other devices. It’s a small investment to make your kids’ transition into the often fraught world of tech and online access easy, fun, and most importantly, safe.

    "title": "In the Season 2 Finale of ‘The Last of Us,’ Tensions Reached an All Time High",
    "article_text": "One of thethings we love most aboutThe Last of Usis that it’s never easy. Things happen, and people say stuff thatcan’t be easily defined or categorised. It’s a show that lives in the grey areas of life. No one is completely good, no one is completely evil, andneither side is right or wrong. It’s up to us, the audience, to figure out how we want to view it. This season, that complexity has taken a back seat at times, with so much of the story laser-focused on the burgeoning love between Ellie and Dina as the pair set off across the country to get revenge on the people who killed Joel. However, in the season two finale, all of the beautiful nuance that makes the show so good came back in a big way. It was an edge-of-your-seat hour of television where the tension and stakes become almost unbearable, leading to an ending that might be a little confusing, but we’ll break it down. And so now, for the last time this season, let’s recap an episode ofThe Last of Us. When last we left our Seattle invaders, Ellie had probably beaten a woman to death, and Jesse was trying to bring Dina to safety after being shot in the leg with an arrow. He gets her back to the theater, where he tells her the unfortunate news that he has to push the arrow through the leg instead of pull it out. Jesse pours some whiskey on the arrow and wound to disinfect it and offers a sip to Dina, who refuses. In TV and movies, two things automatically mean a woman is pregnant: if she vomits at an unexpected time, or refuses to drink alcohol. Jesse clocks that but moves on and successfully gets the arrow out. Ellie returns from her violent little adventure and checks in on Dina. Dina says, despite her injury, the baby is okay, and proceeds to check on Ellie. Ellie takes her shirt off and Dina starts to tend to her very bloody and bruised back. She tells Dina that she found Nora and that the only info she gave about Abby’s whereabouts was “whale wheel.” Then, in a cautious whisper, Ellie says, “I made her talk. I thought it would be harder to do, but it wasn’t. It was easy.” Her scary whispers are intercut with footage of Ellie beating Nora and everyone âus, Ellie and Dinaârealizes this is a new Ellie. She’s changed. She’s done something she didn’t even think was possible. Trying to be comforting, Dina tells Ellie that maybe Nora got what she deserved. Which is Ellie’s cue to tell Dina the truth about why Abby and her friends came to Jackson and killed Joel. Dina is speechless as she processes the information, which she clearly is not able to reconcile. “We need to go home,” is all Dina can muster. It’s her way of saying maybe Abby was warranted in killing Joel, and maybe now they are even. It’s also important to note that through this whole, crucial conversation, Ellie is not wearing a shirt. She’s as vulnerable and naked, literally, as she’s ever been physically and emotionally. The next morning is “Seattle, Day Three,” according to our crucially important on-screen calendar. Dina stays back at the theater as Jesse and Ellie see if they can meet up with Tommy so they can all go home together. On the way, Jesse kind of tricks Ellie into admitting that Dina is, in fact, pregnant and that he is, in fact, the father. He explains how the news changes everything because he can’t die. Like Dina, he now has to live because he’s responsible for this child. And yet, because of Ellie, they’re all stuck in the middle of a war zone. Ellie continues to see how her actions impact others and wrestles with whether or not that changes her story. The rain starts to come down in Seattle and, as we’ll soon learn, this is one of the worst storms in ages. On their way to find Tommy, Jesse and Ellie hide from some WLF soldiers chasing down a Scar. The Scar is basically a teenager and, against six WLF soldiers, doesn’t stand a chance. Ellie wants to help the kid, but Jesse begs her not to, knowing it won’t end well for them. “This is not our war,” he tells her, but it’s not clear she agrees. After that brief reminder of the war between the WLF and Scars, the action takes us to a WLF base at a nearby Costco. Sgt. Park, whose son we saw die two weeks ago, tells Isaac about the storm, but he has something bigger on his mind: Abby. He wants to know where she is; apparently, she has disappeared along with several members of her crew. Park doesn’t understand why Isaac is so fixated on Abby so he explains that, tonight, odds are both he and Park will die. Why or how? We don’t know quite yet. If that happens though, he had hoped Abby would be the person to take over the WLF. But, apparently, she’s got her own things going on. Things that remain a mystery. And yet, for the first time on the show, we get to hear some praise and positive connotation around Abby which feels a little weird. Jesse and Ellie arrive at the designated rendezvous point but there’s no sign of Tommy. So, with a quick break in the action, Ellie and Jesse discuss how he still loves Dina, but Ellie loves her in a different way. He knows that because he fell for a girl passing through Jackson a few months back and, while he wanted to go with her, he felt beholden and in debt to the people of Jackson. Just then, a message on the radio explains that a non-Scar sniper is taking out WLF soldiers and they need help. They both know it’s Tommy. They get some elevation, hoping to see where Tommy is from above when Ellie sees a huge Ferris wheel next to a whale. “Whale wheel.” It’s an aquarium and that’s where Abby is. She excitedly explains to Jesse that they need to go there but Jesse disagrees. It leads to an incredibly tense conversation where we learn Jesse did not vote for Ellie to go to Seattle. He thinks she’s selfish, and Ellie doesn’t appreciate that. She yells about how he only cares about Jackson and was happy to let an innocent boy die just earlier that afternoon. It’s one of those gray area conversations where we see both sides of the argument and are left to make up our own minds. But this is Ellie’s show, so Ellie decides to go to the aquarium and Jesse tells her he hopes she makes it. He goes after Tommy. Ellie makes her way to the coast and realizes the fastest, safest way to get to the aquarium is by boat. Even though the weather is getting very bad, she’s about to make a break for it when a ton of boats appear near her location. Isaac is on one of them. The boats dock and load up ammunition before heading toward a dark island just off the coast. We realize that tonight is the night the WLF has decided to make its all-out attack on the Scars and the fact that it’s happening in the opposite direction of the aquarium is music to Ellie’s ears. She sets off in a rinky-dink boat and is quickly flipped over by a massive wave. Ellie washes up on an unknown shore and is instantly spotted by a young boy. He turns away and the whistles start. This is Scar territory and, basically, it’s over for Ellie. The Scars string her up, get the okay to kill and and just as she’s about to die, horns go off. The Scars realize their village is being attacked and leave Ellie in the woods. She goes back to her boat and heads toward the aquarium as a bunch of explosions go off in the background. What is happening? We don’t know yet. But we do know that this aside felt very out of place in the context of the episode. Was it really important to see Ellie in peril for two seconds? It leaves us wondering why this scene was in there at all. Maybe we’ll learn more next season. After all, Ellie life’s was very much just saved by the WLF, even if they don’t know it. Ellie sneaks into the aquarium and takes out Joel’s gun. The gun she brought specifically to kill Abby with. She seems certain she’s going to find her thereâonly, she doesn’t. What she does find is Owen and Mel, two of Abby’s friends who were in Jackson and are very much on Ellie’s list. She overhears them talking about Abby so when she confronts them and asks for Abby’s whereabouts, she knows they’re lying when they say they don’t know where she is. They’re in shock, though. Clearly, they don’t know Nora is dead yet or that Ellie was around. Ellie tries to reason with them, saying if they give up Abby’s location, she’ll let them live. Owen doesn’t buy it. He quickly grabs a gun but Ellie shoots first. Her bullet goes through Owen’s neck, killing him, and into Mel, who we now realize is pregnant. Mel begs Ellie to help her cut the baby out before it’s too late and Ellie tries but doesn’t have the time or nerves. “Is it out? Is it out?” Mel whispers as she and her baby die. This is not what Ellie wanted, especially after the conversations with Jesse about selflessness. She’s going to be a parent soon and, in a world that has been decimated, every life counts. The mistake destroys Ellie, and she starts crying. At that moment, Tommy and Jesse find her. Each is shocked by the scene they’ve walked into but knows there’s no time to waste. They grab Ellie and get out of there. Back at the theater, Tommy tries to console Ellie about what has happened. They realize it might be time let Abby live and, hopefully, Ellie can live with that. She then thanks Jesse for coming back. He pretends like it wasn’t his idea but Ellie knows it was. Because he’s a good person. A person who, he admits, knows Ellie would do anything to save him if the roles were reversed. She agrees. Just then, they hear a commotion in the lobby. They run to see what’s happening and BOOM, Jesse catches a bullet in the head. He’s dead. It’s Abby. She’s found them and tells Ellie to put down the gun or she’s killing Tommy too. Only, Abby didn’t know it was Ellie. “You!” she says as Ellie comes out. It makes sense, of course. Basically all of Abby’s friends who would know who Ellie is are dead. Ellie quickly tries to tell Abby that she knows her story now and Joel killed Abby’s father for her. She begs Abby to spare Tommy by saying she’s the one Abby wants. “I let you live,” Abby says in disbelief. “I let you live. And you wasted it.” Ellie screams, a gun goes off and the show cuts to black. What happened? Who lives? Who dies? We don’t know. What we do know is that the next shot is Abby waking up. She seems calmer, as if she is over the incredibly heated events we just saw her in. But as she wakes up to start her day at a major WLF base, three words come on the screen. “Seattle. Day One.” We’ve jumped back in time two days and are about to see what Abby has been up to as Ellie and Dina were looking for her. Cue the Soundgarden song, “Burden in My Hand.” It’s a moment that happens almost exactly as it does inThe Last of Us Part II. In the game, you play as Ellie going after Abby for hours. Then, you reach that moment in the theater, it cuts to black, and now you’re playing as your sworn enemy: Abby. Why would the show do that? What can seeing Abby’s point of view tell us? We’ll find out probably in 2027 whenThe Last of Usreturns for season three. What did you think of the finale and the season? Was the ending satisfying for you? Are you mad at it? Where’s your curiosity level about Abby’s story? Let us know below. And, most of all, thank you for reading along for another season ofThe Last of Us. Want more io9 news?

Season two of the HBO PlayStation adaptation is overâso, how do you feel about it? I don't need to know what Neil Druckmann thinks about the ending of 'The Last of Us' any more. For fans of The Last of Us season 2, this real-life fungal outbreak might feel uncomfortably familiar. Show co-creator Craig Mazin says the events of 'The Last of Us Part II' won't be finished in the upcoming third season. Game creator and episode six director Neil Druckmann details why a major Joel and Ellie moment was moved up in the story.

    "title": "Greenworks Lawn Care Combo With Mower, Trimmer, and Blower Is $500 Off, Only at Best Buy for Memorial Day",
    "article_text": "This article is part of Gizmodo Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. Green is good, whether you’re talking about environmentally friendly rechargeable devices or the kind of green you can fold up and stick in your wallet. Best Buy is running an amazing deal on the first kind of green that will put a large stack of the second kind back in your pocket âthis Greenworks Combo Kit of rechargeable yard tools that normally sells for $1,100 is just $600 in a spectacular Memorial Day Weekend sale. This 3-piece combo covers most if not all of your yard-care needs, all in no-gas rechargeable form. The 80V 21-inch self-propelled lawn mower, 13-inch string trimmer, and 730 CFM leaf blower are high-performing machines that are better than their gas-powered counterparts in many ways. The Greenworks Combo Kit also comes with a 4 Ah battery and charger, and the battery is compatible with over 75 other Greenworks 80V products. See at Best Buy The initial skeptical take on electric mowers is that they don’t produce the same cutting power as the gas-powered versions, but that’s not the case with the Greenworks mower. A single battery charge will get you through half an acre of cutting, after which you can fully recharge the battery in just 60 minutes (perhaps while you enjoy an adult beverage for your hard work).The Greenworks mower is self-propelled, 2x quieter than gas mowers,and has SmartCut technology which motors the height and condition of your grass and delivers the correct amount of power to the blades to get it done, even if the grass is wet or thick. The Greenworks mower also has powerful LED headlights, and a 4-in-1 system that mulches, bags, side discharges clippings, and has a turbo setting for picking up leaves. It starts with a simple push of a button, so there’s no backbreaking pull-start action required. It’s definitely not a weaker sibling compared to the gas-powered mowers. The lightweight Greenworks string trimmer is also more powerful than the gas models and has high-low settings so you can decide if you need more cutting power to get through tougher weeds or longer battery life. The 0.80-inch line is controlled with a simple bump-feed motion and is easy refilled. The leaf blower is more than a match no matter how many trees you have. It delivers up to 730 CFM of constant airflow and can max out at 170 mph, which is the equivalent of a 26cc gas-powered blower, except far more quiet, lighter, and easier to use. This Greenworks Combo Kit of 3 high-end yard machines and the battery and recharger needed to keep them going normally sells for $1,100, butBest Buy is celebrating Memorial Day Weekend by knocking a crazy $500 from the price, bringing it down to just $600.

    "article_text": "This article is part of Gizmodo Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. There are more than a couple of “firsts” and “onlys” attached to theINIU Portable Charger that’s just $16 for a limited time at Amazon. It’s the first 10,000mAh portable charger to be just 0.5 inches thick, and it’s one of the only chargers of this category that has an in/out USB-C port that powers up the charger and powers your portable devices. See at Amazon Need some more superlatives? How about the fact that it’s a 3A charger, as opposed to the vast majority of the super-compact chargers on the market which are 2.1A. The translation there is, a 3A charger like the INIU Portable Charger can power up your devices up to twice as fast as a 2.1A charger. Or that it has three 3A ports (two USB-A and one USB-C) that can be used at the same time, which is next to unheard of in a charger this small and this inexpensive?How about that $16 price tag? Maybethere are smaller chargers out there? But none as powerful as this one from INIU, with its 10,000mAh capacity and three 3A ports. How much juice is that? Enough to power your AirPods Pro 13 times over, or an iPhone 15 nearly twice over, or an iPad Pro from fully dead to 90% before the INIU needs to be hooked up to an outlet for a quick refresher. That’s a significantly powerful charger, especially for one that’s 36% thinner, 15% smaller, and 28% lighter than most competing devices. It’s roughly the size of the iPhone 13 Mini, and weighs less than 7 ounces. If you already have visions in your head of a long plane ride for summer vacation and charging your earbuds, phone, and tablet or smartwatch at the same time, it’s fully TSA compliant. INIU backs their ultra-compact charger with a 3-year replacement warranty, and if the INIU name doesn’t ring a bell, it’s Amazon’s top-selling portable charger in 7 countries including the US and Canada, and sells in over 174 countries worldwide. (For reference, that’s 174 out of 195.) The INIU Portable Charger comes with a USB-A to USB-C cable and carrying pouch, and it comes in 4 colors, although the Neutral Black model is the one that’s on sale for $16 at Amazon.(The Classic Blue, Living Orange, and Mellow Red versions will run you an extra 2 bucks.) It’s compatible with virtually every brand of cellphone, tablet, and wireless earbuds and headphones, and fully TSA compliant for air travel.

    "title": "Byond game engine suffers a weeks-long DDoS attack, apparently because a wanna-be Bond villain is trying to force it to go open source: 'Attacks on Byond servers are a symptom of your obstinance'",
    "article_text": "I don't know if the explanation is real, but the attack certainly is. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Byond is an old, free game engine that's been around since at least the early 2000s in games like Space Station 13, to cite one we'vetalked about recently. It's also been the subject of a sustained DDoS attack, according to aMassivelyOPreport, that's now into at least it's third week. And why, exactly, would someone launch a DDoS attack against an obscure game engine, and keep it up for this long? According to a now-deleted Reddit post, available via theWayback Machine, a group calling itself \"the international free and open-source software community\" is doing it to pressure Byond creator LummoxJR into making the software open source. \"Attacks on Byond servers are a symptom of your obstinance,\" theextremelytalking-like-Sephiroth message states. \"They will persist as long as you ignore the voices of those who keep your platform afloat. We demand you voluntarily side with progress. \"Choose: Let Byond die as a proprietary relic, or let it rise as a free project. Time is running out.\" Whether or not that's a legitimate claim, I cannot say. It certainly doesn't sound like a good reason to throw up a sustained DDoS attack, but I've been on the internet long enough to know that'this sounds too stupid to be true'is at best 50/50 when it comes to predicting whether something actually is true. In a Reddit thread that went up not long after the attack began, appropriately entitled \"What kind of maniac DDoSes Byond?\" users suggested other possible rationales for the attack, most of them variants on \"some guy got mad on the internet.\" LummoxJr implied in the thread that they're not sure about the real reason for the DDoS, but wrote that they'd \"heard a rumor as to how this started, and it doesn't really involve Byond; it was just a grudge between someone and a server that escalated.\" Whatever initially touched it out, the fires are still burning: TheByond websiteremains inaccessible, and as of the latest update to theDDoS Downtime Megathread, mitigation efforts are ongoing but there's no ETA for a full restoration. In aseparate threadposted May 23, LummoxJR said they're \"still dealing with the thing,\" but also took a kind of bright-side view of the ongoing mess. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"I know the current situation has pushed a lot of us into closer contact than normal, and in many ways that's a good thing,\" they wrote. \"But there have been some folks coming into new spaces hot, especially thinking they have a new idea that actually isn't new. I know it comes from a good place. Let's just all remember to show each other a little extra leeway and respect.\" And in good news for people who actually use Byond, it's not out of reach: The website is down but some parts of it, including bug reports and downloads, are now being hosted onDiscord. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Andy has been gaming on PCs from the very beginning, starting as a youngster with text adventures and primitive action games on a cassette-based TRS80.

Ready for Halloween, but a little miffed it's so far off? Well, Steam's got you covered. There's plenty of blood, guts, and ghoulies waiting for you in theZombies vs. Vampires Festactive through June 2. That might sound a little narrow if you consider the full scope of things, but zombies are such a quintessentially videogame archetype that you'll find all sorts of games about them. Vampires are less ubiquitous, but it's nice to have them grandfathered in here instead of in their own hyper-specific sale like that one aboutpushing boxes. Heavy-hitting blockbusters likeThe Last of Us,Dying Light 2, and Telltale'sThe Walking Deadtake a narrative posture, if you're one of those types that likes a zombie story which is really about humans and how we act in bad situations. Maybe you're like me, though, and you just like shooting a bunch of monsters with a big ol' machine gun. In that case, you really should pick up games like all-time horde shooterLeft 4 Dead 2(which is currently going for less than a dollar) andKilling Floor 2, which I guess is technically about clones rather than the undead, but I won't tell if you don't. The originalL4Dis on for just $1 in the new sale too. As far as the bloodsuckers are concerned, plenty ofV Risingbundles are on sale; it's one of thebest survival games around, even if you aren't into all the fangs. A personal favorite of mine isEvil West, a Xbox 360-style beat 'em up where you blast apart gargoyles as a ludicrously buff version of Van Helsing. If you need a sheerer shot of adrenaline, maybe give the bullet hell anticsVampire Survivorsa look. A lot of classics are notably not on sale—no Castlevania, no Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines—but there's still plenty to dive into.

    "title": "A month after Electronic Arts mashed the brakes, WRC rally racing games are coming back with a 'complete reboot' under a new publisher",
    "article_text": "The first new WRC game published by Nacon is to arrive in 2027. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Less than a month after theend of its licensing deal with Electronic Artsracing studio Codemasters, the FIA has announced a new deal to bring WRC racing games back in 2027 with an \"all-new WRC games series\" being developed by Nacon. \"After a comprehensive evaluation, we are delighted to have reached an agreement with Nacon,\" FIA World Rally Championship chief marketing officer Arne Dirks said in theannouncement(viaWario64). \"Their vision for the franchise stands out, and their expertise in delivering great rally games is unquestioned. We look forward to breaking new ground together in this collaboration, to truly turn the WRC games into epic adventures and offer gaming experiences beyond rally as we know it today.\" The new games will represent a \"complete reboot\" of the series, Nacon said, featuring \"official rallies, vehicles, teams, drivers, and sponsors,\" as well as other \"anticipated content elements,\" which I hope isn't an oblique reference to live service features. \"We are thrilled to renew our collaboration with WRC Promoter [FIA],\" Nacon CEO Alan Falc said. \"This iconic license provides an exceptional playground to build a highly refined driving experience that lives up to the expectations of rally fans.\" And indeed, this is not Nacon's first kick at the rallying can: For nearly a decade prior to Codemasters acquiring the license in 2020, Nacon (formerly Bigben Interactive) published official WRC games developed by Kylotonn, a French development studio that Nacon acquired in 2018. That's led to something of a mixed reaction from fans about this new partnership, which is a little joke based on Kylotonn's recent history: WRC Generations, the studio's final WRC game (as KT Racing) prior to this new deal, has a \"mixed\" ratingon Steam, as does its most recent release,Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown.

    "title": "Gabe Newell co-founded a neuroscience company in 2019 and its first brain chip is expected to ship later this year",
    "article_text": "It's very preliminary at this stage, but things are happening. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It turns out that Valve boss Gabe Newell is also thecofounder of a neuroscience company called Starfishthat's \"developing a broad range of foundational technologies to enable new ways to interact with the brain,\" and if all goes well its first neural interface chip may launch in late 2025. The 'brain interface' thing isn't a new interest for Newell: In 2021, for instance, he went deep (and, honestly, got a little weird) about the potential ofbrain-computer interface technologyin gaming, but he wastalking about biometric interfacesat least as far back as 2010. According toThe Verge, Starfish Neuroscience was launched in 2019, although it remained quiet until last week, when its first (and thus far only)blog post(viaBrad Lynch) offered a little insight into what the company is aiming for. Starfish is taking a different approach to brain interface technology than other companies working in the field, neuroengineer Nate Cermak explained in the update—foremost among them presumably beingNeuralink, although it's not mentioned by name in the update. \"Existing approaches to interfacing with the brain predominantly focus on interacting with a single brain region (for example, deep brain stimulation for Parkinson’s disease),\" Cermak wrote. \"However, there is increasing evidence that a number of neurological disorders involve circuit-level dysfunction, in which the interactions between brain regions may be misregulated.\" Cermak said developing therapies for those disorders \"will require distributed neural interfaces capable of interacting with the brain at the circuit level; that is, reading and writing to multiple connected parts of the brain at once.\" Current tech really isn't up to the task for a variety of reasons—size, power requirements, \"surgical burden\"—which is where Starfish hopes to come in: The company is working to develop \"a new class of minimally-invasive, distributed neural interfaces that enable simultaneous access to multiple brain regions.\" The work is still very preliminary at this point, but it seems to be coming along reasonably well. \"We anticipate our first chips arriving in late 2025 and we are interested in finding collaborators for whom such a chip would open new and exciting avenues,\" Cermak wrote. \"At this early stage, we’re especially interested in collaborators for whom this technology would pair well with their existing work in fields such as wireless power delivery and communication, or those designing custom implanted neural interfaces.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. This new brain chip technology isn't the only thing Starfish has on the go: It's also developing a \"targeted hyperthermia device\" with potential uses in cancer treatment, and is researching \"transcranial magnetic stimulation\" therapies for possible use across a range of neurological disorders.

    "article_text": "Bug fixes and balance passes aside, the studio is moving on less than two years after the game's release. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In the world of fighting games, NetherRealm fighters are an odd duck. Games like Guilty Gear, Street Fighter, and Tekken tend to get souped up with DLC for half a decade or more before the next entry is even announced—but like Mortal Kombat 11 before it, Mortal Kombat 1 is dispensing with further major updates after around two years. NetherRealm broke the news in athread on X, saying \"while we will continue to support Mortal Kombat 1 through balance adjustments and fixes, there will not be additional DLC characters or story chapters released from this point on.\" A follow-up reply said the news is \"disappointing for fans\" but necessary to make the studio's next game \"as great as we possibly can.\" This all comes two years after creative director Ed Boonsaid on Xthat MK1 was meant to get more post-launch support than any Mortal Kombat before it. But where MK11'send was declaredafter more than two years of support, the MK1 news comes only about a year and a half after the game's release in September 2023. While it hadwacky pop culture crossoversworthy of the best modem MK games,our reviewtouched on a certain sense of flair Mortal Kombat 1 was missing. As reviewer Robin Valentine put it, it felt \"fated to be remembered as the least interesting of the modern MK games.\" Still, fans hoping for more updates to build out its roster will have to wait for the next game, whether that's Injustice 3 or Mortal Kombat, uh, 2. In the meantime, I guess we'll all have to pack ourselves into theaters for theMortal Kombat movielike so many writhing, nostalgia-drunk sardines.

    "title": "Morrowind with every texture deleted is a beautiful magenta fever dream",
    "article_text": "Time for a trip. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In my early 20s, I hopped over to Amsterdam with some friends. I'd just ended a long-term relationship and was determined to melt my brain. On the third day of our trip, we rented a cabin outside the city, surrounded by farmland and chickens, and devoured too many mushrooms. For the next few hours, I was treated to a world where everything glowed purple. Especially the trees. Which also seemed to be constantly moving towards me—though, now that I think about it, I may have been walking towards them. It was a lovely day, apart from the part where I panicked about the mess we were making (someone knocked over an empty can of Coca-Cola and I just freaked out), or when my friend tried to kidnap a chicken. Watching Micky D's recentMorrowindvideo, where he removes all the game's textures, kicks me right back to those halcyon days. It turns out that using OpenMW and deleting all the textures turns Bethesda's greatest RPG into a magenta fever dream. And while it makes inventory management and shopping excursions a touch tricky, I honestly think this would be a really fun way to play a game I've already played to death. I'm particularly enamoured with how Morrowind looks at night, with all those moody, dark purples. It really gives some extra atmosphere to an evening crime spree. Really, the only thing I'm not a fan of is the magenta square that replaces the cursor. It's a tad annoying. Though I'm sure I'd have to endure more awkward niggles than that if I actually did bother to play it this way. Maybe it's better to just watch someone else do it. If a magenta playthrough tickles your fancy, though, the video does provide instructions on how to do this yourself. Fraser is the UK online editor and has actually met The Internet in person.

    "title": "The best videogame RPGs are really tabletop RPGs in disguise—and that might just be their secret sauce",
    "article_text": "Tabletop roleplaying drives videogame RPGs to be better. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. At PC Gamer we occasionally run tabletop RPG campaigns remotely, with senior editor Robin Valentine as our long-suffering GM. I like to think of my role as 'agent of chaos'—all scrapes and japes. Maybe I'll sacrifice myself to save everyone on a dying space station. Maybe I'll betray everyone and kill a former guides editor. Maybe I'll just derail a Star Wars-themed RPG by constantly describing how bad my Duros character smells (it's all in the lore, folks). I adore the messy antics, but equally I am smitten with how weird our stories get, as a bunch ofvery extrawriters fill out a yarn, constantly in conversation with a GM and each other. It's so much more liberating and surprising than a prescriptive videogame RPG. But while I am adamant that the best roleplaying experiences take place around a table (or Discord), videogame RPGs still manage to capture much of what makes this more pure roleplaying style so bloody compelling. Indeed, it's often what makes the best of them so brilliant. The Elder Scrolls is not an obvious example at first glance, but Bethesda's 30-year-old series owes a huge debt to D&D and its ilk—for so many reasons, really, but particularly because of their free-wheeling, 'there's an adventure around every corner' nature. Whether you're aMorrowind stan, rediscovering the allure of Cyrodiil inOblivion Remastered, or one of the countlessSkyrimaddicts, you're engaging with a fantasy world in much the same way as you would be while hunched around a table, rolling dice. The world of Tamriel isn't a million miles away from the Forgotten Realms, and D&D has given videogame RPGs much of their vocabulary, but it's this less definedvibethat really harkens back to tabletops. That sense of randomness, of experimentation. That immersive sim quality. When you escape the devastation of Helgen in Skyrim, you immediately begin a conversation with an invisible GM. \"OK, where now?\" The answer is entirely up to you. Muck around in ancient tombs. Chase down thieves. Find some dragons to fuck up. Rush straight towards the important stuff. No matter what you choose, Bethesda will make an adventure out of it for you. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. If you decide to hoof it to Whiterun, you'll immediately encounter a brawl between the Fighters Guild and a giant. A more prescriptive RPG would make this feel like a critical encounter that you absolutely must engage with. But like a tabletop game, Skyrim treats this like another conversation. \"What would you actually like to do?\" Maybe you'll go down the vanilla route and help the fighters, after which they'll invite you to inquire about joining their ranks by visiting their HQ, giving you a new quest and setting you on a long, wide-ranging adventure that will eventually transform you into a werewolf. But you also might accidentally wallop someone with your sword as you try to hack at the giant, and whoops, now you're fighting your would-be allies too. You are co-writing your story in tandem with Bethesda. Or you could just say \"Screw it\" and hang back, watching the spectacle. Heck, you can simply ignore it entirely and find a new adventure, because warriors and giants are a bit basic, aren't they? You are co-writing your story in tandem with Bethesda, but in a free-flowing way that eschews the very specific choices you make in other RPGs. Big Choices are a huge part of videogame RPGs, but increasingly I find them vapid and by-the-numbers. The Elder Scrolls works so well because it's less about the hugely important moments where you're faced with a binary decision, and more about the understated, moment-to-moment chaos. Which is also what makes them feel so much more connected to the ancient legacy of TTRPGs. It's fascinating how BioWare, which until very recently was responsible for the greatest explicit D&D adaptation, Baldur's Gate 2, has so thoroughly moved away from the things that make tabletop gaming such a trip. Dragon Age: The Veilguard, for instance, only makes you a participant in its adventures. You and your companions have very little in the way of real agency. You are given a few directions to go in, a few extremely important choices, but so much of it is illusory. At no point are you writing your own story. You're merely following BioWare's very specific narrative. Of course, the BioWare that made Baldur's Gate 2 (or really any of the good RPGs) is long gone, but into that vacuum plenty of other developers have enthusiastically leaped, and continued making wonderful RPGs. And it's thanks to this that we haveBaldur's Gate 3. Now, yes,clearlyBG3 draws from tabletop games. It's so obvious that you might think it's pointless for me to even bring the game up. It's literally a D&D game. But Larian did so much more than transpose the setting and rules to a videogame world. It latched onto the raw philosophy of tabletop gaming. It caught that intangible spirit, nurtured it, elevated it, and ultimately gave us something that was equal to the greatest campaigns you might have played with your tabletop cohorts. Critical to this was the way that Larian so thoroughly embraced immersive sim concepts. Creative problem solving, reactive systems, player agency, emergent gameplay—these are the pillars of the immersive sim, but they are equally the pillars of tabletop roleplaying. Through this, Larian was able to lean into the strengths of these two modes of play. It's how, when you play BG3, you really do feel like you can try anything, pushing the rules to their breaking point, even though videogames, by their very nature, cannot truly offer the same levels of freedom as a game driven almost purely by imagination. The principles of immersive sim design are like a cheat sheet, allowing developers to create an almost unbreakable illusion that you, the player, have an unfettered ability to manipulate the world. Arguably one of the purest expressions of this is the way you can physically manipulate the space you inhabit. You can, for instance, weaponise the humble crate in all sorts of ways in the midst of battle, or you can simplystack them up, climb them, and then use spells or items to teleport yourself over seemingly impassible barriers. It's so important to be able to decide how you make your way through the world. Nobody tells you that you can do this. There's no tutorial that suggests, \"Yo, if you stack some boxes you can bypass some of our carefully crafted obstacles\". But you can do it, because it makes sense in a world where you can teleport to things within your line of sight. It fits the logic of the game perfectly—you just need to think creatively. And this is just incredible. Joyful. And just a bit silly. It also makes BG3 a much better RPG than most of its predecessors and contemporaries—because it's so important to be able to decidehowyou make your way through the world. These are the choices that really matter. How you use your imagination and creativity to make the tools you're given work for you. This isn't something you get just because you're playing a game set in the Forgotten Realms. The Infinity Engine games didn't let you do this shit. Dark Alliance didn't let you do it, either. This was down to Larian making a choice about how it took advantage of tabletop-inspired systems. And it was doing it even before it got the D&D gig. This is classic Divinity: Original Sin nonsense. But it's not the only route to creating a phenomenal RPG; nor is it the only way that tabletop RPGs can inspire better videogames. Disco Elysiumis one of the most important videogame RPGs ever made, and effectively reimagines what an RPG can be.Should be. And while I think it could only have been made by the specific people who made up ZAUM's team—now scattered to the winds—with all their specific experiences and obsessions, I don't think it could have existed without tabletop roleplaying, either. \"I think I met Robert [Kurvitz, ZAUM co-founder] when I was 17 or something,\" art director Aleksander Rostovtold Edgefive years ago. \"Before that, you'd hear these whispers going around about some crazy dudes who were doing this weird obsessive D&D thing that wasn't about dwarves and elves but motor carriages and people wearing top hats. It was like steampunk, but not vanilla steampunk, it was inspired by the French Revolution. When I got the materials, the photos of the characters and the maps, in person, it was like, 'Oh, shit, this is the stuff'.\" Disco was specifically designed to evoke AD&D (Advanced Dungeons & Dragons), but with a distinctly different setting, and drawing on D&D-inspired videogames like Planescape: Torment. Initially there was going to be combat, but it eventually shed that. But that makes it feel no less like a tabletop game. While D&D is partially defined by its creative, violent encounters, tabletop gaming is so much wider in scope. I've been playing tabletop games for a couple of decades (I started late), and while violence often plays a big role, combat itself doesn't rear its head very often. While D&D is partially defined by its creative and violent encounters, tabletop gaming is so much wider in scope. Tabletop roleplaying is more about embodying a character, and then using their skills in conjunction with your own brain, your creativity, to push a story forward, solving problems and achieving a range of goals that can be literally anything. You don't need guns or swords or classes for that—they just form a helpful framework. And few games let you embody a character like Disco does. Harry is not the player—he's more defined than that. But Disco does invite and encourage us tobecomeHarry. And then to decide who Harry will become with our assistance. Instead of combat, we are in constant conversation with his psyche, his addictions, his worst and best impulses. In a sense we are at war with ourself, or at least our digital counterpart. I still get all tingly thinking about how good that feels. How exciting it is to explore a character this deeply. And it really, truly does match the experience of figuring out who you are in a TTRPG. The way Disco swaps the conventional RPG skills and modifiers for more esoteric fare and out-there dialogue options—including conversations with the voices in our head—ends up perfectly replicating the way we interrogate ourselves when trying to figure out how to handle a situation on the table. When I encounter an obstacle in, say, D&D, or Mothership, or Call of Cthulhu, I'm not simply looking at my inventory or my character sheet's list of skills and traits, I'm also thinking about how Fancy Jones, Doderick Soup or Whisper (or whatever ridiculous name I've cursed my character with) would approach the situation. Am I stressed? Am I worried about my companions? Do I have a really strange and hyper-specific fetish for space station power generators? Or these things might come from the GM, as they remind me that I am actually soaked head-to-toe in blood as I try to talk my way out of a tricky situation, which ismaybegoing to have an impact. Which might prompt me to lean into the lunacy of it all, like Harry committing entirely to a bit, whether that's being a paranormal investigator or relentlessly telling people, \"I am the law\". And just like a permissive GM, Disco will often reward you for being a complete nutjob. Then there's the playfulness. The way games like Disco, BG3 or The Elder Scrolls encourage you to mess around rather than looking for the optimal path. More conventional RPGs encourage us to 'win', but the truly great ones let us have fun failing, or at the very least take weird risks. It's probably not a good idea to bite off Gale's hand in a BG3 Dark Urge playthrough, or to headbutt the massive racist guarding the docks in Disco or to stab a story-critical NPC in the face in Morrowind, but god is it fun. And there are so many occasions where going down the less obvious path, or just fucking around, will actually pay off. That might really be at the very heart of what makes TTRPGs so wonderful, and why games that draw from this philosophy really sing. You get to indulge yourself. Do way too many drugs in front of your straight-laced friend. Entice a bunch of murderous giants into a peaceful village. Sacrifice countless druids and nice refugees just so you can maybe score a date with a hot drow priestess. You can play a monstrous serial killer, an agent of chaos, a hot mess, or just constantly do the wrong things over and over again, and the game's still got your back. Like a GM with a soft spot for your absolute nonsense, the best RPGs have your back and will give you some great stories, even if you're being a complete tool. This is the secret sauce of a truly incredible RPG. And while I've focussed on three of my favourites here, there are so many brilliant RPGs thatgetthis, that use the foundations of tabletop roleplaying to do something special. There's the old-school TTRPG purity ofRoadwarden(also great if you fancy essentially playing through an entire fantasy novel); the dense flexibility ofRogue Trader, and the way it delights in just letting you make the worst possible decisions; the rich storytelling ofCitizen Sleeper, and its fascinating relationship to its dice mechanics; the wild world-building and enthusiastic skill checks ofSkald: Against the Black Priory; and the audacious scope ofCaves of Qud, with its potent combo of TTRPG freedom and simulation-heavy world generation. When videogame RPGs recognise the dizzying potential of both their TTRPG forebears and contemporaries, they tap into a magic more powerful than anything your lad Elminster can summon: a spell woven from player ingenuity, living stories and systems that, at all times, put the people using them first. This is the secret sauce of a truly incredible RPG. Fraser is the UK online editor and has actually met The Internet in person.

    "title": "Tim Cain talks about the challenges facing a Fallout remaster: 'How much are we now changing the original Fallout? Is this a quality of life thing or are you making a new game?'",
    "article_text": "Remastering one of the greatest RPGs of all time sounds like a pretty straightforward proposition, but Cain is here to remind us all that it's not. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Have you ever thought to yourself,wow, the original Fallout would be the perfect candidate for a remaster?Well, first, you are 100% correct. And second, OGFalloutlead Tim Cain says the process of doing so—if and when someone decides they're going to do it—is a whole lot more complicated than you might think Cain, as you may be aware, has made something of a habit of sharing deep-dive retrospectives on his past work, and his videos are generally informative, insightful, and entertaining. For his latest talk, you can add \"disappointing\" to that list, because while Cain isn't dead-set against the idea of a Fallout remaster, he does have a rather long list of obstacles that such an endeavor would face. First and foremost, legal issues are a big potential roadblock: Bethesda, which now owns the Fallout property, would have to green-light the whole thing, and music would presumably have to be re-licensed as well—a Fallout remaster without the Inkspots just would not fly, after all. Even with a thumbs-up from all involved—and as we've learned from fromNOLFover the past 25 years, that's no sure thing—Fallout's age is another problem: The game's audio and video libraries are proprietary, and it was compiled using the old Watcom compiler, which is itself aged, buggy, and very limited in capability. (Ironically, Cain said he found his original Watcom CD, but doesn't currently have an optical drive in his PC.) It's also not compatible with newer versions of DirectX, and while I'm not a programmer I would guess that would also prove something of a headache. But lawyer headaches and technical hurdles can be overcome—what's really interesting is what Cain described as the \"subjective\" approach to remastering the Fallout experience. Some bugs are obviously problems (and Fallout has its share) but others contribute to thefeelof Fallout: Cain said he could easily make companion AI \"way better,\" for instance, but \"better is subjective here. This would remove some of the jank, some of thefunjank, that people like. You know, Ian won't shoot his Uzi in burst mode at you.Accidentally.\" From there Cain ticks off a list of other things that could be changed, maybeshouldbe changed, but maybe not, too: The ability to finish Fallout without ever finding the water chip that's at the center of the game, for instance, or a bug in the code that prevents critical successes in chess games against ZAX the supercomputer. Both of those are technically bugs, but they're also at this point well-established parts of the Fallout mythos. Should they be corrected in a remaster? Similar questions hover over more granular aspects of the game, like difficulty, display resolutions, and of course the archaic Fallout UI. \"People really hated that long strip inventory we had, and the fact that when you added an item it went to the bottom so you had to scroll all the way down,\" Cain says. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"A simple fix would be, make [the] latest items added go to the top, be first in the list. How about a whole 'sort-by' option—sort by weight, sort by value, sort by recently added? How about a grid—how about we just make it instead of a strip, we make it a grid? That would be a whole bunch easier. But how much are we now changing the original Fallout? Is this a quality of life thing or are you making a new game?\" It's an interesting topic that goes way beyond just Fallout, and one that Cain has clearly put some thought into—which, to be clear, should not be taken as a suggestion that he's actively digging into a Fallout remaster: \"I'm not even sure I want to do this,\" he states emphatically near the start of his chat, \"and as you watch this video you'll figure out why.\" But he's also not rejecting the idea out of hand: While he has \"absolutely no interest\" in trying to untangle the legal part of the equation, Cain said he \"would love to dive in and work on some of these technical issues.\" As for the rest of it, he has some ideas but isn't looking for arguments—although arguments, he acknowledges, are inevitable. \"The bottom line is working on such a remaster should be enjoyable,\" Cain says to wrap things up. \"Discussions about these things should be fun. I do not feel like arguing about them but I do feel like discussing them in detail. I like doing that. Whoever has to remake this game is going to understand that some of those discussions are going to turn to arguments, and some of those subjective decisions do not have a correct answer and people are going to argue about what to do.\" Personally, I would love a Fallout remaster, ideally with a light touch—make it run on modern systems, make it look gooFalloutd, and otherwise leave it alone. (Except for the parts that shouldn't be left along, but that, as Cain said, we can argue about later.) There may not be much hope of that happening, but it does seem almost certain at this point thatFallout 3 Remasteredis on the way—and hey, I'll take that, too.

The longest recorded prison sentence served was just shy of 71 years.Charles Foussardwas incarcerated in 1903 after murdering a man and stealing his boots. At the age of 92, he died in prison. Over inOblivion Remastered, meanwhile, player Scribe_Of_Satire served a sentence of55,284 years, or20,178,790 days. Spotted by our pals atGamesRadar, Scribe_Of_Satire shared this dizzying prison sentence over on theOblivion subreddit. Before the cops grabbed them, our heroic thief had amassed a bounty of more than 2 billion gold. And how did they do this? Merely stealing goodies. The most impressive thing about this crime spree is that they never trespassed, never assaulted anyone, never killed anyone, and never once pinched a horse. They hardly even engaged in any pickpocketing. They merely pilfered from someone's pockets once. But they also stole over a million items. Which is quite a spree. To put this in context, 55,000 years ago Earth was in the middle of the last glacial cycle, the last ice age, and neanderthals were still stomping around. Unfortunately and unsurprisingly, Bethesda did not choose to model the passage of time to such a degree, so doing a prison stint like this will not see you exit your cell and discover a new world full of new species. Your dreams of seeing 20-metre-tall argonians ruling Tamriel will go unfulfilled. What Scribe_Of_Satire did discover was that being stuck in prison for so long gives the Tamriel calendar a bit of a stroke. When they were finally freed, it was the 5th of Morning Star, 3E -9,818. Clearly Bethesda just didn't include enough numbers, and no matter how long you wait, you'll never be able to leave the third era. I guess there isn't much of a downside to this kind of crime spree, then. Apart from the skill loss.

    "title": "Parries and timed blocks are the future of action games—and they've got a place in turn-based RPGs like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, too",
    "article_text": "Choose the right moment, and you can topple gods. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. This article first appeared in PC Gamer magazine issue 407 in February 2025, as part of our 'Why I Love' series. Every month we ask our writers something they love about videogames, and, more importantly, why. I finished Nine Sols just before 2024 ended—and I'm glad I did, because it's one of my favourite games of the year. Partially because of its gorgeous art direction, solid story, and exceptional fight design. But also because it happens to be following a trend that is downright pleasing to me: the \"soulslike\" genre is looking a whole lot more \"sekirolike\", lately. In case you missedFromSoftware's masterwork, here's a basic explanation. In Sekiro, your objective isn't just to reduce your enemy's health bar to zero—it's to break their posture. To do so, you need to apply damage to it. Taking chips off their health will accomplish this, but the real name of the game is timing your blocks just-so. The window to pull one off is far more forgiving than the all-or-nothing parries of past souls games, and the reward for doing so is proportionately smaller. Yet, grafting this system makes boss fights with that back-and-forth rhythm so much more common. Sekiro is sometimes described as a rhythm game in a trenchcoat, and that's pretty accurate. When you settle into the much yearned-for flow state, you can find yourself tapping that block button like one might bang a drum. But I actually don't really like rhythm games—and yet, I adore a good \"sekirolike\". Why is that? Well, I've got a couple of ideas. Some of FromSoftware's best boss fights have been its \"duels\". These are bosses that help you feel as if you are on even footing with your opponent—entering an arena not with an insurmountable wall of flesh, but with arival.The key to these is partly just aesthetic, but it's also the feeling of trading blows. That's hard to do when you can only block or dodge roll. A timed block system, however, matches the push and pull of a martial arts movie. Rather than sluggishly fat-rolling around wide swings, you're planting your feet and matching your enemy's strikes beat for beat before going in for your turn. It's full-tilt Wuxia (which is probably why wuxia-fest Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty used it). There's an intangible neurological glee I get when I walk into a boss room, get flattened by an inscrutable chain of sword-swings and then—little by little—start to download them. It's like the Matrix, if the Matrix suffered a terribly slow AOL-era landline connection. It's gotten to the point where I don't even care about beating the boss, anymore, I just want that sense of mastery. I don't have a problem, I can quit trying to no-hit Nine Sols' final boss any time I want. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Nine Sols expanded on this with the \"Unbounded Counter\": You need to pre-emptively hold down the block button to charge it, and then release at the right moment. The catch being, you can only charge it for so long before you whiff your defense entirely. Succeed, though, and you'll send your foe reeling, no matter how big their blow is. Which leads me to the other half of the coin of my love for this mechanic—because some games let you parryanything. Since time immemorial, we've worshipped at the altar of the underdog. David fells Goliath with a well-placed slingshot, Odysseus clings to a fig tree to evade Charybdis—you get the idea. There's something in our brains predisposed to adore the idea of a little guy choosing just the right moment to strike, and defying all odds. Souls games are similar, putting you in the shoes of a little guy, and then training you up to meet each Goliath with a \"nah, I'd win.\" In my mind, the timed block and the parry are the closest a game can get to that mythological feeling of toppling a giant. In contrast to the idea of a duel, this benefit of the timed block is a seemingly infinite suspension of disbelief that we have for parrying when we're behind the wheel. If I was asked to believe that a small robot deflected a giant's building-sized fist by raising their own at the right time in a TV show, I'd roll my eyes. In Ultrakill, though, the feat of batting away The Corpse of King Minos' giga-swings with nothing but your spindly synthetic arm is rad as hell. Okay, I might cheer for that on the silver screen too, but the point is I'd require worldbuilding and setup for it. V1 doesn't need Chekhov's gun, he just does it. Since I wrote this piece back in February, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 came out and continued to prove me right—the game benefits tremendously from the inclusion of parries for the reasons stated above. Especially with its post-game superbosses. There was something tremendously satisfying about fighting Simon, who could kill any of my party in one swing of his blade, and standing my ground in the face of those impossible odds. In my conclusion here, I say parries are the \"future of soulslike games\", but ol' 33 has taught me it's got a place in other genres, too. Personally, I think the timed block is the future of soulslike games. It just unlocks so many possibilities, combining so satisfyingly with so many elements of your average soulslike, that I'm surprisedElden Ringdidn't have it (outside of a Hardtear introduced in Shadow of the Erdtree). Let me tap my way through Malenia's Waterfowl Dance, Hidetaka Miyazaki. I promise it'll be cool as hell.

    "title": "Oblivion Remastered is great and all, but Morrowind remains the Bethesda RPG that I could play forever",
    "article_text": "Vvardenfalling in love again. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's strange experiencing a sense of urgency in a game I've played for hundreds of hours. But that's what happens when I begin a new adventure in Morrowind: a Pavlovian response that makes me want to charge out of the character creation section and start exploring, even though I know I've seen it all before. This article first appeared in PC Gamer magazine issue 408 in March 2025, as part of our 'Reinstall' series. Every month we load up a beloved classic—and find out whether it holds up to our modern gaming sensibilities. Before I can even get to that, however, are the waves of nostalgia. Hearing the creak of timber ships and the reassuring calm of Azura's voice rockets me back to 2002, and the overwhelming promise of freedom, the likes of which, back then, I'd never experienced. Watching the intro reminds me of the stories sparked from my previous experiences: vampire knights, noble savages, reluctant messiahs, hired killers. It's abandoned shacks full of books, sunrises at the foot of statues. I'm getting ahead—or perhaps behind—myself. I'm not even off the ship yet. The guard arrives and all I can think about is rushing past him so he doesn't slow me down as I sprint to freedom: a manoeuvre I've repeated hundreds of times to speed up the intro. In the best possible way, the opening 30 minutes is pure muscle memory. I make my character, steal everything I can from the first room so I can sell it, collect Fargoth's ring, return it to him to improve my reputation with his friend, Arrille. Even this small act reminds me why the game is so special: I'm five minutes in and I have a contact in the first area, whose backstory I know, and a preferred vendor, from whom I'll get better prices. This specificity is what makes the game sing. On the one hand, Arrille is just another High Elf trader with the exact same face and voice as a hundred other NPCs; on the other, he's the person who sold me my first sword, and a character who means more to me than most of the cast of Skyrim. I wonder if the people and places in Morrowind have the strange emotional resonance precisely because it's a simpler game than its scions. There's more room here for players to use their imaginations, carve their own stories. I'm filling in narrative gaps that aren't present in Skyrim or Oblivion. I roll a Redguard and choose a custom class, specialising in skills I know will help me survive Morrowind's often frustrating opening hours. This choice is mainly to aid with combat: I want to begin with the highest possible Long Blade skill, so I don't spend the next six hours swinging at Cliff Racers and missing. But it's also a narrative leg up: I decide to make my hero, Mundas, a privateer, because it a) feels like a good match to my skill set and b) it sounds more civilised than pirate. Skilled of blade, sharp of tongue, swift of foot; Mundas is the consummate adventurer. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. From here, it's a mix of routine adventure and semi-religious experience. Getting off the boat and seeing the light reflecting off the water, Silt Strider shrouded in the distant mist, is like revisiting the locked storeroom in my mind palace. I'd forgotten how much this world means to me. The stupidest moments suddenly feel transformative: murdering smugglers, fighting my first mudcrab, hearing Tarhiel wail as he falls to his ignominious death. It's glorious to be back. I could take public transport to my next destination, Balmora, but adventure dictates that I use the slower, more interesting path. I remember my first journey from Seeyda Neen to Balmora: how long it took, how often I got lost, how I had to use an actual, physical map for guidance. And, doing it again, I can see why. I stop off at Pelgiad and accidentally make special friends with a horny Khajit called Ahnassi after she compliments my smooth moves. For some players, their adventure would end there: engaged to a gregarious cat-lady before they've even completed the first quest. It's like a trap. There's so much else to see, even on this short journey. As well as all the distracting quests—including a damsel-in-distress who asks you to locate the robber she's fallen in love with—the geography itself is strangely affecting. I love the horror and weirdness of Ghostgate, and the knowledge that the main quest will eventually take me there. I'm still captivated by the misty, liminal, mushroomy landscape. Even public transport, infrastructure, and the economy feel alien, all based on the proliferation of giant insects in Vvardenfell. It's such an unusual, specific take on high fantasy that it still feels fresh. The dragons and trolls and forests of Oblivion and Skyrim, by comparison, feel numbingly generic. By the time I finally reach Balmora, I've seen enough distractions to make me feel like I've already been on adventure. And I'm met with conflicting feelings. On the one hand, I'm glad to be out of howling winds and into a place of comfort. The ash storms and howling winds of Morrowind make getting inside even more appealing. But another part of me wants to keep walking north, to the strange, crab-shell buildings of Ald'Ruhn, past the West Gash, all the way to Khuul and the northern shores of the island. For some reason, for me, the geographical changes here are more tangible and compelling than in anything that followed. I might be imagining it, but certain areas feel like they have moredanger, too; the further from the starting area I stray, the more often I find myself fleeing from flocks of blighted cliff racers or roaming daedra. I stick around Balmora, mainly so I can reacquaint myself with the locals. I drop off a package to Caius Cosades, a member of the Emperor's spy network who's gone so deep undercover that he's accidentally become a genuine drug addict. He's one of Bethesda's best written characters: a fatherly tangle of honesty and ambiguity, who guides you through the main quest and supports you when you declare yourself the reincarnation of an ancient Dunmer god; a level of support I aspire to provide as a dad and/or manager. This is one of the elements that benefits from the reams of text. There's more depth and subtlety. I find myself trusting people who Caius trusts, and it guides my choices. And even the early missions introduce you to the depth and ambiguity of the game. Yes, I'm killing rats and dealing with egg poachers, but I'm also dealing with Eydis Fire-eye, a Fighters Guild member who assigns quests early in the game. And while some of them seem normal—see the rats above—it quickly becomes apparent that not all is as it seems. The cool thing here is that the onus is on me, as the player, to dig deeper. By asking trusted contacts, such as Caius, I can end up uncovering the rot within the heart of the Fighter's Guild. Or I can just do as I'm told. It's magnificent. To finish with, I decide to explore a Dwemer ruin at the request of one of Caius's contacts. He wants a mysterious puzzle box, which absolutely feels like the sort of cursed artefact that I don't even want to be in the same room as, let alone hold. And evenfindingthe ruin is a challenge, because Morrowind doesn't have map markers. Instead, I have to follow vague instructions in my journal, like a waddling tourist asking for directions to the Arc de Triomphe in broken French. When I finally arrive, I delve too deeply into the ruins, reaching a ghost-infested lava pit filled with monsters I can't fight because I only have an iron saber. I heroically flee, and, on the way out, I accidentally discover a room that contains the puzzle box. This, then, encapsulates the joy and madness of Morrowind. The item isn't on any map. It's not in the possession of a notable NPC. It's on the bottom shelf of a Dwemer MALM bookcase, in a room most people will walk right past. You engage with your surroundings in Morrowind, or you fail. It's insane. And I love it. I could play this game forever. There's an enforced slowness that will make some players gnaw through their mouse mats, but, for me, it adds a sense of narrative richness that's rarely been bettered since. It takes time to do everything. I can level up skills faster in real life than I can in-game. When you finally ascend through the ranks of the Fighter's Guild, for instance, it feels like it has value. Pace and ambiguity improve it, somehow. You're not blindly waddling towards a map marker: you're reading descriptions, analysing your surroundings, becoming familiar with the world. I know the towering fungi and volcanic holloways of Vvardenfell with the same clarity as the pastry counter at Greggs. There's nothing stopping me playing Skyrim like this—or modding it to be more like Morrowind—but it's not just a case of avoiding fast travel. The design decisions are supported by a foundation of detail and wonder that's less present in later games. It's the difference between wearing armour that consists of four parts, compared to eight. I will never be as proud of the set in Skyrim as the one I had to fight hard to find in Morrowind. I hope that the upcoming Elder Scrolls game has a similar level of complexity. I'm not expecting levitation, magic locks, spears, staffs, short blades and throwing weapons; just a world of complexity and mystery, where my boss is a drug addict and I can accidentally marry a cat.

    "title": "It turns out the gigantic rats you have to kill in so many RPG quests are totally real, and now I need to apologise to RPG designers",
    "article_text": "But we still shouldn't be squishing them, because they are adorable. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Before you get to start slaying dragons or thwarting the plans of evil deities, RPGs tend to test your mettle with more mundane fare. Typically this involves a filthy tavern with a rodent problem. It's such an ancient trope that RPG designers have been poking fun at it for decades, like 2004'sThe Bard's Tale, which sees you slay a single, solitary rat, celebrate your heroism, and cowardly run away after a much larger rat appears and sets you on fire. So making fun of the trope has become a trope itself, and most prospective adventurers are probably just a little bit sick of these cellar antics. Often RPG designers will try to spice things up by making the rats very large, but that's always felt a bit half-arsed to me. You can't just make a tiny thing big and then call it a day. Except, these massive rodents absolutely do exist and I really need to apologise to them and the RPG designers who've been trying to give them their time in the spotlight. Now, I've always been aware of the existence of large rats, but I always just assumed they were merely chunkier versions of their more common cousins. It turns out, though, that the Gambian pouched rat is a whopping 88cm in length, nose to tail. That's the size of a small dog. They are hench and cute. But I'm a bit more impressed by a slightly smaller but still very large rodent: the subalpine woolly rat. These hefty critters can be 85cm long, but they stand out even more due to their impressive fluffiness. AsLive Sciencereports, we've only known about them since they were identified via museum specimens in 1989, but none of them had ever been documented in the wild. Until now. František Vejmělka, a doctoral candidate at the Czech Academy of Sciences and the University of South Bohemia, has published a study in thejournal Mammalia, documenting his observation of these beefy rodents in New Guinea. He used camera traps to photograph and film them in their natural habitat, with critical assistance from the area's indigenous people. \"These are the first specimen records in 30 years for this spectacular mammal poorly known to science,\" the author says in his study's abstract. Via email, Vejmělk explained to me that the subalpine woolly rat belongs to the largest rodents among the murid family, along with cloud rats from the Philippines. Here in the UK, the most common species of rodents referred to as rats belong to the murid family. The Gambian pouched rat, mentioned above, belongs to a different family: African nesomyid rodents. Subalpine woolly rats can climb trees to chomp on their leaves, nest in burrows, and while they have sharp teeth, you won't find them trying to feast upon the ankles of drunken bar patrons. Speaking to Live Science, Vejmělka provided some insight into how they grew to such a prodigious size. \"Their ancestors arrived from Asia to the island completely absent of any other terrestrial placental mammals (only marsupials and monotremes),\" adding that they might be an example of insular gigantism, where animals on islands end up larger than those on the mainland. So maybe these giant RPG rats aren't so silly after all, but I'd still love it if we could just stop killing them. Rats are lovely. And these fluffly lads deserve to be left in peace, to nibble on leaves and climb trees. You can check out photographs of these massive rats, and their habitat, in thesupplementary material provided with the study.

Y'all ever see a chicken try to knife a duck to death? Y'all ever see a seagull try to beat a duck with a police baton? I hadn't earlier, but now I have thanks to the demo trailer for goofily parodic shooter Escape from Duckov, which is getting a new demo on May 29 that'll last until July 1. It is, if you haven't heard, a kind of singleplayer, top-down, extraction looter-shooter about odd little birds with guns and knives and such. You know, all the trappings of an ultra-serious mega-sweaty mil-sim-lite extraction shooter—no one game in particular I'm thinking of here. Anyway it's that, but with ducks. (And pigeons and geese and seagulls and chickens, etc.) Escape from Duckov's first limited-time demo shot to fourth place on the most-played Steam demo charts mostly because it's a very approachable, accessible twist on the greater extraction formula. In between forays into the wide and violently bird-based world you use supplies to improve your basement lair, where you can upgrade and stockpile weapons. Now developer Team Soda and publisher Bilibili are going to deal out another demo round of Duckov. Which you may be interested in if you missed it last time, for example, because you were playingroughly 83 other game demos at the time. Or if you prefer to play via the Epic Games Store, which alongside Steam will be an option for this demo period and for Duckov's launch proper later this year.

No, there is not a double letter in today's puzzle. A good starting word can be the difference between victory and defeat with the daily puzzle, but once you've got the basics, it's much easier to nail down those Wordle wins. And as there's nothing quite like a small victory to set you up for the rest of the day, here are a few tips to help set you on the right path: There's no racing against the clock with Wordle so you don't need to rush for the answer. Treating the game like a casual newspaper crossword can be a good tactic; that way, you can come back to it later if you're coming up blank. Stepping away for a while might mean the difference between a win and a line of grey squares. Let's get going. The answer to the May 26 (1437) Wordle isDRONE. Past Wordle answers can give you some excellent ideas for fun starting words that keep your daily puzzle-solving fresh. They are also a good way to eliminate guesses for today's Wordle, as the answer is unlikely to be repeated. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Here are some recent Wordle answers: Wordle gives you six rows of five boxes each day, and you'll need to work out which secret five-letter word is hiding inside them to keep up your winning streak. You shouldstart with a strong wordlike ARISE, or any other word that contains a good mix of common consonants and multiple vowels. You'll also want to avoid starting words with repeating letters, as you're wasting the chance to potentially eliminate or confirm an extra letter. Once you hit Enter, you'll see which ones you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second guess should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. With a bit of luck, you should have some coloured squares to work with and set you on the right path. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it wassold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes. When baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do. She's now PC Gamer's word game expert, taking on the dailyWordlepuzzle to give readers a hint each and every day. Her Wordle streak is truly mighty. Somehow Kerry managed to get away with writing regular features onold Japanese PC games, telling today's PC gamers about some of the most fascinating and influential games of the '80s and '90s.

    "article_text": "Justice for Throgg. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In March, Creative Assembly revealed the next DLC for Total War: Warhammer 3 would featureDechala, a six-armed snake lady, as the legendary lord for a Slaanesh faction. In the latestdev chat videothey've shared some more details about the DLC, which is called Tides of Torment, and also features a Norscan faction led by a treacherous mutated Norscan sorcerer called Sayl the Faithless. That's one of those names that tells you upfront someone isn't trustworthy, and yet apparently people keep trusting Sayl and he keeps betraying them. His whole mechanical deal will apparently revolve around betrayal and manipulation, though he'll also be able to summon a special Chaos Spawn called the Nightmaw, which incorporates the bodies of the three wizards he first betrayed. What a jerk. The Norse will also get a new generic hero (a fimir noble), and a new monster (the chimera), as well as other units still to be revealed. The faction's existing mechanics, in particular the Monstrous Arcanum and the Chaos confederation system, are up for a rework and the other Norse legendary lords will get voice updates. Finally, Throgg Wintertooth, King of the Trolls, will have a voice that makes him sound like the smartypants he actually is. The dev chat covers what we can expect from the next update as well as the DLC, with version 6.2 promising an expansion and rebalancing of ancillaries in particular. The dev team mentions that players in the Proving Grounds beta zone have been providing a lot of quality feedback that's being incorporated as well. We can expect that fairly soon, along with some info about the third legendary lord to come in Tides of Torment, which is due later in summer.

    "article_text": "Sorting through every new game on Steam so you don't have to. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. 2025 games: Upcoming releasesBest PC games: All-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest MMOs: Massive worldsBest RPGs: Grand adventures On an average day about a dozen new games are released on Steam. And while we think that's a good thing, it can be understandably hard to keep up with. Potentially exciting gems are sure to be lost in the deluge of new things to play unless you sort through every single game that is released on Steam. So that’s exactly what we’ve done. If nothing catches your fancy this week, we've gathered thebest PC gamesyou can play right now and a running list of the2025 gamesthat are launching this year. Steam ‌page‌‌Release:‌ May 23Developer:‌ Retro Reactor Two Strikes is a 2D fighter set in 16th century Japan, or rather, the afterlife of 16th century Japan. As one of eight fighters you'll engage in tense blade-oriented scraps to determine who gets a chance to return to Earth and face the wrath of Oda Nobunaga. Historical backdrop aside, it's basically a sword-oriented, precision focused fighter with some of the most gorgeous illustrations I've seen outside blockbuster offerings like Guilty Gear or Grandblue Fantasy Versus. Truly, the screenshots do it no justice: it's a gorgeous thing in action. Features a single-player campaign, but most importantly, online and local PvP and cross-platform multiplayer. Steam‌ ‌page‌Release:‌ May 23Developer:‌ D&A Studios This week's mandatory horror is another first-person paranormal investigation outing from the creator of the well-receivedConrad Stevenson's Paranormal P.I. In keeping with that style, it exchanges excessive gore and jump scares for a more technical approach: you'll actually be operating machines used in real life to investigate the paranormal (don't ask me how these work). I guess it wends closer to a puzzle-centric adventure than survival horror per se, but make no mistake: it's definitely spooky AF, albeit with a familiar \"haunted mansion\" setting. Steam‌ ‌page‌‌Release:‌ May 26Developers:‌ Bluecurse StudiosSnacko is a chillaxed life sim and town builder which grabbed my attention mostly because you play as a cat. All the familiar Animal Cross / Stardew Valley beats are here: meeting and potentially romancing a cast of other animals, meticulously plotting out townships and interiors to your liking, plundering mines and the environment for resources, and—most importantly—maintaining a cheerful pastel cuteness all the while. Reviews are \"very positive\" on this one, and I really like its art style, which mixes 2D sprites with low-detail 3D environments. Steam pageRelease:‌ May 24Developer:‌ CodeManu, Endless Coffee Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Tinkerlands is another game about grinding for resources and building stuff, only with more prominent survival and combat elements. Either alone or with up to four friends, you explore a handful of islands on the hunt for materials to bolster your settlement, which naturally involves defending yourself against mindlessly hostile creatures. Crafting and farming? Yes, of course. Fishing? Why, yes. Tinkerlands is an early access affair: it'll get big expansions, endgame content and much more between now and its eventual 1.0 release. Steam‌ ‌page‌‌Release:‌ May 20Developer:‌ Clifftop Games The originalKathy Raincame out in 2016, long before the more recent boom in retro-styled point 'n' click adventures. So studio Clifftop Games knows what they're doing, especially when it comes to lavish LucasArts / Sierra-style pixel art. This instalment sees private eye Kathy Rain tackling a serial killer case, which takes her to a variety of rundown locales in a 1990s-era American city. Protagonist Kathy is arch and down-at-heel, and if I were to point to a '90s predecessor I'd probably mention the Gabriel Knight games, though modern point 'n' click studios tend to make their puzzles far less arcane and thus, parseable for mere mortals.

    "title": "'They're very determined, suddenly, to see your game fail': Former Dragon Age writer calls out 'anti-fans' who bet on games failing before launch",
    "article_text": "David Gaider criticized the way gamers have come to celebrate certain games' failures. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Former BioWare writer David Gaider, who worked on the likes of Baldur's Gate 2, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, and the first three Dragon Age games (not including Veilguard), recently spoke out about an issue he dubbed \"anti-fans\" inan interview with GamesRadar. We've seen it happen time and again: A subset of players and content creators catch wind of some detail they don't like in a project and make it a personal mission to spend the lead up to launch bashing the game as much as humanly possible. Sometimes they'll claim victory with sales flops like Concord orDragon Age: The Veilguard, and otherwise pretend like nothing ever happened when a targeted gamereviews and sells well, like Assassin's Creed Shadows. \"The difficulty is if, suddenly, you end up with anti-fans. Then they turn from what you want, fans who would go out and spread word of your game and get people interested,\" said Gaider. \"But if you get anti-fans, they sort of do the opposite. They're very determined, suddenly, to see your game fail as sort of a lesson to others who would make games of the same type, right? And that, honestly, these days, there's some element of that present in almost all fandoms, but it's always sort of been there for RPGs in particular.\" Gaider went on to explain how he's seen \"fandom\" culture exacerbate this problem. \"More and more fandoms are making the things that they're fans of integral to their identity, and if it's integral to their identity, anything that affects it or insults it, insults them,\" he said. \"So they are so invested in making it what they imagine that, like I said, if they turn into the anti-fan, suddenly it's their personal investment in seeing that fail, or seeing the developers who made that decision be punished.\" According to Gaider, this type of hostility is pushing a lot of game developers to minimize their public presence. That can have the adverse effect of making it harder for developers to interact with non-hostile players or find needles of genuine criticism in the hay bale of angry culture war comments. Unfortunately, the media and cultural environment that produces this behavior doesn't seem likely to change any time soon. We're even already gearing up for our next flashpoint. Alongside genuine concerns aboutMarathon's genre shiftfrom Destiny and well-earned criticism of Bungieplagiarizing from the artist Antireal, a subset of players appears to have become invested in it failing financially in the mean-spirited way Gaider described.

    "title": "A Roblox farming game made by a teenager 'in like three days' had 8.9 million players online at the same time—Steam peaked at 11.5 million across all games on the same day",
    "article_text": "Grow a Garden's popularity on TikTok and YouTube suggests it's not bots. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. All signs point to the biggest PC game of 2025 by number of players beingGrow a Garden, a Roblox game launched by a teenage developer which just hit a peak player count of nearly 9 million⁠—that is to say, all logged in and actively playing the game at once. That's almost three times more than Player Unknown's Battlegrounds, whichholds the record on Steam. On May 21, gaming newsletterGame Filepublished an investigation by Nicole Carpenter into Grow a Garden, including hands-on impressions and comments from its lead developer. At the time of Game File's report, Grow a Garden had millions of players, peaking at 5 million online at the same time the previous weekend. The Roblox Game \"Grow a Garden\" has broke the most Active Concurrent Players in one Experience ONCE AGAIN, with a whopping 8.9 MILLION Active Players. 👨‍🌾🌳#RobloxDevs #RobloxDev #Breaking #Roblox #GrowaGarden #Million #WorldRecord #CCU #Experience pic.twitter.com/wetIJCTwleMay 24, 2025 According to multipleRoblox content creatorsand screenshots of Grow a Garden's publicly visible player count on the Roblox UI, a concerted,record-breakingevent yesterdayresulted in8.9 million concurrent playersin Grow a Garden. That's more people than live in New York City, and about 2.6 million away from the peak number of players in every game on Steam put together that same day. Below are some more numbers for context. It's a Roblox game where you grow a garden. Seriously, it's that simple, and it was first released on March 25. Game File compared its success to that of Farmville, Stardew Valley, and Animal Crossing. People really enjoy low-stakes, violence-free games where you cultivate something. Roblox's diversity of sub-games has always reminded me of Garry's Mod, where you could amble into a server and find an entire universe of role playing, custom rules, functionally an entirely different game to what you experience otherwise, and Roblox has developed its own ecosystem of professional developers making games for it. Once upon a time, Isampled a bafflingly well-made Squid Game, uh,gamein Robloxat the height of season one mania. Eh, it's a living. Players in Grow a Garden get a plot in an instance of the game shared with a few others. It has its own sub-currency earned by selling your produce, in addition to the omnipresent, real-money purchasable Robux. You plant your crops, sell them at a profit, and get better seeds to do it all over again. The plants keep growing when you're not there, encouraging a casual, leave and come back playstyle like a lot of mobile and idle games. There are also, naturally, Robux-gated ways to speed this all up or unlock new mechanics. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Yes, according to Janzen Madsen, owner of professional Roblox game-making studio, Splitting Point, which bought a stake in the game and took over managing it. \"We partnered with the original creator around 1,000 CCU, maybe 2,000,\" Madsen told Game File. The original dev still owns around \"50% of the game,\" with another professional Roblox studio, Do Big, having a minority share in addition to Splitting Point. According to Madsen, the original dev \"literally made the game in like three days,\" and now Grow a Garden is a behemoth phenomenon, if those concurrent player counts are to be believed. It doesn't look like it, but we only have Roblox's self-reported numbers and anecdotal evidence to base that on. Roblox definitely has a nontrivial amount of bot users, but so do most games and social media platforms⁠—except for X, \"The Everything App,\"where they got rid of all the bots. As reported by Game File, financial research company TD Cowen made just such an accusation regarding Grow a Garden hitting the 5 million CCU mark, only to retract it a few days later. TD Cowen cited \"an enormous upsurge\" of account creation in the Philippines and Indonesia in the preceding months as \"circumstantial but strong evidence\" pointing to bot manipulation of Roblox's discovery algorithm in Grow a Garden's favor. While TD Cowen still says that the spike occurred as reported, it no longer alleges that it was somehow fraudulent, manipulative, or directly tied to Grow a Garden. In the absence of a third party source of numbers like SteamDB for Steam, Roblox's own data on individual games, included on its browser, is what we have to go on⁠—the primary evidence for the 8.9 million CCU peak is screenshots of the player count on Grow a Garden's store page when the event occurred. 2025 games: Upcoming releasesBest PC games: All-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together A Roblox company spokesperson told Game File that it did not suspect Grow a Garden's developers of anything untoward. \"Grow a Garden's global success is fueled by exceptional user retention, vibrant social interactions⁠—with friends driving play⁠—and strong Robux engagement,\" the spokesperson said. \"Our preliminary analysis confirms genuine popularity, not artificial inflation, validating the game's authentic community-driven growth.\" And there is plenty of evidence out there for Grow a Garden having genuine, grassroots popularity, it's just not in major publications or even non-Roblox-centric gaming circles on YouTube and Twitch. A quickYouTube searchturns up a staggering number of Grow a Garden guides with nontrivial viewer counts, while it'sbooming even harder on TikTokand YouTube Shorts. I really don't know what to do with all that information. I don't play Roblox, and the only people I know who do are my friend's kids. There is a cognitive dissonance to learning that it's far more popular than any game I've ever covered or played, bigger thanElden Ring, Minecraft, Fortnite, the Beatles, and Jesus. I guess I'll just go back to enjoying the scrappy indie unknown, Baldur's Gate 3.

    "article_text": "Phishing emails seemingly originate from a legitimate source When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Cybercriminals are abusing a legitimate Google service to bypass email protection mechanisms and deliver phishing emails straight to people’s inboxes. Cybersecurity researchers KnowBe4, who first spotted the attacks, have warned the crooks are using Google AppSheet, a no-code application development platform for mobile and web apps, and through its workflow automation were able to send emails using the \"noreply@appsheet.com\" address. The phishing emails are mimicking Facebook, and are designed to trick people into giving away their login credentials, and2FA codes, for the social media platform. Get Keeper Personal for just $1.67/month, Keeper Family for just $3.54/month, and Keeper Business for just $7/month ​Keeper is a cybersecurity platform primarily known for its password manager and digital vault, designed to help individuals, families, and businesses securely store and manage passwords, sensitive files, and other private data. It uses zero-knowledge encryption and offers features like two-factor authentication, dark web monitoring, secure file storage, and breach alerts to protect against cyber threats. Preferred partner (What does this mean?) The emails, which were sent in-bulk and on a fairly large scale, were coming from a legitimate source, successfully bypassingMicrosoftand Secure Email Gateways (SEGs) that rely on domain reputation and authentication checks (SPF, DKIM, DMARC). Furthermore, since AppSheets can generate unique IDs, each email was slightly different, which also helped bypass traditional detection systems. The emails themselves spoofed Facebook. The crooks tried to trick victims into thinking they infringed on someone’s intellectual property, and that their accounts were due to be deleted within 24 hours. Unless, of course, they submit an appeal through a conveniently placed “Submit an Appeal” button in the email. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Clicking on the button leads the victim to a landing page impersonating Facebook, where they can provide their login credentials and 2FA codes, which are then relayed to the attackers. The page is hosted on Vercel which, KnowBe4 says, is a “reputable platform known for hosting modern web applications”. This further strengthens the entire campaign’s credibility. The attack has a few additional contingencies. The first attempt at logging in returns a “wrong password” result - not because the victim typed in the wrong credential - but in order to confirm the submission. Also, the 2FA codes that are provided are immediately submitted to Facebook and in return - the crooks grab a session token which grants them persistence even after apasswordchange.

Theincredibly popular TV adaptation was renewed for a third season in April 2025, so we'll be treated to another season ofThe Last of UsTV showsometime soon. While we wait for it, there's plenty to keep you occupied. Below, I've covered what we know aboutThe Last of Us' third season so far, including its likely cast and story specifics. I'll also offer my prediction on its launch date and discuss whether a fourth season will be needed to tell the full story depicted inThe Last of Us Part II, aka the game on which seasons 2 and 3 are based. Full spoilers followforThe Last of Usseason 2and the second entry in Naughty Dog's post-apocalyptic video game franchise, so proceed at your own risk. It can’t be for nothing. Season 3 is coming. #TheLastOfUs pic.twitter.com/q5HxyvK9O6April 9, 2025 As of May 2025,The Last of Usseason 3doesn't have a confirmed release date. Considering the critically-acclaimedHBOTV Original's next season hasn't started filming yet, that isn't a huge shock. However, I wouldn't be surprised if plenty of pre-production work has already been done. Script work, location scouting, lining up a filming schedule, and many other developmental details have likely been ongoing for months. If they have, I'd be amazed if principal photography doesn't begin in earnest before 2025 ends. What would that mean for season 3's eventual launch? I think a mid-2027 release is most likely. Season 2 made its debut just over two years after its predecessor ended, so if the series maintains that development trajectory, a June or July 2027 arrival for season 3 isn't out of the question. No. As I said, principal photography hasn't started yet, and even when it gets underway, it'll be a long time before a trailer is released. Once one is, I'll update this section. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Big spoilers immediately follow forThe Last of Usseason 2. Based on how last season ended, here are the actors (and the characters they portray) I expect to see again inThe Last of Usseason 3: You might be surprised to see Mazino, Lord, and Barer's names among that contingent. After all, their characters – Jess, Owen, and Mel – died in the season 2 finale. However, with season 3's early episodes set to jump back in time (read more about this in the story section below), this trio won't have met their demise when theMaxshow's third season premieres. The same can be said of Gabrielle's Nora, who'll still be alive during the period to be revisited in season 3's opening chapters. Unless Joel similarly returns in flashback sequences, we definitely won't see Pedro Pascal again.Joel met his end inThe Last of Usseason 2 episode 2,and, while Pascal reprised his role in last season's sixth episode, that entry depicted the five years between the end of season 1 and the start of season 2. So, don't bet on the fan-favorite actor returning as Joel once more. There's also the potential for other surprising omissions. Speaking toVariety, O'Hara said she's been told her character, Gail, won't appear in season 3, as it's not likely to spend much time in Jackson, Wyoming, aka the town where Ellie and many of the show's characters live. If Gail doesn't appear, other supporting characters, including Seth and Maria, may not do so, either. As for newcomers to the series, there are a couple of key characters inThe Last of Us Part IIwho didn't appear in season 2. I won't spoil who they are, but given their importance to the story that'll be told in season 3, you can expect cast announcements about this pair to be made in due course. Full spoilers immediately follow forThe Last of Usseason 2 andThe Last of Us Part II. The Last of Usseason 3 doesn't have a story synopsis yet. However, based on how its forebear ended – read my articleexplainingThe Last of Usseason 2's endingfor more on what happened – andThe Last of Us Part II's story, we have a good idea of how things will pan out. As I mention in my ending explainer, season 3 will shift into reverse gear and head back in time 72 hours to the period before and during its predecessor's finale. That's because season 2's final episode ends with a scene starring Abby, which takes place three days prior to her single-handedly storming the Seattle theater where Ellie and company are holed up in the seventh episode. For those who haven't playedThe Last of Us Part II, Abby is not only the deuteragonist of that story, but also a player-controlled character for around half of the game's total playtime. Events centered around Abby are integral to tellingPart II's full story. What does that mean forThe Last of Usseason 3? It'll be Abby-centric, with its opening chapters likely showing us what Abby was up to before Ellie and Dina arrive in Seattle, and then where Abby is during this three-day period. Part IIdoes this, so there's no reason to suspect HBO's live-action retelling won't take a similar storytelling approach. That being, showing Abby's side of the Seattle-based story, which runs parallel to Ellie and Dina's, before season 2 episode 7's shocking penultimate scene brings them together. As for what Abby's side of the story entails, I won't spoil anything significant here. But, considering there are a lot of unanswered questions – not to mention narrative gaps that need filling in regarding Abby, her friends, the Seraphites, and the Washington Liberation Front – from season 2, its follow-up has some heavy lifting to do from a narrative standpoint. Thankfully, it sounds like there'll be more time to cover all of the above. Interviewed byColliderin May, co-showrunner and executive producer Craig Mazin said: \"I think there’s a decent chance that season 3 will be longer than season 2, just because the manner of that narrative and the opportunities it affords us are a little different.\" Of course, that could mean one of thebest Max shows' third season only has one more entry (eight) than its predecessor did (seven). Some fans were a little frustrated that season 2 was shorter than the show's debut outing, so an installment with more chapters should appease them.Season 2 included plenty of brand-new material that wasn't seen in the games, too, so season 3 could be approached in the same way and, by proxy, have a higher episode count. Depending on where you live,The Last of Us' first twoseasons are available to stream on different platforms. In the US, you can watch it on the cable network HBO as well as Max, aka one of the world'sbest streaming services. Those of you who aren't subscribed to the streamer should read ourMax priceguide to see how much it costs to sign up and ourMax free trialarticle to learn if you can try it before you buy. Meanwhile, UK audiences can catch it on Sky Atlantic and Now TV. Australian viewers can also tune into Max to watch both seasons, but if you're not signed up to Warner Bros. Discovery's super streamer, you can also catch it on Foxtel. It's not been officially confirmed yet, butThe Last of Usseason 3 isn't expected to be the final installment. The Last of Usseasons 2 and 3 were supposed to tell the full story depicted inThe Last of Us Part II. But, speaking in February, HBO TV chief Francesca Orsi indicated thatHBO's adaptation ofThe Last of Uscould run for four seasons. In the same Collider article I linked to in this guide's plot section, Mazin also remarked that \"there’s no way to complete this narrative in a third season. Hopefully, we’ll earn our keep enough to come back and finish it in a fourth\". It sounds like another season could be in the offing after the show's third entry, then. But how will Mazin and company stretch outThe Last of Us Part II's story across three seasons Initially, I suspected that, ifThe Last of Us Part II's story was wrapped up in season 3, a fourth and final season might include plot elements that Naughty Dog may have been considering forThe Last of Us Part III. Right now, a third entry in Naughty Dog's incredibly popular video game franchise hasn't been announced. Naughty Dog president Neil Druckmann has also saidfans shouldn't \"bet on there being more\"– i.e. the continuation of Ellie's story in another game – anytime soon. Druckmann and his inner circle are the only ones who know if more than a story concept was ever devised forPart III. Nonetheless, if a third game isn't going to be made, there's no reason why its plot elements can't be fleshed out and depicted in HBO's TV adaptation instead. That said, speaking on episode 457 of theSacred Symbols podcast, Druckmann indicated that, if a fourth season is greenlit, it'll simply wrap up the story told inPart II. The potential inclusion of brand-new material set during events of that game (and, by proxy, its TV adaptation) aside, then, don't expect a possible fourth season to contain post-Part IInarrative beats.

    "article_text": "Campaign is a \"significant departure\" from earlier video-borne malware attacks When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Hackers are posting AI-generated videos on TikTok to trick users into downloading infostealingmalware, cybersecurity researchers Trend Micro have warned. The premise is simple: the attackers use AI to generate numerous videos demonstrating how to easily “activate” Windows andMicrosoftOffice, or enable “premium features” in apps such as Spotify or CapCut. They then share these videos on TikTok, whose algorithm makes it more likely to turn the video viral, making the success of the attack more likely. Get Keeper Personal for just $1.67/month, Keeper Family for just $3.54/month, and Keeper Business for just $7/month ​Keeper is a cybersecurity platform primarily known for its password manager and digital vault, designed to help individuals, families, and businesses securely store and manage passwords, sensitive files, and other private data. It uses zero-knowledge encryption and offers features like two-factor authentication, dark web monitoring, secure file storage, and breach alerts to protect against cyber threats. Preferred partner (What does this mean?) In the clip, a person is shown bringing up the Run program on Windows, and then executing a PowerShell command. While in the video the command results in the activation of special features, in reality, users running the command would download a malicious script which, in turn, deploys Vidar and StealC infostealers. These infostealers can take screenshots, steal login credentials, grab credit card data, exfiltrate cookies, cryptocurrency wallet information, 2FA codes, and more. \"This attack uses videos (possibly AI-generated) to instruct users to execute PowerShell commands, which are disguised as software activation steps. TikTok's algorithmic reach increases the likelihood of widespread exposure, with one video reaching more than half a million views,\" Trend Micro said. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! \"The videos are highly similar, with only minor differences in camera angles and the download URLs used by PowerShell to fetch the payload,\" the researchers added. \"These suggest that the videos were likely created through automation. The instructional voice also appears AI-generated, reinforcing the likelihood that AI tools are being used to produce these videos.\" One of the videos has roughly 500,000 views, more than 20,000 likes, and more than 100 comments, making it quite successful. Videos were being used to deliver malware in the past, too, but this new campaign is a significant departure from earlier methods. The difference is that before, the link to the malware was shared in the video’s description, or comment, where it could still be picked up by security solutions. By delivering the bait in a video format, the attackers successfully bypass almost all security measures.

    "title": "What is OSINT and why it is so important to fight cybercriminals?",
    "article_text": "OSINT is all about finding the real-world identities behind perpetrators When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A cybercrime story is never far from the news. Last month M&S was the latest in a growing line of high-profile institutions to suffer from a cyber attack. State-sanctioned practices, coupled with the growing use ofAIand emerging technologies, are creating a complex cybercrime scene with a minefield of risks. It’s why the NCSC warned of a growing gap between cyber threats and defense capabilities last year, reporting a threefold increase in severe incidents compared to the year before. With threats appearing from all angles, law enforcement agencies,financialinstitutions, andbusinessesalike are all in need of efficient tools and processes to squash these threats. And one of the answers could lie in open source intelligence (OSINT). Chief Executive Officer at Blackdot. With criminals hiding behind fake identities and information spread over many sources, OSINT is proving to be a highly effective mechanism, mobilizing publicly availabledatain the fight against cybercriminals. OSINT is the targeted collection and analysis of publicly available or licensable data to produce actionable insights. One of the key steps to defining OSINT is recognizing how it differs from OSINF –open sourceinformation. OSINF is publicly or commercially available information located in sources such as news publications, social media, online forums and corporate registries (like Companies House). Naturally, this data can be biased and unregulated, meaning its insights are limited on their own. OSINT is the product of collecting, combining and analyzing OSINF. It produces actionable intelligence and can draw out insights that are not always apparent in the raw data. Given the number of internet users has doubled over the past ten years, there has never been such a volume and range of this data – and therefore never more of an opportunity to get insights out of OSINT. While traditionally employed by government intelligence agencies, the use of OSINT has spread to other public sector bodies, financial institutions, large corporates and media outlets to derive insights not available through other sources of intelligence. For banks and corporates, for example, regulations like the EU’s sixth anti-money laundering directive (part of its AML package) or its corporate sustainability due diligence directive require institutions to conduct robust due diligence on their customers and supply chains. This is to protect the market against risks such as unknowingly engaging with people who are facilitating money laundering or potential business partners who have adverse human rights and environmental impacts. OSINT helps to cast a light on these hidden risks and identify connections between companies or people, making it an ideal tool for fighting complex,network-based crimes. It can play a lead role in use cases such as anti-money laundering and organized crime investigations. So, whether investigators are reviewing publicly availablesocial mediacontent to learn more about a sanctioned entity’s assets or finding connections to possible shell companies in corporate records, this open source data can be harnessed to provide critical intelligence to crime fighters. Of course one of the main objectives of criminals is to remain undetected. And from fake profiles to the dark web (more on that soon), the internet has provided cybercriminals with a variety of ways to act anonymously and mask their identities. So, OSINT for cybercrime is all about finding the real-world identities behind the perpetrators. But how can it help to unmask criminals? OSINT offers major benefits to investigating cybercrime by giving investigators the means to uncover insights not available anywhere else. For example, by analyzing where the same usernames are used across the web, investigators can begin to draw connections to a suspect’s real-worldidentity. Cybercriminals operate in the online world, so OSINT is perfectly suited to fighting them. Sources such as internet forums and publicly available social media accounts are exactly the places where bad actors may have scattered breadcrumbs concerning their identity or operational activities. Then there is the dark web. This is a key gateway for criminals, and therefore a key data source for investigators. Criminals talk more freely about their activities there, whether they are sharing personal data from cyberattacks or describing their techniques. But as the dark web involves using another browser, it isn’t easily accessible through normal web browsing techniques and accessing it can be an extremely risky process. OSINT platforms can provide a secure ecosystem for investigators to tap into dark web resources, as well as improvingsecuritywhen reviewing publicly available social media and other web sources. By being able to uncover leaked data or messages on dark web forums in a safer environment, investigators can understand the nature of stolen information or start to map out criminal networks. And by assessing correlations between forum posts, profile images and metadata across dark and surface web, they may ultimately find real-world identities behind criminals. Crucially, this can provide organizations with insights to prevent future attacks and plug security gaps. Nearly every crime has a financial motivation in some manner. Cybercrime facilitates different forms of crime such as fraud and money laundering, but these are distinctions that criminals do not make. Consequently, the organizations using OSINT to fight back against cybercrime are also playing their part in dismantling systems that fund broader criminal activity. More cybercrime stories will hit the news this year, adding to the multitude of threats presented by cybercriminals. It will be more critical than ever that investigators have the right tools to understand the huge volumes of unstructured data available online - and use it to identify and disrupt criminal networks. OSINT lets investigators take full advantage of publicly available data and turn it against cybercriminals. Whether it’s government agencies investigating serious and organized crime or banks adhering to compliance requirements, the technique allows investigators to use a wide range of publicly available sources – including the dark web – to connect the dots and unmask the real-world identities of cybercriminals.

    "title": "Ecommerce CTRs are plummeting – here’s how smart brands are fighting back",
    "article_text": "E-commerce CTRs drop; smart brands adapt with new SEO strategies When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I’ve worked inSEOfor over a decade, and I can say with confidence:ecommercebrands have never had it tougher than they do right now when it comes to organic visibility. Not because SEO is dying, but because the SERP (Search Engine Results Page) is undergoing a major transformation, whether we like it or not. In 2024, we’ve seen a major shift in how search works.AIOverviews, Shopping Ads, and rich Google SERP features are no longer just experimental additions, they’re dominating the search experience, particularly on mobile. Recent data from AccuRanker confirms what many in the industry have felt for months: ecommerce click-through rates (CTR) for organic results are nosediving, especially for high-intent transactionalkeywords. The good news? There’s still a path forward, but it requires e-commerce brands to rethink their approach to SEO completely. In this article, I’ll break down what’s happening to organic traffic, why traditional SEO tactics are losing ground, and four ways ecommerce brands can adapt to stay visible and competitive. Director and Founder of Bubblegum Search. AccuRanker’s latest white paper examined how organic listings perform across various devices and user intents. The findings were stark: 1. CTR for transactional keywords is down across the board, withmobilesuffering the biggest drops. 2. Even in the absence of paid ads, rich SERP features, such as “Popular Styles,” “Shop the Look,” image carousels, and AI Overviews, dominate the top of the page. 3. On mobile, organic CTRs are up to 50% lower thandesktopfor the same keywords. In short, ranking #1 still has huge value, it just doesn’t guarantee the same volume of clicks it once did. The rise of zero-click search, where users get answers directly within Google's interface, means that even top-performing organic listings are seeing reduced traffic, not because SEO is ineffective, but because more users are engaging with SERP features before ever scrolling. 1. AI overviews are reducing the need to click Google’s AI Overviews, which have now rolled out globally, are designed to answer user queries instantly, often pulling product suggestions from the Google Shopping Graph or summarizing content from multiple sources. For informational or top-of-funnel searches (e.g., “best hiking boots for wet weather”), this used to be prime SEO real estate. Brands would publish buying guides or product roundups and earn high CTRs. Now? AI Overviews often display product suggestions directly in the search result, removing the need to visit a third-party site entirely. 2. Google Shopping is consuming the SERP Google Shopping Ads and organic Shopping features are everywhere, even when you don’t pay for them. SERP features like: ...are now appearing even when no paid Shopping Ads are present. They pull directly from merchant feeds and product schemas, providing Google with a visually rich, shoppable experience and reducing the likelihood that users will need to visit traditional listings. This means traditional organic category and product pages are often buried below these features, especially on mobile, where screen real estate is limited. 3. SERP features create more competition for attention Google’s obsession with rich features means your listing isn’t just competing with other brands; you’re competing with Google itself. Here’s a rough example of what now appears above most organic ecommerce listings: Each one reduces the chance of a user clicking through to your site, even if you’re sitting at position #1. So, how do you fight back when Google keeps pushing your organic listings further down the page? Here are four core strategies we’re implementing with ecommerce clients right now that are helping them remain visible and competitive in an AI-dominated SERP: With organic visibility declining, brand recognition is more important than ever. When users see your name in a cluttered SERP, familiarity can be the difference between a scroll and a click. And that’s where Digital PR comes in. Digital PR isn’t just about backlinks, it’s about building authority and visibility across trusted publications and media outlets. These mentions not only enhance your brand strength but also increase brand recall when users encounter your listing in search results. Action steps: - Secure top-tier backlinks and mentions in industry publications. - Promote branded content on platforms your audience trusts. - Ensure that when your site does appear in search, users recognize and trust the brand enough to click. This is the era of Digital Authority PR, where it’s not just about where you rank, but where else you show up that influences both human behavior and algorithmic trust. Google’s AI Overviews andLLM-powered tools, such as Gemini, Chatgpt, and Perplexity, rely heavily on high-authority, frequently cited web content to generate responses. That includes trusted blogs, media outlets, and other widely referenced sources that are publicly accessible. Brands that appear in well-cited articles, contribute expert commentary, or are mentioned on platforms with crawlable transcripts, likeYouTubevideos with descriptions, Reddit threads, or podcast blogs, increase their chances of being referenced byAI toolsin the future. If your brand is absent from these ecosystems, you may not show up in AI-generated responses, even if you rank well in traditional search. Action steps: - Get featured on niche podcasts, relevant YouTube channels, and Reddit threads. - Contribute expert commentary to high-authority blogs and newsletters. - Create thought leadership content that answers key audience questions, content that LLMs might pull into future AI Overviews. It’s no longer enough to optimize for keywords. You need to optimize for the features Google is displaying. That means treating your product feed and structureddatawith the same care you give your on-page SEO. Action steps: - Keep your Google Merchant Centre feed up to date. Product titles, descriptions, availability, pricing, reviews, and images all influence whether you appear in organic Shopping features. - Implement a comprehensive product schema, including price, availability, reviews, and brand information. - Use the FAQ schema carefully; it’s less likely to impact AI Overviews now, but still useful for People Also Ask boxes. - Ensure your site loads quickly, looks clean on mobile devices, and features rich media (e.g., lifestyle product photos). Optimizing for these SERP features gives you multiple entry points into the search experience, not just the traditional 10 blue links. With fewer clicks available, you can’t just wait for users to search and find you; you need to create demand. This involves building awareness through paid social, influencer marketing, and content campaigns that encourage users to search for your brand directly or convert through other channels. Action steps: - Use paidsocial mediato promote new product launches and seasonal offers. - Partner with creators and influencers to drive awareness. - Nurture audiences throughemailand remarketing to bring them back, even if the initial discovery wasn’t from Google. SEO is no longer the sole driver of e-commerce growth. It's part of a larger demand generation ecosystem. Currently, Google dominates the search market, but the rise of AI-powered tools is reshaping the playing field. While SparkToro data shows that tools like Chatgpt haven’t yet displaced Google for consumer searches, we’re seeing early signs that users are increasingly relying on AI tools for discovery and research, particularly for complex or multi-step decisions. That means now is the time to future-proof your presence. By showing up in trusted places, publications, podcasts, and social conversations, you increase your brand’s visibility in LLM training data and improve your odds of inclusion in AI-generated content. The brands that adapt early will build long-term authority that can’t be gamed or reverse-engineered overnight. Final Thoughts: SEO Isn’t Dead — But the Playbook Is Yes, e-commerce click-through rates are declining, and yes, organic rankings don’t deliver what they used to. But this isn’t the end of SEO. It’s a sign that SEO needs to evolve. The brands winning today are doing more than optimizing their websites. They’re building authority, showing up in high-trust ecosystems, and future-proofing their visibility for an AI-driven future. SEO in 2025 isn’t just about where you rank. It’s about where you’re recognized. We've featured the best online marketing service.

Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. It wasn’t until I got ANIMAL and connected it to FARM that the penny dropped. Before then I wasn’t sure what the theme “a strange new world” meant. A dystopian novel is defined as a story set in a fictional society or world often characterized by an oppressive regime and governmental or religious control after a collapse of some sort. As is the case with all three of today’s choices, they also reflect the time in which they were written and carry warnings about possible futures when we’ll be too busy trying to survive to pass the time on word puzzles.

My mistake came in putting together a group of fairground rides – SLIDE, CAROUSEL, TEACUP and BEAST. Of these, BEAST was the one that didn’t feel right – so I began thinking of other things that it could mean and after dismissing Mr as the link landed onBeauty & The Beastand some of the other characters in the fairytale. STRUM, SLIDE and PICK both felt like they had something to do with guitars but I took a risk with BEND, having completely overlooked the much more obvious AIRPORT FEATURES. How did you do today? Let me know in the comments below. NYT Connections is one of several increasingly popular word games made by the New York Times. It challenges you to find groups of four items that share something in common, and each group has a different difficulty level: green is easy, yellow a little harder, blue often quite tough and purple usually very difficult. On the plus side, you don't technically need to solve the final one, as you'll be able to answer that one by a process of elimination. What's more, you can make up to four mistakes, which gives you a little bit of breathing room. It's a little more involved than something like Wordle, however, and there are plenty of opportunities for the game to trip you up with tricks. For instance, watch out for homophones and other word games that could disguise the answers. It's playable for free via theNYT Games siteon desktop or mobile.

    "article_text": "New Dell AI cooling systems could offer huge energy cost savings When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. As demand for AI continues unabated across the world, serious questions are being asked around the environmental effect the technology is having on the world around us. Dellis doing its bit with the launch of a new system it says can lead to lower cooling costs and reliance on expensive or ineffective current services. At the company'sDell Technologies World 2025event, it revealed Dell PowerCool Enclosed Rear Door Heat Exchanger (eRDHx), its alternative to standard rear door heat exchangers, which promises to redefine cooling systems as we know them. Dell says the technology behind the new system is an industry-first, and can capture 100% of IT heat generated with its self-contained airflow system, meaning it eRDHx can reduce cooling energy costs by up to 60% compared to currently available solutions. This includes saving costs and removing reliance on expensive chillers, as the eRDHx can operate with water temperatures warmer than traditional solutions (between 32 and 36 degrees Celsius). This also means customers can deploy far more racks of dense compute without increasing power consumption, helping maximize their data center capacity. The system can also help spot leaks or issues due to advanced detection systems, real-time thermal monitoring, and can work with the Dell Integrated Rack Controller service for unified management of all rack-level components.

    "title": "AMD just launched its 96-core Ryzen Threadripper Pro 9995WX CPU, but I much prefer its cheaper sibling",
    "article_text": "96 cores, 192 threads, and DDR5-6400 support put AMD’s fastest CPU in the spotlight When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. AMDhas officially launched its Zen 5-based Ryzen Threadripper Pro 9000 WX-series, headlined by the powerful 9995WX with 96 cores and 192 threads. Built on the updated \"Shamida Peak\" architecture, the flagship chip delivers performance gains over its predecessor and claims a 2.2x lead in rendering workloads compared toIntel’s fastest Xeon W chip. With features including 384MB of L3 cache, AVX-512 support, 128 PCIe 5.0 lanes, and DDR5-6400 memory compatibility, AMD is positioning it as a top-tier solution for professionals in content creation, simulation, and AI. The specs alone suggest it could power thefastest PCcurrently available. That said, the new Threadripper 9000 series retains many elements from the previousThreadripper Pro 7995WX. While clock speeds have increased slightly, now peaking at 5.4 GHz, up about 6%, thermal design power remains the same at 350W. The chips continue to use the sTR5 socket and are supported on existing WR90 and TRX50 platforms with a BIOS update, making the upgrade path relatively simple. Coolers compatible with previous Threadripper models are also supported, which is useful for users looking to upgrade with minimal disruption. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! AMD shared internal benchmarks showing up to 245% performance gains over Intel’s Xeon W9-3595X in tasks like LLM inference and 3D design. These results, while promising, should be viewed with caution, as vendor-supplied figures often rely on favorable workloads and testing conditions. Complicating the appeal of the 9995WX is the presence of AMD’s ownEPYC 9655P. Also built on Zen 5 with 96 cores, it shares many architectural traits but is priced much lower, $6,234.99 on retail sites like Newegg. While Threadripper is optimized for single-socket workstations, the EPYC line may offer better scalability and value for users who don’t need workstation-specific firmware. For those chasing thefastest laptopor desktop build, the question becomes one of return on investment. The Threadripper Pro 9995WX might top benchmarks, but the EPYC 9655P could be the more practical choice. While AMD hasn't confirmed official pricing, the 9995WX is expected to retail above $13,000, based on its 22% performance uplift over the 7995WX, which currently sells for $10,940.99.

    "title": "Cybercriminals have found a sneaky way of stealing tax accounts and even encrypted messages: here's what you need to know",
    "article_text": "Hackers use blob URIs to hide phishing pages inside the browser memory When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Security researchers have uncovered a series of phishing campaigns that use a rarely exploited technique to steal login credentials, even when those credentials are protected by encryption. New research fromCofensewarns the method relies on blob URIs, a browser feature designed to display temporary local content, and cybercriminals are now abusing this feature to deliver phishing pages. Blob URIs are created and accessed entirely within a user's browser, meaning the phishing content never exists on a public-facing server. This makes it extremely difficult for even the most advancedendpoint protectionsystems to detect. Save up to 68% for Techradar readers TechRadar editors praise Aura's upfront pricing and simplicity. Aura also includes a password manager, VPN, and antivirus to make its security solution an even more compelling deal. Preferred partner (What does this mean?) In these campaigns, the phishing process begins with an email that easily bypasses Secure Email Gateways (SEGs). These emails typically contain a link to what appears to be a legitimate page, often hosted on trusted domains such asMicrosoft’s OneDrive. However, this initial page doesn’t host the phishing content directly. Instead, it acts as an intermediary, silently loading a threat-actor-controlled HTML file that decodes into a blob URI. The result is a fake login page rendered within the victim’s browser, designed to closely mimic Microsoft’s sign-in portal. To the victim, nothing seems out of place - no strange URLs or obvious signs of fraud - just a prompt to log in to view a secure message or access a document. Once they click ‘Sign in,’ the page redirects to another attacker-controlled HTML file, which generates a local blob URI that displays the spoofed login page. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Because blob URIs operate entirely within the browser’s memory and are inaccessible from outside the session, traditional security tools are unable to scan or block the content. “This method makes detection and analysis especially tricky,” said Jacob Malimban of the Cofense Intelligence Team. “The phishing page is created and rendered locally using a blob URI. It’s not hosted online, so it can’t be scanned or blocked in the usual way.” Credentials entered on the spoofed page are silently exfiltrated to a remote threat actor endpoint, leaving the victim unaware. AI-based security filters also struggle to catch these attacks, as blob URIs are rarely used maliciously and may not be well-represented in training data. Researchers warn that unless detection methods evolve, this technique is likely to gain traction among attackers. To defend against such threats, organizations are urged to adopt advanced Firewall-as-a-Service (FWAAS) and Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) solutions that can help secure access and flag suspicious login activity.

    "article_text": "There are a few packages crashing systems, too When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Cybersecurity researchers Socket have warned of multiple malicious packages hosted on NPM, stealing sensitive user data and relaying it to the attackers. In a blog post, Socket said it identified 60 packages on NPM, which were uploaded from May 12 onward, using three separate accounts. The packages contained a post-install script that runs during ‘npm install’ and exfiltrates hostnames, internal IP addresses, user home directories, current working directories, usernames, and system DNS servers. The script also checks for hostnames related to cloud providers, and reverse DNS strings, to make sure it’s not running in a sandbox. While theoretically possible, Socket said the packages did not deliver additionalmalware, or escalate privileges. Also, no persistence mechanisms were spotted, either.

It uses zero-knowledge encryption and offers features like two-factor authentication, dark web monitoring, secure file storage, and breach alerts to protect against cyber threats.

The names of the packages were similar to other, legitimate ones, such as “flipper-plugins”, “react-xterm2”, or “hermes-inspector-msggen”. Based on the names, the researchers surmised that the attackers targeted CI/CD pipelines. Before being pulled from the repository, the packages were downloaded roughly 3,000 times.

The complete list of the 60 malicious packages can be found onthis link. Those who have downloaded any of these are advised to remove them immediately and then run a full system scan. They should also rotate key credentials and activate 2FA where possible. Socket discovered a separate campaign, also on NPM, and also employing the typosquatting technique. This one, however, distributes eight malicious packages that can delete files, corrupt data, and brick entire systems. They’ve been present on NPM for roughly two years, it was said, and during this time, they managed to amass 6,200 downloads. Platforms such as NPM or PyPI are constantly targeted by cybercriminals who use it to try and compromise software developers working on open-source projects.

    "title": "watchOS 12 and tvOS 19 tipped to get a visual revamp, to match the 'Solarium' update coming to iOS 19 and macOS 16",
    "article_text": "A look inspired by visionOS When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. We now knowApple's Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) for 2025is getting underwayon Monday, June 9, and now we've got more of an idea about the software updates likely to be announced at the showcase this year. According to Mark Gurman atBloomberg, Apple is going to introduce a major interface refresh for watchOS 12 and tvOS 19 – as well asiOS 19and macOS 16 – which is partly inspired by the look of the visionOS software on the Apple Vision Pro. While iOS 19 and macOS 16 are likely to attract more of the headlines, Gurmanalready toldus back in March that theseoperating systemswere getting an overhaul in terms of their design. Now Apple Watches and Apple TVs have been added to the list. The new look for Apple's software is apparently known as 'Solarium' internally, referencing those glass rooms that let in lots of sunlight, and it's said to be \"slicker and more modern\" in terms of its appearance than the current software. We don't get much in the way of detail here, and Gurman hasn't provided any screenshots of what the software interface updates might look like, but it's fair to say thatthe visionOS platformdoes have a clean and elegant look that works well. Even if theApple Vision Prohasn't exactly been breaking any sales records, its software is intuitive and user-friendly, and apparently Apple is keen to extend the look across all of its other devices throughout the rest of the year. The company usually sticks to the same schedule every 12 months: a grand unveiling at WWDC, followed by several months of beta testing before the software is pushed out to everyone (usually in September for iOS and watchOS). Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. \"While iOS 7 in 2013 was the biggest-ever visual change to the iPhone's software, the latest overhaul will be much more widely felt,\" says Gurman.

    "title": "HBO Max might hog the 'premium streaming' spotlight, but lately I've gotten way more value from my Apple TV+ subscription – here's why",
    "article_text": "If you want quality over quantity, Apple TV+ is still an absolute bargain When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If you'd told me at the start of 2025 that a Seth Rogen comedy about a movie studio would be the best thing I'd seen halfway through the year, I wouldn’t have believed you. The Studio onAppleTV+ is a sharp, inventive workplace comedy co-created by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. On paper, it follows Matt Remick (Seth Rogen) as a new studio head who struggles to balance his love for film with actually doing his job. I say “on paper” because it's more than that. It's a light-hearted satire of Hollywood that touches on its politically correct (and not-so-correct) practices, the human follies capable of ruining movies and the impact studios have on artists. It's special in other ways, too. One episode depicts Matt on a film set where the director, under severe time constraints, tries to capture a one-shot at sunset – while the episode itself is a single shot. Or another one that's portrayed like a '40s crime noir as he and his right-hand man Sal (Ike Barenholtz) have to find missing film. Indeed, The Studio highlights Apple's ongoing commitment to producing high-caliber content. While many other platforms are spraying content like tommy guns and hoping something sticks, Apple is a precise sniper that (usually) hits its target. Last year,Apple TV+ beat Netflix and Prime Video for our Streaming Service of the Year awardand it's continuing to prove its dominance in 2025. There's a big reason that Apple flies under the radar. According toJustWatch, in the USA Paramount+ has 1,325 titles,Disney+has 2,057, Netflix offers 7,270 andPrime Videoboasts an industry-leading 24,184 – more than 20,000 movies and almost 3,000 TV shows (though this number may be boosted by rentable movies and inclusions from other platforms). Apple TV+ has just 286. This makes it hard to recommend it as a primary service. It won't let you watch10 Things I Hate About Youfor the 17th time, the 30th spin-off ofReal Housewivesor everySeinfeldepisode while you eat dinner. I don't want to bad-talk other services too much. Just this year Disney+ and Max have added new seasons of great shows likeAndor,The Last of UsandThe White Lotus, while Prime and Netflix added new series inNarrow Road to the Deep Northseries andAdolescence. But they're diamonds in the rough. Where other services spend billions on diverse libraries, Apple spends hundreds of millions on making sure its original content is elite. And, if you're yet tosubscribe to Apple TV+(or haven't explored it sinceTed Lasso), there's such an incredible wealth of content to discover. With shows likeBlack Bird, Shrinking, Maters of the Air, Bad Monkey, Slow Horses, Dickinson, Bad Sistersand a whole lot more, it could be your primary service – at least for a few months out of every year. Still, despite it's quality, Apple TV+ offers a small content library. But, it makes up for that in a key way. One time I casually mentioned in our guide to thebest streaming servicesthat Apple TV+ is the best-value streaming service on the market. My colleague questioned this by asking, \"Isn't Prime Video… free?\" In a sense, that's true. Prime Video is a free inclusion with a $14.99 / £8.99 / AU$9.99AmazonPrime subscription. That's with ads now, mind you – you now have to pay $2.99 / £2.99 / AU$2.99 to go ad free. If you're a regular Amazon shopper, that value is hard to beat. But Prime Video also doesn’t have the nicest user experience. Let's take a quick glance at the Prime Video app – and it’s a similar setup across manyoperating systems. There's the Featured Originals and Exclusives section at the top, followed by Subscriptions You Might Like featuring Apple TV+, MGM+, Bein Sports and many others. Then there's New Release movies for rent or purchase and Top TV Shows, many of which aren't even available on Prime. It’s comparatively overwhelming and cluttered, which is the main reason I hardly ever use it… unless I'm watching a specific series likeThe Boys,Invincibleor something new fromThe Inspired Unemployedboys. Meanwhile, Apple TV+ offers a clean, intuitive UI. Items are easy to find, and its library is easy to explore. And – bonus – there's notthousandsof titles to sift through. The store is also clearly separated from subscription-inclusive content. And it does all this at a price that beats every other service (except perhaps Prime Video, depending on where in the world you live) out of the water. An Apple TV+ subscription costs just $9.99 / £8.99 / AU$12.99 with no ads – competing with many competitors’ cheapest ad-based tiers, as you can see below. Service US Price UK Price AU Price Netflix $7.99 £5.99 AU$7.99 Disney+ $9.99 £4.99 Not available HBO Max $9.99 Not available AU$11.99 The price discrepancy becomes even more stark when you look at the prices of a premium subscription from the services above. Service US Price UK Price AU Price Netflix (Premium) $24.99 £18.99 AU$25.99 Disney+ (Premium) $19.99 £12.99 AU$20.99 HBO Max (Premium) $20.99 Not available AU$21.99 And that’s my argument for how its smaller library is offset by access to superior drama, thriller and comedy series at a compelling price point. Consider recent acclaimed shows such asAdolescence,Baby Reindeer, andBeeffrom Netflix, orShōgunandThe Bearon Disney+, alongside thebest shows on HBO Max. These are as good as TV gets, but such standouts are few and far between on most platforms – with perhaps the exception of HBO. While Apple might not reach those highs with every new show, it certainly tries to be consistent with the quality it provides. Even some of the worst series on Apple TV+ by IMDB rating – likeBefore,Prime Target,Government CheeseandSunny– still have a maintain a level of quality that is too often absent from other services. The flip side is that its smaller library is a big reason that its subscriber numbers are dwarfed by its competitors (according toFlixPatrol). And, while many of the best streaming services have recently become profitable (perForbes), Apple TV+ is not. However, given Apple is worth almost threetrilliondollars – and Netflix is worth $500 billion – it can afford not to be. Which is good for its existing subscribers because, as well as a generally higher quality production, Apple's budget is most noticeable through its casts. IfThe Studiowas made by any other service, would it have worked? Probably, but I don’t think so. We pondered back in 2020 – whenScorsese decided to sign with Apple over Netflixand other services – whether Scorsese signed simply because Apple has more cash to burn on a single director. It certainly has more cash to flash, but that's not the only reason that it attracts top-tier talent now. It was a landmark occasion for Apple TV+ when CODA won the Academy Award for Best Picture at the Oscars in 2022. It proved that streaming services could go toe-to-toe with \"real\" movies if they tried. It seems clear that people see Apple working with people like Scorsese, Tom Hanks and Ridley Scott – creating films likeKillers of the Flower Moon– and want to get involved, even with projects they wouldn't usually. Just look at the highly-anticipatedF1starring Brad Pitt. That's why I don't think any other service could get Martin Scorsese to have his heart broken inThe Studiowhen he realizes his new movie (titledKool-Aid andbased on the Jonestown Massacre) has been bought by Matt Remick and will never see the light of day. Similarly in Brian Cranston's performance as the completely unhinged and unforgettable Griffin Mill (in one of his best roles ever) for what must be 30 minutes of screentime across 10 episodes. All you have to do is look at HBO'sThe Franchise, which, in a similar way toThe Studio,follows the crew of a movie franchise fighting. And was promptly cancelled after one mediocre season. Masters of the Airstars Austin Butler,Presumed Innocentis led by Jake Gyllenhaal and Gary Oldman headsSlow Horses. Then there's Cate Blanchett's fantastic performance inDisclaimerand one of my favorite Colin Farrell roles is as a brilliant private investigator inSugar. There's no chance I'd have watchedWolfsorThe Instigatorsif they weren't led by Casey Affleck, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt and George Clooney. Admittedly Apple TV+ isn't for everyone, but I think its very best shows are – led by Hollywood's very best. So while it might not be a service you subscribe to forever, the value you'll get in a short amount of time with Apple TV+ is undeniable. AndThe Studioshould be reason #1 that you check it out. All 10 episodes are out and bingeable, so you can watch it and cancel, only coming back to watch season two. While you're subscribed, make sure you at least give the following series a chance:Pachinko,Bad Sisters,Silo,For All Mankind,Black Bird,Dark MatterandTrying.

We've already seen the Google Pixel 10 beingfilmed for an adverton the streets of Canada, but the leaks aren't stopping: we now have unofficial information about some of the color options and wallpapers the flagship phone will bring with it. According to tipsterMystic Leaks(via9to5Google), the standard Pixel 10 will be available in Obsidian (black), Blue, Iris (purple), and Limoncello (yellow-ish) shades. Limoncello could be similar to the Lemongrass option we saw with theGoogle Pixel 7in 2022.

We've only got the names though, and there are no images showing what these colors actually look like. The Pixel 9 offers Obsidian (black), Peony (pink), Wintergreen (green-ish), and Porcelain (white-ish). The Pro and Pro XL models come in Obsidian (black), Porcelain (white-ish), Rose Quartz (pink), and Hazel (gray). From the same source, we've got a host of high-resolution Pixel 10 wallpapers, and the team atAndroid Authorityhas collected them all together in a bundle, so you can install them on your current phone if you'd like to.

Police said that the driver, a 53-year-old white British man from the Liverpool area, has been detained. “It is vital that people do not speculate or spread misinformation on social media,”Temporary Deputy Chief Constable Jenny Sims told reporters at a press conference on Monday evening. “We believe this to be an isolated incident, and we are not currently looking for anyone else in relation to it. The incident is not being treated as terrorism,”Sims said. According to local emergency services, 20 people were treated at the scene and 27 more were hospitalized, including two with serious injuries. Four children are among the victims.

    "article_text": "You know when you’re a kid and your mom tells you to clean your room, so you just shove everything under the bed and pray that she doesn’t look? That’s basically the Trump administration’s immigration strategy, only instead of a bedroom, the mess is getting punted to countries like Ukraine, Libya, and El Salvador. “We are working with other countries to say, ‘We want to send you some of the most despicable human beings to your countries. Will you do that as a favor to us?’”US Secretary of State Marco Rubiosaid, per NBC News.“And the further away the better, so they can’t come back across the border.”It’s like a group chat where America just keeps forwarding spam to other nations. And hey, if you’re really trying to make sure someone doesn’t come back – not to America or anywhere else, for that matter – why not just send them to Ukraine? One day you’re watching reruns of ‘Friends’ in the Bronx, the next you’re personally starring in a Slavic war documentary without subtitles. Apparently, some Trump officials thought this was a real banger of a plan. If Ukraine’s military recruiters were getting tired of kidnapping guys off park benches, surely they’d appreciate the gift of some unwitting ‘pre-owned’ conscripts. The Washington Post recentlyrevealedthat in late January, shortly after Trump took office, the US asked Ukraine to“accept an unspecified number of US deportees who are citizens of other countries.” Ukraine, shockingly, wasn’t super into the idea. Probably because their definition of ‘foreign aid’ doesn’t include serving Washington as one giant human recycling bin. Still, it would have solved two problems at once: Ukraine gets soldiers, and the US gets to declutter its immigration problem by yeeting people into geopolitical sinkholes. No worries though, with Ukraine being picky, there are other destinations for an all-expenses paid permanent vacation courtesy of Uncle Sam Holidays. Like Libya! And Saudi Arabia! Asked about migrants being sent to Libya, Trumpsaid,“I don’t know. You’ll have to ask the Department of Homeland Security.”He looked like a kid whose mom just looked under the bed and found a year’s worth of dirty clothes. Asking DHS might be tricky, since Secretary Kristi Noem was last seen giving a stern PSA in front of a Salvadoran mega-prison while dressed like she was auditioning for Call of Duty.“Do not come to our country illegally,”shewarnedon March 26.“You will be removed and you will be prosecuted.” Washington is reportedlypayingEl Salvador $6 million to hide part of America’s mess from voters. And President Nayib Bukele is very upfront about the arrangement:“We are willing to take in only convicted criminals (including convicted US citizens) into our mega-prison (CECOT) in exchange for a fee,”heposted. Nothing says ‘land of the free’ like outsourcing incarceration to the highest bidder. Libya, meanwhile, still hasn’t recovered from being turned into an open-air dystopia after the West’s 2011 Greatest Hits Tour featuring regime change and chaos. Human trafficking is booming. Leadership is a mess. There’s the Government of National Stability (East), the Government of National Unity (West), and various militias doing daily interpretive dance performances with Kalashnikovs. Allinsistthat they never agreed to take Washington’s deportees from places like Vietnam, Laos, or the Philippines, according to NBC News. So what was the game plan anyway? To just drop people off in the middle of the desert and hope no one noticed, like it was Survivor: North Africa? The State Department’s owntravel advisorywarns:“Do not travel to Libya due to crime, terrorism, unexplored land mines, civil unrest, kidnapping, and armed conflict.”Having US citizenship doesn’t“guarantee fair treatment”of foreigners, the advisory states. So, what you’re saying is that it’s an ideal place to send folks who can’t even sue if something goes wrong. At one point, a US judge had to block a military aircraft that was gearing up to taxi with a batch of deportees en route to Libya. Legal red tape might be slow, but you know what’s faster that a judge’s order, probably? That military plane’s engine at full throttle. And then there’s Saudi Arabia. Because why not build your immigration policy like an awkward wedding seating chart: Latin Americans to El Salvador, Asians to Libya, Arabs to Saudi Arabia. To be fair, it’s not just the US tossing migrants around like political hot potatoes. The entire West has been in a full-blown existential crisis since right-wing populism started ‘threatening’ elections in blowback against decades of lax migration. Even Canada is having second thoughts. Newly elected Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is trying to cut back on permanent residents, from 500,000 to just over 350,000 per year, and must know full well that isn’t nearly enough of a cut. Last year, Germany flirted with the same genius idea as Britain: Send asylum seekers to Rwanda. Why Rwanda? Because the Brits already built the facility there, and Germany figured they could just Airbnb it. The only hiccup? German law doesn’t actually let you deport people to a country they’ve never set foot in. Also, there’s the tiny matter of… the Geneva Conventions. And those pesky historical vibes of mass deportation schemes in Germany during the Second World War. But that minor detail apparently doesn’t prevent Rwanda from still being on the table forfuture US deportations. What a mess the West has made for itself by prioritizing virtue signaling over self-preservation. The end result? Don’t call it dystopian foreign policy – just a pan-continental escape room.",

    "article_text": "French President Emmanuel Macron has downplayed a viral video showing his wife Brigitte pushing his face as they disembarked from a plane, describing the moment as the two of them just having fun. The footage, captured on Sunday in Hanoi, Vietnam, shows the aircraft door opening to reveal Macron speaking to someone off camera. Moments later, two arms in red sleeves reach out and push his face, covering his mouth and jaw. He steps back before regaining his balance, then smiles and waves after noticing the cameras. Brigitte, wearing a red jacket, soon appears beside him. Macron offers his arm, which she declines, and they walk down the stairs together. Speaking to reporters on Monday, Macron said he was“surprised”by the wave of speculation about the incident. “There’s a video showing me and my wife bickering and joking, and somehow that becomes a sort of geo-planetary catastrophe, with people even coming up with theories to explain it,”he said. 📱 \"Un moment de complicité\" entre Emmanuel et Brigitte#Macron.✋ L'Élysée a voulu désamorcer la polémique après que des images très relayées sur les réseaux sociaux ont montré le président français recevoir une main au visage de la part de son épousepic.twitter.com/l4eCTzaS2G He also referenced two other recent viral clips.“A lot of lunatics are spending their days interpreting all these videos,”Macron said. One widely shared video, filmed during a visit to Ukraine, shows Macron on a train with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. The French president appears to briefly conceal a small object, prompting online speculation about drug use. The Elysee Palace called the rumors baseless. Another clip from the European Political Community summit in Albania just two weeks ago showed Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan gripping Macron’s finger while seated, as Macron stood beside him – a gesture some media outlets interpreted as a subtle power play. Macron acknowledged all three videos were real but dismissed the online narratives around them. Initially, the Elysee declined to comment on the Hanoi incident, later describing it as a“moment of togetherness.”A source told BFM TV the couple had simply been bickering, nothing more. The Macrons have been married since 2007. The pair met when he was a student at the Lycée la Providence in Amiens, where she was a teacher. Brigitte is 24 years older than her husband. The couple has faced persistent speculation over her gender – claims they have repeatedlydeniedand taken legal action against.",

    "title": "US troop reduction in Europe expected in ‘coming months’ – media",
    "article_text": "The US is expected to announce a reduction in its military presence in Europe in the“coming months,”the German daily Handelsblatt has reported, citing“high-ranking European diplomats.”The exact scale of the pullout is still unclear but NATO is reportedly making preparations for such a development, according to the paper. The pullout could be linked to the new US national defense strategy, according to EU sources contacted by the newspaper. The document is expected to be ready by the end of summer, the report said. Washington needs to focus its efforts on countering China as it is not prepared for a potential confrontation with Beijing, according to US Undersecretary of Defense Elbridge Colby, who was approached by Handelsblatt. Rumors about a potential pullout have been circulating in the media ever since NBC News reported in April that the US was considering withdrawing up to 10,000 troops from Eastern Europe. US President Donald Trump later confirmed that he is considering a partial withdrawal but did not elaborate on either its scale or timetable. In mid-May, the US ambassador to NATO, Matthew Whitaker, said that Washington plans to start talks about a potential pullout with other NATO members following the bloc’s summit in June.“We are not going to have any more patience for foot dragging in this situation,”he said at the time, while admitting that“nothing has been determined”yet. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz publicly denied speculation about a US pullout during a visit to Lithuania this week.“We currently have no indication that the United States of America will withdraw troops from Europe,”he told journalists at a joint press conference with Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda in Vilnius. The cost of replacing the US equipment and personnel following a withdrawal could amount to around $1 trillion over 25 years, Politico reported earlier in May, citing a report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies. As of early 2025, there were nearly 84,000 US troops stationed in Europe, with the largest concentrations in Germany and Poland, and smaller deployments in Romania, Estonia, and Lithuania, according to the US European Command.",

    "title": "German bank restricts ex-chancellor’s account over sanctions fears – Bild",
    "article_text": "A German bank has imposed restrictions on an account belonging to former Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder due to concerns that some payments could be linked to Russia, Bild reported on Sunday. The reported freeze came despite Schroeder not being listed under any sanctions. Sparkasse Hannover, the longtime local bank of the ex-German leader, has frozen incoming transfers linked to his business ties with Russia, according to the article. The restrictions reportedly apply to nearly half a million euros annually that Schroeder is said to receive from his position on the board of Nord Stream 2, a pipeline project owned by Russian energy giant Gazprom. The pipeline, which was intended to deliver Russian gas directly to Germany, was completed in 2021 but never entered service due to EU sanctions over the Ukraine conflict. In 2022, it was severely damaged in a sabotage Moscow believes was orchestrated by Western intelligence services. In a letter to Schroeder, Sparkasse Hannover reportedly cited fears of violating international financial restrictions, particularly those imposed by the US on Russian energy entities. The funds were allegedly routed via a Gazprombank account in Luxembourg but have been returned since Sparkasse’s internal review raised concerns about potential exposure to secondary US sanctions.The bank declined to discuss individual accounts When asked for comment by Bild. Despite the freeze, Schroeder remains unsanctioned by the EU, UK, or US. However, according to Bild, the bank’s move to halt certain transfers came shortly after Hanover Mayor Belit Onay, a member of the Green Party and a public critic of Schroeder, took over as chairman of the Sparkasse board. Onay had previously advocated for stripping Schroeder of his honorary citizenship, calling his continued business ties with Russia incompatible with the city’s values. Schroeder served as German chancellor from 1998 to 2005, forging close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin during his tenure. After leaving office, he took on senior roles in several Russian energy companies. After the escalation of the Ukraine conflict, Schroeder faced growing political pressure due to his perceived ties with Russia. In 2022, the German parliament stripped him of his government-funded office, and attempts were made within his own SPD party to expel him – though ultimately unsuccessful. Schroeder has blasted Western policymakers over underestimating the dangers of the escalation of the Ukraine crisis, while warning it should respect Russia's historical security interests. According to Bild, the ex-chancellor still views Nord Stream as a positive for Germany, citing the need for cheap and sustainable energy supplies.",

    "title": "Israel and Ukraine fighting ‘proxy wars’ for the West – Tory leader",
    "article_text": "Israel’s military operation against Hamas is a“proxy war”being waged on behalf of the UK, Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has claimed in an interview with Sky News. Badenoch made the remarks on Sunday, commenting on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s recent statement that the UK, France, and Canada are on“the wrong side of humanity”for trying to pressure his country to end its campaign in the Palestinian enclave. The Tory leader dismissed accusations that Israel’s actions in Gaza amount to genocide, arguing that it is justified in its fight against Hamas, and that the conflict also serves the interests of the UK. ”Who funds Hamas? Iran – an enemy of this country. Israel is fighting a proxy war on behalf of the UK,” Badenoch said. She went on to say that the Ukraine conflict is similarly a proxy war against Russia being waged on behalf of Western Europe. The Russian Embassy in London later reposted a clip of Badenoch’s interview, saying the Conservative leader has“finally called a spade a spade.” “Ukraine is indeed fighting a proxy-war against Russia on behalf of Western interests. The illegitimate Kiev regime, created, financed and armed by the West, has been at it since 2014,”the embassy wrote on Facebook. It went on to say that Badenoch’s own party was responsible for telling the Ukrainians to“keep fighting”when a potential peace settlement was on the verge of being signed in 2022.“The result has been an unmitigated disaster for Ukraine and its people, as well as an unprecedented security crisis in Europe.” In March, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio made a similar admission when he said the Ukraine conflict is in fact a“proxy war between nuclear powers – the United States, helping Ukraine – and Russia.” Throughout the conflict, Moscow has repeatedly described the hostilities as a Western-led proxy war against Russia in which Ukrainians are being used as“cannon fodder.” Russian officials have argued that the US and other Western powers intentionally escalated tensions in the region by disregarding Russia’s national security concerns over NATO expansion in Eastern Europe and Ukraine’s potential admission into the military bloc. Earlier this month, President Vladimir Putin said Russia is currently standing alone against the Collective West and is locked in an“existential war.”",

    "title": "Kremlin reacts to West lifting limits on long-range weapons for Ukraine",
    "article_text": "The reported decision by Ukraine’s Western backers to lift restrictions on Kiev’s use of long-range weapons runs counter to Russia’s efforts toward a peaceful settlement of the conflict, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday. Peskov made the remarks in response to comments by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who said Ukraine is no longer subject to range limitations on Western-supplied weaponry. “If such decisions have indeed been made, they are entirely at odds with our aspirations for a political resolution and with the efforts currently being made toward a settlement,”Peskov stated. “Quite dangerous decisions, again – if they were indeed made,”he stressed. At the EuropaForum on Monday, Merz said“there are no longer any range restrictions”on Western-supplied weapons used by Ukraine against Russian military targets.“There are no restrictions from the UK, France, Germany, or the US,”he added, as quoted by Euronews. Moscow has repeatedly warned Western countries against enabling Ukraine to carry out long-range strikes, arguing that this could make the military bloc a direct participant in the conflict given that such attacks would require targeting data from NATO satellites – capabilities that Kiev does not possess. Moscow updated its nuclear doctrine last November following deliberations by Ukraine’s backers on whether to allow Kiev to use Western-supplied long-range missiles to strike targets deep inside Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin expanded the list of conditions that could trigger a nuclear response to include scenarios where aggression by a non-nuclear state or group of states supported by a nuclear state could be viewed as a“joint attack.” Since then, Ukrainian forces have launched numerous long-range strikes inside Russia using Western-supplied weapons. Despite the changes, the doctrine still characterizes nuclear weapons as“an extreme and forced measure”and emphasizes Russia’s aim to avoid escalation. Russia has consistently condemned Western arms shipments to Ukraine, arguing that they fuel more bloodshed and hinder efforts toward the peace process. Earlier this month, Russia and Ukraine held their first direct talks since 2022. The sides agreed to present detailed ceasefire proposals, carry out a record 1,000-for-1,000 prisoner swap, and continue negotiations. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Friday that Moscow is at an“advanced stage”of preparing a memorandum outlining the principles and timeline for a peace settlement with Ukraine.",

    "title": "Ukraine can strike deep inside Russia using German weapons – Merz",
    "article_text": "Germany will no longer restrict Ukraine's ability to launch long-range strikes deep inside Russia, including using German-made weapons, Chancellor Friedrich Merz has stated. Moscow has repeatedly warned Berlin that such a move would make Germany a direct participant in the conflict. Kiev should be able to“effectively”defend itself against Russia, the chancellor told the EuropaForum event on Monday. The ability to only strike targets on its own territory is insufficient, Merz argued. “We will do everything in our power to continue supporting Ukraine militarily,”the chancellor said.“There are no longer any range restrictions on weapons supplied to Ukraine, neither from the British nor the French, nor from us, nor from the Americans.” He did not elaborate on whether long-range Taurus missiles would be provided, which was a contentious topic under the previous government of Olaf Scholz. The former chancellor consistently opposed the idea, arguing that it would lead to a dangerous escalation of the conflict. Taurus missiles have an operational range of 500km, meaning they could be used to attack targets deep inside Russian territory, potentially even reaching the nation’s capital. Russia has repeatedly warned Germany that deliveries to Ukraine would make Berlin a direct participant in the conflict. On Monday, Merz stated that Berlin is“actively discussing”potential deliveries with London and Paris. The Kremlin has called the German chancellor’s latest statements“dangerous.”Berlin’s actions go against the attempts to settle the Ukraine conflict peacefully, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned.“If such decisions have been made, they are contrary to our desire to find a political settlement, to all the efforts to resolve [the conflict],”he said. The chancellor’s statements come as Russia and Ukraine have engaged in direct peace talks for the first time in over three years after Kiev unilaterally withdrew from the negotiations in 2022. Merz remains skeptical about a peaceful resolution of the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin“obviously sees offers of talks as a sign of weakness,”he claimed on Monday, adding that“we must prepare ourselves for this war to last longer than any of us could wish or imagine.” Moscow has repeatedly stated it is open for peace talks but would prefer a lasting solution to the conflict to a temporary truce. The Istanbul talks took place after Putin suggested resuming peace process without preconditions.",

    "title": "Ukraine will have to pay for new Patriots – WaPo",
    "article_text": "The administration of US President Donald Trump would be willing to sell Ukraine Patriot air defense systems, the Washington Post has reported, citing officials in Kiev. Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky has increasingly implored Washington to provide more Patriot missiles and units in recent months amid dwindling stockpiles. Kiev believes that the current US administration“will not give it away for free”but will be ready to sell the billion dollar air defense system and ammunition for it, the WaPo wrote on Monday, citing a senior Ukrainian official. “They think like business people. If I give you something, you have to give me something in return,”the outlet cited the official as saying. Kiev has mostly requested the air defense systems and missiles as military aid from the Trump administration,“which, frankly, we don't have,”Secretary of State Marco Rubio told lawmakers in a Senate meeting last week. Washington is instead pushing for NATO allies to donate the US-made armaments from their own stockpiles, but“none of these countries want to give up their Patriot systems either,”he said.“We can't make them fast enough.” Trump has expressed growing impatience with the pace of peace talks around the ongoing conflict. Zelensky’s rhetoric is doing Ukraine“no favors,”he wrote on Truth Social on Monday, adding that“everything out of his mouth causes problems, I don’t like it, and it better stop.” He also condemned Russia’s increased long-range strikes on Ukraine, claiming the attacks are happening“for no reason whatsoever.” Russian forces have intensified large-scale strikes against drone and missile production facilities in Ukraine last week, the Defense Ministry in Moscow has confirmed. The attacks were a retaliation for Ukraine’s escalating strikes on Russian civilian infrastructure, and solely targeted Ukrainian military sites, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the press on Monday. Russian air defenses have intercepted nearly 1,000 Ukrainian fixed-wing UAVs over the country in the past week, Defense Ministry reports say.",

    "title": "Poland wants to ‘earn big money’ on Ukraine – Tusk",
    "article_text": "Poland intends to profit from Ukraine’s post-conflict reconstruction, Prime Minister Donald Tusk has said. During a visit to the Euroterminal Slawkow railway facility in the south of the country on Monday, Tusk pitched the expansion of the site into a key hub for materials bound for Ukraine. “It is not wrong to say: we want to earn big money for Poland on the reconstruction of Ukraine,”he told reporters.“We want to help, but we also want to earn money on it, and this special hub is needed for this purpose.” Poland has been one of Ukraine’s top donors since the conflict with Russia escalated in 2022, providing over €5.1 billion ($5.7 billion) in aid – more than 70% of it military – according to Germany’s Kiel Institute. Warsaw is also part of the so-called“coalition of the willing,”a group of European nations advocating continued military aid for Kiev. Polish officials have repeatedly urged EU-wide militarization in response to what they describe as a growing threat from Russia – claims that Moscow has repeatedly dismissed as“nonsense”and“fearmongering.” The Euroterminal Slawkow, established in 2010, lies near the intersection of Pan-European Transport Corridors III and VI. It currently supports regular connections within Poland, Lithuania, Germany, Italy, and several Ukrainian locations. According to Tusk, the terminal has the potential to become a major transshipment center, thanks to its location at the junction of rail lines linking Western Europe with Ukraine and Asia. Tusk complained about Poland’s minimal role in reconstruction efforts after the Iraq War, insisting that the country will not be sidelined again. “It cannot be like it used to be... where everyone got involved, including Poland, and then the bigger players made money on the reconstruction, and Poland was left out in the cold,”he said. “If we are talking about tens, hundreds of billions of zloty that the world, Europe, Poland, Ukraine will spend on the reconstruction, then among other things we are expanding this logistics hub... so that Poland can make money on it,”he concluded. The World Bank estimates that Ukraine’s recovery could cost more than $500 billion over the next decade. Some EU countries, including Poland, have suggested using frozen Russian sovereign assets to fund the effort. Others, however, have warned that doing so without clear legal grounds could set a dangerous precedent and discourage global investment in Europe. Moscow has condemned the proposed move as“theft”and threatened to retaliate against Western investments in Russia.",

    "title": "EU could end protections for Ukrainian immigrants – media",
    "article_text": "EU member states are reportedly preparing to reevaluate the legal status of Ukrainian refugees who live in the bloc, Euractiv reported on Monday, citing an EU diplomat. Discussions on a potential exit from the Temporary Protection Directive (TPD) may begin as early as June. Brussels invoked the TPD shortly after the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in early 2022. Originally established in 2001, the directive offers a broad array of benefits, including residence permits, housing, access to employment, education, healthcare, financial benefits and social services. While the program was initially set to expire in March 2025, it has recently been extended until March 2026. Talks around“exit strategies”are intensifying behind the scenes amid a“shifting geopolitical landscape,”the unnamed diplomat told Euractiv. The issue is expected to be a central focus at the bloc’s upcoming Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting scheduled for June 12–13. Although most member states support continuing the program for now, Euractiv noted, legal experts warn that further extensions may stretch the directive’s original intent. “We’re already on thin ice with the last prolongation,”Martin Wagner, a senior policy adviser at the International Centre for Migration Policy Development, told the outlet.“A straightforward reading of the directive would mean that after three years, it’s over.” Wagner stressed the need for“a real discussion about alternatives and how to exit temporary protection in one way or another,”pointing out that the directive was never intended as a long-term solution. Another anonymous diplomat warned that the EU risks“overwhelming national asylum systems — exactly what the TPD was meant to prevent.” According to Wagner the current number of beneficiaries is“multiple times more than what countries usually handle,”calling the status quo“an incredible burden.” The debate comes amid growing challenges faced by member states in managing the large-scale influx of Ukrainian refugees. As of March 2025, over 4.3 million Ukrainians had been granted temporary protection in the EU, according to Eurostat data. While Brussels has maintained that continued support is essential, several governments are reconsidering the level of assistance they can provide. Germany, currently hosting more than 1.2 million Ukrainian refugees, has begun scaling back welfare benefits due to sustainability concerns. Meanwhile, Poland has opposed taking in additional migrants under the EU’s newly proposed migration pact. More Ukrainians fleeing the conflict have reportedly migrated to Russia than any there country. According to a law enforcement official as cited by TASS, 5.5 million people had migrated as of 2023.",

    "title": "Germany arming for possible conflict with Russia – Reuters",
    "article_text": "The German military must significantly increase its weapons stockpile by 2029, the year the current government anticipates a potential threat from Russia, according to a directive issued by the country’s defense chief, obtained by Reuters. The order, titled ‘Directive Priorities for the Bolstering of Readiness’, was signed on May 19 by Carsten Breuer, the inspector general of the Bundeswehr, the news agency reported on Sunday. Moscow has denied that it has any aggressive intentions toward NATO countries, dismissing Western speculation of a possible attack as fearmongering aimed at justifying extensive militarization by the bloc’s European members. Breuer’s order emphasizes the procurement of advanced air defense systems and long-range precision strike capabilities effective at ranges exceeding 500km. He has also reportedly directed the military to increase the stockpiling of various types of ammunition and to develop new capacities in electronic warfare, as well as space-based systems for both defensive and offensive missions. Chancellor Friedrich Merz announced on Monday that his government has lifted restrictions on the range of weapons it can supply to Ukraine to fight Russia. The news is perceived as a hint at the possible delivery of long-range Taurus missiles, which the previous government refused to donate. In March, the German parliament amended the nation’s law to exempt military spending from the ‘debt brake’, a measure that limits government borrowing. Merz has proposed allocating up to 5% of the nation’s GDP to security-related projects by 2032, a significant increase from the current level of around 2%. He claimed that this expenditure would transform the Bundeswehr into Europe’s most formidable military force. The rearmament plans necessitate a corresponding increase in personnel. Defense Minister Boris Pistorius indicated in a recent interview that the ruling coalition aims to introduce a recruitment model similar to Sweden’s, potentially ending the current volunteer-only system as early as next year. The military initiatives come amid economic challenges, including de-industrialization and stagnation. On Sunday, the newspaper Bild said that ThyssenKrupp, a company with over two centuries of history, is undergoing a significant restructuring amounting to dissolution. According to the report, the company plans to reduce its headquarters staff from 500 to 100, transfer its steel mills to Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky, sell its naval shipyard Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems (TKMS) in the public market, and divest most other divisions.",

    "title": "US interfering in UK’s internal affairs – Telegraph",
    "article_text": "US officials recently travelled to the UK to meet with local anti-abortion campaigners who Washington believes face retribution for expressing their views, The Telegraph reported on Saturday. The paper described the move as evidence of Washington’s desire to“intervene in domestic British affairs.” In March, the State Department dispatched a delegation from the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL), to meet with officials from the Foreign Office and communications regulator Ofcom to“affirm the importance of freedom of expression in the UK and across Europe.” The talks, which also overlapped with separate UK-US trade negotiations, focused on Britain’s new online safety act and its potential consequences for freedom of speech. However, the five-member US team also quietly met with British activists who had been arrested for protesting outside abortion clinics, the article said. The US officials also reportedly attended an event held at a“nondescript”office block where campaigners were present. “The visit is the latest sign of the Trump administration’s willingness to intervene in domestic British affairs,”The Telegraph noted. While the paper did not provide details on whom the US officials met, Washington has sounded the alarm over several controversial cases where the right to free speech in the UK may have been violated. One of them was that of Livia Tossici-Bolt, a 64-year-old campaigner who was charged in 2023 for holding a sign reading“here to talk if you want”outside an abortion clinic in Bournemouth. She refused to leave when asked by police and faced prosecution under a Public Spaces Protection Order (PSPO) – a legal restriction that creates a 150-meter buffer zone around facilities providing abortion services. In February, US Vice President J.D. Vance also singled out the case of Adam Smith-Connor, a 51-year-old British army veteran and anti-abortion activist, who was convicted in October 2024 for silently praying near the same Bournemouth clinic. Vance called it a“most concerning case”and said it illustrated the threats to the“basic liberties of religious Britons.” UK law enforcement has been criticized for so-called“two-tier policing,”a term suggesting that much harsher measures are often taken against right-wing protesters than against left-wing ones. Elon Musk, a close Trump ally, has been particularly vocal on the matter, blasting the UK over its response to what he described as a disproportionate response to anti-immigration demonstrations.",

    "title": "‘Everything out of Zelensky’s mouth causes problems’ – Trump",
    "article_text": "Public remarks by Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky are only making things worse for his country, US President Donald Trump has said. His comments came after the Ukrainian leader accused the US of a lack of support, which he claimed benefits Russia. Trump took to Truth Social on Sunday to criticize Zelensky for making diplomatic efforts to settle the Ukraine conflict more difficult. The Ukrainian leader, he said,“is doing his country no favors by talking the way he does. Everything out of his mouth causes problems. I don’t like it, and it better stop.” The US president added that the conflict“would never have started”if he had been in office.“This is Zelensky’s, Putin’s, and Biden’s War, not ‘Trump’s.’ I am only helping to put out the big and ugly fires, that have been started through gross incompetence and hatred,”he said. Trump’s comments came after Zelensky criticized his Western backers, including the US, for what he described as a lackluster reaction to Russia’s latest large-scale air strike.“America’s silence, the silence of others in the world, only encourages Putin,”Zelensky said, calling for increased pressure and sanctions on Moscow. The exchange occurred amid an escalation in fighting between Russia and Ukraine, with Moscow accusing Kiev of launching hundreds of drones between Tuesday and Friday alone. According to Russian air defense commander Yury Dashkin, one strike took place during a visit by Russian President Vladimir Putin to Kursk Region, where his helicopter“was at the epicenter”of a Ukrainian drone assault. The Russian Foreign Ministry has vowed an appropriate response, stating that the Ukrainian strikes are intended to“disrupt direct Russian-Ukrainian negotiations”aimed at a lasting settlement. The Russian Defense Ministry later announced a successful strike on a drone and missile production plant in Kiev as well as a radar surveillance center and a US-made Patriot air defense system. Moscow has repeatedly said its strikes are never aimed at civilians. Trump, however, voiced disapproval of Russian actions, claiming that Putin had“gone absolutely CRAZY”and alleging that he had targeted Ukraine with recent strikes“for no reason whatsoever.”The US president has on several occasions threatened to impose new sanctions on Russia if he does not see peace efforts making progress. However, following a call between Trump and Putin last week, Axios reported that the US leader is still refraining from imposing new restrictions on Moscow. Instead, he reportedly told European leaders that he believes“Putin wants a deal”and that diplomacy remains possible.",

    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has reacted to Russia’s overnight missile raids on Ukraine by insisting that his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin had“gone absolutely crazy for no reason,”despite a week of constant Ukrainian drone raids across Russia involving several hundred UAVs. Ukraine significantly intensified its drone attacks inside Russia last week, with at least 764 drones intercepted over Russian territory from Tuesday to Friday, and hundreds more destroyed over the weekend. A helicopter carrying Russian President Vladimir Putin was reportedlycaught in the“epicenter”of a massive drone raid while he was visiting Kursk Region on Tuesday. In response, the Russian military conducted amajor strikeagainst a drone and missile production plant in Kiev on Saturday, followed by additional reported strikes on Ukrainian military facilities on Sunday. Speaking to journalists on Sunday, Trump claimed Russia’s response was unwarranted and said he was“surprised”by what he is seeing. “I’m not happy with what Putin’s doing,”he said.“We’re in the middle of talking and he’s shooting rockets into Kiev and other cities. I don’t like it at all… We’ll see what I’m going to do.” “I’ve always had a very good relationship with Vladimir Putin of Russia, but something has happened to him. He has gone absolutely CRAZY!”Trump added in a post on Truth Social, claiming that“missiles and drones are being shot into cities in Ukraine for no reason whatsoever.” Trump also criticized Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky, in an apparent reference to his remarks about Washington’s“silence”in response to the latest Russian attacks. “Likewise, President Zelensky is doing his country no favors by talking the way he does. Everything out of his mouth causes problems. I don’t like it, and it better stop,”the US leader stated, reiterating that the Ukraine conflict is“not his war.” The Russian Foreign Ministry suggested that the spike in UAV incursions is an attempt to derail the US-brokered peace talks between Moscow and Kiev, while Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that“some European nations led by the UK, France, Germany, and the EU leadership,”who are supporting Kiev and want the conflict to continue, bear some responsibility for the drone raids. Meanwhile, Russia and Ukraine have completed a record prisoner exchange, which was agreed to during direct talks in Türkiye earlier this month. Lavrov earlier stated that the sides will exchange draft ceasefire proposals once the swap is complete.",

    "title": "Top Russian MP advises Telegram’s Durov to leave France",
    "article_text": "Telegram founder Pavel Durov should leave France as soon as possible following his claims that the country’s foreign intelligence agency (DGSE) pressured him to censor conservative voices on his platform, Russian MP Aleksey Zhuravlev has said. Earlier in May, Durov accused the DGSE of attempting to interfere in Romania’s elections by pushing for censorship on Telegram, which he allegedly refused. The spy agency denied the allegations, but the tech entrepreneur doubled down, accusing Paris of abusing“terror”and“child porn”investigations as a pretext to pursue a political agenda. “I would advise him to leave France at the first opportunity – the risk of ending up behind bars again is too high, especially if he continues to resist the demands of the French intelligence services,”Zhuravlev, the first deputy chairman of the State Duma Defense Committee, said in an interview with RIA Novosti on Saturday. Durov, whose company is based in Dubai, was arrested in France in August 2024 on charges of complicity in crimes allegedly committed by Telegram users, including extremism and child abuse. He was later released on €5 million ($5.46 million) bail. Although he was allowed to travel to the UAE in March, his recent request to visit the US was denied, and he remains under restricted supervision. “[Durov] himself said that the DGSE, France’s external intelligence agency, demanded that Telegram organize a campaign against right-wing politicians in Romania,”Zhuravlev said, questioning the conditions of Durov’s release and noting that the tech entrepreneur is still restricted from international travel. “It is more useful to always keep such an influential person in the field of new media within arm’s reach,”he added. Zhuravlev argued that Durov has likely come to fully grasp the nature of“Western democracy,”where, he claimed, the law can be bent to suit political aims. He suggested, however, that Durov is unable to extricate himself from the situation, possibly due to compromising material being held against him. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova also weighed in, accusing French President Emmanuel Macron of using“barbaric”methods to advance his foreign policy agenda. “It turns out that Macron had Durov arrested not even to address internal issues with the messenger, but to influence the elections in Romania – realizing that the candidate from the liberal dictatorship wouldn’t be able to win under any legal circumstances,”Zakharova wrote on Telegram on Saturday.",

    "title": "The Best Second Albums That Beat The Sophomore-Slump Curse",
    "article_text": "“You have 20 years to write your first album,”Elvis Costelloonce said, “and you have six months to write your second one.” But the best second albums shrug off that pressure with abundant flair. They indicate that a band or musician isn’t a flash in the pan—that they’re got depth and variety, or, if they are a single-sound proposition, that their sound is good enough to come back to. A solid second album comes in a few different shapes. Some are incremental improvements on an artist's debut—the same thing, but better, with everyone involved being more accomplished and warier about falling into the obvious traps. Others are complete left turns: albums that reject everything that made their predecessor successful, sometimes with thrilling results. More often than not, these albums grapple with the consequences of newfound fame—a subject that can be boring or intriguing, depending on who's telling the story. Here’s a short list of the best second albums that deftly dealt with those sky-high sophomore expectations. Though their music ended up being hugely influential, the Velvet Undergound enjoyed next-to-no success in the first years of their career, and fizzled out in the early1970s. The solo, self-titled debut of frontman Lou Reed did little to revive things. But the follow-up,Transformer, very much did. Produced byDavid Bowieand hisZiggy Stardust-era guitarist Mick Ronson, it became a critical and (importantly) a commercial success. With the right musical framing, Reed’s songwriting really pops, as evidenced by the countercultural anthem “Walk on the Wild Side,” of course, but also the grand but strange ballads “Satellite of Love” and “Perfect Day.” Vince Staples’s thoughtful, affecting debut,Summertime ’06, confirmed the Compton rapper and then-Odd Future adjunct as one of modern hip-hop’s most interesting voices. ThenBig Fish Theoryput a twist in the script. Staples’s lyrics lost none of their depth and candor about the bleakness of gang-adjacent life in LA, but here they’re complemented with cutting-edgeelectronicproduction influenced by American sounds (house, Detroit techno) and UK bass music. Hyperpop pioneer Sophie even turns up in the credits. Staples returned to a more traditional sound on the releases that followed, so this still stands as one of his more singular projects. Music as we know it changed in a split second on “Smells Like Teen Spirit\"—the ‘90s didn’t really begin until the moment Dave Grohl’s clattering two-beat drum break announced the arrival of that pulverizing, earth-swallowing guitar riff. Nirvana’s first album,Bleach, had been released in 1988 to decent reviews and modest sales—commercially at least, it was just another underground-rock album.Nevermindgave the band's heaviness a radio-friendly sheen and revealed Kurt Cobain as a pop songwriter for the ages, putting alternative rock at the hot center of the mainstream. The rest ishistory. Onetime Fleet Foxes drummer Josh Tillman adopted a glam-meets-indie-rock sound and a surreal, satirical persona and became Father John Misty. OnFear Fun, his first album under that name, the costume and the concept are only half stitched together; onI Love You, Honeybear, the outfit fits without a wrinkle. It’s strange and eccentric—lyrics spool out in long lines and bring up improbable subjects—but very charming too: “Chateau Lobby #4 (in C for Two Virgins)” is a delightful ode to meeting and falling in love withhis wife. Naturally, there’s a mariachi band in there too. Room on Firesuffered grievously from being the follow-up toIs This It. The Strokes’ debut is maybethecanonical indie album, and is therefore held dear by everyone who spent troubled a dive bar in the 2000s. But strip away the sentimentality, and you find thatRoom on Fireis just as good, more or less, asIs This It. Some people even think it’s better. It goes in for the same vibe of taunt, meticulously arranged garage rock, with highlights that lean both jagged (“Reptilia”) and poppy (“12.51”). Given the pressure put onThe Strokesafter their debut, this makesRoom on Firea considerable achievement. “Creep”, the grungy, self-hate anthem on Radiohead’s debut album,Pablo Honey, was a huge hit— too huge, probably, for the young band. Thom Yorke got ill and fed up after the tours that the single’s success earned them. The follow-up album,The Bends, was a pivot between their debut and the grand experimentation that characterizedOK Computeronwards. And though it doesn’t have quite the same critical reputation as what follows, it should:The Bendsis a gorgeous alternative rock album. Songs like “Fake Plastic Trees” are among the best the band has ever written, while the likes of “My Iron Lung” are just as boundary-pushing as later efforts. For all the heights that Kendrick Lamar reached onTo Pimp a Butterfly, there’s a good case to make that his second album,Good Kid, M.A.A.D City, is still his best. It skimps on none of the extended, intricate narratives of the records that follow—“Sing About Me, I’m Dying of Thirst” is a particular highlight in this respect—while it also contains some of his biggest bangers, including “Swimming Pools (Drank)” and “Backseat Freestyle.” “Money Trees”, with its world-weary, fatalistic lyrics and superbly melancholic Beach House sample, might just be Lamar’s greatest song ever, “Not Like Us” notwithstanding. Roads to Judah, the death metal band Deafheaven’s first album, had elements of shoegaze in it, but it was on the follow-up,Sunbather, that the band truly leaned into this thrillingly hybrid sound. The pink cover gives it away: between the screamed vocals and layers of distorted guitars are passages of dreamy beauty. Even the heavy sections incorporate uplifting, major-key melodies.Sunbatherdeservedly won an audience far beyond traditional metal listeners, and it deserves to retain that audience too. Though Bob Dylan is known as the great American songwriter, his self-titled debut album only featured two original songs—it was dominated by the folk standards that he had spent much of his early career playing. His second album,The Freewheelin’ Bob Dylan, was the reverse: almost all the tunes were his. And what tunes they were. “Blowin’ in the Wind”, “Masters of War”, “A Hard Rain’s a-Gonna Fall” and “Don't Think Twice, It’s All Right” all feature here. Though Bobby’s catalogue is very vast indeed, it doesn’t get much better than this for pure folky brilliance. It’s easy, given the impact Amy Winehouse had, to forget that she only released two albums before her tragically early death. It’s even more remarkable that that reputation rests almost entirely on the second of those albums, the monumentalBack to Black. The neo-soul production, courtesy of Mark Ronson and others, is retro-flavored but not stodgy, and the songwriting is peerless. “Rehab”, “Back to Black” and the phenomenal title track, capped off by Winehouse’s voice, rank among the best pop music this century. Another album that was both the second and final work of an artist’s career, though it doesn’t have the prominence it deserves. Gram Parsons, a country musician beloved by Keith Richards, among many others, only released two solo albums before his death aged 26. The second,Grievous Angel, had little commercial success upon release but has since accrued critical acclaim. You might think you don’t like country, but you’ll love this: it’s a blissful, beautiful record, made bittersweet by the fact that its author never had the chance to follow it up. Björk’s solo debut, winkingly entitledDebut, was a dancey, eclectic blend of all sorts of pop genres. Her second album,Post, ratcheted that diversity up even further. Written after she moved to London from her native Iceland, and while she was going out with the trip-hop pioneer Tricky.Postis an experimental but still approachable collection of songs both raucous (the orchestral “It’s Oh So Quiet”) and transfixing (“Hyper-Ballad”). It’s the definitive second-album statement, proving without a doubt thatDebutwas no fluke. Licensed to Illwas a gnarly, metal-sampling, chart-topping party record that turned the Beastie Boys into the nemeses of every suburban parent managing a rebellious teenager. For the follow-up, the hip-hop group did something very different: big beats and frat-boy antics were replaced by a finely woven tapestry of more than a hundred samples, and more reflective lyrics than in previous music. Though it sold nowhere near as well as its predecessor, the world eventually caught up to its genius. Sudan Archives is the recording name of Brittney Parks, a self-taught violinist who happens to be one of the most interesting – and one of the best – pop musicians working today. A case in point is her second album,Natural Brown Prom Queen. Though it builds on the sound of her debut,Athena, it’s a major step up, incorporating endless shades of soul, funk and electronic into stunning arrangements. “Freakalizer”, a spooky R&B number with a bone-shaking beat, might be one of the best songs of 2022.

For a couple of years now, New Balance sneakers have been creeping steadily upmarket. But while theBoston footwear Goliathhas garnered attention withlimited-edition collaborationsandpremium riffs on its core silhouettes, it hasn't entirely eschewed its roots. Exhibit A: the New Balance 471, an excellent new style from the brand's 2025 collection that seems poised to become its next it sneaker. The best part? It costs a mercifully approachable $100. The 471 steals a few styling moves from theretro running shoeslapping the competition. (It looks exactly like the type of shoe your old man would've worn back in the day, in the best way possible.) The mesh base is overlaid by short-haired suede across the front, back, and lacing system, while an oversized leather ‘N’ logo is stitched across the sidewalls. And, much like its vintage-inspired New Balance siblings—namely, the 327 and 237—the toe box features now-signature “fang”-like detailing, a deep-cut flourish the real heads will appreciate. New Balance Nordstrom New Balance New Balance To keep the retro vibes going, the EVA foam midsole is cut into a wedge shape, and lined with gum rubber for added old-school charm. It looks like a \"classic runner silhouette,” says Vinnie Tao, founder of the UK-based kicks emporiumSneaker Pharm. “It's very simple and clean. The raised suede panels are an elevated touch, and thanks to its minimal construction, it lends itself well to future repairs, too. I can't wait to see what other colorways come through.” The 471 is already being prepped for a big moment. Around this time every year, New Balance releases its annual ‘Grey Days’ collection, a who's who of future grails cherry-picked by the company itself. 2025's drop includes heavy-hitters like theviral 1906L loafer, the 9060, the 740— and yes, the 471. And though it's still relatively fresh on the scene, the model has already secured its first high-profile collaboration: later this year, legendary Japanese designer Junya Watanabe will put his stamp on it. All of which means now would be a good time to snag a pair before the rest of the world beats you to it. New Balance New Balance New Balance Nordstrom This story originally appeared onBritish GQ.",

    "title": "'The Last of Us' Star Kaitlyn Dever Is Only Getting Stronger",
    "article_text": "This article contains spoilers for the final episode ofThe Last of Us. Three years ago,Kaitlyn Dever came acrossa YouTube videothat would help her through the worst period of her life. It’s a clip from Stephen Colbert’s late-night interview withAndrew Garfield, which stands out from all other late-night interviews because it swaps the usual translucent banter for genuine vulnerability. In it,Colbertasks Garfield how his work helped him deal with the loss of his mother, who had passed away from pancreatic cancer a couple of years prior. Garfield lowers his chin just a little and exhales. “I love talking about it, by the way,” he says, before he answers the question, “so if I cry, it’s only a beautiful thing.” He then speaks sincerely for a couple of minutes about love, loss and processing grief through art, pausing here and there to stop himself from choking up. “I’m indebted to everyone who has brought me to this place so that I can honor [my mom] through my art, and use it as a way to heal; use it as a way to sew up the wounds.” Top by Loro Piana. Watch by Bulgari. For Dever, whose own mother, Kathy, was in the midst of a decade-plus-long battle with breast cancer, this was a life raft. “I would google it and watch it often,” Dever says, “because I always felt like… the worst thing in my life that could happen was losing my best friend. And I always thought that I wouldn’t be able to go on. But then I’d look at Andrew and think, well, his life seems to be moving forwards.” Kathy had been sick for so long that Dever found herself in an endless cycle of hope, anxiety, and denial. “The other feeling I had was, Oh, I'm never gonna be in his position,” she says. “My brain would always say, But that's not gonna be me.” At the end of 2023 Kathy’s health took a sharp decline, and in February 2024, she died. “I don’t even know how to describe it, because it was the worst time in my life,” Dever says, reflecting on that period a little over a year later. “I still am in shock.” Dever began filmingThe Last of Us, HBO’s post-apocalyptic thriller about survivors during a zombie-adjacent outbreak, three days after her mother’s funeral. It was the biggest job of her career so far, and she started withits most pivotal scene to date—in which her character, Abby, an emotionally ravaged militant, tortures and murders Joel, the show’s beloved anti-hero, played byPedro Pascal. Here, a little sooner than anticipated, was an opportunity to tend to this great wound. “There was no time for any rehearsal,” she says, “we just went straight into it.” In the show, as in the game that inspired it, Abby’s father had been killed by Joel in aDie Hard–esque rampage at the end of season one, five years prior to the events ofseason two. We are introduced to her on the hunt for revenge. “I think what makes Abby so powerful and so overwhelming is the darkness inside her, and because her grief is so intense,” Dever says. “I wanted the anger and the rage to be what was powerful.” When Abby does findJoel—or, really, he finds her, saving her from a horde of infected—all of that emotion comes flooding to the surface. She traps him in a cabin, shoots him in the leg and, before beating him to a bloody husk with a golf club, tells him through tears that she had discovered her father’s body shortly after he had shot him in the head. “I looked at him,” Abby says, angrily fighting back tears. “I saw him. I was 19.” For Dever, having to say these lines over and over again was like dousing the wound in whiskey. “I had just experienced [that],” she says. “Even though death is part of the human experience, we are not meant to be used to grief and watching your best friend die. So that was a crazy line to repeat over and over again because I had just seen her. She wasn’t alive any more and I saw her body in the hospital. And that experience issogut-wrenching. Nothing will ever be as bad as that.” Dever’s performance is visceral and devastating—not an outlier in her body of work, but perhaps a culmination of everything she has built up to this point. \"It felt very special to be the receiving partner of her speech,\" Pedro Pascal tells me over email. “As characters we observed each other's grief, as an actor I observed her skill, resilience, intelligence and profound sensitivity and it’s something I’ll never forget.” Pascal and the other members of the production team were aware of Kaitlyn's grief, but she had asked that no one bring it up on set to avoid any risk of her breaking down while working. “To carry grief into a high-energy environment that can often be so overpopulated is hard to imagine,” Pascal says. “And I hope she felt safe and felt permission to have fun.” Watching the scene, you can’t help but feel Abby’s pain. And yet, Dever can barely recall how she did it: “When I watch it back, I'm like, Whoa… Who even is that?” Leather corset and skirt by Gucci. Bracelet by Gucci. Heels by Jude. Kaitlyn Dever isin a near-empty hotel restaurant on Sunset Boulevard. She has just arrived back in her hometown from Australia, where she’s in pre-production onGodzilla x Kong: Supernova, the latest installment in the appropriately gargantuan monsterverse franchise (Godzilla x Kong: The New Empirewas the eighth highest-grossing movie of 2024, making $571m worldwide). When the conversation turns toward those difficult months last year when her life and work collided so brutally, we are both navigating club sandwiches so large that they’d look regular-sized in King Kong’s hands. I can’t bring myself to address mine for 30 minutes or so, as to paw it while someone opens up in such a way would be gauche. Thankfully, the big lizard movie represents a respite for Dever after a pretty traumatic six years of work. Since 2019, her most celebrated roles have been: a sexual assault survivor inUnbelievable, an opioid-addicted coal-miner inDopesickand, most recently, Belle Gibson, a real Australian woman who faked having cancer in order to shill alternative medicine as a social media influencer, inApple Cider Vinegar. All of those jobs involved heavy bouts of emotional turmoil—not least the latter, which, despite occasional bursts of dark comedy, required Dever to wail-cry on multiple occasions, and was extremely close to home for obvious reasons. But Dever gets more out of the kind of work that requires a bit of excavation. “The harder the job is, I think, the more therapeutic it is at the end of the day,” she says. Necklace by Bulgari. Jacket and top by Lemaire. Pants by Toteme. Top and skirt by Loro Piana. Loafers by Jude. Watch by Bulgari. Though all of those shows were hits in their own right,The Last of Usis a different fungal-zombified beast: thevideo game seriesit’s based on has sold 37 million copies to date, and season one wasHBO’smost-watched series of 2023. Critics gushed, awards were won, and the show’s stars Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal became what a Hollywood marketing executive might call Famous Plus. With that kind of success, however, comes the inevitable baggage. Before it ever hit TV screens, a loud minority of the game’s fans posted sexist and homophobic comments when the game's sequel (released in 2020) binned off Joel and introduced a spate of new characters, including Abby and a non-binary character called Lev. The TV series was subsequently criticized by the same kinds of people, who decided that Ramsey didn’t have the right look to play Ellie, the show’s young lead, and bullied them relentlessly online as a result. As for Abby… it could be argued that she is the most-hated video game character of all time. The actor who voiced her, Laura Bailey, received death threats upon its release. So, in taking up the role, Dever knew that she was holding her own feet to the fire, too. It would be her first real interaction with fans of a mega-franchise. When we meet, we’re still a couple of weeks out from the show’s premiere, but there has already been plenty of depressing chat online about how Dever’s physicality doesn’t quite stack up to Abby’s in the game (yep, the exact same physique that they were angry about before). “I'm fully aware of that conversation surrounding her appearance,” Dever says. Is she prepared for what might be coming her way? “I don't even know how to work Reddit,” she says, laughing. “I'm just taking it day by day. I don't really know if it's gonna affect me or not. I don't really have much control over what they say about me, and that's okay with me. I've made peace with that.” Rather than dwell on a potential mudslide, Dever is choosing to have faith in her own acting ability, and in the show’s creatorsNeil Druckmann(the mastermind behind the games) and Craig Mazin (writer of the much-laudedChernobyl), who earmarked her for the role early on. “Their biggest goal and concern was to make sure that the emotional journey is the most important thing above anything else, and I really appreciated that,” she says. “They wanted to put all their emphasis on that and dive a little deeper than where we go in the game.” Dever was already familiar with the world: she had spent hours watching her dad, Tim, play the original game when it was released in 2013, and, a couple of years after that, Druckmann approached her about playing Ellie in a film adaptation that would eventually be shelved. She met with Druckmann a couple of times at the game developer Naughty Dog’s offices, where they discussed the character and the machinations of the then-unreleased sequel, which Druckmann was working on at the time. “I got to see how the game is constructed,” she says. “And I saw a little tease of the game two years before it came out. He told me what happens… I’ve been sitting on this news that Joel dies for years.” Later, Druckmann asked her to play a small role in 2016’sUncharted 4, but that was the last she heard from him until afterThe Last of Usseason one had aired, when she got the call about playing Abby. “It just felt like this thing was always meant to be in my life, because I had established the relationship with Neil,” she says. “And Bella does such an incredible job as Ellie – they were meant to play Ellie. And it feels like I was always meant to play Abby.” Because of her mother’s illness, Dever was unable to complete the full program of strength and combat training in the lead up to production kicking off. Nonetheless, she exhibits a newfound physicality as Abby—in the way she walks and the way she holds herself, like she’s literally carrying the weight of her grief on her back. “I wanted her to have a different walk,” Dever says. “I think of her anger and that front she puts up as her armor. That kind of anger that is so pent up, I think would naturally make you present yourself differently in the world, and shield yourself. I think it's a defense mechanism of sorts. I wanted it to feel intimidating.” Dever’s big moment in episode two feels like a wild beginning to a long Abby arc, but then—and fans of the game will have been anticipating this—she doesn’t actually feature again until the closing minutes of the season. The rest of the episodes instead follow Ellie as she tries to track Abby down, killing a few of her friends along the way. When Abby does reappear, she catches Ellie off guard, pointing a gun in her face before pulling the trigger when the screen cuts to black. We then jump back in time and see Abby waking up in a survivors' compound in a sports stadium in Seattle, seemingly teasing a third season (which has already been commissioned) that will place her front and center as the second game did. “I think I’ll be in it a lot,” Dever says. Beyond that, she is keeping largely quiet on season three. She roughly knows when she’s going back into production, but she’s not allowed to tell me when that is. She will say that the rumor that I’d heard—summer 2025—is not true. But she hasn’t heard much about how everything will play out. “I think Craig [Mazin] is still trying to write the season,” she says. “I have no idea what their plans are. Craig says it's even more intense than season two, which I don’t know how… [But] that’s all he told me.” Tank top, long sleeve and shorts by Ferragamo. At the beginningof May, just shy of a month afterThe Last of Uspremiered, Dever and I talk again over Zoom. She’s in Queensland filmingGodzilla x Kong, and it’s just past four in the morning in her timezone. She’s pretty zen about the early wake-up: her call time is before six anyway. “I live right across from the beach, and I might go check out the sunrise after this interview, because I've been wanting to do that,” she says. Her version of Abby is out in the world now. The reception, at least from my perspective, far away from the message boards, has been extremely positive—Varietyseems less occupied about whether she will win an Emmy, but ratherwhichEmmyshe’ll win. How has it been from your point of view? “Generally speaking, it has been OK,” she says. “Even though I do check the internet and comments, I'm able to really ignore the negative. And I don't know how or why that is because I wouldn't be able to do that in real life. Like, if someone said something negative [about me], I would be so worried about it. But [with work] I feel so detached from it that it is just, like, interesting and sometimes helpful, honestly, for me moving forward into season three.” Dever is similarly happy with howthat scene in episode two, which she put so much of herself into, has gone down. The expectations had been ridiculously high given what fans knew going into it. Does it feel like they pulled it off? “I feel like I pulled it off, because I worked so hard on it,” she says. “And I had to not be so concerned about the opinion of what I did after the fact. But now, reading all of the reactions and opinions about my portrayal of Abby, I do see that people are being very supportive of what I did.” Tank top, long sleeve and shorts by Ferragamo. In the weeks since our first conversation, I thought a lot about what she had said about her grief. Back then she told me that she wished more people knew how to talk to those experiencing it. “The people that lose someone actually want to be asked about the one that they lost,” she said at the time. “They really want you to ask as many questions. It's actually going to make me feel like her presence and her spirit is still here, and it keeps her alive, you know, her essence, like by talking about her and sharing stories about her. And I know that if I talk about it and share my experience it may help someone else in their experience.” Dever has indeed been out in the world speaking openly about her pain. As a result, her DMs have been flooding with messages from people struggling with grief or the anticipation of grief, who have had the same experience reading her interviews that she did with Andrew Garfield’s moment of sincerity on Colbert. “It was special to hear a lot of feedback,” she says. “It felt really good to know someone feels the same way, and [knowing] someone can relate to how I feel makes me feel less alone.” As for what Garfield said about tending to the wound through work… She does now see her experience onThe Last of Usas “therapeutic.” She’s beginning to believe that those lines, the ones she hated repeating, were like a kind of exposure therapy. It helped her confront some of the trauma at an early stage, rather than burying it somewhere deep inside herself. “It was really hard, but I guess it shoved me into thinking about it more. If I had a few months in between these things, maybe I would have processed it differently. Maybe I would have shut it out more instead.” Before I let Dever out into the burgeoning sun, it dawns on me that throughout our long conversations, I haven’t yet asked her what her mom was like. So, I do. Still half-asleep, she starts to talk and talk. “A lot of people would say she was like a 17-year-old girl in an adult’s body,” she says, smiling. “She had this vibrancy and youthfulness about her that really made her stand out. And it was the most infectious kind of energy to be around. Being around her was like being a phone on low battery and then being charged up again. She gave me the fuel in my personal life but also in my career, and it was because of how excited she was for me and how supportive she was of everything that I did. I knew it when she was alive, and I clung on to it for dear life, because I always had this thing in the back of my head that she is sick. “She never seemed sick, and all the 14 years that she had cancer, she was bopping around, traveling, wanting to go places. But she also just wanted to stay in bed. She loved her bed. Bed was everything. And she loved being at home too, so much, and she was funny, she was the comedy act at Thanksgiving dinner. She was always shopping, and she really knew how to find good deals on Chanel on eBay—she knew when something was authentic. She was the person I talked to the most in my day, hands down.” Dress by Louis Vuitton. This story originally appeared inBritish GQ.

    "title": "‘The Rehearsal’ Had One More Incredible Twist Up Its Sleeve",
    "article_text": "Near the end ofMission: Impossible—Final Reckoning,Tom Cruisegoes full Tom Cruise mode. Thousands of feet above the hills and canyons of South Africa, he dangles from a biplane, withstands 145 mile-per-hour airflow, floats between the wings in zero gravity, and maneuvers his way to the cockpit to take out an enemy pilot. Then he does it all over again on a second plane, battling propeller pressure and hanging on for dear life in between rolls, loops, and hammerhead plunges. It’s a breathtaking, palm sweat-inducing thrill ride that requires spatial awareness and split-second precision. It’s the pinnacle ofthe franchise’s unrelenting, boundary-pushing maxim and Cruise’s death-defying need for speed—all in service of cinema. It’s also the second-biggest aerial stunt of the weekend. That’s because, on Sunday night, to concludethe second season ofThe Rehearsal, deadpan comedian and series creatorNathan Fielderclimbs into the cockpit of a real Boeing 737 and safely flies 150 people for two hours and 21 minutes. Nothing out of the ordinary happens on this trip from the San Bernardino airport and back—wheels go up, flight attendants serve snacks and drinks, and wheels go down. Except that the person manning the controls is not a certified commercial airline pilot. He’s amassed 20 percent of the flight hours required to be one. And his only experience operating a plane that size is through a simulator. This wasn’t just a flight—it was an unprecedented commitment to a bit nobody else could have imagined. That’s probably the best way to describe the entirety ofThe Rehearsal, an absurdist docu-comedy series about Fielder helping people tackle life’s biggest social challenges through elaborate role-play. But in its sophomore season, the show graduated into something more profound and deeply surreal. Over the course of its six ambitious and eerily relevant episodes, Fielder turned a baseline theory (that cockpit miscommunication is responsible for the vast majority of airline crashes) into an all-out mission to revolutionize the aviation industry. Along the way, he created a fake singing competition (which finally crowned a winner this week), cosplayed as Captain Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger, and attempted to kindle romance between a pilot and a paid actor. In other words, normal stuff. But even his half-sincere theory that Evanescence’s “Bring Me to Life” played a role in Sully landing that plane on the Hudson has nothing on the finale’s final twist: the reveal that Fielder has spent two years in flight school chasing a pilot’s license—not to change careers, exactly, but to better understand (and maybe fix) the social hierarchy between captains and first officers in high-stakes situations. It’s the kind of revelation that prompts a head-shaking cackle before realizing, of course he did. And of course he had to. Despite Fielder’s best efforts to find real pilots, mimic their rituals, and stage a believable cockpit emergency, he ran up against the FAA’s rulebook and its very real consequences for insubordination. So, like always, he went all in. If no one else could give him the authenticity he needed to make a case to Congress, he’d have to become the case himself. On its surface, this compelling season of television was a valid and serious endeavor, and Fielder makes a real effort to understand the pressures and challenges that pilots face every day. And yet, as he admits in his signature monotone, “Every public opportunity I’ve had in my life to convey sincerity I instead turned into a joke.” That realization makes it hard to tell whether his actions—and interactions—are genuine attempts for connection and change, or staged machinations for the sake of comedy and his own self-understanding. If the goal was really to make aviation safer, wouldn’t there be a better way than by exposing a loophole within the airline system, renting a privately-owned 737 from a broker on the secondary market, and putting an entire plane of paid actors 30,000 feet into the sky? The answer might seem obvious, but it’s nonetheless thrilling to watch Fielder make these kinds of unfounded leaps and turn a widespread issue into a self-reflexive spiral—or more specifically, an investigation into his own cognitive condition. That started in the penultimate episode, when he visited the Center of Autism and Related Disorders, but it became abundantly clear throughout the finale. At its start, he repeatedly struggles to land a small plane (“My instructors told me I was the slowest learner they’d ever taught,” he says). Later, he laments his failed attempts at becoming a magician because he noticed “there was something off about me.” And when faced with filling out an accurate FAA medical clearance sheet, he opts to get an FMRI scan to determine whether or not he has a real anxiety disorder. These might be gags for the camera, but you can’t help but feel Fielder plucking from his life. If Cruise is the gold standard of stunt actors—and the one sharing his airspace this weekend—Fielder is his awkward, obsessive counterpart: equally motivated to push the boundaries of his genre, choreograph and perform his own creative stunts, and pursue his interests with unrelenting and unwavering dedication. He’s also mastered the art of blurring the personal and professional, to the point where it’s nearly impossible to locate the line between his characters—whether on a lo-fi Comedy Central reality show or a prestige cable series—and the person playing them. The only certainty we have might come from one of his own observations: “We’re all just people in the back of an Uber trying to avoid an awkward conversation.” Ultimately, Fielder’s ludicrous, HBO-financed attempts to course-correct an entire industry culminate in a last-ditch conversation—the kind that partially justifies this entire experiment and convinces the comedian he might not be so alone after all. Inside the cockpit of his maiden flight, Fielder invites Aaron, an Alaska Airlines first officer and wannabe TV producer, to engage in some previously workshopped role-play to open up their lines of communication. It’s not long before Aaron (under the guise as First Officer “Blunt”) calls out the pair’s take-off (Fielder forgot to call out a wing flap check), and in effect breaks down any perceived social barriers. “It doesn’t matter how long you’ve been doing something, you can always learn something,” Aaron says, prompting Fielder (as Captain “All-Ears”) to smile and gratefully acknowledge the feedback. Mission accomplished. This earnest and emotional conclusion still invites all kinds of questions about future aviation regulations, the power of human connection, andthe perception of those on the spectrum. Maybe most importantly, it forces Fielder (or, at least, the Fielder he plays inThe Rehearsal) to consider the value and harm of being diagnosed with an actual disorder. In what you might call this show’s kicker, Fielder explains that as “the least experienced person to fly a 737 in North America,” he was trusted to continue piloting, and he recounts his unlikely journeys relocating empty jets around the world. “They only let the best and smartest people fly a plane of this size,” he reasons. “Nobody is allowed in the cockpit if there’s something wrong with them. So if you’re here, you must be fine.” How can you argue against that logic?",

    "title": "‘The Last of Us’ Finale Kills Off Another Fan-Favorite Character—And Reveals a Major Change For Season Three",
    "article_text": "This story contains major spoilers for the season two finale of HBO’sThe Last of Us. Ellie (Bella Ramsey) is learning about the cost of vengeance. For each violent action in the world ofThe Last of Us, there is an equal and opposite savage action. Over the last few weeks, in the course of her pursuit of Abby, Ellie’s crossed a few names off her Arya Stark-esque kill list, including the particularly gruesome double deaths of Owen (Spencer Lord) and pregnant Mel (Ariela Barer), along with Nora (Tati Gabrielle) in last week’s episode. As if Ellie killing a pregnant Mel and not being able to save her unborn child wasn’t enough of a gutting moment—an action that “breaks her,” as co-creators Craig Mazin andNeil Druckmannput it in a press conference ahead of the finale—the last episode of season two saw the cost of vengeance come due in another way. In the final moments of the episode, Ellie, Jesse (Young Mazino), Tommy (Gabriel Luna), and Dina (Isabela Merced) are all preparing to leave when a raging Abby ambushes them. While it’s not yet clear how exactly she’s managed to track down the quartet, she shows up to hold Tommy at gunpoint and deliver a (shocking) killshot to Jesse. The episode ends with a declaration from Abby to Ellie that she’s “wasted” the fact that she was spared. As a gunshot rings out, the episode fades to black . . . before flashing back to the day Ellie and Dina arrived. Only this time, we see Abby, now firmly in perspective. For those who playedThe Last of Us Part Two, this won’t come as a surprise. ThePlayStationgame unfolded in a similar way. Its opening prologue switches between Ellie and Abby before settling into Ellie’s perspective for quite a while. The moment in the theater plays out in a similar fashion in the game, fading to black on a cliffhanger before putting the player squarely in Abby’s shoes as a playable character. AsCatherine O’Hara revealed in an interview with Variety, season three will, in fact, show us Abby’s side of the story. Mazin and Druckmann confirmed that sentiment in the presser; Druckmann stated that Abby’s story “is going to be really important” moving forward. While we’ll be sure to see the regular cast—Ellie, Tommy, Dina, etc.—again at some point, the bulk of next season will (likely) focus on Abby’s experience in the wake of killing Joel, what she’s up to with the Washington Liberation Front, and why she’s missing when Isaac and the rest of the WLF decide to head off to assault the Seraphites. As part of this, we’ll also learn a lot more about the long-simmering war between the two groups. And Mazin was sure to tease that we’ll learn more about Abby’s father, whom audiences “haven’t met” yet. Fans of the show who didn’t know this was coming might find this conclusion a little random or frustrating, but the change in perspective is one of the things that made the game so compelling when it was released five years ago. While the show has provided more context for Abby’s motivations, this change in perspective is inherently purposeful, opening the door for an exploration of the cyclical nature of vengeance. It’s also part of a shifting idea of what the series can be, season-to-season, which is something Mazin hit upon during that same press conference. The decision for the shift is just as bold a storytelling choice in the show as it was in the game, and we’ll find out what it all leads to whenever the series returns for its (already confirmed) third season.",

    "title": "Trump Says Putin Has \"Gone Absolutely CRAZY” After Russian Leader's Latest Attack Against Ukraine",
    "article_text": "PresidentDonald TrumpcalledPresidentVladimir Putinof Russia “absolutely CRAZY!” in a Truth Social post Sunday evening after Russian forceslauncheda barrage of 367 drones and missiles impacting all Ukrainian regions, including the capital Kyiv, in the largest aerial attack of the war so far. “I’ve always had a very good relationship with Vladimir Putin of Russia,” Trump wrote, “but something has happened to him. He has gone absolutely CRAZY! He is needlessly killing a lot of people, and I’m not just talking about soldiers.” The weekend strikes killed at least 12 people, including three children in the northern region of Zhytomyr, according to Ukrainian officials. Trump alsocriticizedPresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyof Ukraine, saying he “is doing his Country no favors by talking the way he does” and that everything “out of his mouth causes problems, I don’t like it, and it better stop.” The president also referred to Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine as “Zelenskyy’s, Putin’s, and Biden’s War, not ‘Trump’s.’” “I am only helping to put out the big and ugly fires,” he wrote,” that have been started through Gross Incompetence and Hatred.” Earlier in the day, speaking with reporters at the airport in Morristown, New Jersey, Trump said ofPutin: \"I don't know what's wrong with him.” \"I don't know what the hell happened to Putin. I've known him a long time. Always gotten along with him. But he's sending rockets into cities and killing people, and I don't like it at all. We're in the middle of talking and he's shooting rockets into Kyiv and other cities,\" Trump told reporters. US President Donald Trump speaks to journalists before boarding Air Force One from Morristown Municipal Airport in Morristown, New Jersey on May 25, 2025 after spending the weekend in New Jersey. “What the hell happened to him?” the president continued.“Right? He's killing a lot of people. I'm not happy about that.\" Russia’s latest strikes in Ukraine “appeared to be another setback to U.S.-led peace efforts, as Putin looks determined to capture more Ukrainian territory and inflict more damage,” the Associated Pressreports. The multi-day barrage came after Kyiv had accepted an unconditional 30-day ceasefire in March proposed by the United States—one that Moscow effectivelyrejected, according to Ukrainian officials.The New York Timeswritesof Russia’s weekend attack: “The overnight strikes underscored how months of diplomatic efforts to broker a cease-fire have failed to yield a breakthrough as President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has dragged his feet on agreeing to any temporary truce, adding conditions that he knows Ukraine will not accept.” Trump’s recent comments about Putin “sending rockets into cities and killing people” come after Russia’s war in Ukraine surpassed itsthird yearin February. As of that month, over 12,654 civilian men, women, and children have been killed, and over 29,392 injured,accordingto the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission. The full amount of death and destruction is difficult to measure as Russia continues to ramp up its military offenses. Following the president’s remarks about Putin, the Kremlin on Monday thanked the United States for its assistance, saying that Trump’s comments might be due to “emotional overload.” When asked about the president’s words on Putin, Kremlin spokesmanDmitry Peskovsaid: \"We are really grateful to the Americans and to President Trump personally for their assistance in organizing and launching this negotiation process.” \"Of course,” Peskov continued, “at the same time, this is a very crucial moment, which is associated, of course, with the emotional overload of everyone absolutely and with emotional reactions.\" In this handout photo released via the official social media channels of the Office of the President of Ukraine, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky (R) meets with U.S. President Donald Trump (L) during Pope Francis's funeral at St. Peter's Basilica at the Vatican, on April 26, 2025 in Vatican City, Vatican. On X, formerly known as Twitter, Zelensky didn’t address Trump’s comments by name, instead urging the world to apply stronger pressure on Putin following the weekend strikes. “Only a sense of total impunity can allow Russia to carry out such strikes and continue increasing their scale,” Zelenskywrote. “Like any criminal, Russia can only be constrained by force,” he continued. “Only through strength — the strength of the United States, of Europe, of all nations that value life — can these attacks be stopped and real peace achieved.” “There is no real military logic to this,” he held, “but there is significant political meaning. In doing this, Putin shows just how much he despises the world — the world that spends more effort on ‘dialogue’ with him than on real pressure.” Mariska Hargitay Was “Living a Lie” for 30 Years.

    "article_text": "King Charles IIIandQueen Camillaare expected to touch down in Ottawa today for a quick, two-day Canadian tour. But this trip by the royals—unlike some—isn't intended as asweet photo opportunityor acasual visit. Instead, Canadian officials say, it is an effort to remind PresidentDonald Trumpthat—despite his repeatedclaims to the contrary—Canada has no interest in becoming the 51st state. AlongwithTaylor Swiftandtrophy wives, in recent months Trump has fixated on Canada,saying in Marchthat “If you look at a map, they drew an artificial line right through it, between Canada and the U.S. Just a straight, artificial line. Somebody did it a long time ago, many many decades ago. Makes no sense. It’s so perfect as a great and cherished state.” Trump makes an excellent point about borders and how arbitrary they appear to be! But this was not the president's heel-to-face turn on some of the more confounding aspects of US immigration policy. Instead, it was a declaration that our neighbor to the north should probably just belong to us because it'ssitting right there. “Canada only works as a state,” the president said, following it confoundingly with “We don’t need anything they have.\" But “As a state, it would be one of the great states anywhere. This would be the most incredible country, visually.” Trump doubled down on that sentiment when speaking with Canadian Prime MinisterMark Carney. After Carney told Trump that Canada is “not for sale,\" Trump responded, “Never say never.” Soon thereafter, Carney extended an invitation to King Charles to come visit. Then-Prince Charles, Prince of Wales arrives at Fredericton International Airport on May 20, 2012 in Fredericton, Canada. “The king, as head of state, will reinforce the power and the strength of that message,”Ralph Goodale, Canada’s high commissioner to the United Kingdom says of the royal tour, which is expected to begin on Monday afternoon. \"We are the ‘true north strong and free,’ and we will stay that way.” Charles is the official head of state in Canada, which remains a member of the British Commonwealth of former colonies. It's more of a symbolic position these days, but as it's enshrined in Canada's constitution, the title remains. During his visit, Charles will give the opening speech for Canada’s 45th parliament, which is typically delivered from a gilded throne in the senate. Charles willonly be the second monarch to open a Canadian parliamentary session, preceded by his mother, Queen Elizabeth, in 1977. Mariska Hargitay Was “Living a Lie” for 30 Years.

    "title": "Cannes Film Festival Power Outage Might Have Been Caused By Anarchist Groups",
    "article_text": "Apower outagethat snarled the final day of the Cannes Film Festival was the work ofFrenchanarchists, the groups claimed in a letter posted online. The announcement follows a second power outage on Sunday, an arson attack on high-voltage equipment that leftthe city of Nicewithout power for much of the day. According to electricity network operator RTE, Saturday's disruption began with an overnight fire at an electrical substation near Cannes, followed by a downed high-voltage line at another location. The outage knocked out power to around 160,000 households across the Alpes-Maritimes area, and left hotels and businesses in the dark. Some film fest screenings were canceled or postponed, as organizers \"switched to an independent power supply,\" Cannes Film Festival officials said in a statement. After a five-hour outage, power was restored by 3 p.m. local time, allowingthe closing ceremoniesto continue as planned. However, the damage was already done for area restaurants, shops, and small businesses, all of which had expected the final day of the fest to bring high sales and profits. Almost immediately, local administrators said they believed sabotage was to blame. Area prefect Laurent Hottiaux issued a statement condemning “serious acts of damage” and saying “All resources are mobilized to identify, track down, arrest and bring to justice the perpetrators of these acts.” A subsequent investigation revealed two separate acts of arson in the Saint-Cassien power plant,FranceInfo reports, as well as several power line pylons across the Alpes-Maritimes that appeared to be intentionally sawn off. A restaurant without lights during a power outage during the 78th annual Cannes Film Festival on May 24, 2025 in Cannes, France. Early Sunday, a second blackout in Nice was attributed to an arson attack at an electrical transformer in the area,theGuardianreports. Power was restored a few hours later, with Nice Mayor Christian Estrosi sayingon social mediathat “the national and municipal police will be mobilized” to identify suspects in the sabotage. “We are making the images of our monitoring center available to investigators,” Estrosi wrote. “I strongly condemn these evil acts in our country.” In amessage posted toa French outpost of the global organizing network Indymedia, a note attributed to “two bands of anarchists” claimed credit for the acts. “On the eve of the Cannes Film Festival awards ceremony and gala evening, we sabotaged the main electrical substation supplying the Cannes metropolitan area and cut down the 225 kV line coming from Nice,” the letter, which was written in French, continues. “This action was aimed not only at disrupting the festival, but also at cutting off power to the research centers and factories of Thales Alenia Space, its dozens of subcontractors, the French Tech start-ups that thought they were safe, the airport, and all other industrial, military, and technological establishments in the area.” The message ends with a log line and summary of a hypothetical film calledSabotage 2: Night in Cannes.“Set in a world on the brink of apocalypse, the film chronicles the adventures of a libertarian commando unit tasked with sabotaging technological factories of great military importance,” the pitch begins. “When they decide to strike at the time of a prestigious cultural event, a race against time begins.. The authors of the message did not provide the names of their groups, nor did they offer any contact information for interested filmmakers who took their film pitch at face value. A connection between the message and the attacks has yet to be publicly verified by officials, nor have the outages in Nice and Cannes been officially linked. Via statement, Nice prosecutor Damien Martinelli says that an investigation is still in the early stages, and work remains “to clarify the damage and the manner in which the act was committed.” Mariska Hargitay Was “Living a Lie” for 30 Years.

The veteran true-crime filmmaker went intoher latest project, an ID docuseries calledSherri Papini: Caught in the Lie,expecting to learn what really happened whenSherri Papinidisappeared in 2016. Initially, it seemed that Papini had been kidnapped; later,investigators saidthe whole thing was a hoax cooked up by Papini, with support from her ex-boyfriendJames Reyes. The case has already been the subject of another docuseries: the2024 Hulu productionPerfect Wife: The Mysterious Disappearance of Sherri Papini,featuring interviews with Papini’s then husband,Keith.Papini herself did not participate inPerfect Wife—thoughMichael Beach Nichols,director ofPerfect Wife,tellsVanity Fairthat he and his team made repeated efforts to include her in their show. “She never responded to us,”he says. “We would have loved to have spoken to her, and you always want to speak to everyone.” Perhaps her reticence was motivated by her commitment to this new series, which features extensive interviews with Papini. ID presidentJason Sarlanissays thatCaught in the Liewas in the works long before the network was aware of Hulu’s competing property. “In fairness to them, they told a one-sided story because that’s all they had,” says Rittenmeyer, who has worked with members of thePerfect Wifeteam in the past. As Sarlanis puts it, “The Hulu project came out before us—but in so many ways, I believe this project is the yin to its yang.” It might sound counterintuitive, but the Hulu show’s earlier premiere givesCaught in the Liean opportunity to duck a lot of standard true-crime tropes. Papini’s alleged 2016 kidnapping—after reappearing, she initially said she had been taken by two Hispanic women—was national news, as were her 2022plea deal and prison sentencefor the alleged hoax. (She pleaded guilty to charges of mail fraud and making false statements.) Yet a large swath of the public was still unfamiliar with the case untilPerfect Wife,which took a chronological approach to the story’s twists and turns. As such,Caught in the Liegets to skip a lot of exposition and go straight to the meat. So: Why did Papini disappear for 22 days? Why did she lie about it? And why did she wait until now to set the record straight? It might be a spoiler to announce here that none of those questions get fully answered by the new show, though Rittenmeyer truly tried her best. Often, when Papini appears on camera, we can hear Rittenmeyer off-screen, pushing back on responses or pointing out inconsistencies in Papini’s claims. “I have 1,500 pages of interview transcripts,” Rittenmeyer says, “and every time you go through it, it’s just us kind of hammering her.” Yet Papini refuses to fully diverge from the story she’s been telling for years now, insisting that she was in fact kidnapped in November of 2016. “I was abducted by my ex-boyfriend, who held me captive for 22 days. There was no consent, and he still did it,” she says, staring straight into the camera. According to Papini, she initially reconnected with Reyes after he experienced a death in his family, but she says they continued to communicate—with Papini eventually using a secret second phone—as Keith became emotionally abusive and controlling and she sought someone who made her feel heard. (Through his attorney, Keith denies all of his ex-wife’s claims of abuse.) Papini claims she has gaps in her memory around her alleged kidnapping, including the exact details around her alleged abduction in the Northern California town of Redding. According to Papini, she initially blamed two Hispanic women because naming Reyes as her abductor would have meant publicly revealing that she’d had an emotional affair with him. In the series, Papini claims that if Keith had learned of her text conversations with Reyes, he would have likely divorced her. She says she and Keith had a postnuptial agreement that would have awarded Keith all property in the event of a divorce; she was also concerned that infidelity of any sort would cost her custody of their son and daughter. So instead she replaced Reyes with a fictional pair of female abductors—but the fact that she was abducted remains true, she says. In the FBI and police footage that appears in bothPerfect WifeandCaught in the Lie,says Rittenmeyer, “it seems so abundantly clear that she’s lying. And yet in our show, what we learn is what the stakes were for her—which are incredibly, incredibly high, right?” Admitting to an emotional affair could have meant losing her children, as well as her home. Perhaps,Caught in the Lieproposes, that footage actually shows a woman who fell from the frying pan into the fire. If Papini was in fact abducted, she’s been the victim of a monstrous miscarriage of justice—and inCaught in the Lie,subjects including Papini’s therapist,Stephen Diggs,say they believe that the account she’s now presenting is the truth. Reyes, who has not been charged in connection with the case, denies all claims Papini makes in the series, wearily telling an investigator working with the production, “Whatever it is, it’s bull, dude,” before saying he’ll be contacting his attorney. Yet there is something about Papini’s conviction that’s hard to shake. I found myself scrubbing back and forth during her interviews, looking for micro-expressions that might lead to the truth of what happened to her. But ultimately, the series ends on a note of uncertainty. Did we just spend nearly four hours with an incredibly accomplished liar who chose to double down on a falsehood, as most law enforcement officials interviewed in the series claim? Is Papini a deeply troubled person who might struggle to separate truth from fiction? Or is she a legitimate kidnapping survivor, someone who cried wolf in the name of self-preservation—and now will never be believed again?Caught in the Lietakes an ambitious and thoughtful look at trauma and shame. My guess is that whatever a given viewer ends up believing says as much about them as it does about what Papini tells the camera. “You want to open people’s minds, and you want to show them more truth,” Rittenmeyer says. “When you show two people of different mindsets the same thing, and they both walk away with different outcomes, I feel like, Okay, nailed it.” “Do you think that this film is going to do more harm than good for me?” Papini asks in the final moments of the series. That’s a great question, one that leads back to another question we see Papini ask Rittenmeyer—and everyone watching: “How truthful areyou? Have you ever lied?” In a world in which some liarsgo unpunished—orare celebrated, even—Papini’s fury at not being believed might not be forgivable. But it is, at least, a little understandable.

    "title": "Rolf Saxon Thought He Was Being Pranked When ‘Mission Impossible’ Asked Him to Return",
    "article_text": "Three decades ago, Rolf Saxon worked for just a few days onMission: Impossible. Seven films and nearly 30 years later, he was getting a call to return for a major role in director Christopher McQuarrie’sMission: Impossible—The Final Reckoning. It couldn’t be real—could it? “I thought it was a friend making a joke,” Saxon admits in an interview. “I got a call from one of my agents: ‘There's a European film company that wants to speak with you about a project. They won't say what it is.’ And then I got another call saying it's [Missionproduction company] Skydance. I went,theSkydance? “I've got a buddy in Scotland, and we play pranks on each other. So I’m like, ‘okay, Bill.’” He mimes giving Bill the middle finger. Saxon didn’t believe the call was legit until he grabbed himself a drink, sat for a Zoom at the designated time—and was greeted not by Bill, but McQuarrie. “Holy shit. I put the wine aside and thought, why didn't I put a real shirt on?” In Saxon’s defense, it’s pretty shocking that what might be the very lastMission: Impossiblefilm would circle all the way back to a character who appeared injust one scene, 29 years ago. On the other hand, Saxon’s closeup came in the iconic franchise’s signature sequence. Directed by legendary filmmaker Brian De Palma, the 1996Mission: Impossible—a reboot of the ‘60s TV show—introduced Tom Cruise as IMF agent Ethan Hunt, who must break into CIA headquarters to steal a list of undercover agents. The man protecting that information is CIA analyst William Donloe, played by Saxon. As Saxon runs in and out of the vault that holds the list, Ethan drops in from the air duct above. He escapes completely undetected — until a knife falls down and lands in front of Donloe. Fortunately for Ethan, he disappears before Donloe can look up. Since his small role inMission, Saxon’s career as a “jobbing actor” has included an appearance inSaving Private Ryan, plenty of stage work, and serving as the narrator onTeletubbies. But with his very real opportunity inFinal Reckoning, Saxon had the unexpected chance to find out what happened to Donloe after Ethan escaped that vault. In a welcome twist, it turns out that the heist might have been the best thing to ever happen to Donloe — and perhaps Saxon as well. “C’mon, I had two lines. I was onscreen for all of five minutes,” Saxon says. “Never in a million years would I have thought this could happen.” Vanity Fair:Is it a relief that your return hasn’t been kept top secret? Rolf Saxon:It started out being a secret. I had 16 pages of NDAs! Chris made it really clear that I could tell my immediate family, but that was it. That was in Jan. 2022, and then, in maybe Sept. 2022, he said, \"I put you on my Instagram and said you're in it.\" And I said, thank God, because all I could think about was that I'm going to get sued. So this is much better. All these years later, what do you remember about Donloe coming into your life? I was in Wales, doing a tour of a play, and I got a call from my agent: “They're doing aMission: Impossiblemovie, and they want you to audition for it.\" They sent me the script, and I took a three-hour train ride to Pinewood Studios, outside of London, and met Brian De Palma. Was in the room for about three minutes. As I walked out with the casting director, I said, \"Well, that was a waste of time.\" She said, \"No, no, no, you were in there the longest of anybody. He really liked you.\" I took the train back to Wales, got there just in time for the half-hour call [of the play], and I had a message from my agent: “They've offered you the job.\" Tell me about filming your big scene. I was on the film for about three weeks, off and on. I had almost nothing to do, which is a really great lesson for young actors. The one you think,ah, this is nothing, don't think that — every one of them is important. Mr. De Palma is not a people person, so my communication with him was primarily through the first AD, Chris Soldo. It was pretty much up to me what I wanted to do. The vomiting was not in the script. There was a lot of downtime, and one day I was just joking with the crew. I got a tap on the shoulder from Chris: “Mr. De Palma wants to see you.” I thought,shit. I walked up and he said, \"[Very monotone voice] You were really funny; everybody really liked what you're doing. Could you do that again?\" So we filmed all the vomiting that afternoon after lunch and the next day, and all that was just me messing around. After we finished, one of the crew said, “Your agent has to get ahold of Tums, because you’ll make a fortune.” And I should have! [Laughs.] How much thought did you put into your character at the time? Suzanne Doucette, who played the woman in my office, is the real deal — she's ex-FBI and CIA. She was there as an advisor as well, and some of her stories were unbelievable. She filled me in a lot about what Donloe does. Technically, you and Tom are in the same scene, but Donloe doesn’t know it. What were your interactions like with Tom on the first film? There wasn’t a huge amount. He's such a focused guy, doing the job at hand, and so when I was on set, it was always, “Hello,\" \"Good afternoon,\" and then he'd work. My penultimate day, he came up, shook my hand and patted me on the back: \"Great job. Really appreciate you being here.” When did you realize the legacy of your scene? My first day on set ofFinal Reckoning. Because I didn't think it was that big a deal. My friends and family went, \"Oh, it's a great scene,” but you think, yeah, they're my friends and family. Of course they're going to say that. But in our [initial] conversation, Chris said he’s always asked about Donloe. I thought he was blowing smoke. And then, on my first day, one of the other actors went, \"Oh my god, you're William Donloe!\" Chris just stood there, like,I told you so. That's when the penny sort of dropped. To be honest, this is still like a dream. I don't get it. I went and did some work 30 years ago, and suddenly I'm being interviewed byVanity Fair— are you fucking kidding me? This is just nuts. Over the years, were you thinking at all about Donloe? When either3or4was being written, I thought, why not bring Donloe back? I drafted this letter to Tom Cruise, \"Dear Tom, I have this idea...\" And it was like, not a fucking chance. I threw it away and never thought of it again. After your experience on the first film being short and isolated, what was it like stepping onto thisMissionset and fully being part of the team? My first day, I was being brought to see where we were going to [film]. It was an intricate set, a large sound stage, and they were recreating a tunnel section. I had to walk through this tunnel area into the room where Ving [Rhames] was doing his filming, and there was Tom, McQ, and a number of the crew. I got a big round of applause. And Tom gave me a hug: \"Welcome back.\" I felt 10 feet tall. This time around, you actually get to act with Tom. How did it compare? I've worked with a number of stars in my career, and some have something about them that—when they walk in, you know you need to bring your A- game. He is No. 1 on that list. He's positive, focused, knows what he's doing, and he's one of the best filmmakers alive today. Yet he's another actor and we’re working together on the scene. We had some long and very arduous days…I mean, nothing like his stunt days. But you're on set for a long time, and as much as I loved coming to work on this, there were a couple of days when it was tough. You walk in, and there's Tom, and you think,fuck it, I can do this — let's go. I'll feel tired tomorrow. He brings that into a room. In a world of IP and spinoffs, have you allowed yourself to picture the further adventures of Donloe? Mission: Donloe!Impossible: Donloe! I'm loving this. I think one of the strengths of Donloe is that he's not the lead. And Donloe doesn't do stunts. “Sorry, can Agent 12 do that?” No, that's not going to work so well withMission. In my screening, there were literal gasps when you arrived on screen. Have you been feeling that when watching the film with an audience? I’m old and deaf, so I haven't heard gasps, but I have heard, \"Oh!\" I think people appreciate the nice button — not for me, but for the character and story. He’s just a regular guy. Chris said that a lot of the questions asked were, “He did everything he was supposed to do. So why did he get screwed for it?” Some of the reaction still genuinely surprises me. For me, that's like three minutes on the screen, and it’s not that big a deal. I've seen the [first] movie a couple of times, and there are things that I wish I'd done differently. But what's happening now is just insane. I don’t know that this has ever happened, with a part that small, to come back and be given what I have here. I’ve had bigger parts, but never in a movie this size. And some of the stuff I’m getting now, like you wanting to talk to me, has never happened to me before. Am I enjoying it? Fuck yes.

    "title": "The Last of Us Season 2 Finale: Is Ellie Really Dead?",
    "article_text": "We were only ever going to get half a story here.Craig MazinandNeil Druckmannmade plenty of deviations from the PlayStation game they're adapting in this season ofThe Last of Us.But early on, it became clear that they would replicate the game's point/counterpoint structure—for better or worse. The result is a season of television that feels incomplete, because it is. WhileThe Last of Usseason two is clearly interested in exploring characters who make terrible choices despite having incomplete information—somethingPedro PascalandBella Ramsey’s old show,Game of Thrones,didoften and well—it’s also left its audience in the dark, which prevents us from understanding any dramatic irony or the poignancy of understanding something our heroes do not. Instead, we, like them, are just along for the ride. And this final episode feels very much like a ride. After last week'sflashback interlude, there's a lot for Ellie to do before the season wraps. She returns to the theater, where Jesse (Young Mazino) is tending to Dina (Isabela Merced), removing the crossbow bolt that’s stuck in Dina’s leg. Following the operation, Dina asks Ellie what happened at the hospital. At first, Ellie tells her that she got two words out of Nora (Tati Gabrielle): “wheel,” and “whale.” Then Ellie starts to break down, horrified by her own capacity for violence. \"I made her talk,\" she says. \"I thought it would be harder to do, but it wasn’t. It was easy. I just kept hurting her.\" While she did torture Nora, Ellie didn't kill her; instead, she just left the cordyceps infection to do its work. Dina takes Ellie's side, saying maybe Nora got what was coming to her. In a moment of vulnerability, Ellie wonders if maybe Nora didn't. Then she tells Dina what Joel did in Salt Lake City, and how Abby (Kaitlyn Dever) is the daughter of the doctor Joel murdered. Shaken by the news, Dina tells Ellie they need to go home, and Ellie seems to agree. That's easier said than done, though. Tommy (Gabriel Luna) is still out there, and they need to meet him at a rendezvous point so they can all head back to Jackson together. Ellie and Jesse head out, while Dina stays holed up in the theater. On the way, Jesse learns that Dina is pregnant with his kid, making his irritation at Ellie's recklessness even worse. Before they can hash anything out, they stumble onto a squad of WLF soldiers hunting down a lone Seraphite, whom they strip and drag away. Ellie wants to intervene, but Jesse holds her back—they're outnumbered three to one, and he is not dying out here. Briefly, the episode pauses to give us another perspective. At a WLF encampment in front of a Costco, Elise (Hetienne Park) talks to Isaac (Jeffrey Wright). Abby and her team have been missing for at least a day, and the timing could not be worse—a torrential downpour is about to escalate into a terrible storm, just before the WLF plans to invade the island home of the Seraphites. Elise thinks Isaac values Abby too much. Isaac tells her that the two of them might not survive the assault—but Abby was supposed to be the next leader of the WLF. In a final bit of downtime before things really escalate, Ellie and Jesse have a huge argument. As they fight, radio chatter alerts them to the WLF engaging with a sniper—Tommy. They scramble to high ground so they can find him. But then Ellie spots a Ferris Wheel in front of an aquarium across the sound—and immediately snaps back into her plan to find Abby. It’s a choice that gives both the viewer and Jesse extreme whiplash. Tommy is out there; they can hear the gunfire; he needs help. But Ellie stubbornly says they don'tknowthat the WLF is shooting at Tommy, and if it is, he'll handle himself fine. He'd want her to go after Abby, even. The two part ways, but not before having a final exchange that bluntly underlines the theme of this season—and presumably the next. Jesse moralizes about what's good for the community. Ellie yells “FUCK THE COMMUNITY.”Hercommunity, she says, was murdered in front of her, and she doesn't think Joel would stop trying to get his revenge if the roles were reversed. While Jesse's stoic sense of right and wrongisannoying, the fight also makes Ellie seem childish. She seems more like an angry kid violently mourning her surrogate dad than a grief-stricken young woman wrestling with a resolution she'll never get. This feeling only intensifies as her quest takes on its final leg this season. Ellie crosses the sound in a motorboat she finds abandoned by the WLF, who are all off to invade Seraphite island. Ellie is detoured there, briefly kidnapped and nearly murdered in a baffling scene that seems to exist only so she’ll understand that the Seraphites are Also Bad. When she escapes, she finds that Abby is not in the aquarium. Instead, Ellie surprises two more members of Abby’s team: Mel (Ariela Barer) and Owen (Spencer Lord). The standoff goes poorly. Ellie shoots Owe; the bullet goes clean through him and grazes Mel's neck just deeply enough to be fatal. As Mel fades, she reveals she's pregnant, and begs Ellie to cut the baby out—offering to walk her through the process. Ellie is overwhelmed, and Mel dies before the baby can be saved. This is a notable departure fromThe Last of Us Part II, in which Mel and Owen both fight back against Ellie, who kills them in self-defense. With a knife, even. Taken in conjunction with Ellie saying she did not kill Nora at the start of the episode—along with the fuzzy flashbacks of \"The Price\" immediately preceding this ugliness—it seems that the HBO version of the story is attempting to sand off the video game's rougher edges, trying to keep Ellie sympathetic, if not likable. The Ellie ofThe Last of UsPart IIis possessed by an insatiable rage. The Ellie of HBO'sThe Last of Usjust seems confused, like she's still not sure what the consequences of her actions might be. This is an interesting difference, but it's one that the rest of the story has not been adjusted to accommodate. If Ellie is so torn, why does she remain so driven? Perhaps \"The Price\" was too good at showing us her happier times, giving the impression of closure where Ellie does not seem to have any. Jesse and Tommy find Ellie breaking down in the aquarium, and take her back to the theater, where she seems once again ready to let go of her quest. Tommy, in one of his only lines this episode, affirms Ellie's decisions, telling her that Abby's team was guilty. But he also asks if Ellie can make peace with not finding Abby. Ellie says she'll just have to. But that’d before Abby appears, getting the jump on Tommy after he goes into the theater’s lobby. She kills Jesse as he and Ellie race to his aid.Kaitlyn Dever'sreturn to the story is formidable; she seethes with palpable rage in this brief scene as Abby. \"I let you live,\" she tells Ellie, furious. \"And you wasted it.\" She points her gun at Ellie, and there’s a shot. We won't see what happens until season three. But even then, it might be a while before the cliffhanger is resolved. Because final scene of season two finally pulls the big bait-and-switch at the heart ofThe Last of Us Part II: It flashes back to Abby, waking up from a nap as she surveys the stadium that the WLF has converted into a community. WhenThe Last of Usreturns, we'll see how Abby spent the three days Ellie was out there, looking for her, and finally get a more complete picture of the conflict in Seattle. It might not be a clearer one, but it'll certainly be bigger. Mariska Hargitay Was “Living a Lie” for 30 Years.

Their return is a powerful reflection of how cultural exchange offers hope at a low point in China-US relations. The two volumes of 2,300-year-old silk books – the earliest known in China – arrived in Beijing from the United States on May 18. The Zidanku Silk Manuscripts are the oldest ancient classics ever found, dating back to about 300BC. Volumes II and III of the three-volume set were transferred from the National Museum of Asian Art, part of the Smithsonian Institution in the United States. Volume I is privately owned, and efforts were reportedly also under way for its return to China. Illegally excavated in 1942 from a tomb in Zidanku in central China, the books were first acquired by a Chinese collector. They were taken from the country in 1946 by US collector John Hadley Cox. The museum received the silk manuscript fragments as a gift in 1992. Diplomatic efforts to get them returned were started by the National Cultural Heritage Administration of China decades later.",

But tour operators on Monday were hesitant to link the increase to more Hongkongers wanting to visit the country ahead of a mega-earthquake some have speculated will hit in July, with one operator being “cautiously optimistic” about tour demand in the coming summer peak season. The country welcomed 263,600 Hong Kong residents in April, a 42.9 per cent jump from the 184,460 visitors in the same month last year, according to data from the Japan National Tourism Organisation released on Friday. Hong Kong residents visiting Japan in February and March dropped by 5 and 9.9 per cent year-on-year, respectively, which the organisation attributed to major holidays such as Lunar New Year and Easter falling on different months this year. Between January and April, Japan welcomed 911,200 people from Hong Kong, a 12.8 per cent increase from the same period last year. The organisation attributed the rise in visitor numbers to the new route from Hong Kong to Komatsu in Ishikawa prefecture and the resumption of flights to Ishigaki in Okinawa prefecture.",

    "title": "Are Hong Kong’s penalties tough enough for contractors behind on-site accidents?",
    "article_text": "Lawmakers raise concerns at meeting on ombudsman’s investigation into workplace health and safety Hong Kong lawmakers have questioned whether existing penalties for contractors that fail to ensure workers’ safety are tough enough, pointing to a business that was convicted 77 times over several years but was fined no more than HK$10,000 (US$1,280) on average. The concerns were raised at a Legislative Council meeting on Monday that discussed the ombudsman’s investigation into occupational health and safety. According to the report, labour authorities conducted 74,410 safety inspections at various sites last year. They also issued 4,567 notices to employers for violating safety measures and launched 2,388 prosecutions. Figures from the document also showed that 7,371 industrial accidents were reported in 2024, a decrease of 9.4 per cent from 2023. The report found 28 workers had died on the job last year, with 22 of them counted as industrial fatalities. The number of fatalities in the construction sector last year stood at 14, down from 20 in 2023. Lawmakers argued that the punishment for employers who failed to ensure worker safety was “too lenient”.",

A former senior economic planner has called for China’s annual growth target to be lowered for the next five years, factoring in the likelihood of a protracted rivalry with the United States and the need to solve deep-rooted structural problems in China. In the span of a single generation, China has redefined the limits of civil engineering, transforming itself from a nation reliant on foreign bridge-building expertise to the undisputed architect of the world’s most audacious crossings.",

While hosting Chinese Premier Li Qiang in Jakarta on Saturday, Prabowo praised China’s record of standing up to imperialism and its backing of Palestinian statehood – an issue that resonates deeply in Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim-majority country. “I would like to express my respect to China, which has consistently defended the interests of developing countries … fighting oppression, imperialism, colonialism and apartheid,” Prabowo said. “China defends the liberation struggles in countries that are still oppressed by imperialism and colonialism.” China had supported liberation movements even during its own nation-building phase and continued to do so today, he said, citing Beijing’s “leadership, especially in defending the Palestinian people” as “a source of pride for all of us”. Indonesia has long advocated for a two-state solution in the Israel-Palestinian conflict and has grown increasingly vocal as civilian casualties in Gaza mount.",

    "article_text": "The Post unpacks filing requirements and offers insights into controversy involving journalists being targeted for audits The tax filing season in Hong Kong is in full swing, with June 2 marking the deadline for most individuals. Tax audits have come under scrutiny recently after at least 20 journalists raised concerns about “unreasonable” reviews targeting them and their families. The Inland Revenue Department (IRD) Commissioner dismissed these claims, stressing that assessment procedures were applied uniformly and did not target specific industries or individuals based on their background. The Post provides a guide on what to pay attention to regarding filing requirements, with insights from taxation experts on the recent audit controversy. The government issued the Individual Tax Returns for 2024-25 on May 2, 2025, requiring taxpayers to report their salaries, rental income from solely owned properties and profits from sole-proprietorship businesses. The tax return must be filed within one month from the date of issue, or within three months if the taxpayer solely owned an unincorporated business during the year of assessment. An automatic extension of one month will be given for filing the tax return for the year electronically through a service called eTAX. An eTAX account holder can file their taxes online as long as they do not claim an exemption on their income, does not own any sole proprietorship business with gross income of more than HK$2,000,000, has not claimed double taxation relief, or has not obtained an advance tax ruling for that year.",

The “Southbound Travel for Guangdong Vehicles” scheme, which has been the subject of discussion for several years, was originally expected to start at the end of 2024 or early this year. But a source said on Monday that it would take another few months before the policy could be implemented. Another source said mainland authorities were still finalising the scheme’s quota and other arrangements. In its initial stages, the scheme is expected to make available at least 1,000 automated car parking spaces on an artificial island under the city’s jurisdiction that forms part of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge. Guangdong visitors will only be allowed to “park and fly” or “park and visit the city” in the scheme’s early phases.",

Under the proposed deal, Hygon will absorb Sugon shares through a stock swap agreement and issue new mainland China-listed shares to Sugon’s shareholders, according to their stock exchange filings on Sunday. To avoid fluctuations in share prices from the deal, both companies’ Shanghai-listed shares would be suspended for up to 10 trading days starting Monday, according to the filings, which did not disclose the amount of money involved. The merger marks a major move to consolidate two of the leading players in China’s computing supply chain. Hygon, which was founded in 2014, specialises in the design of central processing units (CPUs) and so-called deep computing units, an accelerator card specially designed for artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning. The company is seen as an important player in the country’s push for semiconductor self-sufficiency, with analysts suggesting its products could become an alternative for AI chips from Nvidia, which have come under tighter export restrictions from the US.",

    "article_text": "Follow us on Follow us on 0Shares Hong Kong racing Champion galloper becomes just the fourth Hong Kong-trained horse to amass HK$100 million in prize money bySam Agars Shares While Voyage Bubble’s brilliant surge to a fifth Group One success and a Triple Crown clean sweep rightly demanded much of the attention at Sha Tin on Sunday, the champion galloper also quietly ticked another box on the weekend by becoming just the fourth Hong Kong-trained horse to amass HK$100 million in prize money. More than HK$61 million of his HK$107,472,475 career earnings have come in a superb 2024-25 campaign that has featured four elite-level victories and a HK$10 million Triple Crown bonus for his troubles. It’ll go down as one of the better campaigns ever seen from a Hong Kong galloper but amazingly, may not be enough to secure him Horse of the Year honours at the end of the term. While Romantic Warrior has been immense again this season, it does look a race in two between Ka Ying Rising and Voyage Bubble. UNBELIEVABLE! 🤯31 years since River Verdon won the#TripleCrownfor the first time, Hong Kong has a second winner of the series in Voyage Bubble, who makes light work of his Champions & Chater Cup rivals... 🏆🏆🏆@WorldPool|@mcacajamez|#HKracingpic.twitter.com/bIP5MwdPxa Many still have Ka Ying Rising as the front runner after an undefeated eight-run campaign lined with four Group One successes and multiple track-record-breaking efforts. Those in Voyage Bubble’s corner can make a compelling case for Ricky Yiu Poon-fai’s galloper, however. He has bagged more prize money than Ka Ying Rising this season, has been far more versatile than the sprinter by winning at the top level over 1,600m, 2000m and 2,400m and he just became Hong Kong’s second ever Triple Crown winner, and first in 31 years. Amid the euphoria that followed Voyage Bubble’s three-and-a-half-length Group One Champions & Chater Cup (2,400m) demolition job on Sunday, jockey James McDonald briefly cast his thoughts back to Voyage Bubble’s agonising defeat at the hands of Red Lion in last month’s Group One Champions Mile. RED LION ROARS! 🦁It's an 89/1 shocker in the FWD Champions Mile at Sha Tin for@HugeBowmanand John Size as Red Lion lands his first Group 1 over Voyage Bubble...#FWDChampionsDay|#HKracingpic.twitter.com/BoYbwGqmmt After prevailing by a short head, $90 shot Red Lion had to survive a protest from the connections of $1.6 favourite Voyage Bubble before securing the prize. “I still can’t believe he got beat last time, to be fair,” said McDonald on Sunday. If that short-head margin does cost Voyage Bubble Horse of the Year honours, there is little doubt he can count himself just about as unlucky as any galloper who has missed out on the gong. While Voyage Bubble couldn’t quite snare five Group One wins this campaign, McDonald certainly could as he continued his extraordinary fly-in, fly-out feature-race spree in Hong Kong. Thanks to Romantic Warrior’s Group One Hong Kong Cup (2,000m) success and Voyage Bubble’s four top-line wins, McDonald led the way in 2024-25 by winning five of the 12 elite-level contests of the campaign. Zac Purton was the other jockey to bag multiple Group One wins, saluting three times aboard Ka Ying Rising, while the Australia-based McDonald has now plundered 12 Group One successes in Hong Kong in the past two and a half years. While the Group Ones are behind us for another season, there are still four Group features to come in 2024-25, starting with this Saturday’s Group Three Sha Tin Vase (1,200m) and Group Three Lion Rock Trophy (1,600m). Won last season by Ka Ying Rising, this year’s Sha Tin Vase is headlined by four-time Group One winner Lucky Sweynesse and the ever-consistent Helios Express. Ka Ying Rising has Group 1 targets next season! 😏The gifted 3YO secures the G3 Sha Tin Vase in style with@KarisTeetanfor David Hayes...#HKracingpic.twitter.com/kTyzBz3OMY Rounding out the 11 entries are Lucky With You, Victor The Winner, Patch Of Theta, Magic Control, Invincible Sage, Mugen, Copartner Prance, Beauty Waves and Lady’s Choice. The Lion Rock Trophy has also attracted 11 entries and a string of Group One performers, with Red Lion and Beauty Eternal joined by Chancheng Glory, Beauty Joy, Happy Together, Sunlight Power, Divano, Encountered, Johannes Brahms, Ka Ying Generation and Pray For Mir.

The Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority (MPFA), the scheme’s regulator, has instructed MPF trustees and fund managers to prepare for a contingency plan if the last remaining credit agency downgrades the US government bonds. “Recently, the MPFA reiterated this reminder to all MPF trustees, urging them to evaluate the potential implications on MPF funds in consultation with relevant investment managers in view of the latest market situation,” the MPFA said in reply to a query from the Post on Monday. It also asked the “trustees to formulate appropriate strategies and mitigation measures in case the US does not meet the definition of ‘exempt authority’ due to changes in credit ratings”. The MPFA said such preparation would be needed as the authority had no plan to change the current investment requirements. It would be the responsibility of the MPF investment manager to “formulate suitable compliance contingency plans and make timely and orderly adjustments to their asset allocation in response to possible market developments while acting in the best interests of MPF scheme members”, the MPFA added.",

The Security Bureau revealed its proposal to increase fees for 28 services in a document submitted to the legislature on Monday, with rates projected to rise by between 3 and 51 per cent and take effect in September. Last revised in 2000, the fee for issuing a 48-page passport for people aged 16 or above will rise by 13 per cent from HK$460 to HK$520. Children under 16 will be charged HK$260, up from HK$230. A 32-page passport for people 16 or above will cost HK$430, a 16 per cent increase from the current HK$370. Younger Hongkongers will have to pay HK$215, up from HK$185. The rates were last amended in 2006. The proposal is expected to generate an extra HK$104 million more for the public coffers every year, according to authorities. The bureau explained that the price review was based on “cost recovery” and “user-pays” principles, as the fees should be “adequate to recover the full cost of providing the goods or services” in general.",

    "article_text": "Winston Churchill wore a signet ring bearing 2 family crests, and Frank Sinatra and James Brown were both partial to a pinky ring – today, brands from Anita Ko to Yvonne Léon are embracing the style So what exactly is a signet ring – and is it the same as a pinky ring? Not quite. A pinky ring is simply any ring worn on the little finger. A signet ring, on the other hand, is defined by its flat surface, often engraved with a crest, initials or symbol. While signets are traditionally worn on the pinky – of the non-dominant hand – a pinky ring doesn’t have to be a signet. Still, the two terms are often used interchangeably – and with good reason, as the signet has become the most iconic pinky style of all. The origins of the signet ring can be traced back to Mesopotamia around 3,500BC, when they were used – often by illiterate businessmen – to authenticate documents and mark property. The ancient Egyptians continued the tradition, carving sacred symbols in reverse to leave imprints in wax or clay – giving rise to the tradition of wearing the ring on the pinky, which made sealing easier without obstructing writing. The use of signet rings continued through the Roman Empire, when carved gemstones served as personal signatures – and status symbols – for emperors and merchants. In medieval Europe, they also became legal instruments, and were often destroyed upon the owner’s death to prevent misuse. The pope’s Fisherman’s Ring, used to seal documents until 1842, symbolises papal authority to this day.",

The proposed regulation would require platform operators to “reduce burdens for merchants”, with a focus on supporting small and medium-sized businesses by allowing them to pay lower fees or receive exemptions from certain commissions. The document also urges platforms to “take social responsibility” during natural disasters or public health emergencies by reducing or waiving commissions and lowering other fees. The regulation aims for greater fee transparency through more visible online disclosures. For deposits, operators must specify how the money will be returned and ensure that it is not misused or embezzled, according to the draft. Shopping sites would also be required to publish commission fees “in a prominent position on the homepage”. Before any planned pricing changes, platforms would have to solicit public opinion on the homepage for a minimum of seven days. They would also be required to keep historical pricing records for three years to ensure that merchants could easily access past standards.",

    "article_text": "Authorities say city’s diversification of markets a factor, with value of exports increasing to HK$434.5 billon, up from HK$378.8 billion in April last year Hong Kong’s exports rose by 14.7 per in April against a year ago, following an 18.5 per cent jump in March, a result the government has attributed to sustained growth of the mainland Chinese economy and the city’s efforts to strengthen ties with diverse markets amid the Sino-US trade war. But economists cautioned on Monday that momentum could weaken in the coming months as exporters currently rushing to fulfil orders would face reduced demand when tariffs went back up. According to the Census and Statistics Department, the value of exports reached HK$434.5 billion (US$55.4 billion) in April, up from the HK$378.8 billion recorded in the same month a year ago. Imports jumped by 15.8 per cent, year on year, to HK$450.5 billion. The latest figures followed a 90-day pause in the trade war earlier this month, when the US agreed to cut tariffs on Chinese exports from 145 per cent to 30 per cent, and China reduced duties on American goods from 125 per cent to 10 per cent. Last month, exports to the mainland and many other Asian markets grew notably, while those to the United States saw a marginal increase and shipments to the European Union declined, authorities noted. Shipments to the United States saw only a marginal year-on-year increase of 1 per cent in April, reaching HK$27.9 million. While this figure was 10.8 per cent higher than the HK$25.8 million recorded in March, that month itself recorded a 11.4 per cent year-on-year jump for US-bound shipment, according to government statistics. Billy Mak Sui-choi, an associate professor at the department of accountancy, economics and finance at Baptist University, said he expected a contraction in exports to the US in the coming months, while the robust growth achieved by Asian markets in April might not be maintained.",

    "article_text": "But lawmakers say penalty for five-hour disruption does not reflect seriousness of case, with one calling suspension ‘appalling’ and a ‘disaster’ The incident was the third traffic disruption in four months caused by technical failures, drawing strong criticism from lawmakers on Monday. Secretary for Transport and Logistics Mable Chan also pledged to consider reflecting incidents that may affect service and passengers with the company’s remuneration. During a legislative panel meeting, Chan confirmed that the HK$19.2 million penalty for the Tseung Kwan O line disruption would be allocated for passenger rebates. She added that further funds would be set aside for similar incidents in February and April involving engineering trains, which the government viewed with “grave concern”. “The cumulative funds for such rebates will mean there will be a day with half-priced rides for people,” Chan said. “I hope the MTR Corp can see that the greater their ability, the greater their responsibility.” Chan said she would “definitely” raise lawmaker Chan Hok-fung’s suggestion of performance-linked pay for management during discussions with the company’s board of directors.",

Analysts from Morgan Stanley said that “while some of these discounts have been in place since April, the official announcement sends a strong signal” about how tough the market was.",
