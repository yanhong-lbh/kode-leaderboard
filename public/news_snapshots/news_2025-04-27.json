    "title": "Cousin of infamous fraudster 'Crazy Eddie' out to bring down Trump nemesis NY AG Letitia James",
    "article_text": "Notorious Crazy Eddie fraudster Sammy Antar says he's at war with NY AG Letitia James with mortgage fraud claims. EXCLUSIVE:New York Attorney General Letitia James, who became President Donald Trump's nemesis after accusing him of mortgage fraud, is now battling the very same allegations, and her chief tormentor is a legendary scam artist who says he knows a crook when he sees one. Sam Antar, who kept the books for his cousin, \"Crazy Eddie\" Antar, while he built a New York-area consumer electronics empire, helped his late relative skim cash and inflate the value of their company before leaving investors high and dry in the late 1980s. He says he knows every trick in the fraud book and smells a rat in James' real estate filings. \"I don't know how the wheels of justice will turn and, to be frank, I don't care as long as I'm right,\" said Antar, who has made his findings public. \"If they fail to convict her, it's their humiliation and their embarrassment.\" Antar pleaded guilty to multiple felonies, cooperating with prosecutors to help convicthis cousin, whose chain's ads featured a maniacal pitchman pledging, \"Our prices are insane!\" While Eddie Antar fled to Israel, was extradited back to the U.S. and served time before dying in 2016, Sam Antar reinvented himself as a fraud expert for government agencies and law firms. He runs a website where he posts about his various investigations. An undated Crazy Eddie Store in Coney Island(Anthony Pescatore/NY Daily News Archive via Getty Images) Sammy Antar, a forensic accountant investigator and the former CFO of the consumer electronics company Crazy Eddie, uncovered the documents that led to a criminal referral against New York State Attorney General Letitia James.(Fox News) ‘PLAYING WITH THE COURTS’: TRUMP ADMIN HIT WITH DOZENS OF SUITS AFTER YEARS OF PRESIDENT CONDEMNING ‘LAWFARE’ In an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital, Antar said he worked alone and was the first to unearth documentation of James’ alleged mortgage fraud and posted it to hisWhite Collar Fraudwebsite weeks ago. He said the strength of his findings, backed by his renowned reputation in the field of uncovering white-collar fraud for the government, eventually led to the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) picking up the case and sending a criminal referral to the Justice Department. \"It's not the Trump administration at war with Tish James, it's me bringing her to accountability and justice,\" Antar told Fox News Digital. \"I'm not the Trump administration. I was investigating Tish James because that is what I do.\" \"I took all kinds of risks doing it, from retaliation, to libel, to reputational risk. But I stand by everything.\" New York State Attorney General Letitia James is being accused of mortgage fraud.(Lev Radin/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images) Antar said his findings were all uncovered independently by him and that he is not working for the government by looking into James. Fox News Digital asked the FHFA and the White House to corroborate his claims but did not receive a response. \"Everything that I've done is thoroughly documented,\" said Antar, who said he's a Democrat. \"This is not bullying. This is not the Trump administration at war. Trump has his own agenda. I don't care. I am not Donald Trump. All I did was, I did my forensic accounting and I thoroughly documented everything that I did.\" Antar’s investigations uncovered documents stretching back as far as 1983, which he said indicate James may have been misrepresenting her financial situation for decades in order to nail sweetheart loans from lenders. The FHFA accuses James of falsifying records to meet certain lending requirements and score favorable loan terms. James, 66, denies the allegations and claims Trump is behind the move, calling it a \"revenge tour\" for the $454 millioncivil fraudlawsuit she successfully spearheaded against him last year. Trump and the Trump Organization are currently appealing. In Trump's civil fraud case, the then-presidential candidate was accused of financial misrepresentation and providing false statements about his real estate, the same types of crimes James is being accused of by the FHFA. Antar told Fox News Digital that he started digging into James’ records months ago after he looked into the costs of her private flight travel as attorney general.

She bought the property around the time the Trump trial was getting underway. The FHFA said primary residence mortgages receive more favorable loan terms, including lower interest rates, compared to secondary residence mortgages. In her mortgage documents, James reaffirmed this would be her primary residence, Antar said. \"She gave her relative power of attorney and declared, in a notarized document, that she intended to make the property her primary residence,\" Antar said. \"If that’s true, she’d be disqualified from holding office in New York. Neither she nor the relative filed for a homestead exemption, yet the mortgage was issued under the condition that both would live there. That’s how she got favorable terms.\" One of Letitia James' properties in Norfolk, Va.(Google Maps) A building permit issued on James’ New York property on July 15, 2024, lists that property as the \"JAMES RESIDENCE\" and states \"Remain Occupied,\" according to the FHFA letter. James' office told Fox News Digital that she has been clear that she is not using the Virginia home as her primary residence because she lives inNew York. In a letter to the Justice Department this week, James' lawyers told Attorney General Pam Bondi that while the power-of-attorney form \"mistakenly stated the property to be Ms. James’ principal residence,\" Pult \"absolutely ignored\" an all-caps statement to the mortgage loan broker two weeks prior that the property \"WILL NOT be my primary residence\" but would rather be the primary residence of her niece. James' attorney, Abbe Lowell, said emails showed the mortgage broker understood this. Property in Brooklyn, NY In 2001, James purchased a property in Brooklyn with its certificate of occupancy listing the property as having five units, but James, the FHFA said, consistently misrepresented the same property as having four units in both building permit applications and numerous mortgage documents and applications. This enabled James to get a lower mortgage interest rate, known as a conforming loan, since conforming loans are only available on four-unit or fewer structures. Letitia James' property in Brooklyn, center(Google Maps) COURT NAMES NEW JUDGE IN TRUMP CIVIL FRAUD CASE BEFORE REASSIGNING PREVIOUS JUDGE HOURS LATER She also netted mortgage assistance through the Home Affordable Modification Program, a government-run program that provides homeowners at risk of foreclosure with reduced monthly mortgage payments and recipients had to have properties with four dwellings or fewer, the referral states. James' lawyers told Bondi that the residence \"has four floors and, for as long as Ms. James has lived there, the property has always functioned as a four-person residence.\" The certificate of occupancy for the property listed online still shows the2001 version, listed as five units. The DOB told Fox News Digital that that document is the most recent certificate of occupancy they have on file for that building. James’ office told Fox News that James has been clear in her filings that the property is a four-unit dwelling and that the previous owner listed the property as a five-unit before she purchased it in 2001. Mortgages with father listed as her husband Meanwhile, James, who never married, is also accused of saying her father was her husband to obtain two mortgages in Queens as a married couple. The documents allegedly show that the property James purchased with her father had both parties listed as \"husband and wife\" in 1983 and 2000. \"While this was a long time ago, it raises serious concerns about the validity of Ms. James representations on mortgage applications,\" Pulte wrote. Lowell, who accused the FHFA of \"cherry-picking,\" writes the deed lists her father \"and Letitia James, his daughter.'\" \"As I have set forth, the exhibits Director Pulte included with his letter are notable for the fact that he omitted numerous other records (some of which we have included) which refute the allegations of impropriety, and make clear that a mistake on one line had no significance,\" Lowell wrote. \"If there is anything that you believe I have not addressed in the real facts and documents provided, please let me know. Otherwise, we would expect a quick response confirming that this referral matter has been closed by the Department.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Antar, meanwhile, continues to back his findings. \"I documented everything that I did,\" he said. \"And I stand by everything I did.

    "article_text": "Noem's purse, which contained $3,000 in cash and her DHS access card, was stolen from DC restaurant last week. It's not clear if the suspect targeting Noem or it was a random crime. A second arrest has been made in connection to the theft of Department of Homeland Security Kristi Noem's purse while she was out having lunch on Easter with her family. Authorities announced that they apprehended the accomplice believed to be tied to the series of thefts in D.C. in Miami on Sunday. \"The individual is believed to be a co-conspirator in those incidents with the primary defendant who is accused of committing a robbery against Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem,\" a spokesperson for the Secret Service shared in a statement. \"Public safety is strongest when built on trust and collaboration,\" Special Agent in Charge Rafael Barros said. \"We are grateful to the Miami Beach Police Department for their swift and outstanding assistance in today's apprehension. After receiving information from Washington, Miami Beach Police officers quickly implemented targeted patrols and located the defendant, who was taken into custody without incident.\" SUSPECT ARRESTED FOR ALLEGED THEFT OF KRISTI NOEM'S BAG CONTAINING $3K IN CASH: REPORTS The identity of the alleged accomplice has not been released, but officials said the suspect is currently being held on an immigration detainer as charges are finalized. This comes hours after authorities announced the first arrest ofan illegal immigrantwith an extensive criminal history who was believed to be tied to theft. \"Thank you to Secret Service and ICE and our law enforcement partners for finding and arresting the criminal who stole my bag on Easter Sunday as I shared a meal with my family at a Washington DC restaurant,\" Noem's spokesperson shared in a statement with Fox News Digital. Noem said, \"This individual is a career criminal who has been in our country illegally for years.\" The Secret Service spokesperson said that they determined the theft was not targeted and had nothing to do with \"Secretary Noem or her role as Secretary of Homeland Security.\" Retired NYPD inspector and Fox News contributor Paul Mauro told Fox News Digital he agreed with the Secret Service and believes that this theft was not targeted specifically at Noem, but rather motivated by the luxury bag itself. \"This was not targeted. This is pretty much the bottom of the criminal food chain.They, I know he had an accomplice, just wanted to make money and get away with it,\" Mauro explained. \"Why invite the kind of scrutiny the head of DHS would invite?  We’re not talking about KGB here.\" The suspect was identified as 49-year-old Mario Bustamante Leiva, who authorities say is an illegally present Chilean national, who was linked to a series of thefts in April, according to the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police Department. Officials said in each ruse, Leiva approached victims as they ate in a restaurant, stole their purses from the back of their seats, and then fled the scene. Detectives locatedvideo evidence of the theftswhich led them to identify the alleged suspect as Levia. He was arrested on Saturday and charged with two counts of robbery and faces additional charges for an offense being investigated by the United States Secret Service, officials said.

    "title": "Marco Rubio hits back at claims that minor US citizens were deported without due process",
    "article_text": "Secretary of State Marco Rubio denied a Washington Post report that three child US citizens were deported. Secretary of State Marco Rubio denied claims that three minor U.S. citizens, all under ten years old – and one with stage IV cancer, were deported without due process, calling the accusations \"misleading.\" The Washington Post reported that three American citizens from two different families, aged two, four and seven, were deported along with their mothers from a Louisiana facility on Friday. The report alleged that the four-year-old child is suffering from stage-4 cancer and that the mother had no way of contacting their doctors, according to the family’s lawyer. Rubio pushed back against the claims that the children were deported, instead asserting that the children’s mothers, who were not in the country legally, opted to take their children with them. \"That’s a misleading headline. Three U.S. citizens, aged 4, 7 and 2 were not deported. Their mothers were legally deported, and the children went with their mothers. They can come back to their father or someone who wants to assume them. Ultimately, it was the mothers who were here illegally. You guys make it sound like ICE kicked down the door and grabbed the child and threw them on an airplane, and it’s misleading and that is not true,\" Rubio said. MIGRANT LAWYERS CLAIM TRUMP IS DEPORTING WITHOUT 'DUE PROCESS,' BUT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio denied that the US government was deporting child citizens without due process.(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein, Pool) Trump appointee U.S. District Judge Terry A. Doughty, however, did not believe the federal government's claims that the children were not in fact deported. In response to an emergency order filed Thursday night by the father of the two-year-old girl, the judge issued an order expressing his \"strong suspicion that the government just deported a U.S. citizenwith no meaningful process.\" The toddler had accompanied her mother to an immigration meeting that would allow her to remain in their community called an Intensive Supervision Appearance Program, the family’s lawyers claimed. \"The government contends that this is all okay because the mother wishes that the child be deported with her, but the court doesn’t know that,\" Doughty wrote. The family's lawyers say the girl’s father was only able to speak to her mother for one minute before their phone call was abruptly endedby ICE agents, and the girl was shipped off to Honduras with her mother the following morning. DEMS FUME OVER 'DUE PROCESS' FOR ABREGO GARCIA DESPITE LONG HISTORY OF PARTY BUCKING THE LEGAL PRINCIPLE Rubio remained firm that the only targets for deportations were the mothersin the US illegally, and that the children would be welcome to return if their fathers or another suitable guardian were to assume responsibility for them. Rubio said the administration is committed to securing the border.(James Breeden for New York Post / Mega) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"If someone is in this country unlawfully, illegally that person gets deported. If that person is with a 2-year-old child and says I want to take my child with me, then you have two choices. You can say yes, of course, you can take your child whether they’re a citizen or not, because it is your child. Or say yes, you can go, but your child must stay behind. And then your headlines would read U.S. holding hostage 2-year-old, 4-year-old, 7 -year-old while mother deported,\" Rubio said.

    "title": "Waltz doubles down on Hegseth praise amid ongoing Pentagon controversy",
    "article_text": "National security advisor Michael Waltz discusses President Donald Trump’s pursuit to end the war in Ukraine, the threat China poses to the U.S. and more on ‘Sunday Morning Futures.’ Trump national security adviser Mike Waltz reiterated the administration’s support for Secretary of DefensePete Hegsethon Sunday, saying they \"couldn’t be prouder\" of his early months in the role, despite a wave of high-profile controversies and resignations that have embroiled the department in recent weeks. Speaking toFox News host Maria Bartiromoon Sunday, Waltz was pressed about the alleged dysfunction inside the Pentagon’s top ranks— and whether, in his view, the current Pentagon is equipped to deliver on lofty foreign policy goals, including helping broker a negotiated settlement in Russia’s war in Ukraine. \"Can you do this in what appears to be a chaotic, weakened Defense Department?\" Bartiromo asked Waltz on \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" citing reports of chaos and dysfunction, including recent firings of Hegseth’s top aides, and reports he has been threatening polygraph tests for some staffers at the department. \"I'll tell you about a weakened Pentagon,\" Waltz fired back. \"That was one that had a Defense Secretary that disappeared for two weeks just last year, and nobody knew about it.\" DEFENSE SECRETARY PETE HEGSETH REBUFFS NEW GROUP CHAT ALLEGATIONS AS ATTEMPT TO ‘SABOTAGE’ TRUMP'S AGENDA Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is seen at Guantanamo Bay earlier this year.(U.S. Army photo by Staff Sgt. ShaTyra Cox) In contrast to his predecessor, Waltz said Hegseth is \"leading from the front\" at the Defense Department, and praised what he described as Hegseth's early efforts to reform the Pentagon. \"He is leading the charge, and he has no tolerance for leaking,\" Waltz said, dismissing the alleged chaos or dysfunction as a \"media narrative,\" and one he vowed they \"are going to power through.\" Waltz alsobrushed off a questionabout the departures of senior aides, including Hegseth’s own chief of staff, Joe Kasper, last week. The exodus of senior officials and other allegations of chaos from inside the Pentagon have prompted some Democrats to call for an investigation into his leadership. But Waltz also brushed off these characterizations of dysfunction on Sunday. Asked by Bartiromo how he was going to replace the fired Pentagon officials, Waltz said in response: \"Maria, there’s 20,000 people in the Pentagon.\" \"There is a record number of generals,\" he said. \"And the other piece— there is accountability. We have had several general officers that weren’t getting the job done, and admirals get fired and get replaced… That’s what the Pentagon needs.\" Waltz argued that that is a stark contrast to the longtime culture at the Pentagon, where he said \"no one ever gets fired, [and] there’s never a sense of accountability.\" \"And now there is,\" he told Bartiromo. \"Whether it’s leaks, or not getting the job done, or failures in terms of procurement acquisition, now you have a leader that’s in charge,\" Waltz said. \"And I couldn’t be prouder of Pete Hegseth.\" HEGSETH SHARED DETAILS OF YEMEN STRIKES IN SECOND SIGNAL CHAT: REPORT Pete Hegseth, left, President-elect Donald Trump's choice to be Defense secretary, shakes hands with Chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss. after his Senate Armed Services Committee for his confirmation hearing.(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) Waltz’s remarks come as Hegseth’s role has come undermounting scrutiny in recent weeks— both for his participation in at least one Signal group chat in March where he discussed a planned military strike against the Houthis, and the firing of several senior staffers earlier this month. Hegseth earlier this month fired three top aides: including his aide, Dan Caldwell, his deputy chief of staff Darin Selnick, and the chief of staff to the deputy defense secretary, Colin Carroll. These oustings were described as both \"baffling\" and alarming by John Ullyot, a former Pentagon communications official who resigned earlier this year. \"The dysfunction is now a major distraction for the president — who deserves better from his senior leadership,\" Ullyot wrotein an op-ed for Politico. The White House, however, has sought to emphasize its support for Hegseth in recent days, with both Vice President JD Vance and White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavittvehemently dismissing reportsthat the administration could be considering a possible replacement. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Let me reiterate: The president stands strongly behind Secretary Hegseth and the change that he is bringing to the Pentagon, and the results that he's achieved thus far speak for themselves,\" Leavitt told reporters at a briefing last week, describing the reports as a \"smear campaign.\" Breanne Deppisch is a national politics reporter for Fox News Digital covering the Trump administration, with a focus on the Justice Department, FBI, and other national news.",

    "title": "UN cash app for Gazans exploited by Hamas as terror group steals aid money meant for civilians",
    "article_text": "For the first time since Hamas seized power 18 years ago, Gazans are speaking out against Hamas at great personal risk, Fox News' Mike Tobin reports. United Nations agencies' monthly cash transfers to Gaza residents are inadvertently strengthening the Hamas terrorist organization, as the group and affiliated traders continue to control the money flow to the enclave, an expert on Hamas' financial and economic operations said. \"Hamas exploits its role as the de facto ruler of Gaza to extract financial gains from aid money sent byU.N. organizationsto civilians via apps still operating in the region,\" Eyal Ofer told Fox News Digital. \"The aid system is being manipulated by Hamas and affiliated traders. Hamas does this largely behind the scenes, leveraging their control over large merchants, crime families, and using cash to establish a shadow banking system within Gaza.\" HOW ISRAEL'S WAR AGAINST HAMAS TERRORISTS WILL BE DIFFERENT UNDER TRUMP Gazans at a bazaar set up to meet their basic needs amidst the rubble in the heavily damaged Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza on the 3rd day of Ramadan, after Israel halted humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, on March 3, 2025.(Mahmoud Issa/Anadolu via Getty Images)) Each month, international organizations send significant sums into Gaza's economy. The U.N.'s World Food Programme (WFP) transfers approximately $18.43 million, reaching 82,636 families, with each family receiving an average of $209, according to open-source data. UNICEF’s monthly assistance averages $5 million, helping to reach at least 20,000 families every month. \"I go to the market and meet people whose job is to provide cash in exchange for a fee,\" Gaza resident Shahab Yousef toldIsrael's news agency TPS-IL. \"The fee is 20–30%. If I transfer 1,000 shekels [$271] I get back 700 [$190],\" he said. \"For big purchases, I pay digitally. But at the market, I need cash, and I lose 30 percent every time.\" Another Gaza resident, Nidal Qawasmeh, expressed similar frustration to TPS-IL. \"These people are charging 30 percent just to give you cash. I just want to take care of my family, but everything costs me more because of this. Prices are insane.\" The specific amount received per family every month is around $270 (or 1,000 New Israeli Shekels), which was calculated as 80% of the Survival Minimum Expenditure Basket, UNICEF told Fox News Digital. Smaller organizations like UNFPA and others also contribute, bringing the total to about $39.66 million per month, reaching 60% of Gaza’s households, according to open-source data. A man holds a wad of Israeli shekels in Gaza.(Majdi Fathi/TPS) Despite the scale of direct financial aid, which reaches over half of the enclave's population, Gaza’s severe food insecurity and high inflation (91% and 118%, respectively, as of January 2024) underscore its importance. However, the way this money circulates within Gaza is far more complex. \"Hamas controlsmuch of the cash that enters Gaza through various channels,\" Ofer told Fox News Digital, \"People who receive money via mobile apps must convert it into cash to use in local markets, but this involves hefty fees, with many money changers tied to Hamas or its allies.\" TPS-IL reported that Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar recently warned that Hamas’s economic strength in Gaza relies on billions of shekels in cash, paid as salaries and quickly reclaimed through taxes on merchants. In a letter to Bank of Israel Governor Prof. Amir Yaron, Sa’ar urged the cancelation of the circulation of 200-shekel bills previously introduced into Gaza, saying that experts believe the move would severely damage Hamas’s financial network. The Bank of Israel rejected the proposal, citing technical reasons and claiming that implementation was not feasible. Ofer's research found that the fees can range from 20% to 35%, meaning recipients lose a significant portion of their aid just to access it. \"Invideos from Gaza, you can see traders refusing to accept app funds and forcing customers to convert them into cash, knowing they will lose at least 20% in the process,\" he said. Peter Gallo, an international lawyer and former Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) investigator at the U.N., told Fox News Digital, \"If an investigator in Israel can figure it out, the aid agencies either knew or should have known. Twenty to thirty percent is just ridiculous. That’s extortion. It’s what some have politely described as a ‘revolutionary tax.’ In fairness, the aid agencies might argue they had no alternative, It is the cost of doing business, but it would have been better if they were honest about it from the start.\" HAMAS TERROR GROUP REPORTEDLY BUCKLING UNDER FINANCIAL STRAIN AMID ISRAELI MILITARY GAINS AND GROWING UNREST Palestinians shop for food and clothes at the local bazaar as daily life continues in the shadow of war in Jabalia, Gaza, on January 15, 2024. (Photo by Mahmoud Shalha/Anadolu via Getty Images)(Photo by Mahmoud Shalha/Anadolu via Getty Images) A spokesperson for UNICEF told Fox News Digital, \"UNICEF is aware of the cash liquidity crisis in Gaza and the continuous shortage of hard cash, which is a direct consequence of the banking system’s inability to function amid the ongoing conflict. \"Since May 2024, UNICEF has introduced fully digital cash payments via e-wallets, which do not require hard cash at any point. By using e-wallets, recipients of humanitarian digital cash transfers can purchase goods such as food, hygiene items and medicine without ever handling physical money,\" the spokesperson said. \"The use of digital e-wallets can be accessed through an app and works on the most basic smartphones. When implemented, these digital cash payments via e-wallets eliminate the need for cash conversion and, consequently, the payment of any fees. The UNICEF humanitarian digital cash program adheres to the highest standards of neutrality and impartiality. No external party, actor, or agency—not even the beneficiaries themselves—has any role or influence in the design or implementation of the program, including the composition of the beneficiary list, payment schedule, frequency and amounts.\" World Food Programme (WFP) aid at the Erez west crossing on the Israel-Gaza border.(IDF spokesman) The spokesperson claimed: \"More than 1.8 million people—close to the entire population of Gaza—are grappling with extreme food insecurity, with at least half of them being children. . . . Acute malnutrition among children is rising at alarming rates. The UNICEF humanitarian cash transfer program is, simply put, keeping children alive in the midst of a war not of their making by providing them with access to essential items for their survival. UNICEF’s monthly budget for humanitarian cash transfers in Gaza averages USD 5 million to support approximately 20,000 families. We estimate that these parameters are too small to significantly impact the local economy.\" The World Food Programme didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment. In a statement to Fox News Digital, Israel's Ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, said, \"This is yet another example of Hamas showing a complete disregard for the people of Gaza - and exploiting systems and infrastructure to sustain their murderous terror machine.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Turning a blind eye is not acceptable. The U.N. Security Council has been addressing terrorist financing since 2001, yet aid agencies continue to ignore the fact that Hamas is making a profit off this money flow, despite international efforts to stop terrorist financing,\" Gallo said.

    "article_text": "The tomb of Pope Francis was opened to visitors at St. Mary Major Basilica, where Catholic faithful lined up to pay their respects a day after world leaders and hundreds of thousands attended the late pontiff's funeral. (AP) The tomb of Pope Francis opened for visitors at St. Mary Major Basilica in Rome on Sunday, a day after world leaders and a crowd of hundreds of thousands attended the funeral of the late leader of the Catholic Church. Roman Catholic faithful are filing past the simple white tomb in St. Mary Major Basilica. Many are administering the sign of the cross or snapping photos on their cell phones, as ushers urge them to keep moving to accommodate the thousands who flocked to the Rome basilica to see the tomb, forming a long line outside. The tomb was opened on the second of nine days of official mourning for Francis, after which a conclave will be held to elect the next pope. A single white rose was placed on the tomb that said \"Franciscus\" – the pope's name in Latin. A light cast its warm glow over the tomb and a reproduction of the late pontiff's pectoral cross on the wall above it. The wait time is about an hour, according to SkyTV. Some visitors arrived before dawn so that they could get in at 7 a.m. when the tomb first opened. An estimated 200,000 people also attended a special Mass at St. Peter's Basilica on Sunday by Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican's secretary of state.

He is considered No. 2 at the Vatican and is one of the possible contenders to be the next pope. \"The shepherd whom the Lord gave to his people, Pope Francis, has ended his earthly life and has left us,\" Parolin said in his homily. \"The grief at his departure, the sense of sadness that assails us, the turmoil we feel in our hearts, the sense of bewilderment: we are experiencing all of this, like the apostles grieving over the death of Jesus. Yet, the Gospel tells us that it is precisely in these moments of darkness that the Lord comes to us with the light of the resurrection, to illuminate our hearts.\" Parolin emphasized that God's mercy was a central focus of the late Argentinian pope. \"He reminded us that ‘mercy’ is the very name of God, and, therefore, no one can put a limit on his merciful love with which he wants to raise us up and make us new people. It is important to welcome as a precious treasure this principle on which Pope Francis insisted so much. And – allow me to say – our affection for him, which is being manifested in this time, must not remain a mere emotion of the moment; we must welcome his legacy and make it part of our lives, opening ourselves to God’s mercy and also being merciful to one another,\" Parolin said. \"Mercy takes us back to the heart of faith.\" Parolin added, \"Only mercy heals and creates a new world, putting out the fires of distrust, hatred and violence: this is the great teaching of Pope Francis.\" Among those in attendance were many young people who originally came to Rome for what was supposed to be the canonization of the first millennial saint, Carlo Acutis, during special holy days devoted to teenagers. About 80,000 youths had registered to attend the Jubilee. Many groups of youths, some in scouting uniforms, attended Francis' funeral on Saturday and again filled St. Peter's Square for the special Mass on Sunday. 5 QUOTES FROM CARDINAL ROBERT SARAH, A FAVORITE AMONG CONSERVATIVES TO SUCCEED POPE FRANCIS Boy Scouts participating in the Jubilee of Teenagers attended a mass presided over by Vatican Secretary of State, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican, on Sunday, April 27, 2025.(AP Photo/Francisco Seco) \"The joy of Easter, which sustains us in this time of trial and sadness, is something that can almost be touched in this square today; you can see it etched above all in your faces, dear children and young people who have come from all over the world to celebrate the Jubilee,\" Parolin said. \"You come from so many places: from all of the dioceses of Italy, from Europe, from the United States to Latin America, from Africa to Asia, from the United Arab Emirates… With you here, the whole world is truly present!\" No date has yet been set for the conclave, but it is expected to start between May 5 and May 10. Pope Francis chose his place of burial in St. Mary Major Basilica, near an icon of the Madonna that he revered, because it reflects his \"humble, simple and essential\" life, the archbishop who administers the basilica said Friday.

    "title": "Taiwan on edge after Pope Francis's death, closely watching Vatican-China relations",
    "article_text": "Mourners from around the world pay their respects to Pope Francis at St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City. Dr. Tim O'Donnell joins 'Fox & Friends First' to weigh in ahead of the funeral. KAOHSIUNG, Taiwan - Some in Taiwan are watching with growing unease asthe Catholic Churchprepares to elect a new leader following the death of Pope Francis. The Holy See is the only European state that maintains diplomatic relations with Taipei, but some fear the growing ties between the Vatican and Beijing could change things. Taiwan is home to fewer than 300,000 Catholics. By contrast, estimates put the number of Catholicsin communist Chinaat anywhere between eight and 12 million, with another 390,000 in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong. Despite these figures, the Holy See continues to recognize Taiwan as the sole \"China.\" After Pope Francis’ death, Taiwan’s President William Lai quickly said he planned to attend the funeral. A short time later, however, Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that former Vice President and devout Catholic Chen Chien-jen will be Taiwan’s envoy. POPE FRANCIS EMPHASIZED CATHOLICISM GLOBALLY, REACHED BEYOND US, EUROPE INTO IMPOVERISHED NATIONS This picture taken on August 10, 2018, shows worshippers lining up to receive holy communion during a Catholic mass in the Holy Spirit Church in Yanshui, about an hour's drive from the southern city of Tainan. With a cross rising from a red pagoda roof and two lion statues guarding the entrance, a Catholic church in southern Taiwan could easily be mistaken for one of the ubiquitous temples dotting the island. There are more than 1,000 churches across the island, but the Holy Spirit Church is particularly unique.(SAM YEH/AFP via Getty Images) According to Taipei-based lawyer and political risk analyst Ross Feingold, Taiwan will be disappointed that President Lai will miss this gathering of world leaders. \"The precedent exists for Taiwan’s president to attend a pope’s funeral. In 2005, then-President Chen Shui-bian attended John Paul II’s funeral, so,\" he claimed, \"it’s safe to assume President Lai’s team inquired whether Lai could attend Francis’ funeral, and equally safe to assume the Holy See’s response was a negative one.\" AfterPope Francistook office in 2013, the Vatican began to build ties with Beijing. In 2018, it signed a controversial agreement with China on the appointment of bishops. The deal—renewed and extended several times—gives both sides input on bishop selection, an attempt to bridge the divide between China’s state-run Catholic Church and an underground church loyal to Rome. Vatican officials insist the agreement is pastoral, not political. Still, for Taiwan, it is seen as a warning sign. This picture taken on August 10, 2018, shows a motorcyclist riding past the Holy Spirit Church in Yanshui, about an hour's drive from the southern city of Tainan.(SAM YEH/AFP via Getty Images) China, which cut ties with the Holy See in 1951, demands that all countries end diplomatic relations with Taiwan before establishing relations with Beijing. Taiwan’s official allies now number but 12, and the Holy See is its most symbolically significant diplomatic partner. But Thomas Tu, a Vatican diplomacy expert at Taiwan’s National Chengchi University, told Fox News Digital that fears of an imminent switch are overblown. \"This isn’t just about politics—it’s about the global Catholic mission,\" Tu said. \"The Vatican has survived empires. It’s patient.\" Tu cited the Vatican’s relationship with Vietnam as evidence of pragmatic patience. China and Vietnam do not have formal ties, but the Vatican maintains a high-level religious representative there. FIRST PHOTOS RELEASED OF POPE FRANCIS IN HIS CASKET; FUNERAL SET FOR SATURDAY People attend a Christmas mass at the Xishiku Catholic Church in Beijing on December 24, 2023.(Pedro Pardo/AFP via Getty Image) Pope Francis believed that engagement with China, however imperfect, is preferable to nothing. Francis was the first pope to fly through Chinese airspace and famously sent greetings toPresident Xi Jinpingin 2014. On his visit to Mongolia in 2023, the pontiff also sent a \"warm greeting to the noble Chinese people.\" Each overture to Beijing has drawn criticism from within the Church, particularly from outspoken China critics, such as 93-year-old retired Cardinal Joseph Zen of Hong Kong, who was arrested in 2022 after China imposed a National Security Law that criminalized almost every form of dissent in that supposedly autonomous special administrative region. Zen's passport was recently returned to him by authorities so he could attend the pope's funeral. Zen and others view any warming of ties with Beijing as kowtowing to an officially atheist regime. Pope Francis greets the people of China as he concludes Mass in the Hun Theatre on September 3, 2023, in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.(Vatican Media via Vatican Pool/Getty Images) Since 1957, Beijing, via its Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association, has kept a tight leash on millions of Chinese Catholics. Pope Francis accepted some compromises with China, butthe Vaticanwants autonomy in spiritual matters, which may require a miracle to accomplish under China’s one-party dictatorship. Some observers suggest that Beijing may eventually allow more space for the Vatican, but any formal deal would require the Holy See to sever ties with Taiwan, a non-negotiable prerequisite for China. CLICK HERE TO GET TO THE FOX NEWS APP With a new pope being elected in the next month, somein Taiwanare worried about a shift, but few experts believe the next pontiff will make any hasty decisions. \"There’s no rush,\" said Dr. Chang Ching, a Senior Research Fellow of the ROC Society for Strategic Studies, \"The Vatican knows how to wait, and China isn’t willing yet to grant the Chinese Catholic community the same privileges Catholics enjoy in most other nations.

    "title": "Here's why a flare-up between India and Pakistan over Kashmir matters",
    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Indiaand Pakistanhave intensified their hostilities over the hotly contested Kashmir region following a massacre of 26 mostly Indian tourists, which New Delhi linked to Pakistan. Pakistan denies it was behind Tuesday's attack by gunmen on a group of tourists in Kashmir. Both sides have since escalated the tensions by exchanging diplomatic and trade sanctions against each other and raising fears of a military conflict. INDIA VOWS TO HUNT TERRORISTS ‘TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH’ AS TENSIONS WITH PAKISTAN RISE AFTER KASHMIR ATTACK Here are five reasons why a flare-up between India and Pakistan matters: Under intense domestic pressure, India has hinted at the possibility of a limited military strike on Pakistan in response to what it called the \"terror attack\" with \"cross-border links.\" Pakistan has made it clear that it will respond militarily to an attack. This raises fears that an escalation by any one side could lead to a wider war. The last time the two nations came to blows was in 2019, when a suicide car bombing killed 40 Indian soldiersin Kashmir. In 2021, the sides renewed a ceasefire agreement along their border, which has largely held. That relative calm was broken on Thursday after a brief exchange of fire between their armies. Both India and Pakistan are armed with nuclear weapons. There are fears that any conventional war or skirmish between them could potentially turn into a nuclear exchange. India and Pakistan fought two major wars, in 1965 and 1971, but in 1974, India conducted its first nuclear tests, raising the stakes in any military conflict. It triggered a nuclear race and Pakistan reached that same milestone in 1998. Kashmiri villager women walk past the blown-up family home of Asif Shiekh, a militant who officials say is involved in the deadly attack on tourists in Pahalgam, at Monghama village in Tral, south of Srinagar, Indian-controlled Kashmir, Friday.(AP Photo/Dar Yasin) Since then, India and Pakistan have had one major border skirmish in 1999 that killed at least 1,000 combatants. The fighting only stopped after the U.S. intervened. India and China are geopolitical rivals whose armies clashed along the disputed Himalayan border in 2020. Ties between the Asian giants have improved since, but they still maintain large numbers of troops on their borders. Their borders are also contiguous to Pakistan's, making it the world’s only three-way nuclear junction. Beijing also controls a part of the Kashmir region that New Delhi says belongs to India. On the other hand, China is also a main ally of Pakistan and has helped advance its missile programs, creating additional military concerns for New Delhi. Meanwhile, India maintains strong defense ties with the U.S., which has long sought to limit Beijing’s rise in the Indo-Pacific region. Experts say any conflict between India and Pakistan is unlikely to stay strictly between them, as their strategic partners are likely to get involved. In response to the massacre, India suspended a crucial treaty that governs the flow of river waters into Pakistan. Pakistan said it would consider any attempt to stop the flow of water from India an \"act of war.\" Under the Indus Water treaty, India is obliged to let six rivers flow freely to Pakistan. If India follows through and restricts the flow, it could have a devastating impact on Pakistan's agriculture as it battles acute water shortages. It's also a major environmental issue. Water insecurity is a big concern in both India and Pakistan due to rapidly growing populations and climate change. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Rights groups —including the U.N.— have blamed New Delhi for rights violations, including civilian killings and arbitrary arrests, in Indian-controlled Kashmir as a result of an intense crackdown by Indian forces. It has hurt India's human rights record and raised concerns that global powers are not doing enough to pressure New Delhi and hold it accountable. Militants fighting against Indian rule have also killed scores of civilians, including Hindu pilgrims. India has used military response against militants as part of its efforts to eradicate \"terrorism,\" saying it threatens regional stability.",

Micah Beckwith slammed state Senate Democrats' \"revisionist history\" on the Three-Fifths Compromise in their argument against a GOP-led anti-discrimination bill. Indiana Lt. Gov.Micah Beckwith criticized state Senate Democrats for equating a GOP legislative proposal intended to root out diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in higher education to the Three-Fifths Compromise. \"They were saying this is a bad bill because it actually encourages discrimination, just like the Three-Fifths Compromise going all the way back to the foundations of our nation.

It was actually just the opposite.\" \"Don't buy into the DEI radical revisionist history that is happening in today's culture,\" he said. \"Know your history. Go back and study the documents. Read them for yourself like I have. Go look them up and you will find that the Three-Fifths Compromise and many other things like that were designed to make sure that justice was equal for all people and equality really meant equality for all.\" INDIANA GOV PULLS PLUG ON DEI IN ‘EXHILARATING’ MOVE FOR STATE Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith is seen presiding over the Senate on Thursday, April 24, 2025, during the legislative session at the Indiana State Capitol in Indianapolis.(Grace Hollars/IndyStar / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images) The legislation in question, Senate Bill 289, ultimately passed both chambers of the state legislature last week and heads to RepublicanGov. Mike Braun'sdesk. The bill restricts DEI programs at K–12 schools, charter schools, state agencies, and public universities and allows people to sue such institutions if they compel students, teachers or administrators to adopt that one race, sex, ethnicity, religion, or national origin \"is inherently superior or inferior\" to another, that a person's moral character is determined by one of those characteristics, or that a person should be blamed for actions committed in the past by other members of the same race, sex, ethnicity, religion, or national origin. The GOP-sponsored bill – titled \"unlawful discrimination\" – also includes transparency requirements for institutions to post any DEI-related trainings online and repeals provisions concerning university diversity committees, among other reforms. It follows anexecutive actionBraun, a former U.S. senator, issued when he took office as governor in January prioritizing merit over DEI in education and state government. Critics of the bill in the state Senate last week said the proposal leaves out of consideration a legacy of discrimination in the U.S., citing the Three-Fifths Compromise,Jim Crowlawsand real estate redlining. As for the Three-Fifths Compromise, Beckwith said it was \"a compromise that the North made with the South. At the time, there were basically 13 independent nations.\" \"They had not really created a Constitution. They were sort of a European Union-esque nation, and they were saying to the pro-slave states, 'Hey, if you want to count your slaves to have representation, more representation in Congress, we're not going to let you do that,' because they knew that that would codify things like slavery into our nation and the North stood up to the South,\" Beckwith said.

Mike Braun announced the Make Indiana Healthy Again initiative at the Indiana State Library.(Mykal McEldowney/IndyStar / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images) PASTOR LEADING TARGET DEI BOYCOTT CALLS MAGA, TRUMP 'ROACHES' IN EASTER SERMON Made during the 1787 Constitutional Convention, the Three-Fifths Compromise set forth that slaves would be counted as three-fifths of a person when counting a state's population for taxation and congressional representation. While it reduced the influence that slave-holding states initially wanted, it ultimately allowed them more seats in the House of Representatives and more sway in presidential contests in terms of the Electoral College than if free people were only counted. The Three-Fifths Compromise ended after the Civil War with the adoption of the 13th and 14th Amendments, abolishing slavery and establishing equal protection under the Constitution. When the Constitution was being written, Beckwith explained, southern states considered slaves as property but still wanted to count slaves as part of their population in the census to get more members of Congress from the South. The North said if the South wanted it to count its \"property,\" or its slaves, as whole people in the census, the North would in turn count its tables, chairs and all their belongings in their homes as part of their population as well, according to the lieutenant governor. Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith, right.(Grace Hollars/IndyStar / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images) \"They came up with a Three-Fifths Compromise. They said you will only get three-fifths of a vote when it comes to your slave. And what that did, it actually limited the number of pro-slave representatives in Congress by 40%. This was a great move by the North to make sure that slavery would be eradicated in our nation,\" Beckwith said. \"They knew what they were doing. But now here you have Senate Democrats in today's American Republic who do not understand that.\" \"They think the Three-Fifths Compromise was something that was a scourge on Black people. That's not what it was. And how did we get to this place? We got to this because of DEI in education. We got here because you have professors at woke schools that will not teach the history of what actually happened back in the foundations of our nation,\" Beckwith continued. \"Many, many men and leaders in our nation's history knew how wicked slavery was. They knew that God had created Black people, White people, red people, all people in his image, and they were fighting for equality for all, but they're not taught that today, and that's why you had the Senate Democrats who were getting up talking about the Three-Fifths Compromise like it was some sort of terrible thing in our past it was not it actually was the exact opposite that helped to root out slavery and lead us into a more perfect union that we now see.\" Beckwith said the Three-Fifths Compromise was the beginning of the U.S. later evolving to where all people can have equal representation under the law.

    "title": "Defunding DEI: Here’s how the Trump administration has undone Biden’s very prized programs",
    "article_text": "Ohio State Sen. Jerry Cirino weighs in on Democratic opposition on the Buckeye State banning DEI practices at public colleges. President Donald Trumpshut downall diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) offices across the federal government during his first week in office and signed a number of executive orders to quickly undo former President Joe Biden’s efforts. The president, just hours after taking the Oath of Office on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, signed an executive order toeliminate all DEIprograms from the federal government. He also quickly signed an order making it \"the official policy of the U.S. government to only recognize two genders: male and female.\" WHITE HOUSE OPM ORDERS ALL DEI OFFICES TO BEGIN CLOSING BY END OF DAY WEDNESDAY A day later, the president directed the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to notify heads of agencies and departments to close all DEI offices and place those government workers in those offices on paid leave. President Donald Trump shut down all diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) offices across the federal government during his first week in office.(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) That move quickly forced those offices to take down all outward facing media — websites, social media accounts, and more — for those DEI offices, and required the withdrawal of any final pending documents, directives, orders, materials and equity plans. Trump also canceled current and impending contracts focused on DEI initiatives, with Elon Musk, who heads up the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), saying that move saved the federal government $420 million. The president also issued two other executive actions that day targeting DEI. One was an executive order to end discrimination in the workplace and higher education through race and sex-based preferences under the guise of DEI. The other was a memo to eliminate a Biden administration policy that prioritized DEI hiring at the Federal Aviation Administration. In the memo rolling back Biden's DEI hiring practices at the FAA, Trump ordered the secretary of transportation and FAA administrator to immediately stop Biden's DEI hiring programs and return to nondiscriminatory, merit-based hiring. TRUMP VOWS 'NEW ERA OF NATIONAL SUCCESS,' SAYS AMERICA'S 'DECLINE IS OVER' IN INAUGURAL ADDRESS Trump also required that the FAA administrator review the past performance and performance standards of all agency employees in critical safety positions and make it clear that anyone who fails to demonstrate adequate capability is replaced by someone who will ensureflight safetyand efficiency. A sign marks the entrance to the FAA headquarters in Washington DC on October 7, 2024.(J. David Ake/Getty Images) \"Illegal and discriminatory diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) hiring, including on the basis of race, sex, disability, or any other criteria other than the safety of airline passengers and overall job excellence, competency, and qualification, harms all Americans, who deserve to fly with confidence,\" the memo read. The memo stated: \"All so-called DEI initiatives, including all dangerous preferencing policies or practices, shall immediately be rescinded in favor of hiring, promoting, and otherwise treating employees on the basis of individual capability, competence, achievement, and dedication.\" Trump also rescinded Biden’s order on diversity initiatives, \"Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government,\" which he signed on his first day in office in 2021. In February, the Department of Education also warned stateeducation departmentsthat they must remove DEI policies or risk losing federal funding. That move came after Trump signed executive orders directing agencies to provide a plan to eliminate federal funding for \"illegal and discriminatory treatment and indoctrination in K-12 schools, including based on gender ideology and discriminatory equity ideology.\" MAJOR UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER ACCUSED OF HIDING DEI PROGRAMS, INFLUENTIAL SENATOR CALLS THEM OUT The president’s efforts to end DEI across the federal government also prompted the cancellation of such programs across the private sector. Meta, in January, canceled its DEI programs, as did McDonald's. And after the 2024 election, Walmart, Ford Motor Co., John Deere, Lowe's and Toyota also ended DEI programs. A new study revealed that nearly half of U.S. college students don't DEI courses mandated in their schools.(Fox News) As recently as April, according to Forbes, IBM, Gannett, and Constellation Brands Inc., made changes to DEI policies. Earlier in 2025, UnitedHealth Group, MLB, Victoria’s Secret, Warner Bros. Discovery, Goldman Sachs, Paramount, Bank of America, BlackRock, Citigroup, Pepsi, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Coca-Cola, Deloitte, PBS, Google, Disney, GE, PayPal, Chipotle and more scaled back or canceled their DEI programs. Meanwhile, in March, the National Institutes of Health rescinded the agency’s \"Scientific Integrity Policy\" implemented during the last few weeks of Biden’s term, to peel back any DEI requirements. That Biden-era policy said that DEI was an \"integral\" part of \"the entire scientific process,\" and pushed NIH's chief scientist and top scientific integrity official to \"promote agency efforts regarding diversity, equity and inclusion.\" It also instituted agency-wide policy directives ordering supervisors at the NIH to \"support\" scientists and researchers who are \"asexual\" or \"intersex,\" while imploring NIH leadership to \"confer with relevant offices\" when additional DEI expertise is needed. MULTIPLE FEDERAL AGENCIES END LINKEDIN CONTRACTS OVER DEI \"The Biden administration weaponized NIH’s scientific integrity policy to inject harmful DEI and gender ideology into research,\" said Health and Human Services Department spokesperson, Andrew Nixon. \"Rescinding this (scientific integrity) policy will allow NIH to restore science to its golden standard and protect the integrity of science.\" TheBiden administrationalso funded grants related to DEI, such as one for roughly $165,000 that was focused on \"queering the curriculum\" for family medicine doctors to guide them in their treatment of transgender patients. Those grants have been canceled. And earlier this week, multiple federal agencies told Fox News Digital that they have dropped millions of dollars in contracts for LinkedIn services over the business social network’s embrace of DEI. The Departments of Treasury, Interior and Veterans Affairs dropped LinkedIn — a move to comply with the president’s executive orders banning federal agencies from contracting with companies that embrace DEI policies. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Every American taxpayer should be angry that the Biden administration wasted so much money on contracts like these,\" an Interior Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital. \"Under the leadership of President Trump, we have been combing through hundreds of thousands of contracts here at the Department alone and are canceling wasteful, woke, and downright ridiculous contracts that do not align with the will of the American people.\" LinkedIn DEI services(LinkedIn) A LinkedIn spokesperson told Fox News Digital, in response, that: \"Like every business, the organizations that use our products change, often driven by shifts in their budgets and priorities. We’re keeping our focus on helping our customers achieve the objectives they’ve set.\" Fox News Digital's David Spector and Alec Schemmel contributed to this report.

    "article_text": "Fox News correspondent Chanley Painter reports on growing concerns from lawmakers and travelers as the deadline to use REAL ID-compliant licenses for air travel gets closer. PresidentDonald Trump'sadministration has signaled there will be no REAL ID exceptions after Kentucky lawmakers requested a deadline extension. The Trump administration confirmed in a statement to Fox News Digital that states will need to comply by the May 7 deadline, despite Kentucky's delay request, as a 20-year standoff between state and federal governments comes to a head with REAL ID's real deadline. \"Beginning on May 7, passengers will need a REAL ID or another acceptable form of identification to fly, like a passport or military ID. TSA is committed to enforcing the law, as directed by Congress.\" \"Non-compliant passengers may expect wait times or additional measures at airports. If you are an illegal alien without a REAL ID, the only way you will be permitted to fly is if you are self-deporting,\" a Transportation Security Administration (TSA) spokesperson said when asked if extensions were on the table. PANDEMIC, PRICE TAGS AND PRIVACY CONCERNS: WHY IT TOOK 20 YEARS TO IMPLEMENT REAL ID The deadline for REAL ID implementation is May 7.(Getty Images) Kentucky lawmakers, including Kentucky's Senate Transportation Committee Chair Jimmy Higdon and 27 state senate leaders, sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on April 17requesting a delayon REAL ID enforcement, citing concerns among Kentuckians \"who are still unable to access driver’s licensing services due to limited appointment availability and long lines for walk-ins.\" 'MASS SURVEILLANCE': CONSERVATIVES SOUND ALARM OVER TRUMP ADMIN'S REAL ID ROLLOUT \"This simple request is to protect Kentuckians from bureaucratic burdens,\" Higdon said. \"Rural residents, seniors, and families still have hurdles in front of them, and in a lot of cases, may not be aware of their options. Only about 40 percent of our residents have a REAL ID, but I would also like more time to help Kentuckians understand that they may not need a REAL ID. Kentucky has made a good-faith effort, but we just aren’t there yet.\" Passengers line up at a TSA checkpoint. Passengers will be required to travel with a REAL ID, or other compliant identification, in order to travel, starting May 7.(iStock) Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., sent his own letter to Noem on the same day, asking her to \"please describe how you will ensure that there are not delays at TSA security checkpoints and what steps the TSA is taking to process travelers who arrive at airport security checkpoints without REAL ID-compliant identification.\" Reed said it seems like many passengers will not be compliant by May 7, pointing out that \"20 percent of air travelers still use a form of identification that is not compliant with REAL ID requirements,\" and \"millions of Americans still do not have a REAL ID-compliant license or an acceptable alternative form of identification.\" States have long rejected REAL ID implementation. 20 years after it was signed into law, Kentucky is requesting a deadline extension.(Getty Images) Since PresidentGeorge W. Bushsigned the REAL ID Act into law in 2005, states and advocacy groups have rejected its implementation for a range of reasons, including costs, states' rights and privacy concerns. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) – a longtime opponent of REAL ID implementation –called it\"discriminatory, expensive, burdensome, invasive, and ultimately counterproductive\" in 2007 as disapproval grew nationwide. By 2009, at least 25 states hadenacted legislationopposing the REAL ID Act. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP While deadlines have shifted and implementation plans rolled out, Kentucky's letter revealed states continue to panic over the REAL ID deadline as Americans line up at their local Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and make appointments to secure their enhanced identification.

    "article_text": "Former federal prosecutor and former Trump attorney Jim Trusty discusses how due process can be used with the intent of drawing out and appealing cases to slow them down, on 'Life, Liberty & Levin.' Prosecutors in a left-wingMinnesota county attorney'soffice will be required to consider defendants' race when crafting plea deals, according to a local report citing internal documents. The office of Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty, which recently let a Democrat-connected alleged Tesla vandal off with a slap on the wrist, issued the internal document \"Negotiations Policy for Cases Involving Adult Defendants.\" It directs prosecutors to consider \"racial identity and age\" as they negotiate plea deals,local Minnestota outlet KARE 11first reported last week. \"While racial identity and age are not appropriate grounds for departures [from the Minnesota Sentencing Guidelines], proposed resolutions should consider the person charged as a whole person, including their racial identity and age,\" the internal document states, according to the outlet. \"While these factors should not be controlling, they should be part of the overall analysis. Racial disparities harm our community, lead to distrust, and have a negative impact on community safety. Prosecutors should be identifying and addressing racial disparities at decision points, as appropriate,\" it continues. STRING OF PLEA DEALS FROM MINNEAPOLIS DA OUTRAGES FAMILIES OF VICTIMS, DRAWS CONCERN FROM LEGAL EXPERTS Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty speaks in video address.(Hennepin County Attorney's Office/YouTube) The policy changes are set to take effect on April 28, according to the outlet. Hennepin County encompasses the city of Minneapolis and is the most populous county in the Democrat-run state. The \"Negotiations Policy for Cases Involving Adult Defendants\" began circulating in the county attorney's office last week, KARE 11 reported. Fox News Digital reached out to the Hennepin County Attorney's Office on Sunday morning regarding the policy update, motivation behind the internal document and whether there are any concerns over the constitutionality of the changes, and is awaiting a response. The reported plea deal policy comes with constitutionality issues, according to KARE 11, which spoke to local attorneys to weigh in on the change. SOROS PROSECUTOR RIPPED FOR FAILING TO CHARGE WALZ STAFFER OVER TESLA VANDALISM: 'TWO-TIERED JUSTICE SYSTEM' \"It both says, 'Don't take race into account,' presumably because of the constitutional problems with taking race into account in addition to potentially political objections, but it simultaneously says this is something you should consider,\" Jill Hasday, a University of Minnesota law professor, told the outlet. \"And the problem for the drafters of this policy is, once you take race into account, it doesn't really matter what else you say. The policy is going to be struck down.\" Another local attorney brushed off constitutionality concerns, saying that county prosecutors are directed to steer clear of racial disparities, not create them. A man in handcuffs (Reuters/Lucy Nicholson)(Reuters/Lucy Nicholson) \"I definitely think that some people will get worked up about the issue, but I don't see a constitutional problem, and that's specifically because the policy tells prosecutors to avoid racial disparities. Not to create them,\" University of St. Thomas law professor Rachel Moran told the outlet. The Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution requires states to govern impartially, meaning that states and official government actions cannot discriminate or treat individuals differently based on characteristics such as race. WALZ STAFFER ACCUSED OF VANDALIZING TESLAS MIGHT NOT FACE CHARGES: REPORT \"Our sentencing guidelines that criminal justice professionals use every single day in court say that race should not be used in that calculus. This seems to contradict our sentencing guidelines,\" former Washington County, Minnesota, prosecutor Imran Ali told the outlet. \"It's inconsistent not only with our sentencing guidelines, but the policy in and of itself is inconsistent.\" Snow is removed from the entrance of the Hennepin County Government Center in Minneapolis on Wednesday, Dec. 8, 2021.(AP Photo/Christian Monterrosa, File) Thecounty attorney's officetold KARE 11 that race is an important factor to consider during plea deal negotiations \"because we know unaddressed unconscious biases lead to racial disparities.\" \"This policy acknowledges that there are many factors to be considered in negotiations. Each case – and defendant – is unique. Someone’s age may change the likelihood of growth and change. A defendant’s race matters because we know unaddressed unconscious biases lead to racial disparities, which is an unacceptable outcome,\" the office told the outlet. NUMBER OF TESLA ATTACKS SOARS PAST 50 AS VIOLENCE TARGETING MUSK'S COMPANY ESCALATES \"Our goal with this policy matches the goal of all our work: to achieve safe, equitable, and just outcomes that center the healing of victims while improving public safety,\" the office continued. Fox News Digital previously reported that Moriarty has beenbacked by groupstied to money from liberal mega-donor George Soros, who has helped toinstall scores of soft-on-crime local prosecutorsaround the nation. She was first elected to the role in 2022 after working for more than two decades as a public defender in the county. Moriarty most recently made national headlines last week when her office bucked criminally charging a Minnesota state employee suspected ofvandalizing six Tesla vehiclesand causing $20,000 in damages. Instead, the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office said it would seek \"diversion\" over charges against Minnesota Department of Human Services data analyst Dylan Bryan Adams.

    "article_text": "Fox News host Laura Ingraham shares an exclusive look of her visit to Guantánamo Bay with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on ‘The Ingraham Angle.' America’s most notorious federal prison, a terrorist detention facility at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, took center stage for a short period in the early days ofPresident Donald Trump’s first 100 days,when the administration began sending some of the \"worst of the worst\" criminal illegal aliens there. Also known as \"Gitmo,\" Guantánamo is a 45-square-mile high-securitynaval base in Cubaand houses some of America’s most deadly enemies, including the al-Qaeda terrorists responsible for the 9/11 terror attacks. In one of the first moves of his second term, Trump authorized the detention of illegal immigrants at the facility shortly after taking office on Jan. 20. Trump instructed the Pentagon toprepare 30,000 bedsat the base to house \"criminal illegal aliens\" who pose a threat to the American public, adding that putting them there would ensure they would not come back. PRESIDENT TRUMP BLASTS COURTS FOR GETTING IN THE WAY OF DEPORTATION AGENDA America’s most notorious prison – Guantánamo Bay – took center stage for a short period during President Donald Trump’s first 100 days when the administration began sending some of the \"worst of the worst\" criminal illegals to the prison.(U.S. Army photo by Staff Sgt. ShaTyra Cox) At the time, Trump explained the decision, saying that some criminal migrants \"are so bad that we don’t even trust the countries to hold them, because we don’t want them coming back, so we’re going to send ‘em out to Guantánamo.\" The president said the move would bring the U.S. one step closer to \"eradicating the scourge\" of migrant crime in communities, once and for all. Then, shortly after theState Departmentdeclared 10 migrant gangs – including the Salvadoran MS-13 and Venezuelan Tren de Aragua as well as several Mexican cartels – \"foreign terrorist organizations,\" the administration began sending migrants through Gitmo, with several hundred passing through the base. Among those sent to the base were several \"high threat\" illegal members ofTren de Aragua, which is an international terrorist and criminal group linked to Venezuelan socialist dictator Nicolás Maduro. Tren de Aragua – also known as \"TdA\" – has a presence in most major American cities and is linked to the high-profile murder of Georgia nursing student Laken Riley and the seizure of an entire apartment building in Aurora, Colorado.

In a social media post, Hegseth called Gitmo \"the front lines of the war against America’s southern border.\" Speaking of the troops manning Gitmo, Hegseth said, \"These warriors are directly supporting the apprehension and deportation of dangerous illegal aliens.\" However, the administration soon began running into snags, making it difficult to ramp up the naval base's capacity to accommodate the 30,000 beds that Trump had wanted.

ShaTyra Cox) In early March, Fox News Digital reported thatnone of the 195 tentsset up in Guantánamo Bay had been used to house migrants. According to two U.S. defense officials familiar with the matter, this was due to the tents not meeting ICE standards. The officials said that the U.S. military was told to set up the tents without clear guidance as to what the standards for holding migrants are, and that the military had not received specific guidelines on what the tents need in order to be certified to hold the migrants. The operation to build more tents was halted in February, just several weeks after it started.

That’s why the project, Threads: My Songs In Symphony, is so special to me,\" Parton said in the Kennedy Center's announcement of the show, which was first exclusively shared with Fox Digital on Sunday. \"It’s about sharing my music and my musical journey with audiences in a new way.\" The concert, called \"Dolly Parton’s Threads: My Songs in Symphony,\" made its premiere last year in Nashville and has since toured the nation from Pittsburgh to Portland, Oregon. The Kennedy Center will host the program on June 26 and 27, with the National Symphony Orchestra performing hits such as \"Jolene,\" \"Coat of Many Colors,\" and \"I Will Always Love You.\" Parton will not sing during the concerts, but the events will feature \"a unique performance that honors her enduring spirit and unparalleled impact on American popular music culture.\" The National Symphony Orchestra will perform alongside guest vocalists and musicians to deliver a \"fresh symphonic take on the timeless songs of Dolly Parton,\" according to the Kennedy Center.

    "article_text": "Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, joins ‘The Brian Kilmeade Show’ to discuss the Trump administration’s southern border strategy and Democratic support for suspected MS-13 gang member Kilmar Abrego Garcia. FIRST ON FOX:House Republicans are carving out $68.8 billion for PresidentDonald Trump’sborder wall and to hire more agents in the field amid talks on a massive bill to advance the commander-in-chief’s agenda. While Trump spent much of his first term focused on a physical barrier between the U.S. and Mexico, the legislation now under consideration seeks to modernize the task with $46.5 billion for an integrated \"border barrier system,\" according to details first viewed by Fox News Digital. It would incorporate physical fencing along with updated surveillance tools, roads, and lighting. The bill also aims to pay $5 billion for new facilities and personnel for Customs and Border Protection (CBP), something the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has sought since Trump came back to the White House. ACLU APPEALS TO SUPREME COURT TO STOP VENEZUELAN DEPORTATIONS; BOASBERG HOLDS EMERGENCY HEARING FRIDAY NIGHT House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mark Green will lead his panel through part of Trump's budget agenda next week(Getty Images) It would specifically dedicate $4.1 billion to fund new front-line personnel to patrol the border, while also incentivizing new and current CBP staff with retention bonuses, among other measures – for which $2 billion is dedicated. It would also put $813 million into modernizing CBP's existing fleet of vehicles, with its current tech falling prey to mechanical issues and high maintenance costs. The bill also seeks $2.7 billion to fund an array of modern technology that agents could use to crack down on illegal immigration at the border, including ground sensors, drones, radar, and remote surveillance technology, among other items. For people caught crossing illegally, it would fund $673 million in upgrades to the U.S.'s current biometrics system aimed at tracking those illegal migrants. Just over $1 billion in funding for new and updated air and maritime platforms is also included. The legislation also puts millions toward threat-assessment and logistical planning for multiple upcoming international events in the U.S. – $1 billion for the 2028 Summer Olympics, and $625 million for the coming World Cup soccer championships. Other funding items include $1 million to commemorate American victims of illegal immigrant crime, and $500 million to specifically crack down on cartel drug smuggling at the border. The Department of Homeland Security, led by Secretary Kristi Noem, is pushing Congress for more border funding(Ken Cedeno/UPI/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Border securityis a core pillar of congressional Republicans’ priorities in the budget reconciliation process. The Homeland Security Committee, which has jurisdiction over significant amounts of U.S.-Mexico border operations, was directed to use up to $90 billion in new spending to achieve those goals. Trump administration officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and immigration czar Tom Homan, have emphasized the need for more funding to carry out the president's agenda. DHS sent a memo to House and Senate Republicans earlier this month warning that failure to pass the legislation \"will undo all the Trump Administration's Massive Successes.\" DEMOCRAT SENATOR VAN HOLLEN MEETS, SHAKES HANDS WITH ABREGO GARCIA U.S. Customs and Border Protection's agents from the Houlton Sector arrest illegal border crosser in March of 2025.(U.S. Customs and Border Protection - Houlton Sector) Budget reconciliation lowers the Senate’s passage threshold from 60 votes to 51 for certain items relating to federal spending, taxes, and the national debt. It therefore allows a party controlling the House, Senate and White House to pass sweeping reforms while entirely sidelining the opposing party, in this case Democrats. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Republicans are aiming to use reconciliation to pass broad swaths of Trump’s agenda. In addition to border security that includes new commitments to fossil fuel energy,the national defense, and Trump’s tax policies – both extending the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and fulfilling newer promises to eliminate taxes on tips, overtime pay, and retirees’ social security.

Dolphins are one of the smartest animals on Earth and have been revered for thousands of years for their intelligence, emotions and social interaction with humans. Now Google is usingartificial intelligence (AI)to try and understand how they communicate with one another – with the hope that one day humans could use the technology to chat with the friendly finned mammals. Google has teamed up with researchers at Georgia Institute of Technology and the Wild Dolphin Project (WDP), aFlorida-basednon-profit which has been studying and recording dolphin sounds for 40 years, to build the new AI model called DolphinGemma.

For instance, signature whistles have been used by mothers and calves to reunite, while burst pulse \"squawks\" are often observed during dolphin fights, researchers said, according to aGoogle blogon the project. Click \"buzzes\" are often used during courtship or chasing sharks. Now, using the vast data gathered by WDP, Google has built DolphinGemma, building upon Google’s own AI lightweight open model, known as Gemma. DolphinGemma has been trained to analyze the vast library of recordings to detect patterns, structures, and even potential \"meanings\" behind the dolphin communications or vocalizations. Over time, DolphinGemma will try to organize the dolphin sounds into categories — almost like words, sentences, or expressions in human language.

CHINESE HUMANOID ROBOT WITH EAGLE-EYE VISION AND POWERFUL AI \"By identifying recurring sound patterns, clusters and reliable sequences, the model can help researchers uncover hidden structures and potential meanings within the dolphins' natural communication — a task previously requiring immense human effort,\" a poston Googleabout the project reads. \"Eventually, these patterns, augmented with synthetic sounds created by the researchers to refer to objects with which the dolphins like to play, may establish a shared vocabulary with the dolphins for interactive communication.\" DolphinGemma uses Google’s Pixel phone technology, specifically the audio recording technology used in Pixel devices, to make clean, high-quality sound recordings of dolphin vocalizations. The Pixel phone technology can separate out dolphin clicks and whistles from background noise like waves, boat engines, or underwater static. That clean audio is critical for AI models like DolphinGemma, because messy, noisy data would confuse the AI, researchers said.

Enter \"SkinnyTok,\" a popularweight-loss trendmaking the rounds on TikTok.

CHICK-FIL-A FOOD AND EMPLOYEES HELPED MAN LOSE WEIGHT AND CHANGE HIS LIFE As of April 26, there were more than 60,000 videos from creators talking about SkinnyTok. One of those is Mandana Zarghami, 25, a business owner and influencer in Miami, Florida. \"What you eat in private will show in public,\" Zarghami told her followers in a recent video. The influencer spoke with Fox News Digital about her perception of the worldwide SkinnyTok trend. \"There’s an emphasis on portion control, prioritizingdaily movementand knowing what foods will make you feel better from the inside out and more,\" she said. The creator acknowledged, however, that some of the content could be triggering for those who have battled disordered eating. Mandana Zarghami, a TikTok creator, acknowledged that some of the SkinnyTok content could be triggering for those who have battled disordered eating.(Mandana Zarghami/TikTok) \"While some content under the SkinnyTok trend can promote motivation aroundhealth and wellness, it can also unintentionally glamorize unhealthy habits or unrealistic body standards if you're following the wrong influencer or content creator,\" Zarghami cautioned. At the same time, she said, \"you control what you consume.\" \"What you eat in private will show in public.\" \"It’s a little hard to be sensitive to each group, because a lot of the people who talk about SkinnyTok on their platforms also battled disordered eating and overcame it withhealthy lifestyle choices,\" Zarghami added. Dr. Brett Osborn, a Florida neurosurgeon and longevity expert, said he has witnessed the \"devastating consequences\" of extreme thinness firsthand, including women with fractured bones caused by malnutrition. \"This is a growing crisis, and it is being dangerously celebrated on social media under hashtags like #SkinnyTok,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"It’s a little hard to be sensitive to each group, because a lot of the people who talk about SkinnyTok on their platforms also battled disordered eating and overcame it with healthy lifestyle choices,\" said influencer Mandana Zarghami (right).(iStock/TikTok-Mandana Zarghami) \"When young people chase after extreme thinness throughstarvation diets, they invite frailty into their lives.

FIRST GLP-1 PILL FOR WEIGHT LOSS, DIABETES SHOWS SUCCESS IN LATE-PHASE TRIAL Physical effects of malnutrition can includehair loss, reduced bone density and, in severe cases, irreversible structural damage, he added. Low body weight or minimal body fat does not equate to good health, the doctor said. \"Starvation is not a virtue – it is an abandonment of the body’s nutritional needs,\" he said. \"The SkinnyTok trend preys on impressionable youth, particularlyyoung women, encouraging them to shrink rather than thrive.\" Low body weight or minimal body fat does not equate to good health, one doctor told Fox News Digital.(iStock) Rather than focusing on \"extreme thinness,\" Osborn called for a focus on building muscle, which he described as the \"cornerstone of vitality.\" \"In older adults, muscle loss — or sarcopenia — is a medical warning sign linked to increased risks of falls, fractures, hospitalizations,cognitive declineand even mortality,\" he cautioned. \"Muscle loss doesn’t just weaken the body — it erodes the mind, hastening the onset and progression of dementia. The body and the brain are interconnected, and when one suffers, so does the other.\" \"Muscles are your shield against disease and decline.

As people scroll through countless videos of \"ideal\" bodies and lifestyles, this often leads them to conclude that they’re not thin enough or attractive enough. \"This content dangerously glorifies content that encourages people to take drastic measures to change their bodies,\" one expert told Fox News Digital.(iStock) \"Continual assessment of appearance and eating habits can make a person hypercritical and hyper-fixated on perceived flaws, thus fueling the cycle of eating less, which often leads to overeating and overexercising, which oftenleads to fatigueand loss of control around food,\" said Lampert. \"It is a vicious cycle that quickly spirals from external messaging to internal criticism.\" Dr. Anastasia Rairigh, a Tennessee-based family physician andobesity medicinespecialist at the virtual health platform PlushCare, warned that extreme weight-loss behaviors can be deadly.

    "title": "Shedeur Sanders' NFL Draft fall ignites fiery debate between ESPN broadcasters",
    "article_text": "Colin Cowherd reacts to Shedeur Sanders’ surprising slide out of Round 1 and what it means for his NFL future Shedeur Sanders’slide from a projected first-round pick to an eventual fifth-round selection proved to be the most polarizing topic of the NFL Draft over the weekend. ESPN draft analyst Mel Kiper Jr. was one of the staunch defenders of Sanders and was shocked over his fall to theCleveland Browns. The annoyed broadcaster teed off on teams after Sanders was picked, and it led to a clash between him and fellow colleague Rece Davis. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Oct. 7, 2023; Tempe, Arizona: Colorado Buffaloes quarterback Shedeur Sanders (2) against the Arizona State Sun Devils at Mountain America Stadium.(Mark J. Rebilas-USA Today Sports) NFL analyst Louis Riddick explained to Kiper that the question wasn’t about whether Sanders could play quarterback but, from a team perspective, whether they want him to play the position. Kiper, perplexed, couldn’t understand why a team wouldn’t want Sanders, considering that he’s \"one of the toughest quarterbacks you’ve ever seen.\" Riddick responded, \"This is personal,\" about the reason why Sanders fell. Kiper added that Sanders hasn’t had an \"off-the-field issue.\" Davis then agreed with Riddick when he said that the \"draft has spoken.\" \"That’s the key, Mel. It’s not putting a value judgment who passed were right or wrong. They did. So, now, whenever you’re in circumstances in life, whether you like them, whether you don’t like them, whether they’re fair or whether they’re unfair, you might have to deal with them,\" Davis said. \"And now Shedeur Sanders has to deal with them.

Now he has an opportunity to answer it. I think yelling at the NFL about it is not productive.\" Kiper put the onus on the league for its lack of proper evaluation when it came to quarterbacks. \"Boomer Esiason was not happy when he was a second-round pick,\" Kiper said. \"Tom Brady was not happy. They dropped. How’d they turn out? My point is, Rece, the NFL has been clueless for 50 years when it comes to evaluating quarterbacks. Clueless. \"They have no idea what they’re doing in terms of evaluating quarterbacks. That’s proof. There’s proof of that. They can say, ‘We know exactly what we’re talking about with quarterbacks.’ They don’t.\" The debate continued from there as Kiper defended Sanders for exuding confidence ahead of the draft.

    "article_text": "Urban Meyer joins Colin Cowherd to share his thoughts on Shedeur Sanders falling out of Round 1 of the NFL Draft. The NFL is investigating how the newestCleveland Brownsquarterback Shedeur Sanders’ phone number used for the NFL Draft was leaked, which led to him being prank called, a league official confirmed with Fox News Digital. During Day 2 of the 2025NFL Draft, video went viral on social media of Sanders, the Colorado Buffaloes star, receiving a call on a phone specifically used for the moment. Sanders expressed concerns about potential prank calls before the draft, so he said Boost Mobile sent him a new phone with a number only released to NFL executives.

Sorry about that.\" SHEDEUR SANDERS SAYS OF THINGS HE DID THAT SEEMED RIGHT, ‘I COULD HAVE WENT ABOUT IT IN A DIFFERENT WAY’ Another video made its rounds on social media of the man suspected of calling Sanders. He is reading off a script on his lap, and a side-by-side video of the two conversations appear to match up with Sanders’ own video of the situation. Sanders was confused after the person hung up, and so was the crowd of friends and family around him. \"What does that mean?\" Sanders said. He ended his live stream on Twitch shortly thereafter. Sanders eventually got a real call from Browns general manager Andrew Berry, who told him they were going to call his name with pick No. 144 in the fifth round.

My reaction to it, I don’t – it is what it is. I think, of course, it’s childish. Of course, I feel like it was a childish act, but everybody does childish things here and there.\" Sanders’ new head coach, Kevin Stefanski, said that \"people are morons\" when asked about the prank call. After the prank call, the Saints ended up selecting Louisville’s Tyler Shough with the 40th overall selection – again, a quarterback not named Sanders taken.

    "title": "Red Sox's Jarren Duran steals home, leaving Guardians stunned: 'I knew I had it'",
    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Boston Red Soxoutfielder Jarren Duran has showcased his speed on numerous occasions over his young MLB career, but nothing quite like Saturday night against the Cleveland Guardians. He did something no Red Sox player has done in 16 years. In fact, it was the exact same date that Jacoby Ellsbury did it to the New York Yankees. Duran had a clean steal-home againstGuardianspitcher Doug Nikhazy in Boston’s 7-3 victory in the second game of the doubleheader on Saturday night in Cleveland. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Boston Red Sox left fielder Jarren Duran (16) steals home under the tag of Cleveland Guardians catcher Bo Naylor (23) during the third inning at Progressive Field.(Ken Blaze-Imagn Images) The speedster was dancing off third base, and Nikhazy, a lefty, couldn’t really see just how far Duran was down the line, due to his back being turned toward the bag. Duran took full advantage of getting off the base, but when he was basically halfway down the line, he put his head down and started sprinting home. Nikhazy quickly lifted his leg and fired a pitch, but catcher Bo Naylor couldn’t get the tag down before Duran’s right hand crossed home plate. \"(Third base coach Kyle Hudson) heard him tell the umpire that he was working from the stretch, so I decided I was going to go on the first pitch,\" Duran said when asked why he had stolen home. \"It was just to keep the offense going and cause a little chaos. I knew I had it.\" RED SOX STAR JARREN DURAN OPENS UP ABOUT TRYING TO TAKE HIS OWN LIFE: ‘I DIDN’T EVEN WANT TO BE HERE ANYMORE' Red Sox manager Alex Cora added, \"Under the new rules, he’s kind of the perfect player. We saw a window there, and he took advantage of the situation.\" One of the new rules Cora refers to here is the catcher not being allowed to block the plate with his body, which allowed Duran to dive head-first into home. It wasn't the first time Duran has attempted to do this. Last season alone, he tried twice, once against theTampa Bay Rayson May 21, and the other against the Chicago White Sox on June 7. Cleveland Guardians catcher Bo Naylor (23) rolls away after Boston Red Sox left fielder Jarren Duran (16) stole home during the third inning at Progressive Field.(Ken Blaze-Imagn Images) He scored on both attempts, but they were also double steals, meaning another Red Sox player was swiping second, allowing him to head home. This, however, was a straight steal-home, and Rafael Devers, who was in the batter’s box at the time, was jumping up and down when the home plate umpire called Duran safe. \"It was really a cool play and a cool sequence of events there,\" pitcher Walker Buehler said. \"He’s one of the most exciting players in baseball. After watching him from afar, it’s been fun to see him up close this season.\" Even Guardians manager Stephen Vogt had to tip his cap to Duran, who he said had made \"a heads-up baseball play\" after noticing that his third baseman, Jose Ramirez, wasn’t anywhere near third base to keep Duran close. Nikhazy could have stepped off the rubber and fired the ball home instead of going through his usual delivery from the stretch – something that he regrets in hindsight.

    "title": "NFL Draft emotional reactions: Rookies realizing their dream came true pulls at fans' heartstrings",
    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Since they were kids, every prospect who was drafted this weekend into theNFLhas dreamed of that very moment – hearing their name called by a professional football team. While fans are ecstatic to get new talent on their teams, some of those are expected to make an immediate impact in 2025. The raw emotion for the players, as well as their loved ones, is what makes theNFL Drafttruly a special time in sports. All seven rounds of the draft came to an end on Saturday, and there were tons of emotional rookies who couldn't contain how they felt after hearing their names called. So, grab a box or two of tissues as we dive into the best of those moments, which are all reminders of how much this game means to every single player taken over the last three days. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Miami quarterback Cam Ward poses after being chosen by the Tennessee Titans with the first overall pick during the first round of the NFL football draft, Thursday, April 24, 2025, in Green Bay, Wis.(AP Photo/Jeff Roberson) Coming out of high school, Ward didn't have a single offer from an FBS school. He had to start his college journey at the University of the Incarnate Word, working diligently to get the opportunity to play at Washington State, and then transferring again to Miami this past season. So, although it was presumptive that Ward would go first overall to the Tennessee Titans on Thursday night, the official pick had theHurricanesproduct all emotional during his interview on the Green Bay stage. \"I just thank God, man,\" Ward said, fighting through tears. \"The hard work that I put myself through and just the unbelievable work ethic that I have. I just always have faith.\" SHEDEUR SANDERS OPENS UP ON HISTORIC NFL DRAFT SLIDE, PRANK CALL AND BECOMING A BROWN When asked by ESPN's Molly McGrath about the emotion she heard in his voice, Ward responded why that was the case. \"I’d just say the little kid in me who wanted it,\" he replied. The fourth overall pick in the draft was LSU star offensive tackle Will Campbell, who will hopefully be Drake Maye's blindside protector for as long as they are New England Patriots teammates. Campbell came out onto the draft stage with a bright smile and his Patriots hat on before giving some words about his feelings after hearing his name called. When asked what was behind his smile, he said, \"It's all the hard work,\" but he cut himself off, because he felt the emotion coming to his face. The crowd gave him a loud cheer as he worked to get his emotions in check. \"I worked my entire life to be up here to be able to get my name called by a franchise like New England. It means everything to me,\" Campbell continued. If that first cheer wasn't loud enough, Campbell had everyone, not just Patriots fans, loving his answer when asked what New England can expect from him right away. \"I’m going to fight and die to protect them with everything I got,\" he responded. LSU Tigers offensive lineman Will Campbell is selected by the New England Patriots as the number-four pick in the first round of the 2025 NFL Draft at Lambeau Field.(Kirby Lee-Imagn Images) If you knew the story about Kelvin and Monica Banks, you'd understand why the former couldn't stop crying at home, surrounded by friends and family, when he embraced his mother after the New Orleans Saints took him ninth overall. Monica Banks has battled health issues since her son's freshman year at Texas, and it got to the point where she was placed in hospice care. But when doctors removed her gallbladder, her health began to see a positive trend back to normal. So, the celebration was more than just Kelvin Banks heading to the NFL, and it clearly showed as he had to put the Saints hat over his face even after their embrace because of how much he was crying. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell loves greeting each rookie when they get their name called on night one, and sometimes those celebrations turn into him being lifted off the ground. Starks did that when the Baltimore Ravens called him late on Thursday night, but the embrace never stopped. Starks was clearly getting emotional, and Goodell was talking him through it. The Buffalo Bills called the Kentucky cornerback with the 30th overall pick to join their ranks, ending a three-hour-long wait to hear his name called in Round 1. But what Hairston did before hearing his name called went viral on social media – he congratulated every single prospect taken before him in the NFL Draft green room. When it was finally his time to shine, he couldn't hold back tears when he hugged his father. As Fox Sports' Jordan Schultz put it, Hairston is a \"special person,\" and the city of Buffalo is sure to see that. MIKE GREEN'S WATERWORKS The Marshall product was one of the most raw in terms of emotions on Friday night, as day two of the draft began. In the second round, the Ravens called his name, and every broadcast showed a joyous family and a crying Green in a living room – a scene we've seen many times in the NFL Draft. The Herd shared the words that Ravens GM Eric DeCosta and head coach John Harbaugh said to him in that emotional time. Controversy swirled around Green after two separate sexual assault allegations reportedly had teams taking him off their boards. The Ravens explained their choice of Green during a press conference, saying that thorough investigations had been done and that they were confident in the person they had drafted. Arizona State running back Cam Skattebo (4) blows a kiss toward fans after Texas won 39-31 in double overtime in the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl in Atlanta on Jan. 1, 2025.(IMAGN) On Day 3, there were still some impact players left on the draft board. In fact, many will argue that Rounds 4-7 are where teams truly win the draft as they find value in their selections. The New York Giants went with Arizona State running back Cam Skattebo with their fourth-round selection, nabbing the fan favorite whose confidence beams with every touch of the football. When broadcasts cut to his family home, where they learned the news, Skattebo kept shaking his head up and down as he couldn't fathom wearing the Giants hat on his head. Again, the dream realized is a powerful thing. And Skattebo knew just how to endear himself to the Giants' fan base, as he broke out his Michael Strahan No. 92 jersey for all to see. To wrap it up, perhaps the best draft day call was for Morrison in the second round, as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers brought the Notre Dame cornerback into the fold. Head coach Todd Bowles played with his father, Daryl, so the connection is already there. But the Bucs were not expecting to hear Morrison so emotional when he got on the phone. \"Thank you for believing in me,\" Morrison said with tears running down his face. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Man, I’m not going to let you down. I promise you, man,\" Morrison said to Coach Bowles. \"Thank you so much.\" If you're ever wondering how much being drafted means, no matter the sport, just look at Morrison on this phone call, which he will never forget.

    "title": "Aaron Rodgers appears down to only one NFL team needing him after NFL Draft",
    "article_text": "Emmanuel Acho, LeSean McCoy and James Jones discuss whether the Pittsburgh Steelers should draft a QB in the first round with Aaron Rodgers' NFL future unknown. While the football world was wrapped up in where Shedeur Sanders was going to go on day three of the 2025NFL Draft, ESPN’s Adam Schefter dropped some other quarterback news that is very significant for a certain MVP free agent. Aaron Rodgers remains without a team for the 2025 season, as he hasn’t made his decision on whom to play for. One of those potential teams was theMinnesota Vikings,given that J.J. McCarthy, the team’s first-round pick in 2024, didn’t touch the field last season due to a season-ending injury. However, the front office has been adamant that McCarthy is the man for the job, heading into this season, but speculation about a potential Rodgers deal remained afloat. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers (8) waits for the snap of the ball during the first half of an NFL football game against the Los Angeles Rams in East Rutherford, N.J., Sunday, Dec. 22, 2024.(AP Photo/Seth Wenig) Perhaps that has officially come to an end after Schefter revealed during ESPN’s broadcast of the draft that the Vikings had acquired Sam Howell from theSeattle Seahawks. Howell later confirmed the trade, making a celebratory post on Instagram. ESPN STAR OFFERS EXPLANATION FOLLOWING SHEDEUR SANDERS' NFL DRAFT TUMBLE In return for Howell, Minnesota sent its 142nd pick in the fifth round, which the Seahawks used on defensive lineman Rylie Mills. Two picks later, Sanders was finally taken by the Cleveland Browns. So, where does that leave Rodgers for 2025? The Pittsburgh Steelers are still the frontrunner for his services, and their draft mindset appeared to show that they still believe he has a good chance of signing. When Pittsburgh passed on a quarterback in the first round, electing to go with Oregon defensive tackle Derrick Harmon instead, many were shocked. New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers answers questions from reporters after an NFL football game against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Sunday, Dec. 15, 2024, in Jacksonville, Fla.(AP Photo/Phelan M. Ebenhack) The surprise only gained weight when the Steelers continued to select other positions of need for its roster other than quarterback on day two. Finally, after Sanders was taken, the Steelers selected Ohio State’s Will Howard, a Pennsylvania native, in the sixth round. Steelers owner Art Rooney II and head coach Mike Tomlin have both publicly shown interest in bringing in the four-time MVP quarterback to lead their offense after his failed tenure with the New York Jets. \"That’s certainly a possibility,\" Tomlin said to NFL Network about getting a decision from Rodgers soon. \"I’m not going to forecast the ifs and whens regarding not only him, but any other potential free agent. We’ve had really productive talks with him, and I’ve enjoyed having productive talks with him and getting to know him.\" Ultimately, it appears the decision is entirely Rodgers’ at this point. Retirement, much like it was when his time with the Green Bay Packers was clearly up before the 2023 campaign, is still in the cards.

The Steelers did make things enticing for Rodgers, too, bringing in D.K. Metcalf in a trade with the Seahawks to add to their offensive firepower, which includes George Pickens, Jaylen Warren, Pat Freiermuth and rookie running back Kaleb Johnson out of Iowa. Other than Howard, the Steelers brought back Mason Rudolph and signed Skylar Thompson to fill out its quarterbacks room.

    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. The questions aboutShedeur Sanders' NFL draft experience over the last three days that will go a long way toward determining his future are: Has he learned anything? And can he use that to improve? In that regard, the newest addition to theCleveland Brownsquarterback room seems to be on the right path.

So, it’s always in different areas I’m able to improve. \"And some things that I could have done at the time that seemed right at the time I could have went about in a different way, and that was like more during the season and stuff like that.\" Sanders not only slid in the draft. He rode an avalanche down the board, really. So, how did that feel? What effect did that have on his mindset? SHEDEUR SANDERS OPENS UP ON HISTORIC NFL DRAFT SLIDE, PRANK CALL AND BECOMING A BROWN \"No, nothing really affected me the last couple of days,\" Sanders said. \"You know, to just really push having faith and understanding, you know, God really had me, and I’m favored, I’m blessed. \"Besides that, it’s not really anything that changed. The love of the game is still the love of the game. When you get on the field, there wasn’t too much negativity being said. I know I gotta clean up some things in my game for me to be at my best, but that’s what I take each offseason one at a time and fix it. \"So I think that was just outside of football getting in the way. But, therefore, I have an opportunity now. We’re about to get on grass really soon.\" Sanders said that advice he got from his father and Colorado coach Deion Sanders amid the dramatic slide in the draft helped. And he also shared his feelings throughout that time. Colorado Buffaloes quarterback Shedeur Sanders (2) celebrates after defeating the Arizona State Sun Devils at Mountain America Stadium, home of the ASU Sun Devils.(Mark J. Rebilas-USA Today Sports) \"He said, ‘God got us.’ So that’s what it is. I look at what went on and everything as a football game, you know, you may not come out early hot, you know, that may not happen. But you know, when it’s down to the final two minutes of the game, then you understand the level of seriousness raises the stakes. All the stakes raised, and that’s why I thrive in those high-pressure moments. So, I never felt any type of way, I never felt any type of way. I understood, ‘OK, this is the route,’ and that’s it.\" Sanders has been portrayed as entitled. And perhaps arrogant. That snapshot of him is not inaccurate, depending on the moment. But that's not how he would have everyone believe he'll be when he arrives at the Browns' facility in Berea, Ohio. \"Get there and handle my business, do what I have to do, whatever role that is, I’m just thankful for the opportunity. So that’s all I could ask for. The rest is on me. \"I know I’m going to fit in perfectly. I feel like it’s first getting in, showing respect to the vets, showing them I’m here ready to work. Show the coaches and have them understand, I’m here ready to work. So they could actually understand the real me. That’s what I’m truly thankful to have, is the opportunity for people to actually see the real me and not be able to see stuff that could be true or not.\" It's obvious that Sanders doesn't agree with what happened when he was passed over by all 32 teams multiple times until the fifth round arrived.

    "title": "Broncos coach Sean Payton issues warning about Shedeur Sanders after NFL Draft fall: 'Beware'",
    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Denver Broncoshead coach Sean Payton never needed a quarterback entering the 2025 NFL Draft, which is always a good place to be in. Bo Nix, the team’s first-round draft choice in 2024, showed tremendous promise as a rookie, helping lead Denver into the playoffs out of a tough AFC West division. But that didn’t mean Payton wasn’t evaluating the quarterbacks available in this year’s draft class, especiallyShedeur Sanders, who played down the road in Boulder for the Colorado Buffaloes the past two seasons. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Denver Broncos head coach Sean Payton walks off the field following an NFL football game against the Cincinnati Bengals in Cincinnati, Saturday, Dec. 28, 2024.(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) Sanders took over the NFL Draft storylines, as he slipped into the fifth round before theCleveland Brownseventually took him with the No. 144 pick. Due to the unexpected fall down the draft board, Payton issued a warning to NFL teams about the prospect he had gotten to know really well. \"I saw [Shedeur] when he was in junior high, and then I saw him in high school, and then I saw him when he was a sophomore in high school when they were on their way to Florida,\" Payton said,via ESPN.\"He's going to, like there'll be this chip on his shoulder, and beware because this guy is going to play in this league.\" Payton was among the many coaches who attended Colorado’s pro day, or, as Deion \"Coach Prime\" Sanders called it, \"We Ain’t Hard to Find Showcase.\" ESPN STAR OFFERS EXPLANATION FOLLOWING SHEDEUR SANDERS NFL DRAFT TUMBLE Payton came away very impressed with what Sanders had put out on the practice field. \"We sat there. I watched right behind him throwing. . . . He had an outstanding pro day,\" he explained. \"I think we all are surprised, and yet the talent – holy cow, if you’re a team that needs a quarterback.\" Now, Payton and the elder Sanders have a strong relationship, which was showcased on the latter’s Instagram when he posted a picture of the two of them at the pro day together smiling. Colorado Buffaloes quarterback Shedeur Sanders (2) celebrates after defeating the Arizona State Sun Devils at Mountain America Stadium, Home of the ASU Sun Devils.(Mark J. Rebilas-USA Today Sports) But Payton wasn’t just surprised because he knows the Sanders family well. Many others couldn’t believe he had slipped that far, to the point where Browns GM Andrew Berry admitted they had taken him because he had been the best prospect available at \"the most important position.\" \"It’s surprising. We evaluated him,\"New England Patriotsexecutive vice president of player personnel Eliot Wolf said after Day 2, via ESPN. \"I had the opportunity to watch him play against Oklahoma State this year. . . . It was interesting to see that he’s still available, and I’m sure there’s going to be a fit for him tomorrow.\" Jerry Jones, the Dallas Cowboys owner who knows Deion Sanders very well, given his time with the organization, added: \"I watched two or three ballgames with [Shedeur]. So, with my knowledge, I know where the character is there, and boy, it is great character. It is an unbelievable competitive winning character for sports. OK? And so I can tell you that.\" Shedeur Sanders admitted this \"wasn’t the plan,\" especially considering the first-round grades many had given him. And while there likely won’t be anyone giving a pinpoint answer as to why he slipped down the draft board, reports have come out that he had bad meetings in the pre-draft process with multiple teams, and perhaps they were a factor.

Sanders' message pertained to the Browns, and it began recirculating shortly after his son was drafted by the very same franchise. SHEDEUR SANDERS OPENS UP ON HISTORIC NFL DRAFT SLIDE, PRANK CALL AND BECOMING A BROWN \"I love what the @Browns have done this offseason but if im a young QB ain't no way im going to Cleveland. I would pull a ELI MANNING If possible,\" Sanders wrote in a March 2018 social media post. Manning had been projected to be the top pick in 2004, and the Chargers had the No. 1 pick. But the franchise was gaining a reputation as a destination young quarterbacks should avoid. Manning's agent reportedly informed the Chargers that his client would sit out the entire season if the team were to draft him. Manning's family reportedly got involved, and the quarterback was drafted and traded to theNew York Giants. Deion previously declared, \"It's going to be an Eli\" when explaining how Shedeur and reigning Heisman Trophy winner Travis Hunter would handle the draft. He later clarified that he would not attempt to \"orchestrate\" where his son fell in this draft. \"No, because that's not God's will right now. I want Shedeur to do what he's consistently done — excel against all odds,\" the Colorado football coach said in March during an appearance on\"The Skip Bayless Show.\" \"I like the hating.

    "title": "Shedeur Sanders draft slide timeline: NFL executives cause media meltdown by rejecting polarizing prospect",
    "article_text": "Craig Carton breaks down how Shedeur Sanders may have actually won big by avoiding the pressure of being drafted in the first round. The Shedeur Sanders media machine arrived in the NFL with a resounding thud this weekend. Sanders' collapse from potential No. 1 overall pick to 144th marked an unprecedented moment in NFL Draft history, and rocked the nation. President Donald Trump called for Sanders to be \"picked IMMEDIATELY\" on Friday, just before the second round. But an NFL team did not select Sanders until Saturday afternoon, late in the fifth round. The Cleveland Browns ended the historic slide late in the fifth round, but by then, the national outrage had run its course. Viral discourse on the subject ranged in topic from religious to racial. Here's how it all went down: Tuesday before the draft,NFL Media releaseda summary of the top 18 prospects in this year's class. Sanders' section included testimony from an anonymous assistant coach, who said that Sanders was \"The worst formal interview I've ever been in in my life. He's so entitled. He takes unnecessary sacks. He never plays on time. He has horrible body language. He blames teammates. . . . But the biggest thing is, he's not that good.\" An anonymous longtime executive added, \"It didn't go great in our interview. He wants to dictate what he's going to do and what's best for him. He makes you feel small.\" SHEDEUR SANDERS OPENS UP ON HISTORICA NFL DRAFT SLIDE, PRANK CALL AND BECOMING A BROWN The quotes went viral, feeding into earlier rumors that Sanders had slid significantly down draft boards. But now, the notion that he could fall out of the first round had become widely acknowledged. Eventually, most betting platforms had Sanders at even odds to be a first-rounder. The night before round one, CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones said on his network's air, \"I think that there's a very good chance that [Shedeur Sanders] is not selected on Thursday night.\" Stephen A. Smith acknowledged the possibility of Sanders falling from the first round during the draft morning episode of ESPN's \"First Take\" and called the notion \"appalling.\" \"I'm trying to figure out is what the hell is the precipitous drop all about?\" Smith said on ESPN's \"First Take\" Thursday. \"We know this brother can play. We know about whether he doesn't have the greatest motor or the greatest arm. The accuracy is there. The poise is there. The pedigree is there. We see all of these things along with his skill set and what he's been able to do on the collegiate level, and here we are now wondering if this guy is going to be a second-round pick. I find this very appalling and very alarming and very disturbing.\" Smith sent a warning to the mainstream sports public that morning over potential outrage that could emerge if all 32 teams were to pass on Shedeur Sanders that night. Later that afternoon, Sanders wrote on X, \"I’m built for whatever today may bring.\" Deion Sanders with his sons Shedeur Sanders (left) and Deion Sanders Jr. (right) on the red carpet before Super Bowl LIX NFL Honors at Saenger Theatre.(Kirby Lee-Imagn Images) Sanders was initially projected as a candidate for each of the top three teams (Titans, Browns and Saints) early in the draft process, with the Raiders at six and the Saints at 11 as candidates, if Sanders were to fall out of the top three. But by the nine o'clock hour on Draft Night, all of those possibilities had officially passed him by, after the Saints took offensive tackle Kelvin Banks Jr., out of Texas. The nation watched ESPN and NFL Network broadcast shots of the inside of the Sanders family house, showing an entire shelf covered with all 32 NFL caps so he could pull one out and wear it for his big moment. At one point during the first round, his other brother, NFL safety prospect Shilo Sanders, insisted \"something is going on\" with Shedeur not being selected. The Steelers became the team to which Sanders was most strongly linked toward the end of the draft process. Some experts, including NFL Network's Daniel Jeremiah, believed that Pittsburgh could be Sanders' floor in the first round at 21. But Pittsburgh passed on Sanders, taking defensive tackle Derrick Harmon, out of Oregon. That move left the quarterback with no clear path to be chosen in the first round, as the reality of falling to the next day came into focus for him and his family. Just four picks later, the Giants traded up with the Texans to get the 25th pick, for a quarterback, but it wasn't Sanders. The Giants took Jaxson Dart, out of Ole Miss, who had been projected to go much later than Sanders in initial draft boards. NFL DRAFT QUARTERBACK MISTAKES THAT SHAPED LEAGUE LANDSCAPE And it seemed as the night got later, famed ESPN analyst Mel Kiper Jr. got progressively and noticeably more irritated when Sanders wasn't chosen. Mocking Kiper's progressive irritation. Kiper's irritation and affection for Sanders became one of the most mockingly discussed topics on social media throughout the draft, and was even pointed out by the social media account of the NBC-owned Pro Football Talk. It became official after the Chiefs used the 32nd and final pick on offensive Josh Simmons out of Ohio State; Sanders would not be a first-round pick. The 23-year-old quarterback took it upon himself to give a speech on-camera after that to acknowledge that it wasn't what he or his family had expected. \"We all didn't expect this,\" Sanders said, but expressed confidence that he would go on Day 2. Viral arguments began to spread rapidly across social media, as football fans fought on behalf of or against the validity of Sanders as a first-round prospect. The morning after Sanders fell past the first round marked the start of a national obsession over the question as to why. The topic led every mainstream sports talk show across the nation, and the conversation began to branch out of just football. SHEDEUR SANDERS' HISTORIC NFL DRAFT DRAMA IGNITED HEATED RACIAL DEBATES USA Todaypublished a columntitled, \"Shedeur Sanders' dramatic NFL draft slide seems deeper than pure football,\" which claimed that the quarterback's fall from the first round \"feels weird.\" Then, former Democrat congressman Jamaal Bowman amplified the argument that Sanders had fallen in the draft due to racial reasons, posting a 10-minute video rant and stating, \"America continues to fear strong black men.\" Bowman's video was later community noted to point out how many Black quarterbacks have been taken No. 1 overall in recent years, including this year's with Cam Ward. Meanwhile, Shedeur's father and college coach Deion Sanders broke his silence on the shock of his son slipping out of the third round in a post on X. President Trump expanded the scale of the controversy with a simple social media post on Friday afternoon. Hours before the start of the second round, Trump weighed in on Sanders' slide, supporting the quarterback and calling for him to be picked \"IMMEDIETELY.\" \"What is wrong with NFL owners, are they STUPID? Deion Sanders was a great college football player, and was even greater in the NFL. He’s also a very good coach, streetwise and smart! Therefore, Shedeur, his quarterback son, has PHENOMENAL GENES, and is all set for Greatness. He should be 'picked IMMEDIATELY by a team that wants to WIN. Good luck Shedeur, and say hello to your wonderful father!\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. Some in Sanders' family, including his brother Deion Jr., shared the president's message, as it thrust the entire situation into the political sphere. With Ward and Dart taken, the expectation became that Sanders would be the third quarterback picked and likely go high in the second round. No other prospect available at that point was realistically projected ahead of Sanders. But then the Saints made a very telling decision early in the second round with the 40th pick, needing a quarterback, they took Tyler Shough, out of Louisville. The 25-year-old Shough was nowhere near Sanders in early scouting reports. The football world was starting to realize they were seeing something unprecedented. The second round came and went without Sanders getting picked, so he waited in the third. The family's draft experience was broadcast on Twitch, and at one point, Sanders was seen answering a phone call that he assumed was from a general manager making the decision to draft him. The quarterback had a big smile on his face as he answered and greeted the caller, with friends and family crowding around him. \"I'm good, been waiting on you,\" he said. But the imposter on the other side told the eager young athlete that he would \"have to wait a little longer,\" as Sanders' smile quickly faded. The caller was attempting to impersonate Saints general manager Mickey Loomis, a video posted by Deion Jr. later showed. The call left Shedeur and the whole family confused. \"Nobody has that number but coaches, strictly for that reason. Why get mad? They want you to have a certain type of reaction to it,\" He told his brother on the video. \"They want you to feel bad. But I ain’t trippin’.\" When the third round ended Friday night, ESPN's Adam Schefter called Sanders' draft slide \"unprecedented.\" Superstar quarterback Patrick Mahomes even appeared to weigh in on the controversy with a simple tweet late Friday evening. The nation simply couldn't believe that Sanders would be, at the earliest, the sixth quarterback taken in the draft, after Jalen Milroe out of Alabama went to the Seahawks at 92 and Dillon Gabriel went to the Browns at 94. Kiper said of the development. \"I think it's disgusting. I don't understand what the heck's going on with this,\" Kiper said on ESPN. Meanwhile, Stephen A. Smith had already begun to compare the situation to Colin Kaepernick being out of the NFL since 2016 after his infamous kneels during the national anthem. The Sanders family never succumbed to negativity in the public throughout the historic slide and cruel prank. Shedeur himself thanked God several times, despite everything that was going on after falling past the third round. Deion Jr. made five X posts citing Bible verses dating back to Thursday, and was frequently re-sharing them as his brother fell in the draft. But outside the Sanders family home, the rest of the country was tearing itself apart over Sanders' slide. ESPN’s Booger McFarland had already succumbed to the argument that \"It’s gotta be about more than football,\" while NFL Network's Joel Klatt pointed the finger at the narratives that were built about Sanders during the pre-draft process. \"Shedeur represents everything I dislike about the NFL Draft, and it’s only one thing: It’s narratives. It’s narratives that are built up, lazy, and quite frankly, trash,\" Klatt said. And the debate raged well beyond sports. Bartsool founder Dave Portnoy amped up online racial arguments over Sanders' slide by responding to Smith's Kaepernick comparisons on X. ESPN radio host Peter Rosenberg posted a long-ranging thread on X, arguing that race had been a factor in Sanders' draft slide. Conservative filmmaker Matt Walsh even got in on the discussion, scrutinizing Sanders and agreeing with his slide. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Sanders was finally taken with the 144th pick on Saturday afternoon when the Browns ended the slide. Sanders' family celebrated the pick with the same degree of enthusiasm had it occurred in the first round, streaming a boisterous group celebration on Twitch once the pick was announced. However, Kiper, Smith and countless other prominent mainstream sports media figures spent plenty of time after that continuing to passionately debate the slide. The racial conversations about the situation haven't died down across social media. The Shedeur Sanders era is sure to be rife with national conversation for years to come.

    "title": "Blue Shield exposed 4.7M patients’ health data to Google",
    "article_text": "These scams can catch Facebook veterans and novices off guard. Healthcare institutionsand insurers arguably collect the most sensitive information about you, including IDs, contact details, addresses and medical records. But they often don’t put in the same level of effort to protect that data. That’s clear from the growing number of healthcare data breaches we’ve seen recently. In most of those cases, a bad actor was involved. But in the latest news, health insurance giantBlue Shield of Californiaconfirmed that it had been sharing private health data of 4.7 million users with Google for three years without even realizing it. STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS — SIGN UP FOR KURT’S THE CYBERGUY REPORT NOW A person doing a Google search(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)) Blue Shield of California just admitted to a major data privacy slip that went on for almost three years, from April 2021 to January 2024. It was usingGoogle Analyticsto track how people used its member websites. This is totally normal since every business does it. But the tool was accidentally sharing sensitive info with Google Ads because it wasn’t set up properly. What I find extremely shocking is that it took the company three years to realize it was sharing its user data with Google to run ads. This says a lot about how much these healthcare giants care about protecting your data. The shared data included a broad array of protected health information (PHI), including names, zip codes, gender, medical claim dates, online account numbers, insurance plan names, group numbers, family data and even search criteria used in its \"Find a Doctor\" feature. \"Google may have used this data to conduct focused ad campaigns back to those individual members. We want to reassure our members that no bad actor was involved, and, to our knowledge, Google has not used the information for any purpose other than these ads or shared the protected information with anyone,\" the companysaid in a notice on its website. This incident is not isolated. Over the past few years, healthcare and tech companies have come under scrutiny for similar missteps. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) have already issued warnings about the use of tracking technologies in healthcare, especially those that might expose patient data to third parties without adequate transparency or safeguards. A Google spokesperson provided the following comment to CyberGuy when asked about the Blue Shield data breach: \"Businesses, not Google, manage the data they collect and must inform users about its collection and use. By default, any data sent to Google Analytics for measurement does not identify individuals, and we have strict policies against collecting private health information (PHI) or advertising based on sensitive information.\" A person working on their laptop(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT Since the data was only shared with Google and not any other party, the overall risk is relatively low, apart from the clear privacy violation. It’s highly unlikely that anyone else will gain access to it, so the chances of the data being misused are slim. Google says it doesn’t allow ads to be served based on sensitive information like health, so there’s a good chance your data wasn’t even used for advertising. Blue Shield's case follows a string of similar breaches. Companies like GoodRx, BetterHelp and Kaiser have all faced regulatory and legal consequences for sharing sensitive user data with advertising vendors. Some even settled for millions of dollars. Despite the risks, many healthcare organizations have continued using these tools due to the lack of clear regulatory guardrails, a situation complicated further by a federal court ruling that blocked the Biden administration’s attempts to curb the use of online trackers in healthcare settings. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? A person working on a laptop(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET The Blue Shield of California incident is a reminder that even well-known healthcare providers can mishandle sensitive data. While you can’t always control what happens behind the scenes, therearesteps you can take to reduce your exposure and safeguard your privacy: 1. Limit what you share on health portals:Avoid entering more personal details than absolutely necessary on insurance or provider websites. Tools like \"Find a Doctor\" might log your search terms, so keep inputs vague when possible. 2. Use privacy-focused browsers:Browsers like Brave or Firefoxoffer built-in privacy protections, such as blocking third-party trackers that could expose health-related browsing activity. 3. Turn off ad personalization:VisitGoogle’s Ad Settingsand disable ad personalization. This won’t stop tracking, but it can reduce how your data is used for targeting. 4. Opt out of tracking where possible:Many healthcare sites use cookies and tracking tools. Choose \"reject all\" or the strictest privacy settings in cookie banners. If a tracking opt-out tool is available, use it. 5. Read privacy policies (yes, really):Look for language like \"third-party sharing,\" \"advertising,\" or \"analytics.\" If a healthcare provider mentions tools like Google Analytics or Meta Pixel, that’s a cue to proceed cautiously. 6. Monitor your accounts and credit:Keep an eye out for unusual insurance claims or medical charges. Set up credit alerts or monitoring services if your provider offers them, especially after a breach. 7. Ask questions:Call or email your healthcare provider or insurer. Ask what tracking tools they use and how they protect your data. The more consumers push for transparency, the more pressure there is to improve standards. GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE If you want to go beyond the basics, here are some additional steps that can help reduce your digital footprint and catch misuse early: Use a personal data removal service:While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren’t cheap — and neither is your privacy.  These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It’s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.  By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.Check out my top picks for data removal services here. Consider identity theft protection services:If you’re concerned about fraud or medical identity theft, you'll want to consider using identity theft protection services. Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.  They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Use strong antivirus software:To guard against malware or phishing attacks that could compromise access to your online health accounts, be sure to use strong antivirus software. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. It baffles me how careless most companies are when it comes to protecting user data. Blue Shield \"mistakenly\" shared your data with Google, which then used it to show personalized ads. It took the company three years to realize this. While most cyber incidents involve an attacker, this breach didn’t need one. We need accountability in data practices, especially when human error or tech oversight can cause damage at scale.

    "article_text": "HUD Secretary Scott Turner explains why housing is a bipartisan issue on 'Special Report' TheTrump administrationjust announced plans to sell the headquarters of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), a brutalist architectural monstrosity. Secretary Scott Turner admits that HUD headquarters is \"known as the ugliest building in D.C.\" The Trump administration is also seeking to terminate half of HUD’s staff and defund programs that have vexed America since the launch of Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society. Andrew Cuomo, former New York governor and Bill Clinton’s last HUD secretary, admitted in 1998 that HUD had been \"the poster child for failed government.\" In 1976, Detroit City Council president (and future U.S. senator) Carl Levin denounced the agency as \"Hurricane HUD\" for ravaging the Motor City with reckless subsidized mortgages with stratospheric default rates.

HUD PUTS HALF-OCCUPIED HEADQUARTERS BUILDING IN DC UP FOR SALE Gross negligence has always been HUD’s standard operating procedure. In 2011, the Washington Postcompiled hundreds of satellite images to prove thatHUD’s largest homebuilding programwas a \"dysfunctional system that delivers billions of dollars to local housing agencies with few rules, safeguards or even a reliable way to track projects.\" HUD claimed to have no idea that billions of dollars of its grants had been misused or plundered and ignored a barrage of complaints from individuals whose neighborhoods were ravaged. HUD left a \"trail of failed developments in every corner of the country. Fields where apartment complexes were promised are empty and neglected,\" the Post noted. Andrew Cuomo, Bill Clinton’s last HUD secretary, admitted in 1998 that HUD had been \"the poster child for failed government.\"(AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) During the 1990s, I spent many days at HUD headquarters investigating boondoggles. HUD was overstocked with the most depressed employees you would ever meet outside of a group therapy session in a city jail. After I wrote a Wall Street Journal piece headlined \"Clinton’s Wrecking Ball for Suburbs,\" HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros denounced me for \"unfortunate stereotyping of assisted-housing residents.\" But not nearly as unfortunate as subsequentHUD-financed violent crime wavesacross the nation. In the first half of 2016, at least 30 people were killed at Section 8 residences in Chicago - along with 7,000 other reported crimes. TRUMP STOPPED BIDEN’S PLAN TO FORCE DEI ON LOCAL COMMUNITIES In Houston, male Section 8 recipients are twice as likely to commit violent crimes as people with similar backgrounds and incomes who did not receive housing vouchers, according to a Texas A&M University study. A HUD-financed study found that Section 8 relocations \"tripled the rate of arrests for property crimes\" among boys who moved to new locales. Vice President Al Gore denounced HUD-financed public housing projects in 1996: \"These crime-infested monuments to a failed policy are killing the neighborhoods around them.\"(Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg) Russell Vought, Trump’s Office of Management & Budget chief,derided Section 8 because it \"brings with it crime, decreased property values, and results in dependency and subsidized irresponsibility.\" The Trump administration is expected to propose severe cuts in rental subsidies for next year’s budget. When Congress created HUD in 1965, it was supposed to bring social justice toAmerican cities. But Sandra Thompson, Biden’s Federal Housing Finance Agency chief, testified to Congress in 2022 that the racial homeownership gap \"is higher today than when the Fair Housing Act [of 1968] was passed.\" The Biden administration sought to \"fix\" that problem with a new mandate to punish mortgage borrowers with good credit ratings by forcing them to subsidize borrowers with shaky records of paying their bills. But \"No Deadbeats Left Behind\" is a poor maxim for mortgage policies. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Scott Turner appears before the Senate ahead of his confirmation vote to serve as HUD secretary.(Getty Images) Secretary Turner is ready to abandon HUD headquarters, declaring that that agency’s focus is on \"creating a workplace that reflects the values of efficiency, accountability and purpose.\" That 12-story building needs a half billion dollars in \"deferred maintenance and modernization\" expenses and costs more than $50 million a year to operate – despite being perennially half empty even before Trump’s mass firings. The maintenance and modernization costs far exceed the original cost of the building in inflation-adjusted dollars. HUD’s faltering headquarters could be far more valuable for a symbolic gesture than for a real estate payout. Donald Trumpshould take a page from the most dramatic housing intervention of the last 60 years. In 1954, St. Louis opened one of the nation’s largest public housing projects, with 33 high-rise apartment buildings. But the Pruitt-Igoe project soon became hopelessly marred by crime and vandalism. The 1972 film footage of the entire project being demolished should have been required viewing in every high school civics class in the nation.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP A heavily publicized demolition of HUD headquarters would provide a more valuable lesson for Americans than any sale price the faltering building fetched.

    "article_text": "Holocaust survivor Rae Goldfarb calls the attack on Israel ‘similar’ to her experience during the Holocaust on ‘FOX & Friends.’ Eighty years ago, as Allied forces moved through a broken Europe in the final days of World War II, my great-grandfather,Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, walked into a place that changed him forever: the Nazi concentration camp at Ohrdruf, a subcamp of Buchenwald. What he saw there – piles of corpses, skeletal survivors and evidence of unimaginable cruelty – would stay with him for life. He feared the world might one day try to deny it ever happened. So, he took action. He decided to etch it into the annals of world history. He immediately orderedAmerican troops, members of Congress, and international journalists to visit the camps and document the atrocities. Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower listens as a U.S. lieutenant questions a liberated slave laborer at, the Nazi concentration camp at Ohrdruf, which was liberated April 4, 1945.(Photo12/UIG/Getty Images) \"The visual evidence and the verbal testimony of starvation, cruelty and bestiality were so overpowering,\" he wrote to Gen. George Marshall, \"I made the visit deliberately, in order to be in a position to give first-hand evidence of these things if ever, in the future, there develops a tendency to charge these allegations merely to propaganda.\" UN MARKS HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY BY REDEFINING THE HOLOCAUST, COMPARING ISRAELIS TO NAZIS That foresight now feels painfully prophetic. In 2020, a nationwide survey by the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany revealed that 63% of U.S. millennials and Gen Z did not know that 6 million Jews were murdered in the Holocaust. Forty-eight percent could not name a single one of the more than 40,000 Nazi concentration camps and ghettos. These aren’t just troubling statistics – they’re a warning. In a world where misinformation spreads quickly, and whereantisemitismis once again on the rise, these gaps in knowledge are dangerous. MY PARENTS SURVIVED THE HOLOCAUST. THEY GAVE US 5 LESSONS ON LIVING WELL In parallel, antisemitic incidents in the United States have reached record highs. According to the Anti-Defamation League, in 2023, there were 8,873 documented antisemitic incidents – the highest number since the ADL began tracking such incidents in 1979. That’s a 140% increase from the year before. These included physical assaults, vandalism of synagogues and Jewish schools, and a growing presence of antisemitic rhetoric in mainstream discourse and on social media platforms. Polish prisoners in striped uniforms stand in rows before Nazi officers at the Buchenwald Concentration Camp, Weimar, Germany, circa 1943.(Frederic Lewis/Getty Images) This year, as we mark the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, I will participate in the International March of the Living, walking from Auschwitz to Birkenau alongside the president of theState of Israel, 80 Holocaust survivors, survivors of the Oct. 7 Hamas massacre in Israel, and students from across the world. MY FATHER SURVIVED THE HOLOCAUST. CENSORSHIP DIDN’T STOP THE NAZIS, IT HELPED THEM We will walk in silence – but our presence will speak loudly. It will say that we remember. That we bear witness. That we will carry forward the testimonies of those who survived and those who perished. It is an honor, as General – and then President – Eisenhower’s great-grandson, to continue that legacy of truth-telling by standing on the very soil where the Nazis tried to erase a people. While my great-grandfather is best remembered for his leadership during the war, his legacy as president also includes support for the Jewish people throughout his presidency. During his presidency, Eisenhower oversaw the United States' strengthening of Israel’s right to self-defense, its support for Jewish refugees fleeing Europe, and an unmissable condemnation ofantisemitism and bigotryin all its forms. In 1958, he dedicated the cornerstone of the Jewish Theological Seminary library, stating, \"We must affirm human dignity and decency. For unless we do, civilization itself is in jeopardy.\" He understood that the battle against hate didn’t end with the war, nor with the Jews – it was universal. HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY – WHY WE MUST NEVER FORGET That is still true today. Holocaust denial and distortion are no longer creeping into our public discourse, they are flooding it. Oncollege campuses, in political rhetoric, and in online forums, attempts to minimize or erase the truths for which Eisenhower and millions of others fought are shockingly left unchallenged. In this context, education isn’t just a tool – it’s a responsibility. We must teach young people not only what happened in the Holocaust, butwhyit happened – how hatred, dehumanization and silence allowed genocide to unfold.

Elie Wiesel, the Nobel Prize-winning author of \"Night,\" is on the second bunk from the bottom, seventh from the left.(Corbis/Corbis via Getty Images) We must ensure they hear the voices of survivors, see the remnants of the camps and understand what \"never again\" truly demands of us. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION WhenEisenhower visited Ohrdrufin 1945, he stood as a general. But his decision to shine a light on those horrors was also the act of a human being unwilling to look away. As his great-grandson, I feel the weight of that decision – and the privilege of carrying it forward. He once said, \"The hope of the world is that wisdom can arrest conflict between brothers.\" That wisdom begins with memory. With truth. And with ensuring that future generations never forget what he, and so many others, saw with their own eyes.

The sitefirst went down on April 14, with the person responsible for the hack apparently leaking data including a list of moderators and “janitors” (one janitor told TechCrunch they were “confident” that the leaked data was real). 4chan’s extended disappearance led to at least one premature obituary, with journalist Ryan Broderickwriting for Wiredthat “what began as a hub for internet culture and an anonymous way station for the internet’s anarchic true believers devolved over the years into a fan club for mass shooters, the central node of Gamergate, and the beating heart of far-right fascism around the world.” But the 4chan team responded defiantly ina post on X: “Wired says ‘4chan is dead.’ Is that so?” And on Friday, the sitecame back online. Shortly afterward,a post on the official 4chan blogin said “a hacker using a UK IP address” was able to gain access to one of 4chan’s servers using a “bogus PDF upload,” subsequently “exfiltrating database tables and much of 4chan’s source code,” then beginning to “vandalize 4chan at which point moderators became aware and 4chan’s servers were halted, preventing further access.” The damage, the post said, was “catastrophic.” “Ultimately this problem was caused by having insufficient skilled man-hours available to update our code and infrastructure, and being starved of money for years by advertisers, payment providers, and service providers who had succumbed to external pressure campaigns,” the post said, later adding, “Advertisers and payment providers willing to work with 4chan are rare, and are quickly pressured by activists into cancelling their services.” The breached server was subsequently replaced, the post said, although the site has new limitations — PDF uploads are “temporarily” disabled, and a board for sharing Flash animations has been left offline as the team saw “no realistic way to prevent similar exploits using .swf files.” As of Sunday afternoon, the site’s status checker showed that the boards and front page were up, while posting, images, and thumbnails were not working. “4chan is back,” the post said. “No other website can replace it, or this community. No matter how hard it is, we are not giving up.” Topics Anthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "title": "Welcome to Chat Haus, the coworking space for AI chatbots",
    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Nestled between an elementary school and a public library in Brooklyn’s Greenpoint neighborhood sits a new kind of “luxury” coworking space. Dubbed the Chat Haus, this space has many of the elements you’d find in a traditional coworking office: people hammering away at their computer keyboards, another person taking a phone call, someone else pausing by their computer to take a sip of coffee. There is, however, one key difference: Chat Haus is a coworking space for AI chatbots, and everything — including the people — is made out of cardboard. More specifically, the Chat Haus is an art exhibit by Brooklyn artistNim Ben-Reuven. It  houses a handful of cardboard robots working away at their computers through movements controlled by small motors. There is a sign that offers desk space for “only” $1,999 a month and another that labels the space as “A luxury co-working space for chatbots.” Ben-Reuven told TechCrunch that he built the exhibit as a way to cope and bring humor to the fact that most of his work — which largely centers around graphic design and videography — is being pushed into the AI world. He added that he’s already getting denied freelance jobs as companies turn to AI tools instead. “It was like an expression of frustration in humor, so I wouldn’t get too bitter about the industry changing so quickly and under my nose and not wanting to be a part of the shift,” Ben-Reuven said. “So I was like, I’ll just fight back with something silly that I can laugh at myself.” He said he also wanted to keep this exhibit from being too negative because he didn’t think that would tell the right message. He said creating art that is blatantly negative forces it into a corner and requires it to defend itself. He added giving the display a “lighter tone” also helps it drawn in viewers of all ages and with all opinions on AI. While Ben-Reuven and I were chatting at Pan Pan Vino Vino, a cafe located across the street from the window display, numerous groups of people stopped to look at the Chat Haus. Three millennial-aged women stopped and took pictures. A group of just-out-of-school elementary-aged students stopped and asked their adult companions questions. Ben-Reuven also thought that despite what AI is doing to the industry he works in, the situation remains lighter than some of the other horrors and trauma going on in the world today. “I mean, AI, in terms of the creative world, seems like such a light thing compared to so many of the other, like war, things that are happening in the world and like the terror and the trauma that exists,” he said. Ben-Reuven has always used cardboard in his art. He made a lifesize-replica of an airport terminal out of cardboard in grad school. In between freelance jobs over the last decade, he’s worked on building these cardboard robots, or “cardboard babies” as he calls them. So while using these cardboard robots was a natural choice for display — he joked he also needed a reason to get them out of his apartment — the material is also providing another commentary on AI. “The impermanence of this cardboard stuff, and the ability for it to collapse under even just a little bit of weight, is how I feel that AI is interacting with the creative industries,” he said. “People can make their Midjourney images that look really great on Instagram and excite 12 year olds to no end, but with any level of scrutiny, it’s garbage, and I feel like you look close enough at these cardboard things, they are easily collapsible and easily will fall under any weight.” He understands why consumers are drawn to some AI-generated art, though. He likened it to junk food and the fast-acting serotonin hit that comes from eating junk food before it gets digested quickly. The Chat Haus is a temporary display as the building that houses it awaits permits to get approved for renovation. Ben-Reuven hopes to keep the display up until at least mid-May and has hopes to move into a larger gallery if he can. He wants to be able to add more to it — but is worried about where he’ll put any additional materials in his apartment once the display is over. “I just thought it would be funny to express this idea of, like, a whole bunch of kind of cute, kind of creepy, baby robots typing away because of our ChatGPT prompts in some warehouse somewhere, working non-stop taking as much electricity as Switzerland uses in a year,” Ben-Reuven said. The Chat Haus is currently on display in the front window of 121 Norman Avenue in Brooklyn, New York’s Greenpoint neighborhood.

The WSJ says that after learning about internal concerns about whether the company was doing enough to protect minors, it spent months conducting hundreds of conversations with the official Meta AI chatbot, as well as user-created chatbots available on Meta platforms. In one reported conversation, a chatbot using actor/wrestler John Cena’s voice described a graphic sexual scenario to a user identifying as a 14-year-girl. In another conversation, the chatbot imagined a police officer catching Cena with a 17-year-old fan and telling him, “John Cena, you’re under arrest for statutory rape.” A Meta spokesperson described the WSJ’s testing as “so manufactured that it’s not just fringe, it’s hypothetical.” The company estimated that in a 30-day period, sexual content accounted for 0.02% of responses shared via Meta AI and AI studio with users under 18. “Nevertheless, we’ve now taken additional measures to help ensure other individuals who want to spend hours manipulating our products into extreme use cases will have an even more difficult time of it,” the spokesperson said.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Not so long ago, the idea of public tech companies emerging from Latin America seemed far-fetched, and Mercado Libre once appeared as rare and mythical as a true unicorn. Today, however, the region is home to several startups that have reached billion-dollar valuations. Some of these startups, propelled into the spotlight by cross-border expansion, are now recognized beyond their home countries, with Nubank notablygoing public in the U.S. Yet, there is a broader cohort of Latin American scale-ups that deserve attention; many in fintech, but not exclusively. Other important sectors include e-commerce, health tech, logistics, proptech, and SaaS. Some homegrown unicorns may currently hold “paper valuations” from rounds that were raised during the 2021 peak, but the point still stands: They are worth knowing, and many could recover alongside the market, as VC investment in Latin Americademonstrated resilience in 2024. As a group, these unicorns also reflect Latin America’s multiple startup hubs. While Brazil and Mexico remain leaders in numbers, unicorns have also emerged from Argentina, Colombia, Chile, and Uruguay, further strengthening these ecosystems. Let’s take a closer look at the top Latin American unicorns by valuation — although the oldest price tags often need to be taken with a grain of salt. Coming out of Colombia, Rappi is an on-demand delivery platform that becamea super appand expanded into multiple countries. Its rise solidified before the pandemic: In 2019, it raiseda $1 billion investmentfrom SoftBank. But its $5.25 billion valuation was attached to theround of more than $500 millionit secured in July 2021. Since then, Rappi has operated in a more challenging environment, conducting multiple rounds oflayoffsand facing changinggig economy legislation in Mexico, where it now plans toinvest $110 millionto boost its operations. However, the company stillvery much hopes to IPOandhired a CFOto prepare for that endeavor after reaching break-even for the first time in late 2023. QuintoAndar is a Brazilian proptech company focused on the rental and sale of residential real estate. With commercial activities insix Latin American countriesanda tech hub in Europe, it made several acquisitions and grew into a group with a headcount of more than 3,500 people. In 2021, the startup was busy on the fundraising front: Less than three months after announcinga $300 million Series E at a $4 billion valuation, QuintoAndar raised an additional $120 millionat a $5.1 billion valuation. With$755 millionraised to date, its cap table includes Kaszek, General Atlantic, SoftBank, and Tencent. Creditas is a Brazilian fintech player specializing in loans, including consumer credit. Its latest round of funding was a $260 million Series F in January 2022 valuing the Brazilian lenderat $4.8 billion, up from $1.75 billion in December 2020. The Series F was led by Fidelity, with participation from new and existing backers, including Kaszek Ventures, QED Investors, and SoftBank. It wasextended in July 2022at the same valuation, allowing Creditas tobuy the Brazilian license of Andorran bank Andbankfor some $93 million. Branded as Tiendanube in Spanish-speaking markets, Nuvemshop is a Brazilian e-commerce platform designed for SMEs and entrepreneurs to sell products and services online — or in short,“Latin America’s answer to Shopify.” Its latest known valuation of $3.1 billion comes from the$500 million Series E mega-roundco-led by Insight Partners and Tiger Global Management that it raised in August 2021, only a few months after itsAccel-led $90 million Series D. Wildlife Studios is a Brazilian mobile gaming company. It was co-founded byVictor Lazarte, now also a general partner at Benchmark, the VC firm that led Wildlife Studios’$60 million Series Ain 2019 at a $1.3 billion valuation. Less than a year later, the startup reached anearly $3 billion valuationfrom its Series B round. In a candid conversation onstageat Slush 2023, Lazarte said that, in retrospect, raising too much capital at too high a valuation so fast was a “mistake.” In June 2023, the company announced that former Amazon executive Peter Hill wouldreplace Lazarte as CEO. It also conductedseveral rounds of layoffs. Loft is a Brazilian proptech companysupported by big Silicon Valley names since its genesis in 2018. Loft’s $175 million Series C was co-led by a16z and Vulcan Capital in 2020. A $425 million Series D led by New York-based D1 Capital Partners followed in March 2021, and its extension in April 2021 valued the companyat $2.9 billion. The digital real estate platform wasn’t immune to the market turn. It conductedtwo rounds of layoffs in 2022butdenied having raised a down roundin November 2022. In 2023, after fresh funding from asovereign fund in the Middle East” at an undisclosed valuation and another round of layoffs, it claimed tohave reached break-even. Unico is a Brazilian ID tech startup, and one of Latin America’s largest SaaS companies. Its $2.6 billion valuation is more recent than many on this list. It came from the $100 million Series D the company raisedin April 2022. The round was led by Goldman Sachs, with participation from existing investors General Atlantic and SoftBank Latin America Fund. C6 Bank is a Brazilian digital bank. Unlike some competitors, it hasn’t expanded beyond Brazil, where it has more than 35 million clients. C6 was valued at$2.28 billionin December 2020, six months before JPMorgan Chase acquired 40% ownership of the neobank in 2021. Afterincreasing its stakein 2023, it now owns 46% of C6, which had itsfirst-ever profitable year in 2024. With backers including General Catalyst and SoftBank, Kavak is a Mexico-based e-commerce platform to buy and sell used cars online. Once valuedat $8.7 billionafter a Series E round that doubled its valuation in 2021, Kavak saw its valuationslashed by $6.5 billionfollowing expansion difficulties and layoffs. After raising a $127 million equity round and securing two $200 million debt facilities in March 2025, the company aims to position itself for a potential IPO within the next three to five years. Bitso is a Latin American cryptocurrency exchange that also facilitates cross-border payments. In May 2021, it secured a $250 million Series C round valuing the company at $2.2 billion and co-led by Tiger Global and Coatue, with participation from new and existing investors, including Kaszek andQED. Known for its InfinitePay and Jim.com brands, CloudWalk is a Brazilian payment infrastructure company (not to be confused with theChinese facial-recognition software companyby the same name).

    "title": "Victim hurt in attack involving crossbow 'stable'",
    "article_text": "One of two women seriously injured in an attack involving a crossbow and a firearm in Leeds has undergone surgery for \"life-threatening injuries\". Counter Terrorism Policing North East said the \"isolated incident\" involving the women aged 19 and 31, happened on Otley Road, in the Headingley area, at about 14:47 BST on Saturday. One of the women was sent home from hospital earlier while the other, who underwent surgery, was now in a stable condition, police said. A 38-year-old man, who officers said was \"the key suspect\", remains in hospital in a critical condition, under police guard, after suffering a \"self-inflicted injury\". The incident occurred on Otley Road in Headingley while people were taking part in the popular Otley Run pub crawl. Cordons around the scene on Otley Road were removed on Sunday evening. Det Ch Supt James Dunkerley said: \"The investigation continues and officers are working at pace to establish the full facts and circumstances of Saturday's incident. \"We are not currently seeking anyone else in connection with this matter, which has caused understandable concern. We believe it was an isolated incident.\" Alison Lowe, deputy mayor of West Yorkshire for policing and crime, said the man was being held under police guard. She said: \"The suspect injured themselves and is now in hospital under police guard so the threat has been eliminated.\" Lowe reassured the public and said there would be an increased police presence across Headingley in \"the coming days and weeks\". \"This is a very, very rare incident and the police know that the public are very frightened, so there is a much bigger police presence. \"I would be scared if I had witnessed or been close to an incident of that magnitude. \"All I can say to those women and girls is that we're here for you. We're increasing those patrols.\" MP for Leeds Central and Headingley, Alex Sobel, said the incident raised concerns about the safety of the Otley Run. He said: \"We need to look at the numbers and see what we can do to ensure safety on the Otley Run. \"This is really serious and shocking and nobody foresaw that anything like this would happen, but we have had other issues, just because of the huge volume of people who come every Saturday and the growth in it. \"Because of this we're going to have to look really deeply at how Otley Run operates.\" Headingley resident Vasileios Balampanos described seeing the aftermath of the incident. He said he saw paramedics treating someone further up Otley Road and \"a couple of distressed individuals, students mostly\". \"It was quite scary,\" he said. \"Generally, this is a quiet area but we have plenty of people doing the Otley Run and going to the pub. It can get busy sometimes.\" Headingley councillor Abdul Hannan said his thoughts were with the victims and said the council was working closely with the police and reassuring the community. \"It's horrific,\" he said. \"There is a lot of footfall in that area, it is a busy stretch, especially on a Saturday. \"It is a tragedy what has taken place.\" Listen to highlights fromWest Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latestepisode of Look North.

    "title": "Israel launches air strike on Beirut",
    "article_text": "Israel carried out an air strike on Beirut's southern suburbs on Sunday, after ordering an evacuation of a building that it said was being used by the Iranian-backed group Hezbollah. The attack occurred despite a ceasefire that came into force five months ago which put an end to the conflict between Israel and the military group. Israel said that it had targeted a Hezbollah store of \"precision-guided missiles\" that \"poses a threat to the State of Israel and its civilians\". The Lebanese presidency condemned the strike and called on the US and France - who brokered the ceasefire in November - to press Israel to cease its attacks on the country. The attack marks the first time in almost a month that Israel has struck Beirut's southern suburbs - called Dahieh - where Hezbollah is based. This will put further pressure on the ceasefire. Despite the deal, Israel has struck targets it says are linked to Hezbollah almost every day. The Israeli government has said that it will respond to any perceived threats from Hezbollah. Western officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, have told the BBC that the militant group has been largely compliant with the truce, while accusing Israel of multiple violations that include air strikes and drone surveillance. Live footage streamed by Reuters showed a giant plume of smoke billowing from the targeted building an hour after the Israeli army issued an evacuation order to residents of the Hadath neighbourhood. Lebanon's Civil Defence later said that no casualties had been recorded and rescue crews had extinguished the fire. In a statement on X following the strike, the Lebanese Presidency said that President Joseph Aoun condemned the attack. \"The United States and France, as guarantors of the cessation of hostilities agreement, must assume their responsibilities and compel Israel to immediately cease its attacks,\" it wrote. \"Israel's continued undermining of stability will exacerbate tensions and expose the region to real threats to its security and stability.\" Israel's government said that it had targeted a Hezbollah store of \"precision-guided missiles\". \"The storage of missiles in this infrastructure site constitutes a blatant violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon, and poses a threat to the State of Israel and its civilians,\" the Israeli military said in a statement. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said that Israel \"will not allow Hezbollah to grow stronger\". \"The Dahiyeh neighbourhood in Beirut will not serve as a safe haven for the terrorist organisation Hezbollah,\" it added. UN Special Coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, wrote on X that the strike \"generated panic and fear of renewed violence among those desperate for a return to normalcy\". \"We urge all sides to halt any actions that could further undermine the cessation of hostilities understanding,\" she added. Earlier this month anIsraeli airstrike in Beirut's southern suburbs killed four people, including a Hezbollah official. Students, staff, and parents alike are traumatised by what has happened and the destruction that surrounds them. The BBC's Hugo Bachega explores the future for Hezbollah in the wake of Israel's devastating attacks. The men, aged 39 and 35, were arrested over suspected links to banned group Hezbollah. The Israeli military said it targeted a Hezbollah operative in the southern suburbs of Lebanon's capital. The strike, which Israel said hit a Hezbollah site, occurred hours after two rockets were fired from southern Lebanon towards northern Israel.",

    "title": "The rapid remaking of a nation, in 100 days",
    "article_text": "During last year's presidential campaign, Donald Trump constantly repeated his intention to bring about dramatic change as soon as he returned to the White House. But few expected it to come at such breakneck speed. In the three months since he took the oath of office, the 47th president has deployed his power in a way that compares to few predecessors. In stacks of bound documents signed off with a presidential pen and policy announcements made in all caps on social media, his blizzard of executive actions has reached into every corner of American life. To his supporters, the shock-and-awe approach has been a tangible demonstration of an all-action president, delivering on his promises and enacting long-awaited reforms. But his critics fear he is doing irreparable harm to the country and overstepping his powers - crippling important government functions and perhaps permanently reshaping the presidency in the process. Here are six turning points from the first 100 days. For once, it wasn't a Trump social media post that sparked an outcry. Three weeks into the new term, at 10.13am on a Sunday morning, Vice-President JD Vance wrote nine words that signalled a strategy which has since shaped the Trump administration's second term. \"Judges aren't allowed to control the executive's legitimate power,\" he declared on X. In the media frenzy that followed, legal experts lined up to challenge that assertion, pointing to a 220-year-old principle which lies at the heart of American democracy. Courts have the power to check and strike down any government action - laws, regulations and executive orders - they think violates the US Constitution. Vance's words represented a brazen challenge to judicial authority and, more broadly, the system of three co-equal branches of government crafted by America's founders. But Trump and his team remain unapologetic in extending the reach of the executive branch into the two other domains - Congress and the courts. The White House has moved aggressively to wrest control of spending from Congress, unilaterally defunding programmes and entire agencies. This erosion of its power has been largely met by silence on Capitol Hill, where Trump's Republicans hold slim majorities in both chambers. The courts have been more resistant, with well over 100 rulings so far halting presidential actions they deem to be unconstitutional, according to a tally by the New York Times. Some of the biggest clashes have been over Trump's immigration crackdown. In March, more than 200 Venezuelans deemed a danger to the US, were deported to El Salvador, many under sweeping wartime powers and without the usual process of evidence being presented in court. A Republican-appointed judge on a federal appeals court said he was \"shocked\" by how the White House had acted. \"Now the branches come too close to grinding irrevocably against one another in a conflict that promises to diminish both,\" Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson wrote. Trump and White House officials have said they will obey court rulings, even as the president lambasts many of the judges who issue them and the administration at times moves slowly to fully comply. It all amounts to a unique test of a constitutional system that for centuries has operated under a certain amount of good faith. While Trump has been at the centre of this push, one of his principle agents of chaos is a man who wasn't born in the US, but who built a business empire there. Elon Musk, dressed in black from head to toe and wearing sunglasses, stood centre stage and basked in the adulation of the Conservative Political Action Conference crowd. The richest man in the world, who wants to cut trillions of dollars from the federal government, said he had a special surprise. Argentinian President Javier Milei, known for his own budget-slashing, emerged from backstage and handed him a shiny gold chainsaw. \"This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy,\" Musk exclaimed. \"CHAINSAW!!\" It was a dramatic illustration not only of Musk's enthusiasm for his \"Department of Government Efficiency\" (Doge) assignment, but also of the near rock-star status that the South African-born technologist has developed among the Trump faithful. Since that appearance, Musk has dispatched his operatives across the federal government, pushing to access sensitive government databases and identify programmes to slash. Although he has not come anywhere near to finding the trillions of dollars of waste he once promised, his cuts have drastically reduced dozens of agencies and departments - essentially shutting down the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and attempting to dismantle the Department of Education. While pledges to cut \"waste, fraud and abuse\" in government and trim the ballooning federal deficit typically have broad appeal, the manner in which Musk has used his metaphorical chainsaw has led to conflict with senior government officials and stoked anger among some of the American public. Some Trump supporters may approve of the administration's aggressive budget-cutting but other constituents have berated Republican legislators at town hall events. Hecklers have expressed fear that the cuts will adversely affect popular government programmes like Social Security retirement plans, veterans benefits, and health insurance coverage for the poor and elderly. Their concerns may not be entirely misplaced, given that these schemes make up the bulk of federal spending. If these programmes are not cut back, sweeping tax cuts that Trump has promised would further increase the scale of US government debt and put at risk arguably his biggest election promise - economic prosperity. When trader Richard McDonald saw Trump hold up his charts in the White House Rose Garden showing a list of countries targeted by US tariffs, he knew he had to act fast. \"I jumped to my feet because I wasn't expecting a board [of charts] - I was expecting an announcement,\" he says. McDonald expected tariff cuts of 10% or 20%, but says \"nobody expected these huge numbers\". He raced to understand which companies might be worst hit. Then he sold. \"There are billions being wiped off share prices every second, so it's really 'fastest finger first'.\" He is one of the many traders who were at the coal face of global markets when share prices plunged everywhere following Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement. The S&P 500 index of the largest firms listed in the US was hit particularly hard - and even though the White House has reversed course on some of the highest tariffs, it hasn't fully recovered since. The economy was the biggest concern for US voters in November's election, and Trump rode a tide of deep unhappiness over Biden's handling of inflation all the way to victory. His pledge to cut prices, pare back government regulation and boost homegrown industry was a pro-business message warmly welcomed on Wall Street and by many working Americans. But as Trump tries to follow through on his promise of new tariffs, the economic costs, at least in the short term, have become painfully apparent. The stock market is sinking, interest rates - including for home mortgages - are rising, and consumer confidence is down. Unemployment is also ticking up, in part due to the growing number of federal employees forced out of their jobs. The Federal Reserve Bank, along with economic experts, warn Trump's plan will shrink economic growth and possibly lead to a recession. While the president's approval ratings on his handling of the economy have tumbled, many of his supporters are sticking with him. And in former industrial areas hollowed out by the loss of manufacturing jobs, there are hopes that tariffs could even the global playing field. \"Trump has earned back the respect,\" says truck driver Ben Maurer in Pennsylvania, referring to tariffs on China. \"We are still the force to be reckoned with.\" Economic concerns have contributed to Trump's overall decline in the polls, but in one key area, he is still largely on solid ground in the public's eye - immigration. \"It's him! It's him! I recognise his features,\" says Myrelis Casique Lopez, pointing at a photo of men shackled and cuffed on the floor of one of the most infamous prisons in the world. She had spotted her son in the image, taken from above, of a sea of shaven heads belonging to men in white T-shirts sat in long, straight rows. At home in Maracay, Venezuela, Ms Casique was shown the photograph, first shared online by the El Salvador authorities, by a BBC reporter. When she last had contact with her son, he was in the US and facing deportation to Venezuela but now he was 1,430 miles (2,300 km) away from her, one of 238 men sent by US authorities to a notorious mega-jail in El Salvador. The Trump administration says they are members of the Tren de Aragua gang - a powerful, multi-national crime operation - but Ms Casique insists her son is innocent. A tough stance on immigration was a central plank of Trump's re-election campaign, and the president has used his broad powers of enforcement to deliver that pledge. Illegal border crossings were falling at the end of the Biden presidency, but are now at their lowest monthly total for more than four years. A majority of the US public still backs the crackdown, but it has had a chilling effect on communities of foreign students who have found themselves caught up in the blitz. Some, including permanent residents, have been detained and face deportation because of their role in pro-Palestinian campus protests. They have rejected accusations that they support Hamas. Civil rights lawyers warn that some migrants are being deported without due process, sweeping up the innocent among the \"killers and thugs\" that Trump says are being targeted. While so far there haven't been the level of mass deportations that some hoped for and others feared, newly empowered immigration enforcement agents have taken action across the US in businesses, homes and churches. They have been active in universities too, which have become a prominent target of President Trump in several other ways. On 21 April, Harvard University's president, Alan Garber, decided to confront the White House head-on. In a letter to the university community, he announced a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's move to freeze billions of dollars in federal grants. It was, he said, an illegal attempt to \"impose unprecedented and improper control\" over Harvard's operations. The White House said it had to take action because Harvard had not tackled antisemitism on campus - an issue that Garber said the university was taking steps to address. But the Ivy League college's move was the most prominent display of resistance against Trump's use of presidential power to target American higher education, a longstanding goal energised by pro-Palestinian protests that engulfed campuses in 2024. The president and his officials have since impounded or threatened to withhold billions of dollars in federal spending to reshape elite institutions like Harvard, which the president and many of his supporters think push a liberal ideology on students and researchers. Earlier in the month, Columbia University in New York City had agreed to a number of White House demands, including changes to its protest policies, campus security practices and Middle Eastern studies department. A similar dynamic has played out in the corporate and media worlds. Trump has used the withholding of federal contracts as a way to pressure law firms to recruit and represent more conservatives. Some of the firms have responded by offering the Trump administration millions of dollars in free legal services, while two firms have filed suit challenging the constitutionality of the administration's punishments. A defamation lawsuit Trump brought against ABC News has led to the media company contributing $15m (£11m) to Trump's presidential foundation. CBS is also in talks to settle a separate lawsuit over a Kamala Harris interview, as its parent company Paramount seeks federal approval for a merger with Skydance Media. The Associated Press, by contrast, has resisted administration pressure to accept Trump's \"Gulf of America\" name change despite the White House's efforts to block the news agency from coverage of the president. On the campaign trail, Trump warned about the runaway power of the federal government. Now in office, he is wielding that power in a way no previous modern president has attempted. Nowhere, however, have the impacts of his efforts been more visible than within the federal government agencies and departments that he now controls. The press conference at the White House began with a moment's silence for the victims of an aircraft collision over the Potomac River. Within seconds of the pause coming to an end, however, Trump was on the attack. A diversity and inclusion initiative at the Federal Aviation Agency was partly to blame for the tragedy, the president claimed, because it hired people with severe intellectual disabilities as air traffic controllers. He did not provide any evidence. It was a startling moment that was emblematic of the attack his presidency has launched against inclusivity programmes that have proliferated in recent years across the US government and corporate world. Trump has directed the federal government to end its diversity and equity (DEI) programmes and investigate private companies and academic institutions thought to be engaged in \"illegal DEI\". His directive has accelerated moves among leading global companies like Meta and Goldman to cut back or eliminate these programmes. First introduced in the 1960s in the wake of civil rights victories, early forms of DEI were an attempt to expand opportunities for black Americans. They later expanded to take in women, LGBT rights and other racial groups. Efforts were stepped up and embraced by much of corporate America in the wake of the 2020 Black Lives Matters protests following the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis Police officers. But to its critics, DEI was putting politics and race above talent, creating division and was no longer needed in modern America. While Trump's directive seems to have support from a narrow majority of voters, some of the unexpected consequences have raised eyebrows. Arlington National Cemetery scrubbed from its website all mentions of the history of black and female service members. And the Enola Gay aircraft that dropped an atomic bomb on Japan was initially flagged for removal from Pentagon documents, apparently due to the word \"gay\". Donald Trump's first 100 days have been an unprecedented display of unilateral power exercised by a modern American president. His efforts to dismantle large swaths of the federal government will take years, if not decades, for subsequent presidents to restore - if they so desire. In other ways, however, Trump's efforts so far may end up being less permanent. Without the support of new laws passed by Congress, many of his sweeping reforms could be wiped away by a future president. And so to what extent this whirlwind start leads to lasting change remains an open question. Later this year, the narrow Republican majorities in Congress will attempt to provide the legislative backing for Trump's agenda, but their success is far from guaranteed. And in next year's mid-term congressional elections, those majorities could be replaced by hostile Democrats bent on investigating the administration and curtailing his authority. Meanwhile, more court battles loom - and while the US Supreme Court has a conservative tilt, its decisions on a number of key cases could ultimately cut against Trump's efforts. The first 100 days of Trump's second term have been a dramatic show of political force, but the next 1,361 will be the real test of whether he can carve an enduring legacy.

    "title": "Beijing seizes tiny sandbank in South China Sea",
    "article_text": "The Chinese coastguard has seized a tiny sandbank in the South China Sea, state media has reported, in an escalation of a regional dispute with the Philippines. State broadcaster CCTV released images of four officers, wearing all black and holding the Chinese flag, standing on the disputed reef of Sandy Cay in the Spratly Islands. CCTV said China had \"implemented maritime control and exercised sovereign jurisdiction\" on the reef earlier in April. Both China and the Philippines have staked claims on various islands. The Philippines said later on Sunday that it had landed on three sandbanks, releasing an image of officers holding up their national flag in a pose that mimicked the Chinese photo. It is unclear whether one of the sandbanks the Philippines security forces landed on was also Sandy Cay. In a statement, the National Task Force West Philippine Sea (NTF-WPS) said it witnessed \"the illegal presence\" of a Chinese Coastguard vessel 1,000 yards (914 metres) from one of the sandbanks, as well as seven Chinese militia vessels. \"This operation reflects the unwavering dedication and commitment of the Philippine Government to uphold the country's sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction in the West Philippine Sea,\" the statement said. The dispute between the two nations has been escalating, withfrequent confrontationsincluding vessels colliding and scuffles. Sandy Cay is near a Philippine military outpost on Thitu Island,also known as Pag-asa, which Manila reportedly uses to track Chinese movements in the area. There is no sign that China is permanently occupying the 200 sq metre island and the coastguard is reported to have left. The White House said reports of China seizing the reef were \"deeply concerning if true\". In comments reported by theFinancial Times,James Hewitt, US National Security Council spokesperson, warned that \"actions like these threaten regional stability and violate international law\", adding that the White House was \"consulting closely with our own partners\". The Chinese move comes as US and Philippine forces are carrying out their annual war scenario drills - called the Balikatan exercises. China has criticised the drills as provocative. As many as 17,000 personnel are taking part in the coming days. Missiles from the US Marine Air Defense Integrated System were fired off the coast of the northern Philippines on Sunday, the system's second live fire test and its first deployment to the Philippines. The drills are also set to feature the US anti-ship missile system NMESIS. The Philippines military says the drills are a rehearsal for national defence but insists they are not directed at any particular country. \"This type of training is absolutely invaluable to us,\" said Third Marine Littoral Regiment Officer John Lehane. The exercise has helped allay fears among some US allies that Donald Trump may upend the years-long military support it has provided in the region. On a visit to Manila last month, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said Washington was \"doubling down\" on its alliance with the country and was determined to \"re-establish deterrence\" against China. There have been wrangles over territory in the South China Sea for centuries, but tension has grown in recent years. China claims by far the largest portion of territory in an area demarcated by its so-called \"nine-dash line\". The line comprises nine dashes which extends hundreds of miles south and east from its most southerly province of Hainan. Beijing has backed its expansive claims with island-building and naval patrols. Competing claimants such as Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei have staked claims on islands and various zones in the sea. Organisers of the festival where a car ramming attack killed 11 people say they are \"heartbroken\". The drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a \"severe infection\", her family says. Popes enjoy rockstar status in overwhelmingly Catholic Philippines. And yet, Pope Francis was special. She was one of the Philippines' biggest film stars with a career that spanned seven decades.

    "title": "Myanmar's army vowed a ceasefire after the earthquake. I saw them break it repeatedly",
    "article_text": "Days after a 7.7-magnitude earthquake shook Myanmar at the end of March, killing at least 3,700 people, the country's ruling junta agreed to a halt in its devastating military campaign. It then violated that ceasefire, again and again. I went inside rebel-held territory in the eastern Karenni state for 10 days from mid-April. I witnessed daily violations by the junta, including rocket and mortar attacks which killed and injured civilians and resistance fighters. One of those was Khala, a 45-year-old father killed in a strike by military warplanes, in a place his wife Mala said should have been safe. When the ceasefire was announced, on 2 April, Mala and Khala sensed an opportunity to return to their home for the first time in years. With their four-year-old child, they headed from the camp where they'd taken refuge to their village, Pekin Coco. They found it abandoned, with buildings shattered from drawn-out fighting. Almost everyone there had moved to farmland further away from the junta's weapons. But as the young family was about to leave Pekin Coco again, their car loaded with their possessions, the shelling started. \"We were all at the front of the house. Then, shells landed near us. We hid at the back of the house. But he [Khala] stayed where he was,\" said Mala. \"The artillery shell landed and exploded near him. He died in the place where he thought he was safe. \"He was a good man,\" she said and began to cry. Later that afternoon, the junta's warplanes attacked a house on the same street, killing four more men. \"I hate them,\" Mala said. \"They always attack people without reason. I don't feel safe here. Jet fighters are flying over the sky often but there is no place to hide.\" Mala is 31 and seven months pregnant. When we spoke she was back in a displaced people's camp, grieving. Her son Zoe, missing his father, wouldn't leave her side. Before the earthquake, Myanmar was in the midst of a nationwide civil war. After decades of military rule and brutal repression, ethnic groups, along with a new army of young insurgents, brought the dictatorship to crisis point. As much as two-thirds of the country has fallen to the resistance. Tens of thousands of people have been killed, including many children, since the military seized power in a coup in 2021. The UN says the earthquake has pushed a further two million people into need, some 2.5 million were already displaced before the quake. Karenni, or Kayah, state is far from the earthquake's epicentre. Its remoteness is both a blessing and a curse. Its thick jungle provides cover for those who oppose military rule, but it is difficult to get around, the roads are poor and main highways remain in range of the army's guns. Most of the state is now controlled by rebel and armed ethnic groups. On 28 March when the quake hit, there were no reported deaths in Karenni - but the hospitals still filled quickly with people suffering spinal and crush injuries. A 30m (100ft) sinkhole had appeared in the forests around the town of Demoso. Locals who heard the ground open up thought it was another air strike. For many weeks, the sinkhole continued to expand with the aftershocks. The UN noted that the Myanmar military continued operations after the earthquake and beyond the ceasefire, and called for them to end. The State Administration Council, the ruling junta, has not commented on the alleged violations but has claimed that it was attacked by resistance groups. During the ceasefire all sides in the conflict have reserved the right to respond if attacked. During my 10 days in Mobeye, Karenni, I witnessed daily attacks by the junta. I met Stefano there, a 23-year-old fighting the military dictatorship with the Karenni Nationalities Defence Force (KNDF). He leads a platoon of young fighters who have set up trenches around the base. From a dugout just 100m (330ft) from the junta's positions, he explained the army had continued attacks \"using all means\" during the ceasefire - soldiers on the ground, drones and jets. \"They usually attack with drones and heavy artillery on this side. When it rains, they advance by taking advantage of the weather.\" He called the ceasefire a \"joke\". \"We did not believe the military council from the beginning. We don't believe it now, and we won't believe it in the future.\" The day after we spoke, the military launched a full-scale assault with heavy weapons and men, attacking rebel lines. As we made our way to the front lines, small-arms fire could be heard nearby, along with mortar strikes. The ground was pitted with fresh hits from armed drones. Nearby lay the corpse of a junta fighter who had tried to breach the rebel positions. The resistance forces say they have suspended all offensive activities during the ceasefire, but they have said they will respond if attacked. Yi Shui, the commander of another resistance group, the Karenni National Army, showed me pictures on his phone. \"When we saw them, we shot them. One of them got hit\" and another ran away, he said. And again, the military wasn't just targeting the resistance forces. Its rockets hit farmland beyond, killing a 60-year-old woman. We arrived at fields where four rockets had landed, children were playing with the bent metal and shrapnel from the strikes. The injured were taken to local hospitals, which are hidden deep in the jungle to avoid air strikes from junta warplanes. In one, a young fighter was being treated in a wooden ward with a dirt floor. He had a shrapnel wound to his shoulder and was losing a lot of blood. The doctor in charge, 32-year-old Thi Ha Tun, said he'd treated around a dozen patients for war-related injuries since the ceasefire was declared. Two of the patients, resistance fighters, died. He dismissed what he called the junta's lies. \"They only care about their own interests,\" he said. \"They will only care about their own organisation. They will not care about the rest of this country, their own generation, the youth, the children, the elderly, anything.\" The only solution is to keep fighting, he said. High on a hilltop in the rebel-controlled areas is the church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The earthquake brought down the church steeple and part of the roof. The bell from Rome now sits in a temporary cradle. Repairs have been made, but the church will probably need to be rebuilt. They are still feeling the aftershocks here weeks later. But for Father Philip, the local priest, the greatest threat to his congregation, many of whom are the war displaced, comes from above, not below. \"No place is safe. When we have jet fighters flying in the sky… you never know what will come falling from the sky.\" Back at the Mobeye front, Stefano and his men pass the hours between attacks, cleaning their weapons and singing songs. \"I can hear the people's prayers, cries, and cries. We will overthrow the dictatorship,\" they sing in unison. They say the only ceasefire they will trust will come with the junta's defeat. The truce will finish at the end of the month, but for most of the people here, it's as if it never existed at all. It comes just days after Russia's Valery Gerasimov praised the \"heroism\" of North Korean troops. After a deadly militant attack in Kashmir, India suspended a key water treaty with neighbouring Pakistan. Two US institutions have been granted access to samples collected by the Chang'e-5 mission in 2020. Nearly 80 students across two high schools fell sick after eating the meals this week. It comes after Delhi's retaliatory measures following a militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir that killed 26 tourists.",

    "title": "Mourning turns to anger in Iran after massive port explosion kills 40",
    "article_text": "In Iran, mourning is turning to anger after a huge blast at its largest commercial port killed at least 40 people and injured more than 1,000. The explosion happened on Saturday morning at Shahid Rajaee port. Many people rushed to hospitals up and down the country to give blood. A day later, fires are still blazing as a thick black cloud of toxic chemicals hangs over the surrounding area. People in nearby towns and cities have been told by the health ministry to stay indoors \"until further notice\" and wear more protective clothes. In the nearby southern city of Bandar Abbas, home to the Iranian Navy's main base, all schools and offices were ordered to shut on Sunday to allow authorities to focus on the emergency effort, state TV said. A local festival not far from Shahid Rajee Port that was supposed to be a celebration spontaneously turned into a solemn occasion for remembering the dead and praying for the injured. Authorities declared a day of national mourning on Monday, with an additional two days of mourning in Hormozgan province. It is a reminder that while Iran has been rocked physically by the blast -residents up to 50km (31 miles) away reported feeling the effects- the country is now being rocked by a growing blame game too. Ambrey Intelligence, a private maritime risk consultancy, said it believed that intense fires that could be seen spreading between containers before the explosion were a result of \"improper handling of a shipment of solid fuel intended for use in Iranian ballistic missiles\". The firm said it believed the affected containers had contained solid fuel destined for ballistic missiles, and was aware that an Iran-flagged ship \"discharged a shipment of sodium perchlorate rocket fuel at the port in March 2025\". The New York Times quoted a person with ties to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, speaking on condition of anonymity, as saying that what exploded was sodium perchlorate - a major ingredient in solid fuel for missiles. Some Iranians are asking whether they should believe speculation on social media which said Iran's military and Revolutionary Guard were storing rocket fuel that they had recently imported from China at the port – a claim which has been denied by an army spokesman. Many in Iran are blaming the authorities for incompetence and worse, asking: How could so much inflammable material apparently be left on the port without due care? That is a question that the Iranian regime will need to address. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian visited the scene of the explosion on Sunday, saying: \"We have come to see first-hand if there is anything or any issue that the government can follow up on.\" Pezeshkian had previously ordered an investigation into the cause of the blast, sending the interior minister to the region to lead it. Defence ministry spokesman Reza Talaei-Nik later told state TV that \"there has been no imported or exported cargo for military fuel or military use in the area\". The port's customs office said in a statement carried by state television that the explosion probably resulted from a fire that broke out at the hazardous and chemical materials' storage depot. There is also the question of whether Iran's economy may be affected, given the port handles nearly 80% of the country's imports. On Saturday, authorities were warning of possible food shortages in the near term with the port out of action for some time. A day later, they were playing that down, saying that the explosion only affected a part of the port and that the rest is functioning normally. An image from Iran's Tasnim news agency on Sunday showed a helicopter flying through a sky blackened by smoke to drop water on the disaster-struck area, AFP reported. Others showed firefighters working among toppled and blackened cargo containers, and carrying out the body of a victim. The authorities have closed off roads leading to the site. The Kremlin said Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered that multiple specialist firefighting aircraft be sent to Iran to help deal with the aftermath of the disaster. Beijing's foreign ministry said in a statement to AFP on Sunday that three Chinese victims were in a \"stable\" condition and that it had received no further reports of casualties. Among the condolences being sent were from the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, India, Turkey, the United Nations and Russia. The explosion ripped through the port as Iranian and US delegations were meeting via mediators in Oman for high-level talks on Tehran's nuclear programme, with both sides reporting progress. Iran has said it is open to curbs on its nuclear programme in return for sanctions easing but has insisted it will not stop enriching uranium. It insists its nuclear programme is for civilian use. At least four people have been killed and 500 more injured in Bandar Abbas. Iranian and US officials agree to continue with a third round of high-stakes talks on a new nuclear deal. The highest-level talks between the two nations since Trump's first term in office will resume next week. Donald Trump has suggested Iran could face military action if it does not agree to a new nuclear deal. The BBC's James Landale looks at how Iran might respond to Trump's threat to agree to a deal or face military action",

    "title": "First images released of Pope Francis' tomb adorned with single rose",
    "article_text": "Images of Pope Francis's tomb at the Santa Maria Maggiore church in Rome have been released. A single white rose was pictured lying on the stone tomb that bears the name he was known by during his pontificate, below a crucifix illuminated by a single spotlight. The late pope was laid to rest at the church - one of four major basilicas in the Italian capital, and one he would regularly visit during his time as cardinal and pontiff - in a private ceremony following his public funeral in the Vatican on Saturday. Thousands of mourners have been filing past the tomb since the church opened to the public on Sunday morning to pay their respects to Pope Francis, who died aged 88 on Monday. Among them was Rosario Correale, an Italian, who said it was \"very emotional\" seeing the tomb. \"He really left a mark on us,\" he told the Associated Press. Polish pilgrim Maria Brzezinska felt the resting place befit the man. \"I feel like it's exactly in the way of the Pope. He was simple, and so is his place now,\" she told the news agency Reuters after visiting. Francis was particularly devoted to the Virgin Mary, and Santa Maria Maggiore was the first church to be dedicated to her when it was built in the 4th Century. The basilica sits near the Colosseum, a stone's throw from the city's endlessly bustling and chaotic central Termini station - well beyond the limits of the Vatican, where popes are traditionally entombed. But it was one the South American pontiff had a long-held affinity for. Its senior priest previously told an Italian newspaper that Pope Francis had said he wished to be laid to rest there in 2022, citing inspiration from the Virgin Mary. \"I thought it was amazing that he wanted to be buried here in this basilica,\" Amaya Morris, another pilgrim, told AP. \"Out of all of the [churches], he chose this one. So I thought that was really amazing. It's really humbling to be able to be here.\" Francis's funeral was attended by heads of state, heads of government and monarchs from around the world - as well ashundreds of thousands of Catholics who lined the streetsleading to the Vatican to pay their respects. Hymns played out on giant speakers, occasionally drowned out by the sound of helicopters flying overhead, before 91-year-old Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re gave a homily on the pope's legacy. The cardinal emphasised that Pope Francis had repeatedly urged the world to \"build bridges, not walls\". The funeral was also the venue fora meeting between US President Donald Trump and Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky, which the latter said afterwards had the \"potential to become historic\". Trump later questioned Russian President Vladimir Putin's willingness to end the now three-year war in Ukraine, a conflict which Pope Francis had regularly called for peace during his papacy. Following the public funeral, Pope Francis's coffin was carried through Rome in a slow procession. Authorities said 140,000 people had lined the streets, clapping and waving as the hearse - a repurposed white popemobile - crossed the Tiber river and drove past some of Rome's most recognisable sights: the Colosseum, the Forum and the Altare della Patria national monument on Piazza Venezia. After a period of mourning, attention will soon turn to the selection of the next pope. A date has not yet been set but it is thought it could start as early as 5 or 6 May, with 135 cardinals set to attend, making it the largest conclave in modern history. The Vatican's representative to South Sudan says the Pope's memory should be honoured by seeking peace. The BBC's religion editor Aleem Maqbool explains why it's so difficult to guess who will be the next pontiff. Michelle O'Neill said the late Pope was a \"man of humility\". Many world leaders and royals have gathered among mourners at the Vatican - here are the pictures of them there. World leaders and royalty joined 400,000 people for the funeral mass and procession.",

    "title": "Drag Race and Pose star Jiggly Caliente dies aged 44",
    "article_text": "Drag star Bianca Castro-Arabejo, who performed as Jiggly Caliente, has died aged 44, her family has said. The performer, who found fame on the fourth season of RuPaul's Drag Race, had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after suffering a \"severe infection\". Caliente had served as a judge on the show's Philippines spin-off, and also appeared in the hit US TV series Pose. Her family wrote in a statement on Instagram: \"It is with profound sorrow that we announce the passing of Bianca Castro-Arabejo, known to the world and cherished by many as Jiggly Caliente.\" They said she died in the early hours of Sunday morning \"surrounded by her loving family and close friends\". Caliente's family paid tribute to her \"infectious energy, fierce wit, and unwavering authenticity\", adding that she left a legacy of \"love, courage and light\". \"She touched countless lives through her artistry, activism, and the genuine connection she fostered with fans around the world,\" they said. \"Though her physical presence is gone, the joy she shared and the space she helped create for so many will remain forever.\" Fellow drag queens have left tributes to the Filipino-American performer online. Laganja Estranja, who appeared on the sixth season of the US reality TV programme, said Caliente was a \"kind, caring soul\". RuPaul's Drag Race UK star Baga Chipz described Caliente as \"one of the kindest, sweetest souls I've ever met\". Cheryl The Queen, who also competed in the UK version of the show, wrote: \"We will love you forever and always Jiggly.\" Tia Kofi, who won Drag Race UK versus the World, said Caliente was \"someone I came to for advice, I looked up to, who gave me support when it was most needed and, I cannot lie, was always there for a good gossip!\" Drag Race judge Michelle Visage in her tribute said \"the laughter was endless, our talks were special, your energy was contagious\". \"You were and remain so very loved. This world has lost an angel and we want you to soar high,\" she added. Born in the Philippines in 1980, Caliente moved to the Queens neighbourhood of New York City with her family when she was a child. She quickly became a fan favourite on RuPaul's Drag Race for her sense of humour and memorable interactions with other queens, when she appeared on the show in 2012. In one particularly memorable moment, while arguing with Caliente, fellow contestant Lashauwn Beyond coined the catchphrase \"this is not RuPaul's Best Friend Race\", which has been frequently repeated in later series. Caliente went on to embark on an acting career, appearing in episodes of sitcoms Broad City and Search Party. She played the role of Veronica in the TV drama Pose, which chronicled New York's LGBT ball culture in the 1980s and 90s. Caliente, who publicly came out as transgender in 2016, later returned to the Drag Race universe, competing in the sixth series of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars in 2021 and judging the spin-off show Drag Race Philippines for three series. Prior to her death, the drag performer's family had said on Thursday that she had suffered a \"serious health setback\" which led to the loss of \"most of her right leg\". The latest comments by the US president come despite Kyiv repeatedly rejecting ceding the peninsula. The impact of what President Trump has done so far is being felt in every corner of American life. The Philippines, which disputes China's claim to the sandbank, responds by releasing a photo of its own forces on another. Organisers of the festival where a car ramming attack killed 11 people say they are \"heartbroken\". Jens-Frederick Nielsen says the island must \"stand together\" with Denmark during a highly symbolic visit to Copenhagen.",

    "title": "The beauty and challenge of elections in Canada's frigid north",
    "article_text": "Nunavut is Canada's largest federal district. The entire territory - all 1.8 million sq km (695,000 sq miles) and its 40,000 people - will be represented by one person in parliament. \"Nunavut is at least three times the size of France. If it was its own country, it would be the 13th largest behind Greenland,\" Kathy Kettler, the campaign manager for local Liberal candidate Kilikvak Kabloona, told the BBC. Located in the Arctic, where average temperatures in the capital city Iqaluit are below freezing for eight months of the year, it is so vast and inaccessible that the only way to travel between its 25 communities is by air. \"Yesterday, in 24 hours, we travelled 1,700 km (1,050 miles) by air and campaigned in Pangnirtung, Iqaluit, Rankin Inlet, and Arviat,\" said  Ms Kettler. \"There are not very many people who understand the reality of the north,\" Ms  Kettler said, describing the challenges of running a campaign where so much is different from southern Canada. She recalled knocking on doors earlier this month as she campaigned for her candidate in -24C (-11F) temperatures. She said it's rare in northern communities for people to knock before entering someone's home. Instead, the tight-knit culture permits visitors to simply \"walk in and say hello\" - almost unthinkable in other parts of the country. As an Inuk from northern Quebec, she said it \"feels weird\" even for her to knock and wait for a response. In Nunavut, one of Canada's three northern territories, the majority-Inuit population speak Inuktitut. Ms Kettler said one of the biggest expenses was translating campaign signs and hiring an interpreter for Kabloona, the candidate. Election issues for northerners too are unique. \"The national campaign is really focused on Arctic security and sovereignty, whereas our campaign here is focused on food security and people being able to survive,\" Ms Kettler said. Food can be prohibitively expensive and there are infrastructure challenges to accessing clean water for a number of Indigenous and northern communities. She was boiling water to drink while campaigning in Arviat, she said, and described being unable to rely on calling voters as she canvasses because a phone plan is the first thing they sacrifice to afford food. The seat is currently held by the New Democratic Party (NDP), with incumbent Lori Idlout running for re-election. James Arreak is the Conservative candidate. Jean-Claude Nguyen, the returning officer in Nunavut, is responsible for conducting the election in the district. He described how difficult it is to ensure ballots and voter lists get to every community - including to workers at remote gold mines. \"[Elections Canada] sent a team from our Ottawa headquarters via Edmonton and Yellowknife to the mine where they work, gave them sufficient time to vote, and then they brought the ballots back,\" he said. Mr Nguyen also spoke about security considerations. Once polls close, the ballots are counted at the polling station and then stored safely either with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), or a local hamlet - a small community that provides municipal services to its residents. The ballot boxes are then flown to Iqaluit, and then to Ottawa. Mr Nguyen recalled how in the 2019 election, a ballot box arrived with a big hole. \"When we asked the charter flight company what happened, they said it was eaten by a raven,\" he said laughing. \"That's part of the reality here in the territories, you have wild animals eating the ballot boxes.\" No ballots were damaged by the bird. Beyond all the challenges, Kathy Kettler said she is most drawn to the spirit of the people. \"The generosity, love, and care that people have for each other in every community shines through,\" she said. \"That's what keeps me going, and it's what makes campaigning across Nunavut so meaningful.\" Kai-Ji Adam Lo, a 30-year-old resident of the city, is charged with several counts of second degree murder. A resident of the city has been charged with murder and work to identify victims is ongoing. Canada is holding a national election amid growing tension with the US over trade and tariffs. The first ethnic minority politician to lead a major federal party in Canada faces an uphill battle in the 2025 election. Blanchet has led Quebec's sovereigntist party since 2019, after spending time in provincial politics.",

    "title": "'Grandpa robbers' held Kim Kardashian at gunpoint - but didn't know who she was",
    "article_text": "The morning after the heist, burglar Yunice Abbas went home to catch up on some sleep. When he woke up, his wife was glued to the TV. The headline news of the day was that American reality TV star Kim Kardashian, 35, had been tied up and robbed at gunpoint in a luxury Paris apartment. All her jewellery had been taken for a sum of about $10m (£7.5m) – including the engagement ring her then-husband and rapper Kanye West gifted her, which alone was worth $4m (£3m). Yunice Abbas' wife glared at him. \"This has you written all over it,\" she grumbled. She was right. The 62-year-old had dabbled in crime his whole life, from petty offences to bank heists. The Kardashian robbery, he later wrote in a memoir, was going to be his last job before retirement. But a series of blunders meant the heist was doomed from the start and in early 2017 - three months after the robbery - Abbas and several of his alleged accomplices were arrested. Ten of them will now be appearing in court in Paris in a trial set to last just under three weeks. Out of those, five are accused of taking part in the heist, and six are accused of being accessories to the crime. Most of them were born in the 1950s, leading French media to dub them the \"grandpa robbers\". Abbas and a 68-year-old man, Aomar Ait Khedache, have confessed; the others have not. One has since passed away, and another, aged 81, will be excused as he is suffering from advanced dementia. By the time the trial starts, almost nine years will have gone by since the heist. On the night between 2 and 3 October 2016, Abbas and four accomplices allegedly staked out Kardashian's discreet suite in Hotel de Pourtalès, in the glitzy Madeleine neighbourhood in Paris, not far from the Opéra and Place Vendome. At around 03:00 local time, they burst into the hotel's entrance hall, dressed as policemen and wielding a gun. They threatened and handcuffed Abderrahmane Ouatiki, an Algerian PhD student who regularly took up shifts as night receptionist, and marched him up to Kardashian's room. She was resting on her bed, tired from days of attending Paris Fashion Week events, when she heard stomping up the stairs. She called out for her sister Kourtney and her stylist Stephanie, but when they didn't answer she panicked. \"I knew someone was there to get me,\" she recalled in an interview with US interviewer David Letterman years later. \"You just feel it.\" Kim dialled 911 but the number, of course, didn't work outside of the US. As she was calling her then-security guard Pascal Duvier - who had accompanied her sister to a club - the men burst in, pushed her on the bed and started shouting. \"They kept on saying: the ring, the ring! And I was so startled that it didn't compute for a minute,\" she told Letterman. The language barrier meant Ouatiki had to act as an interpreter. They grabbed the ring and several other jewels, as well as 1000 euros in cash. One of the men grabbed her and pulled her towards him. Because she was wearing a robe with nothing underneath, she thought he was going to assault her, Kim later told Letterman, wiping tears away. But instead – using the technique of saucissonnage, or the practice of tying them up like a saucisson, a salami - the man bound her with zip ties and duct tape, and left her in the bathroom. Then, he and the rest of the burglars fled on bikes and on foot. Kim freed herself of her restraints, and shortly after her security guard turned up. Traumatised, Kim gave a statement to French police in the early hours of the morning and flew back to the US by dawn. It wasn't until the next morning, when Abbas caught a glimpse of the TV screen his wife was watching, that he understood who their victim was. \"There were breaking news alerts saying Kim Kardashian had been robbed at gunpoint – that's how important it was,\" says LA-based entertainment journalist KJ Matthews. \"We were so fascinated with her and her family and their rise to fame... When the heist happened we were so surprised. How could burglars have gotten so close to her?\" Matthews says. But while mistakes were made in terms of Kardashian's security, serious errors were made on the burglars' side, too. \"They didn't take into account the progress made by police techniques, which can now find micro traces of DNA anywhere,\" said Patricia Tourancheau, a crime reporter and the author of \"Kim and the grandpa robbers\" - a thorough account of the heist and of the lives of its perpetrators. \"When they dressed up as police they thought 'that's it, nobody will be able to recognise us',\" she adds. But in 2016 Paris was still reeling from the terrorist attacks of the previous year, and there were a huge number of CCTV cameras all round the city, meaning police were able to spot the thieves and see them make off with the jewels. Other details of this story suggest that the thieves' planning was rather haphazard. When fleeing the scene on a bike, Abbas fell, dropping a bag of jewels. The next day, a passer-by found a diamond-encrusted necklace and wore it all day at the office before watching the news and realising where it had come from. Police arrested Abbas and several other people in January 2017 and later confirmed that they had been under surveillance for several weeks, after DNA traces left at the scene provided a match with Aomar Ait Khedache, also known as \"Omar the Old\". French media published a photo from the police stakeout, which shows several of the men having coffee and chatting at a Parisian café that winter, just before their arrest. The question that remains - and which will undoubtedly be explored doing the trial - is just how the gang got wind of Kardashian's schedule. Court documents seen by the BBC show that both Khedache and Abbas stated that all the information they needed was posted online by Kardashian herself, whose very career was built on sharing details about her life and movements. But how did the gang know that on the night of 2 October Kardashian would be alone in her room, without her security guard? Court documents indicate police believe Gary Madar, whose brother Michael's firm had provided transportation and taxis to the Kardashians for years, was an accessory to the heist and that he had fed information to the gang about Kim's whereabouts. Mr Madar was arrested in January 2017. His lawyer Arthur Vercken vehemently pushed back against the accusations, telling the BBC that \"since the start the case was built on assumptions, theses, theories - but no proof [of Madar's involvement] was ever found\". He added that although the Madar brothers exchanged texts about the Kardashians during Fashion Week it was just because they were \"bored\" and that when the heist took place Gary was asleep. Gary's brother, Michael, is not a defendant. \"Five men did this. You don't think one of them was keeping an eye on who was coming and going from her hotel?\" he said, suggesting that Mr Madar had only been arrested \"to prove that the French justice system works\". The trial will also attempt to determine where the jewels ended up. Police tracking of the gang's phones showed that soon after the heist Omar the Old travelled from Paris to Antwerp in Belgium, where 50% of the world's polished diamonds and 80% of rough diamonds are sold, according to the Diamond Investment Office. Many jewels were reportedly melted or broken up and sold. Abbas got 75,000 euro (£64,000); others far less. As for Kim Kardashian's engagement ring, Omar the Old said the gang was too scared to sell it on as it would be too easily traceable. It has never been found. Kim Kardashian was undoubtedly spooked by the event, which marked the start of her social media hiatus. In an episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, she tearfully recalled the night of the heist and said had been scared for her life; later she also said the robbery had made her a \"less materialistic person\". Soon after the incident her sister Khloe told The Ellen DeGeneres that, for safety reasons, the Kardashian family were making some changes to how freely they posted on social media. \"The biggest change was her security detail,\" KJ Matthews told the BBC. Patricia Tourancheau, the author of the book about the heist, said she was \"fascinated\" by the \"clash between these old-style burglars from the Parisian banlieue and this global social media star\". \"They fled on bikes and she flies around on private jets,\" she laughed. \"These are a group of elderly down-and-out thieves, they're always broke, they're forever involved in convoluted plans… and they're facing a huge celebrity and they don't even know who she is.\" The gang was not \"elite\" as it was suggested in the early days, she added. \"This isn't the creme de la creme of French banditry. They're a bit of a bunch of losers, really. They're the same kind of people who in the 60s and 70s would burglar banks or post offices and who then rebranded to drug trafficking and then moved on to jewels because it was easier,\" she said. Around mid-May, Kim will face the suspects for the first time in years when she takes the stand as a witness. Cameras are not allowed in French courts but her arrival to the tribunal on Ile de la Cité alone will inevitably spark the same media frenzy that has accompanied her for over a decade. In his memoir, Abbas expressed the hope the victim's status and the global resonance of the case would not influence judges unduly. However, he also said that on the last day of the trial he would bring a duffle bag with his belongings, ready to be sent to jail. \"The problem with the past,\" he wrote, \"is that it sticks with you as long as you live\". Eurostar says the delays were caused by an \"overhead power issue\" with several trains between Paris or Brussels and London affected. Matt Clayton ran the Brighton Marathon, walked to France and then completed the Paris Marathon. American visitors tell the BBC they're keeping quiet about their nationality abroad. A fire at a waste disposal centre caused smoke to rise above buildings in the French capital city. Matt Clayton will run the Brighton Marathon, walk to Paris, then run the French capital's event.",

From catwalk-ready looks to gory TV special effects, BBC Three'sGlow Uphas seen it all. The reality television show, hosted by model Leomie Anderson, sees aspiring make-up artists compete on various creative briefs and in challenges as they try to impress judges Dominic Skinner and Val Garland. I've had a sneak preview of the new series,which starts on Wednesday, and can tell you that the contestants are thrown in at the deep end from the start. Assignments include assisting on the set of HBO fantasy drama series House of The Dragon and working on a music video set with Nova Twins. Val told me the talent this series \"really takes makeup to another level\", and said people should \"expect the unexpected\". And there's a career-making prize awaiting the winner: a contract assisting some of the world's leading make-up artists. It's a big week for Marvel fans, withThunderbolts*landing in cinemas on Friday. First reactions on social media have been positive, with many praising actress Florence Pugh for her role as assassin Yelena Belova. Matt Neglia of Next Best Picturecalls it\"some of Marvel's darkest material to date\", adding: \"It very much belongs to Florence Pugh, who carries much of the dramatic weight of the movie on her back.\" Film writer Mia Pflüger also praised the 29-year-old,writing on Xthat \"the future of the new superhero generation is in good hands with her\". Pugh previously appeared as Yelena in 2021's Black Widow movie and the Disney+ series Hawkeye. In the new film, her character embarks on a dangerous mission to confront the darkest corners of her past, alongside a team comprising Bucky Barnes, Red Guardian, Ghost, Taskmaster and John Walker. What everyone really wants to know, however, is what the asterisk is all about... On Thursday, black comedy mystery sequelAnother Simple Favouris released on Prime Video. It sees Stephanie Smothers (played by Anna Kendrick) and Emily Nelson (Blake Lively) reunite on the island of Capri for Emily's extravagant wedding to a rich Italian businessman. So far, so good - but alongside the beautiful scenery and glamorous guests, murder and betrayal lie in wait. There have been months of speculation about a feud bubbling between the film's A-list co-stars but recently, the pair were seen posing and laughing together at the London screening, which went some way to dispelling the rumours. Lively, of Gossip Girl fame, is separately locked in a dispute with her former It Ends With Us co-star Justin Baldoni, with both sides denying allegations made in lawsuits they havefiled against each other.

Just don't tell Oklahoma singer-songwriterSamantha Crain, who's about to release her seventh album, Gumshoe. Full of bewildering beauty and life-affirming anthems, it was written over the last three years, as she unexpectedly fell in love. \"I spent much of my life as a lone wolf,\" she tells BBC News, \"so hyper-independent that it became a defining trait.\" \"But as I explored vulnerability and reciprocity in my relationships, I realised… we can change by the minute, and that's okay. \"In my ancestors' Choctaw language, there are no words for 'is' or 'are,' reflecting their belief that people, animals, and plants are not permanent or static. That's the biggest lesson of the past few years: I can be a lone wolf sometimes and still belong to a community.\" That realisation manifests in the lovestruck slacker rock of Dragonfly, and the finger-plucked Neptune Baby, with its refrain, \"I'm a boat, and you are the water\". Not that Crain's relationship was all plain sailing. Her new partner struggles with addiction, and a track called Melatonin finds her listing the items she brought them in rehab – \"mint choc-chip ice cream, cigarettes, a watch\". \"You got it bad, but you got me,\" she reassures. It's an album of stunning poetic clarity and emotion – typified by the title track, an old-time country-rock ballad inspired by her love of detective novels. \"The word 'Gumshoe' has been in every writing notebook since I was a teenager,\" she says. \"After watching The Maltese Falcon, I considered how detached detective characters are and imagined two loners finding love. \"Instantly, gumshoe came to mind—the perfect word for a song about unravelling the mystery of relationships.\" Voters pick Outkast and Cyndi Lauper for induction, but overlook Oasis, Mariah Carey and New Order. Video has emerged of a gig in 2023 appearing to show one band member saying: \"The only good Tory is a dead Tory.\" Ian Broudie and his band are raising money for seven hospitals across Sussex.

    "title": "Urgent care in England performing 'far worse' than pre-pandemic, think tank says",
    "article_text": "A leading health think tank says urgent and emergency care in England is performing \"far worse\" than before the pandemic. The Health Foundation argues that the NHS was \"in distress\" this winter with A&E waiting times reaching a record high. The group says it would be wrong just to blame relatively high levels of flu. The government is due to publish an urgent and emergency care plan soon. The Department for Health and Social Care said that hospitals were \"feeling the strain\" but that it was taking \"decisive action\" to prevent winter crises. The Health Foundation report on the recent winter says that the number of people waiting 12 hours or more in A&E after a decision to admit to a ward was the highest since modern records began. It topped 60,000 in January, or 11% of emergency admissions. The report says that a familiar problem remains as acute as ever – delays discharging patients from hospital who are fit to leave. This, it says, made bottlenecks worse in A&E and for ambulances trying to hand over patients and that delays for those handovers were worse than in previous winters. The authors acknowledge that flu cases in hospitals were higher than usual but no worse than in the winter of 2022-23 – though the number took longer to fall than in that year. Hospital patients with the winter vomiting bug norovirus were also more numerous than in many winters. But hospital admissions for the respiratory virus RSV were similar to previous winters, and Covid admissions remained relatively low. Overall emergency hospital admissions fell slightly compared to the previous winter, as did the number of people going into major A&E units. The authors argue that the NHS should be prepared for winters like this one and that blaming external factors such as winter bugs risked offering \"false comfort\" about the state of the health service. Tim Gardner, assistant director at the Health Foundation, said an annual winter crisis did not have to be inevitable and the analysis should be a \"wake up call to the government to focus on the underlying issues\". A Department for Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"Despite our actions to protect patients during the colder months, including vaccinating more people than last winter, we know hospitals are feeling the strain. \"Annual winter pressures should not automatically lead to an annual winter crisis.\" It says its \"decisive action\" included ending the junior doctors' strikes and rolling out the country's first RSV vaccine. The Royal College of Emergency Medicine said in response to the report there was a \"clear roadmap\" and that the urgent and emergency care plan and a 10-year plan for the NHS, which are both due soon, offered \"an unmissable opportunity to implement changes that are so desperately needed\". In a separate move the Department of Health and Social Care said a target for increasing the number of hospitals in England allowing patients to view appointments through the NHS app had been exceeded. The target was 85% by March and the outcome was 87%, up from 68% last July, it said. The department also said because more patients could get access to correspondence via the app, 12 million fewer letters had been sent since July. There were 1.5 million fewer missed appointments, it said. Ministers said this was helping cut waiting lists and saving taxpayers money. Ian Broudie and his band are raising money for seven hospitals across Sussex. Archive photos are released to mark the 60th anniversary since the hospital was officially opened. The garden at Pilgrim Hospital was created by United Lincolnshire Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust. A doctor describes witnesses as \"forgotten patients\" who may need support for emotional distress.

    "title": "UK to see warmest April weather in seven years",
    "article_text": "The temperature in southern England could hit 27C (81F) later this week making it the highest temperature recorded in April since 2018. Warmth and sunshine will develop widely across most areas of the UK as high pressure gradually builds. Lack of rainfall however, will again raise concerns about potential wildfires. The last time the temperature rose to 27C in April was in 2018 in Cambridge. Runners of the London and Manchester marathons will likely tell you that it was already warm on Sunday, with the those pounding the streets of the capital experiencing the fourth-warmest London Marathon in its history. The week begins with temperatures across England and Wales already hitting 19-24C, with much of Scotland and Northern Ireland around 16-19C under slightly cloudier conditions. Some patchy rain likely in north-west Scotland, too. However, as sunny skies develop more widely, the combination of strong sunshine and light winds will help temperatures to peak on either Wednesday or Thursday, and be the highest of the year so far in each of the four nations. 23C is the expected high in parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland, 25C in Wales and 27C in England. London, the Home Counties and Cambridgeshire are the areas expected to record the warmest of the conditions. With sea temperatures around the UK still relatively low at the moment, coastal areas where sea breezes develop will feel cooler, but UV levels will remain high. Whilst the upcoming spell of warmth is significant, with a number of areas seeing temperatures 10 degrees above what we'd usually expect, it is not technically going to be aheatwavein meteorological terms. For this, we would need to see at least three consecutive days at or above the \"heatwave threshold\" which varies depending on where you are in the UK. Do be prepared for high levels ofUV, as the sun is as strong this time of year as it is in August. If you're a hay fever sufferer, another feature of the warm and sunny weather will be an increase in pollen levels. While this will be the warmest weather of the year so far and the warmest since early September, April can bring big swings in temperature and it is not unusual to see this type of hot spell during spring. The highest April temperature ever recorded is 29.4C which was reached in London on 16 April 1949. As our climate continues to warm though, we expect this type of spring heat to occur more often. Recent analysis found that spring is thefastest-warming seasonin the United Kingdom. Warm and sunny spells in April are not unusual, but are likely to become more frequent as our climate warms Despite some occasional downpours, spring has been incredibly dry so far this year for a number of areas. In a large swathe of central southern England many have seen only around a fifth of the rainfall they would normally expect to receive since the start of March. For inland areas of North Yorkshire there has been close to a quarter of the normal rainfall which has had an impact on river levels. According to the latestrainfall and river flow summary,externalby the Environment Agency, river levels quite widely across the north-eastern quarter of England are classed as \"notably low\" or \"exceptionally low\". Dry and cracked ground in Nottinghamshire after below-average rainfall so far this spring The ongoing dry conditions also mean that fire services across the UK will be on high alert for further wildfires. A study of satellite data by the BBC shows that the area of the UK burnt by wildfires so far this year is already higher than the total for any year in more than a decade. Another potential drawback to the warm, sunny and calm conditions will be the build up of pollutants in the atmosphere. Defra and Met Officeair pollution forecasts,externalfor the week shows moderate pollution levels quite widely across the UK by Wednesday, especially for England and Wales. Area burned by UK wildfires in 2025 already at annual record The role of weather in air pollution With the May Bank Holiday on the horizon I think you may know the answer to this one. Later in the week, as high pressure gradually diminishes a shift in wind direction to the north or north-west will bring cooler air southwards for the start of the weekend. However, while temperatures will drop for all, they will still remain at or above average for the time of the year. At the moment, the start of the weekend looks dry, but there are hints that low pressure could bring showers and cooler conditions by the end of the long weekend. You can find out how the temperatures will vary where you are on the BBC Weather app or by catching up with the latestWeather for the Week Ahead. Jet stream explained.

    "article_text": "Footage of rap group Kneecap allegedly calling for the death of British MPs is being assessed by counter-terrorism police. A video has emerged of the west Belfast trio at a November 2023 gig appearing to show one person from the band saying: \"The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.\" The Metropolitan Police also said that another video, from November last year, is being assessed. The footage appeared to show a band member shouting \"up Hamas, up Hezbollah\" at a performance in London. Kneecap have said on social media that they have \"faced a co-ordinated smear campaign\". BothHamas and Hezbollahare banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them. A Met Police spokesperson said: \"We were made aware of a video on 22 April, believed to be from an event in November 2024, and it has been referred to the Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit (CTIRU) for assessment and to determine whether any further police investigation may be required. \"We have also been made aware of another video believed to be from an event in November 2023.\" A UK government spokesman said: \"We unequivocally condemn threatening remarks made towards any individual. \"Political intimidation and abuse must have no place in our society. We recognise the chilling effect that harassment and intimidation of elected representatives can have on our democracy. \"All reports of intimidation, harassment and threats are taken extremely seriously. We work with the police and Parliament to do everything in our power to crack down on threats to elected officials.\" Democratic Unionist Party leader Gavin Robinson called for Kneecap to be investigated. \"Promoting sectarianism, glorifying violence and spreading division under the guise of \"art\" is still hate,\" the Belfast East MP said in a post on X. None of the members of the group have been charged with any offences. The group has faced recent criticism after they displayed messages about the war in Gaza during their set at US music festival Coachella earlier this month. Following formerX Factor judge Sharon Osbourne calling for Kneecap's US work visasto be revoked, the band was dropped by its now-former sponsor and booking agent Independent Artist Group (IAG). The agency confirmed the split to The Hollywood Reporter. Kneecap hit back at the visa call, and when asked by BBC News NI for a response, the band replied: \"Statements aren't aggressive, murdering 20,000 children is though.\" The visas held by the band members are understood to no longer be valid and they are in the process of securing a new sponsor ahead of its sellout October tour in North America. Kneecap, made up of Liam Og Ó Hannaidh, Naoise Ó Caireallain and JJ Ó Dochartaigh, alleged on social media they have \"faced a co-ordinated smear campaign\", saying their shows have previously \"called out\" the conflict in Gaza. They also appeared to suggest they would be taking legal action against the \"malicious efforts\". Earlier in the week, Kneecap's manager Daniel Lambert said the band had received \"severe\" death threats after Coachella. Voters pick Outkast and Cyndi Lauper for induction, but overlook Oasis, Mariah Carey and New Order. The man, in his 20s, suffered injuries to his head, shoulder and foot in the crash in east Belfast.

    "title": "Fathers of Southport victims complete London marathon in tribute to daughters",
    "article_text": "The fathers of two girls killed in the Southport attack have completed the London Marathon in an emotional tribute to their daughters. Sergio Aguiar and David Stancombe entered the race to raise money for projects set up in their daughters' memory. Alice Aguiar, nine, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Bebe King, six, were killed last July at a Taylor Swift-themed dance workshop. The fathers received encouragement from Sir Keir Starmer on the morning of the race with Mr Aguiar telling the BBC it was \"good\" to have received his support. Mr Stancombe added: \"Even now it still blows me away that so many people know about it and you're getting messages from the prime minister.\" \"I would love people to know I've seen their message, but I have genuinely read so many of them. It's amazing,\" he added. Mr Aguiar finished the gruelling race on Sunday with a time of four hours and five minutes. Mr Stancombe finished in four hours and 28 minutes. Bebe's parents, Lauren and Ben King, went to London to cheerfrom the sidelines as Mr Aguiar and Mr Stancombe ran the 26.2 mile (42.2km) route. In the video message played to the families ahead of the race, Starmer said:\"David and Sergio, I want to wish you the very best of luck in the London Marathon this weekend. I know how much it means to you and your families. \"This is an incredible way to honour the memory of your precious daughters and the entire nation is in awe of your courage and your resilience. \"We'll all be with you every single step of the way. Good luck.\" Mr Stancombe was raising money for Elsie's Story, a charitable trust that makes grants to assist young people and support others in the Southport area. Elsie's mother, Jenni Stancombe, told BBC Breakfast the Prince and Princess of Wales had donated to Elsie's Story and sent the family a \"special message\" ahead of the race. Running alongside Mr Aguiar was Jinnie Payne, the headteacher of Churchtown Primary School, where Alice and Bebe were pupils. She said Prince William and Catherine made a donation to the Churchtown Playground fund for a new playground, including a performance stage and library, at the school. Mrs Payne said the school was \"deeply touched and encouraged by William's and Kate's support\". Runners from across the country tackle the 45th edition of the London Marathon. The protesters were arrested and the London Marathon continued uninterrupted across Tower Bridge. Ben Karthauser, 48, was diagnosed in 2021, and wants to break the world record for the category. Sunday's marathon will be the last of 12 which Laura Coleman-Day has run in a year. \"It's nice to set yourself a goal,\" says Katie Cartwright, who is running in the London Marathon.",

    "title": "Qatar claims slight progress towards ceasefire in Gaza",
    "article_text": "Qatar's prime minister says there has been \"a bit of progress\" in efforts to broker a new ceasefire in Gaza between Israel and Hamas, but that there was still no \"answer for the ultimate question: how to end this war\". It follows his meeting with the head of Israel's spy agency on Thursday. Speaking in Doha, Turkey's foreign minister Hakan Fidan said that Hamas appeared to be more receptive to negotiating a lasting solution to the war. After rejecting Israel's latest ceasefire offer more than a week ago, Hamas now seems set on an agreement that would see the release of all the remaining hostages as part of a deal to end hostilities for at least five years. Hamas has suggested it could consider disarming as part of such a tradeoff, but only if Israel were to pull all its forces out of Gaza. The Israeli government appears to have no intention of doing this. Israel imposed a complete blockade on Gaza in early March and resumed air and ground attacks later in the month. The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry says 2,151 Palestinians have been killed since then, including 51 in the 24 hours into Sunday morning. Fighting between Hamas and Israel has also intensified, with the Israeli military saying an Israeli soldier and a police officer were killed on Friday. On Thursday, Israel's Mossad spy agency chief David Barnea met with Qatari PM Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani in Doha. Sheik Mohammed said that there had been \"a bit of progress compared to other meetings, yet we need to find an answer for the ultimate question: how to end this war\". Last week,Hamas rejected an Israeli proposalfor a 45-day ceasefire that called for the group's complete disarmament and the release of 10 of the 59 remaining hostages. Sheikh Mohammed said that they were \"trying to find a breakthrough\" but added that Israel and Hamas remained at odds on what a ceasefire would entail. He said Hamas has agreed to hand over all the remaining hostages in an exchange to an end to the war, but that Israel wants the hostages released without offering a vision on an end to the conflict. \"When you don't have a common objective, a common goal, between the parties, I believe the opportunities [to end the war] become very thin,\" Sheik Mohammed said at a press conference in Doha. A Hamas delegation held talks with Egyptian officials in Cairo on Saturday which reportedly focused on a ceasefire agreement and addressing the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. A Palestinian official familiar with negotiations told the BBC that Hamas has signalled its readiness to hand over governance of Gaza to any Palestinian entity agreed upon \"at the national and regional level\". The official said this could be the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority (PA) or a newly formed administrative body. The US has also encouraged the idea of a reformed PA governing Gaza after the war. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has ruled out any role for the PA in Gaza and has said he opposes the formation of a Palestinian state. On Saturday, PA President Mahmoud Abbas named close confidant Hussein al-Sheikh as his deputy in the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), the PLO said. Abbas, 89, has led the PLO and PA since 2004 but has previously resisted internal reforms, including naming a successor. The PA's leadership has regularly insisted it is ready to take over running post-war Gaza. But it has been criticised by Palestinians for not speaking out enough or taking effective action. In a fiery speech during a meeting of the Palestinian Central Council in Ramallah on Wednesday, Abbas lashed out at Hamas,calling the group \"sons of dogs\"and demanding they release the hostages, disarm and hand over control of Gaza. Hamas and Abbas's Fatah organisation, which dominates the PA, have been bitterly divided for decades, with their rift ensuring that no unified Palestinian leadership in both the West Bank and Gaza has been able to emerge. On Sunday, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza announced that the deal toll from the war had risen to at least 52,243 people, after taking account of hundreds of individuals listed as missing whose deaths have now been confirmed. \"An additional 697 martyrs have been added to the cumulative statistics after their data was completed and verified by the committee monitoring missing persons,\" the health ministry said. The ministry had earlier denied that it hadmanipulated death toll figures after media reports highlighted anomaliesbetween the August and October 2024 and March 2025 lists of fatalities. Last week the UN World Food Programme haswarned that all of its food stocks in Gaza have run outas a result of the Israeli blockade. The UN says Israel is obliged under international law to ensure supplies for the 2.1 million Palestinians in Gaza. Israel says it is complying with international law and there is no aid shortage. During the press conference in Doha, Sheikh Mohammed condemned what he described as Israel's \"starvation\" policy. The war began on 7 October 2023 when Hamas carried out a cross-border attack, killing around 1,200 people and seizing 251 hostages according to Israeli tallies. Israel's military campaign in response has killed tens of thousands in Gaza and turned most of the strip to rubble. Israel said it hit a Hezbollah missile store. The Lebanese presidency urged the US and France to press Israel to cease its attacks. Twenty-one people are reportedly killed in two separate strikes in the northern town of Jabalia. The mineral, once widely-used, releases toxic fibres into the air when disturbed that can cling to the lungs and cause cancer. Holocaust survivors were part of the crowds taking part in the annual 'March of the Living', 80 years after the camp was liberated. Gazan civilians are losing their fear of Hamas, openly criticising the group on the streets and online.",

    "title": "'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny'",
    "article_text": "Liverpool's players celebrate clinching the Premier League title Liverpool's long wait ended as the giant red and white clock in the corner of the Kop flicked over to 18:24 BST on the day that was Anfield's destiny. The small detail wasTottenham Hotspur had been swept aside. The big picture was Liverpool were now officially Premier League champions and, with great significance, had equalled Manchester United's total of 20 titles. As Liverpool's team coach emerged from plumes of red smoke blowing towards the stadium on Anfield Road, the smell of sulphur and cordite hanging heavy in the air, the banners and scarves read: \"The Most Successful Club In England.\" This was a moment 35 years in the making. Liverpool could celebrate a title win with their own vast support, in their own stadium, in front of the Kop. They had last experienced this sort of elation when Sir Kenny Dalglish, who was watching from the directors' box, led Liverpool to victory over Queens Park Rangers on 28 April 1990. Jurgen Klopp led them to the Premier League title in 2020, but the celebrations were played out in the genteel surroundings of Formby Golf Club, and the trophy lift in front of invited family and friends at a deserted Anfield amid the Covid-19 pandemic. This explained the release of emotion at the final whistle, which had been building up hours before kick-off. It was finally unleashed in a wall of sound - fireworks exploded behind the Kop, another fog of red smoke swept around Anfield accompanied by an outpouring of tears from players and fans alike. At the heart of it all was head coach Arne Slot, the modest Dutchman who has made the so-called impossible task of succeeding Jurgen Klopp look so easy. It had been 343 days since Klopp said his Anfield farewell, attempting to ease the air of uncertainty about his departure swirling around Liverpool by singing a song in honour of his soon-to-be-anointed successor. The tune echoed around Anfield throughout this 5-1 win, and Slot delivered his own version in tribute to Klopp as ecstasy unfolded around him. \"To replace Jurgen is a big job and the manager did it in his own way and deserves a lot of credit,\" said captain Virgil van Dijk. \"I don't think anyone from the outside world thought we would be Premier League champions.\" Slot thanks Klopp moments after Liverpool win title 20 of the best photos from Liverpool's momentous day 'No-one expected this' - how Slot guided Liverpool to the title Hours before the storm started there was little calm around Anfield. The entire area was a sea of red from mid-morning - thousands of supporters waited in long lines to be among the first into the stadium, the usual watering holes were packed and Anfield Road was jammed with fans as far as the eye could see. Liverpool owner John W. Henry made one of his rare Anfield visits for the coronation, while tickets were reportedly selling at Â£3,000 on the black market. Neil Atkinson from the Anfield Wrap told BBC Radio 5 Live he felt like he was on his way to his wedding. Abigail Rudkin, also from the Anfield Wrap, likened the excitement to Christmas morning. \"Just to get to be with everyone, for all of us to get to be here and sit together, it does make the difference,\" she said. \"You can say to yourself 'just win it', but for us fans all of us being together, for the players to be there with us, to be at Anfield - that's what it's all about.\" This video can not be played Gravenberch best midfielder in the Premier League this season - Murphy In reality, this win against a submissive Spurs was simply a step on the road from Anfield's anticipation to the glorious realisation that the prize was theirs. Once Liverpool had applied the correction to Dominic Solanke's shock early goal, it was party time - no better illustrated than when Mohamed Salah celebrated his goal, Liverpool's fourth, by taking a phone to snap the selfie of a lifetime with the Kop as his backdrop. Liverpool fans belted out the old title-winning songbook as they watched their triumphant team rip Spurs apart. Watching intently from the sidelines was Slot, who has brought a more measured approach to the thrilling chaos of Klopp's Liverpool without removing any of the potency. He has not simply been the beneficiary of the outstanding squad he inherited, he has added value with his tactical acumen. Slot was uncharacteristically agitated at times, focusing on the unfolding events in front of him rather than acknowledging the constant demands from the Kop for recognition. He waited until the board for four extra minutes went up before blowing kisses to his family in the stand and applauding the fans. It was then time for a congratulatory embrace with opposite number Ange Postecoglou before he gathered his trusted backroom staff around him. When the celebrations started on the pitch, Liverpool's players ran wildly towards the Kop before Slot donned the red shirt and gave them the Klopp-style fist pumps they have wanted for eight months. Individual players were called forward to take their bow. Trent Alexander-Arnold's future may be in doubt among links to Real Madrid, but on Sunday Liverpool were the centre of his world. The future, for now, can wait. Slot, the architect of this triumph, told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"Looking back I have enjoyed the whole day. You could see looking in their eyes how much it meant to them. It was impossible to us to not get that point or win today. \"What else is there to say? It is unbelievable.

I don't think I want to say a lot. The only thing now is to send my appreciation to Jurgen Klopp,\" Slot, who replaced Klopp as Liverpool manager last summer, told LFCTV. The 46-year-old immediately launched into a rendition of the song Klopp asked Liverpool fans to sing after his final game last May, but replaced the lyrics 'Arne Slot' with 'Jurgen Klopp'. \"I am 99.9% sure that if I pick up my phone there will be a message from Jurgen,\" he told BBC Match of the Day. \"So many moments in the season the two of us have had contact.

But I don't think that is fair on the players as they are much better than that and they have shown it this season.\" Dominic Solanke gave Spurs a surprise lead at Anfield, but Slot had no doubts his side would turn things around. \"I think from the moment we arrived on the bus everyone could feel that we were never going to lose this game,\" he told BBC Match of the Day. \"The fans were so supportive before and during the game. Even at 1-0 down you felt this team and the fans could get it over the line.\" He told LFCTV: \"They always find a way to win. I'm incredibly proud, not only of the players but the people standing here, sport directors, my staff members, we should give them a big round of applause. \"Let's forget it's the second title in 35 years... it's the second in five years.\" Liverpool crowned Premier League champions with thumping win over Tottenham - reaction 'No-one expected this' - how Slot guided Liverpool to the title Liverpool rejoin Man Utd on 'perch' with 20th title Liverpool last won the Premier League five years ago, but the Coronavirus pandemic meant there were no fans inside Anfield to witness it. For fans and players alike, a first title win in front of supporters since 1990 is something special. \"It's special to win it at Anfield - it's very difficult to describe,\" Mohamed Salah told BBC Sport. \"Everyone wanted Palace to finish it [at Arsenal on Wednesday], but I know what Anfield is like, so I'm glad we did it here. \"It's completely different [to the title in 2020]. The feeling is unbelievable. The first time was lockdown and the pandemic, but to be here five years later is incredible.\" Salah told Sky Sports: \"This is 100% better than last time.\" Virgil van Dijk - the first non-British captain to lead Liverpool to a top flight title - dedicated the triumph to the club's supporters. \"I was desperate to win it for them [the fans] and all the fans around the world, and for us as well,\" Van Dijk told Sky Sports. \"This is the most beautiful club in the world. We deserve this. We are going to enjoy the next couple of weeks and take it in.\" This video can not be played Salah on securing PL title after Tottenham win Left-back Andy Robertson was also a member of the 2019-20 title-winning team, and he has now become just the third Scotsman to win multiple Premier League titles after Darren Fletcher and Brian McClair. \"Last time [we won the league in 2020] was a strange time,\" he told Sky Sports. \"It was unique the way we did it. We enjoyed it of course but you cannot beat what we experienced today. Nothing compares to that. \"It is special. For me, when I came to this club I quickly realised how good Scottish players have been here. There is a bit of pressure with that. I am glad I managed to continue that and hopefully can carry that forward.\" It has been a remarkable few years for midfielder Alexis Mac Allister, who won the 2022 World Cup with Argentina before joining Liverpool in 2023. \"To win a World Cup and now a Premier League is really special,\" he said. \"But it would not be possible without my team-mates. I am just one part of the puzzle. This team has been really good the last two years. \"It wasn't enough last year but this year we made a big difference. Hopefully we can enjoy this week.\" 20 of the best photos from Liverpool's momentous day 'A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield's day of destiny' Despite uncertainty regarding his future hanging over him for much of this season, Salah has been sensational. His 63rd-minute goal on Sunday was his 28th of the season, while he has set up another 18 for his team-mates. \"It's incredible. Winning the Premier League and having the impact I've had is incredible,\" Salah told BBC Match of the Day. \"For me, this [title] feels more special. Jurgen [Klopp] is not here and other players I respect a lot are not here, but to do it with a new manager and a new team shows what I'm capable of.\" Defending their title will not be easy, but having committed his immediate future to the club with a new two-year contract earlier this month, Salah is confident. \"People think it's going to get easier, but now it's going to be difficult because other teams will catch us and it's going to be harder for him [Slot],\" he said. \"Even in my time here, the second season was way harder. \"I believe next season and the year after will be great, for sure.\" Slot shared his star man's optimism. \"That is something we are definitely going to try [to defend the title],\" he told BBC Match of the Day. \"But first we are going to enjoy the last few games.\" This video can not be played Murphy on phenomenal first season for Slot Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "Man City can't 'confuse' season as success - Guardiola",
    "article_text": "This video can not be played Highlights: Nottingham Forest 0-2 Manchester City Boss Pep Guardiola has told Manchester City they cannot get \"confused\" this season has been a success after reaching the FA Cup final. Rico Lewis and Josko Gvardiol were on target asCity beat Nottingham Forest to book a date with Crystal Palaceon Saturday, 17 May. It will be their third straight FA Cup final and the chance of an eighth success in the competition, while Palace have never won a major trophy. The competition is also City's only chance of major silverware this season, apart from the Community Shield, as their run of four straight Premier League titles ended with Liverpool officially crowned champions on Sunday. With his side fourth in the table, 21 points adrift of Arne Slot's side, Guardiola warned an FA Cup triumph, and reaching next season's Champions League with a top-five finish, will not be enough to mask a disappointing campaign. \"No,\" he said. \"The damage would be minimum. It's not going to confuse [that] the season has been good. The club has to take the decision, the right ones, so next season will be better. \"We are a thousand million points behind Liverpool. I said many times the season hasn't been good because we define if the season is good or not with the Premier League. \"This season it could not happen, at the same time we tried to avoid the damage. We have to be calm now and recover.\" Lewis' second-minute goal put City in control, with the England international impressing in midfield, having been pushed up from his regular full-back role. The 20-year-old believes his side are now moving in the right direction after their faltering mid-season form proved costly in domestic and European competitions. \"We can go on about excuses but it wasn't good enough at the start of the season and now we're picking ourselves back up and we've got momentum,\" said Lewis. \"We've got the chance of a trophy now and hopefully be in the top four to take into next season. \"We showed character, this season we showed character. It's not been smooth sailing but we have picked ourselves up and shown we are a top team. \"We have top players and we can get through tough situations. Now we are on the up we can take it into next season.\" This video can not be played Qualifying for the Champions League is the most important thing - Guardiola After starting the season with a 13-game unbeaten run, City won just once in their next 13 in all competitions. They had slipped to seventh place on Boxing Day after a 1-1 draw with Everton, but have managed to climb back into Champions League contention. Guardiola's side also suffered their earliest exit from the Champions League for 12 years afterlosing to Real Madrid in the knockout play-offs in February. They continued to stutter,thrashed 5-1 at Arsenal in Februarywhile Forest beat them 1-0 at the City Ground in March. But City have won six of their last seven games, including their last-gasp2-1 success over top-five rivals Aston Villa on Tuesday. Midfielder Mateo Kovacic added: \"We found ourselves again. The team is getting stronger, everyone is 100% focused. A lot of players came back very strong. \"When we are all back we are a strong team. This season has not been how we wanted, but we are in another FA Cup final and in the top four.\" The only season Pep Guardiola won no trophies with Manchester City was 2016-17 - his first season in charge Lewis' early opener silenced the 35,000 Forest fans behind the goal and Nuno Espirito Santo's side failed to land a blow on City before the break. Substitute Anthony Elanga should have made it 1-1, firing wide a minute after coming on at the start of the second half, but Gvardiol's 51st-minute header put the game beyond reach. Gibbs-White smacked the bar from the edge of the area with an audacious volley, before hitting the post from a tight angle after rounding City keeper Stefan Ortega following Gvardiol's mistake. Taiwo Awoniyi also hit the woodwork with an instinctive effort following more Forest pressure. \"We started really badly again, it makes everything hard. It took time to feel comfortable and adjust,\" said Nuno. \"The first half was difficult and in the second half the momentum changed a little bit. We had a couple of chances which could put the game in a different story. The boys gave it all, we have to accept we lost.\" Forest next host Brentford in the Premier League on Thursday, sitting sixth in the table but knowing victory will return them to third place and maintain their push for a Champions League spot. \"It's a sad day,\" added Nuno. \"It's going to be hard, but when we wake up and the sadness is gone we know we have big things ahead of us to fight for. \"It can only bring us more energy for the last moments of the season.\" Midfielder Gibbs-White also looked to lift Forest, who beat relegation on the final day of last season. He said: \"We've got to put this behind us now and focus on the league. Five big finals, we are going to give it our absolute everything and hope for the best.\" This video can not be played Nuno on FA Cup defeat to Man City Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "Dubois to fight Usyk at Wembley Stadium on 19 July",
    "article_text": "Daniel Dubois (left) has claimed 21 of his 22 victories by knockout Daniel Dubois and Oleksandr Usyk will fight to become the undisputed world heavyweight champion at Wembley Stadium on 19 July. Briton Dubois is the IBF champion, with Usyk holding the WBA (Super), WBO and WBC belts. Usyk is undefeated in 23 fights and beat Dubois, 27, via aninth-round stoppagein August 2023. The 38-year-old Ukrainian made history in May 2024 when hebeat Tyson Furyto become the first undisputed heavyweight champion of the four-belt era. Usyk, who was also undisputed at cruiserweight, vacated the IBF belt prior to his rematch with Fury in December. Dubois was upgraded to IBF champion as a result and successfully defended the belt against Anthony Joshua last September. He was set to make a second defence against Joseph Parker in February butillness forced him to withdrawfrom the bout in fight week. \"This is the fight I wanted and demanded and now I get my chance for revenge,\" said Dubois. \"I should have won the first fight and was denied by the judgement of the referee, so I will make no mistake this time around in front of my people at the national stadium in my home city. \"I am a superior and more dangerous fighter now and Usyk will find this out for himself.\" No British boxer has held the undisputed heavyweight title in the four-belt era, and the last Briton to be undisputed heavyweight champion was Lennox Lewis in 1999. Usyk last competed in December when he earned asecond win against Fury. \"I'm grateful to God for the opportunity to once again fight for the undisputed championship,\" said Usyk. \"Thank you, Daniel, for taking care of my IBF belt - now I want it back.\" By Coral Barry - senior combat sports journalist Dubois fired himself into superstar status when he stopped Joshua at Wembley Stadium. The Londoner has risen from defeats to mould himself into a world champion with a seemingly unshakeable confidence. Usyk, on the other hand, has made a career of breaking British hearts and will aim to do it again when he meets Dubois. Having swept two-time heavyweight world champion Joshua aside, Dubois now has his sights on felling another of the old guard in the Ukrainian. But were it any other fighter, an 11-year age gap would prompt discussions about a passing-of-the-torch moment, but such is Usyk's pedigree he will be clear favourite. The fight will represent a full-circle moment for Dubois, whose mental fortitude was called into question after his loss to Usyk almost three years ago in Poland. There was also the small matter of thecontroversy of the low blowas Dubois was mere centimetres away from knocking down Usyk and perhaps finishing the fight. There are not many who would have predicted Dubois would be the one to knock Usyk off his perch - that was supposed to be Fury - but in July, on home turf, Dubois will have the chance to banish demons and claim his spot at the top of the heavyweight mountain.

    "title": "'No-one expected this' - how Slot guided Liverpool to the title",
    "article_text": "'No-one expected this' - how Slot guided Liverpool to the title \"If you had asked Liverpool fans back in August would their team win the Premier League, most would have said no,\" says former Reds goalkeeper Sander Westerveld. Jurgen Klopp was always going to be the hardest of acts to follow as manager. Liverpool supporters were understandably worried about the future when the charismatic German, whose force of personality and success gave him iconic status,announced in January 2024he was leaving at the end of that season. Who would undertake the seemingly impossible task of replacing Klopp? Would Liverpool tread water or even go backwards for a season or two while his successor settled in? \"Klopp was a sort of god who changed the club - not just on the pitch but the whole atmosphere,\" says Westerveld. Former Reds midfielder Xabi Alonso, who had taken Bayer Leverkusen to the brink of a first Bundesliga title, was strongly linked with a return before announcing he was staying in Germany. That paved the way forArne Slot's appointment. \"At that moment I didn't even think about Arne,\" says his fellow Dutchman Westerveld, who has remained friends with Slot since their playing days at Sparta Rotterdam in 2007-08. \"Nobody in England knew an awful lot about him. Everybody who knows football said it was going to be a huge task and that this was an unknown coach who comes from the Netherlands.\" Yet the transition from Klopp to Slot has been seamless, culminating in Liverpool winning the title for arecord-equalling 20th time. With 25 wins in 34 games and just two defeats, Slot's side have made top spot their own and have looked down on the rest of the Premier League since 2 November. And now they are champions - with four games to spare - for just the second time since 1989-90. Slot, who ruled himself out of the running to become the next Spurs boss while at Feyenoord in May 2023, has joined an elite band of bosses in the Premier League era to have delivered the title in their first season in charge. Jose Mourinho (2004-05) and Carlo Ancelotti (2009-10) both managed it at Chelsea before Manuel Pellegrini (2013-14) accomplished the feat at Manchester City. The last boss to do so before Slot was Antonio Conte - also at Chelsea - in 2016-17. \"Nobody expected this,\" says Ian Doyle - chief Liverpool writer for the Liverpool Echo. \"In terms of an achievement for a manager in his first season at Liverpool, it has to be right up there.\" Neil Atkinson, presenter and CEO of Liverpool fans' podcast and website The Anfield Wrap, says: \"I don't think anyone wanted the new manager to come in and try to be a Jurgen Klopp tribute act. \"All Liverpool fans wanted was Slot to be himself - and that's what he has been.\" Liverpool clinch Premier League title with thumping win over Spurs Slot thanks Klopp moments after Liverpool win title Liverpool rejoin Man Utd on 'perch' with 20th title In many ways, Slot's main job has been to build on and improve the outstanding squad left behind by his predecessor, who averaged 80.33 points in his last three seasons at Anfield. Three more victories would mean Liverpool break the 90-point barrier after Slot tightened the defence and brought more control to the midfield. \"They've amassed these points by winning when it's hard, winning when it's ugly, winning when the opposition have put up a fight,\" adds Atkinson. \"Liverpool have managed to do that - none of their rivals have.\" WhileFederico Chiesawas the only addition to Slot's squad for this season, the Dutch coach has improved players, including Ryan Gravenberch, who has grasped his opportunity at the base of Liverpool's midfield after the club missed out on signingMartin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad. With 28 Premier League goals and 18 assists in 34 appearances - compared to 18 goals and 10 assists in 32 appearances in Klopp's final season - Mohamed Salah's figures under Slot have been seriously impressive. Gravenberch's Netherlands team-mate Cody Gakpo has provided 17 goals in all competitions in 2024-25, beating his tally from last season. \"In his first meeting with the players, Arne had all the data from the season they were champions in 2019-20 and all the data from the final season under Klopp,\" adds Westerveld. \"Last season, compared to the title season, there were less sprints, the team was less effective. Instead of saying to the players, 'come on, work hard', he was telling them exactly what they had to do and needed to know showing them all the data.\" There have been tweaks off the field too, with Slot implementing a new routine for how his players build up to games. Under Klopp, the day would begin later, but this season players have been at the training ground in Kirkby, about six and a half miles from Anfield, at 9.15am for breakfast. Slot and his backroom team have introduced a process known as 'body wake-up', which involves breathing exercises before both training and matches. Under Klopp, the Liverpool squad would stay together in a hotel before home games. That is no longer the case, with players allowed to remain at their own homes. Training sessions have been longer than before but less intense to reduce injury risk, with fitness issues undermining several campaigns in recent years. In addition, Slot has made key hires behind the scenes. Ruben Peeters, a specialist in periodisation (the science of optimising training loads), followed Slot from Feyenoord, Dr Jonathan Power was promoted to director of medicine and performance, while Amit Pannu joined as a new first-team doctor. 20 of the best photos from Liverpool's momentous day Liverpool's tactical tweaks under new boss Sander Westerveld (pictured, right, at Liverpool's training ground) is a friend and former team-mate of Arne Slot Liverpool fans had plenty of time to get used to Slot before his first Premier League game in charge. There were three months between the Reds announcing him as their new head coach and the match at Ipswich on 17 August. It helped that Klopp, after his final match in charge, urged supporters to sing with him 'Arne Slot, na na na na na' to the tune of Opus' Live Is Life before the German waved goodbye to Anfield - a chant that has become more and more popular at the ground as the season has gone on. \"Before his first home game in front of 60,000, I asked Arne if he was nervous,\" says Westerveld, who won the FA Cup, League Cup and Uefa Cup at Liverpool in 2000-01 under Gerard Houllier. \"He said: 'Oh well, you know, I was manager of Feyenoord and we had a stadium of 50,000 so I'm used to that.' \"I said; 'No, Arnie. No... this is Anfield, this is different.' He was downplaying everything. \"Then I thought about it afterwards and Liverpool is perfect for him. He's just a normal guy, down to earth, feet on the floor, very calm. For him everything is the same and he doesn't change. \"He didn't get carried away when Liverpool won 11 of the first 12 games, and he didn't panic when they lost the League Cup final five days after going out of the Champions League.\" One banner that has become a regular feature in The Kop this season refers to 'Arne's Slot Machine' - a nod towards his popularity with supporters young and old. He has befriendedIsaac Kearney - a Liverpool-obsessedseven-year-old, who was born with a rare condition known as Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome, meaning he develops at a slower rate than other children his age. When the club heard about Isaac's story, they invited him, his mum Melissa and dad Alan, and older sister Florence to the training ground to meet the players. They were told they might not see Slot as he was busy planning for a game. \"Isaac was walking past the manager's office with Mo [Salah] and Virgil [van Dijk] and Isaac being Isaac shouted 'Arne' through the window at him,\" Melissa recalls. \"Arne was in a meeting but came out to chat with Isaac. He was so genuine and down to earth. We sat down for lunch and Arne came over and was fist-bumping Isaac. \"Arne asked if he was having a nice day and Isaac told him he was still waiting to see Trent [Alexander-Arnold]. Arne said: 'I'm going to take you to meet him right now.'\" Before Liverpool's home game with Southampton in March, Slot also name-checked Isaac in his pre-match news conference. Asked how he would cope with serving a touchline ban, the Reds boss said he would be sitting in the stand close to his friend Isaac. Slot spent time with Isaac Kearney (right), his mum Melissa, dad Alan and sister Florence after Liverpool invited the family to the training ground Slot comes across as likeable, approachable and intelligent in interviews, although there were occasions in his early days when he struggled to grasp the local dialect. Before Liverpool's Champions League game with Bologna in October, a local reporter asked if preparations for a big European game were any different to a domestic match. \"That was a bit of Scouse,\" said Slot, struggling to understand the local accent before turning to Tony Barrett - director of first-team communications - for help. \"He's relaxed into the job,\" adds Doyle. \"Anyone who has seen his press conferences, he doesn't mind a laugh and a joke. He's mentioned in the past that his dad reads the newspapers.\" Arend Slotmade the headlinesin January when Arne revealed his dad was not impressed with the way the Reds performed in the 2-1 Champions League win over Lille. \"When I called him after the game he says: 'Ah, it wasn't as exciting as other games of Liverpool,'\" said Arne at the time. Doyle adds: \"I haven't seen him snap in press conferences but if he doesn't believe a question is fair he'll make a point of addressing that fact. \"He always says 'this season we've basically got what we deserved' whether it's after a win over Real Madrid in the Champions League or defeat by Newcastle in the League Cup final.\" Westerveld was at Goodison Park in February when Slot was shown a red card after a dramatic Merseyside derby ended 2-2, with Everton equalising in the 98th minute. \"He looked really angry when he walked off the pitch and then he saw me and straight away he smiled,\" he adds. \"It's like I said before... he doesn't get too down. He's exactly the same as he was in his first coaching role at Cambuur.\" Away from football in the Netherlands, Slot used to relax by playing golf with Westerveld, but since moving to Liverpool he keeps fit playing racquet sport padel with his backroom staff at the training ground. \"Go home, eat, take the computer out, watch the training session back, prepare for the next meeting,\" said Slot - whose family have remained in the Netherlands - when asked what he does after training. \"He's clearly a brilliant coach... and a serious minded person,\" adds Atkinson. \"His reaction to getting knocked out of the Champions League by Paris St-Germain wasn't to bemoan the referee or blame injuries. \"He said it was thebest game he had ever coached in.He has shown genuine humility while simultaneously having a real sense of confidence in himself, his coaching staff and players.\" Liverpool fans have taken Slot to their hearts Not since they were champions in the early 1980s have Liverpool won back-to-back league titles. So will they build on this season's incredible success? While there has been no need for a rebuild in 2024-25, Slot is expected to be active in the transfer market to ensure Liverpool are in a strong position next season. Although Salah has signed anew two-year contractand captain Virgil van Dijk has also committed his future, England international Alexander-Arnold isexpected to move to Real Madrid. Reported Liverpool targets include Newcastle's Sweden forward Alexander Isak and Bournemouth's Hungary left-back Milos Kerkez. \"I refuse to believe Slot will allow standards to slip next season,\" adds Atkinson. \"I think they'll break 80 points again - and if you do that you have every chance of being in the conversation for the title.\" Westerveld will be at Anfield on 25 May, when Liverpool host Crystal Palace on the final day of the season, to see his friend and former team-mate show off the Premier League trophy. \"To come from coaching in the Netherlands to the Premier League... I didn't expect it to be so easy for him to adapt,\" he admits. \"At the start of the season I used to send him a message to congratulate him after a win. Then I sent him a message saying, 'I'm not going to congratulate anymore because it's getting boring'.\" This video can not be played I want to keep Liverpool at the top - Slot Latest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views Get Liverpool news sent straight to your phone Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "Who has made Troy's Premier League team of the week?",
    "article_text": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the Week. Here are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page. Robert Sanchez (Chelsea):He's been pretty poor all season and the general consensus is that Chelsea are going to have to change their goalkeeper, but he was very good against Everton. He made three or four decent saves and then was in a position where he could command his box much better than he has done for most of the season. Kieran Trippier (Newcastle):He was excellent, assured, calm and quality on the ball. At the ripe old age of 34, he is still showing that it's necessary to have experience in the side. He helped Newcastle to manage the game when they went 2-0 up. He showed quality for two of the goals - standing a cross up for Dan Burn and also his corner for Newcastle's third was magnificent. Carlos Baleba (Brighton):Brighton will do well to keep hold of Baleba. There are so many levels to go up in his armoury - he is just frightening. He's tall and powerful and his celebration after his last-minute winner wasn't too bad either. Dan Burn (Newcastle):Burn is the magic man of Newcastle, he just keeps on going. Every time you think his story is doing to drop off, he just keeps getting better. Burn had a real ding-dong with Liam Delap but had the Ipswich forward in his back pocket and then also scored a goal. Rayan Ait-Nouri (Wolves):It looks to me like he is playing for a move, he looks focused and has the right mindset. His assist for the goal was fantastic but he just continually gets up and down the field. There are only a couple of games left and he still has that burning desire to have an impact. Alexis Mac Allister (Liverpool):He has been Liverpool's most consistent midfielder this season. It was a great finish from him, he just looked so calm. The best bit wasn't the goal but it was that he was the standard-setter throughout. Yasin Ayari (Brighton):He was good and solid but it's all about his goal. What a hit and what a show of technical ability to use Lucas Paqueta who was running at him and just bend it round him. Matheus Cunha (Wolves):I'm running out of ways to praise him. He is just at home at Wolves - we know he is leaving but he just looks so comfortable in that side. Wolves know the offer is coming and he just wants to sign off on a positive. He is known as a bit of a maverick and has a wild side but at the moment he has his head screwed on. Mohamed Salah (Liverpool):He just continues to score goals and had a very decent celebration - a selfie in front the Kop. It's at a time when you think he isn't playing at his full potential too and on a weekend when Liverpool secure the title. Antoine Semenyo (Bournemouth):I'm so impressesed every time I watch him. I played against him at Bristol City and didn't think he would be able to go on and do what he's doing in the Premier League, but he is going from strength to strength. Manchester United need to be looking at him - he is powerful and drives, that's what they need. Alexander Isak (Newcastle):He could have scored four on the day. His movement and link-up play is excellent. This guy is the complete striker in world football. Arne Slot (Liverpool):Could it be anyone else on the weekend that he delivers Liverpool a 20th league title? He has come in and only bought Federico Chiesa and turned Liverpool into a title winning team. He's excellent as a manager, excellent in every interview and handles any adversity in the right kind of way. Do you agree with Troy's selections? Who would be in your Team of the Week?

    "article_text": "Meta is facing a second set of lawsuits inAfricaover the psychological distress experienced by content moderators employed to take down disturbing social media content including depictions of murders, extreme violence and child sexual abuse. Lawyers are gearing up for court action against a company contracted by Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, after meeting moderators at a facility inGhanathat is understood to employ about 150 people. Moderators working for Majorel in Accra claim they have suffered from depression, anxiety, insomnia and substance abuse as a direct consequence of the work they do checking extreme content. The allegedly gruelling conditions endured by workers in Ghana are revealed in a joint investigation by the Guardian and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism. It comes aftermore than 140 Facebookcontent moderators in Kenya were diagnosed with severe post-traumatic stress disorder caused by exposure to graphic social media content. The workers in Kenya were employed by Samasource, an outsourcing company that carries out content moderation forMetausing workers from across Africa. Majorel, the company at the centre of the allegations in Ghana, is owned by the French multinational Teleperformance. One man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said he attempted suicide owing to the nature of his work. His claims his contract was subsequently terminated and he has returned to his home country. Facebook and other large social media companies employ armies of content moderators, often based in the poorest parts of the world, to remove posts that breach their community standards and to train AI systems to do the same. Moderators are required to review distressing and often brutal pictures and videos to establish whether they should be removed from Meta’s platforms. According to workers in Ghana, they have seen videos of a person being skinned alive and a woman being beheaded. The moderators claim mental health care offered by the firm was unhelpful, was not delivered by medical doctors, and that personal disclosures made by staff about the effects of their work were circulated among managers.Teleperformance disputed this, saying it employed licensed mental health professionals who are registered with the local regulatory body and hold a master’s degree in psychology, counselling, or another mental health field. The legal case is being prepared by a UK-based nonprofit, Foxglove. It would be the second case brought by content moderators in Africa, after Samasource workers in Kenya sued in 2023. Foxglove said it was “urgently investigating these shocking abuses of workers” with a view to using “every tool at our disposal, including potential legal action” to improve working conditions. It is working with a Ghanaian firm, Agency Seven Seven, on preparing two possible lawsuits. One would allege psychological harms and could involve a group of moderators, and the other unfair dismissal, involving the moderator from east Africa whose contract was terminated after he attempted suicide. Foxglove’s co-executive director Martha Dark said: “These are the worst conditions I have seen in six years of working with social media content moderators around the world. “In Ghana, Meta is displaying nothing short of a complete disregard for the humanity of its key safety workers upon whom all its profits rely: content moderators. They are treated as objects who can be used up, burned out and replaced with no care whatsoever for the permanent damage to their mental and physical wellbeing.” Dark said basic wages for content moderators in Accra were below living costs, incentivising them to work overtime, for which pay is understood to be even lower than normal rates. Moderators faced deductions from their pay for failing to meet performance targets, she added. Contracts seen by the Guardian show that the base wage starts at about 1,300 Ghanaian cedis a month – just over £64. This is supplemented by a system of performance-related bonuses, the upper range of which amounts to about 4,900 cedis (£243) a month, significantly less than the estimatedcost of living in Accra. A Teleperformance spokesperson said content moderators enjoyed “strong pay and benefits, including monthly pay that is roughly 10 times the country’s minimum wage for domestic moderators, and 16 times the minimum wage for those who have relocated from other countries, when including project allowance, transportation allowance, language premium and more – all of which are automatically paid to the moderator and are not performance-based”. Foxglove’s researcher Michaela Chen said she had seen photos of moderators’ living quarters, in which they were “crammed five to a flat, two to a room”. She said there appeared to be a culture of secrecy, including surveillance from managers, who follow workers into the toilets during breaks. This extends to moderators’ work for Meta. She said: “Workers spend all day working on Meta’s platforms, moderating to Meta’s standards and using Meta’s systems, but at the same time, moderators are told constantly: ‘You do not work for Meta,’ and are forbidden from telling anyone they do.”Teleperformance said moderators were “offered housing in … one of the most upscale and well-known residential and commercial neighbourhoods in Accra”.The spokesperson described the housing as “safe, with strong security” and having air conditioning, recreation facilities, including gyms and pools. Carla Olympio, a partner at Agency Seven Seven, said she believed a personal injury case could succeed in Ghana’s courts and would set a precedent establishing that worker protections extend to psychological harms as well as physical injury. “[There is] currently a gap in our laws because they haven’t necessarily caught up with the new developments that cover technology and virtual work,” she said.Rosa Curling, a co-executive director at Foxglove, said it was seeking for the court to “order immediate changes to the content moderators’ workplace”, including proper safeguards and psychiatric care. A spokesperson for Teleperformance said: “At TP in Ghana, we take our content moderation work seriously. From the very beginning during the interview process, within the employee contract and through employee training and resiliency testing, we are fully transparent with our prospective moderators regarding the content they might see during their work to help keep the internet safe for our communities. We have robust people management systems and workplace practices, including a robust wellbeing programme staffed by fully licensed psychologists to support our content moderators throughout their content moderation journey.”Meta said the companies it worked with were “contractually obliged to pay their employees who review content on Facebook and Instagram above the industry standard in the markets they operate”. The tech company said it took “the support of content reviewers seriously”, including detailing expectations around counselling, training and other support in contracts with the companies it outsourced.It said all content moderators signed client confidentiality agreements because they were dealing with user information which needed to be protected and for their own safety, but moderators may discuss their jobs with doctors and counsellors, and some aspects with family members.

    "title": "PM says Canada ‘heartbroken’ after at least 11 killed in Vancouver car-ramming",
    "article_text": "At least 11 people are dead and dozens injured after a driver ploughed into a crowd at a street festival in Vancouver on the eve of Canada’s election, in an attack that the prime minister, Mark Carney, said left the country “shocked, devastated and heartbroken”. Vancouver’s police chief described the carnage as “the darkest day” in the city’s history and told reporters it was “impossible to overstate how many lives have been impacted for ever” by the lone driver. “There are many unanswered questions about this horrific crime, the motive of the person who did it, and whether anything could have been done to prevent it,” said the interim chief constable, Steve Rai. “There are many things we still don’t know. We are working hard to get all of the answers.” He said the victims ranged from five to 65 years old, and that dozens more were injured, “some critically and some have not yet been identified”. Late on Sunday, the British Columbia Prosecution Service charged Kai-Ji Adam Lo, 30, with eight counts of second degree murder and said more charges were possible. Lo, a Vancouver resident, appeared in court and remains in custody, prosecutors said. Rai said officials felt confident the incident was not an act of terrorism and there were no known prior threats to the Filipino community. The suspect had a “significant history of interactions with police and police and healthcare professionals related to mental health”, Rai said. He later added: “It’s not policing the symptom. We’ve got to get to the root cause. We’ve got to get people help, and it’s not putting more cops on the street.” Vancouver’s mayor, Ken Sim, said he has directed a full review of the city’s “event safety measures, including barriers, traffic control and safety protocols”. Echoing Rai’s comments, he added: “We can’t create a police state here, right? It doesn’t get to the root cause. The conversation keeps coming back to mental health. We need to take care of people that are sick, get them the care they need.” The Lapu-Lapu festival, held on a balmy spring day, drew nearly 100,000 people, many of whom were families with young children. The celebration is named after Datu Lapu-Lapu, an Indigenous resistance fighter in the Philippines, who orchestrated the defeat of the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan in battle in 1521. Saturday’s festival was the second annual event for the city and organisers advertised a street parade, artisans, cultural activities, a basketball tournament and local food vendors. Carney, the Liberal party prime minister and former Bank of England governor who is favourite to win Monday’s election, paused campaigning to address the country on Sunday morning. “Those families are living every family’s nightmare,” said a visibly emotional Carney. “I know that I join all Canadians in mourning with you. I know that Canadians are united with you.” Carney referenced “Bayanihan”, the Filipino value of community serving those in need. “This spirit upon which we must draw in this incredibly difficult time. We will comfort the grieving. We will care for each other. We will unite in common purpose.” Carney said he had been briefed by national security officials who believed the attacker acted alone and that there was no active threat to the public. “Last night was extremely difficult and the community will feel this for a long time,” RJ Aquino, the chair of the festival organiser Filipino BC, told reporters, asking the media to respect the privacy of those affected. “We know that there’s a lot of questions floating about and we don’t have all the answers, but we want to tell everybody that we’re grieving.” Vancouver had more than 38,600 residents of Filipino heritage in 2021, representing 5.9% of the city’s total population, according to Statistics Canada. Ferdinand Marcos Jr, the Filipino president, said he was “completely shattered” by the incident and that his government conveyed the “deepest sympathies to the families of the victims and to the strong and thriving Filipino community in Canada”. King Charles said he and his wife were “profoundly saddened” by the attack and “send our deepest possible sympathy at a most agonising time for so many in Canada”. The incident occurred shortly after 8pm local time (1300 BST), said Rai. The event was wrapping up, but many festivalgoers were in the area when the driver in an SUV approached. Aphoto posted to Xhalf an hour before showed a busy street with young people looking at the wares of food truck vendors. “It is hard to make sense of something so senseless, and I know there are questions about whether this tragedy could have been prevented,” said Rai. Footage posted online showed a black luxury SUV with a damaged bonnet parked on a street littered with debris as first aiders tended to people lying on the ground. One witness told CTV News he saw a vehicle driving erratically in the area of the festival just before the crowd was hit. The Vancouver Sun said thousands of people were in the area. “I didn’t get to see the driver, all I heard was an engine rev,” said Yoseb Vardeh, a food truck operator, in an interview with Postmedia. “I got outside my food truck, I looked down the road and there’s just bodies everywhere. He went through the whole block, he went straight down the middle.” Kris Pangilinan, a Toronto-based journalist attending the festival, told CBC News: “[The driver] just slammed the pedal down and rammed into hundreds of people. It was like seeing a bowling ball hit – all the bowling pins and all the pins flying up in the air.” “It was like a war zone … There were bodies all over the ground,” he said. Festival attenders held the suspect until police could arrive. Video circulating on social media showed a young man in a hoodie with his back against a chain-link fence, alongside a security guard and surrounded by bystanders screaming and swearing at him. “I’m sorry,” the man said, holding his hand to his head. Police set up a 24-hour assistance centre to help anyone who had been unable to contact relatives or friends who were at the festival. Harjit Sajjan, a former defence minister who previously worked as a police officer in Vancouver, told CTV News the aftermath was “the largest crime scene that I’ve seen. I’ve been to many crime scenes in that neighbourhood before … This is unfathomable.” Sim said: “Our thoughts are with all those affected and with Vancouver’s Filipino community during this incredibly difficult time. The incident cast a pall over the final day of the federal election campaigning. Canadians go to the polls on Monday in a vote heavily influenced by the spectre of Donald Trump’s threats to annex Canada and a trade war he has launched against his country’s northern neighbour. The New Democratic party (NDP) leader, Jagmeet Singh, had attended the festival to meet voters. He left about an hour before the incident. “Having been at the Lapu-Lapu festival, this is a festival with kids there and families there,” Singh said. “I don’t have the words to describe the pain that I’m feeling now at the lives that were lost … We don’t know the motives, we don’t know any of the details. But, ultimately, this is something that targeted the Filipino community and the Filipino community right now is reeling.” The NDP cancelled four other events in the province schedule for Sunday. Carney’s campaign said a large rally in British Columbia had been cancelled. “All Canadians are united in solidarity with the Filipino community,” the Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre, said while visiting a Filipino church in Ontario. “All Canadians are united with you in mourning the loss of these treasured lives and in binding our country together to support the surviving loved ones.” The Tory leader called the SUV ramming attack a “senseless act of violence”. “I know that today will be a day of prayer and reflection for the Filipino community and for all Canadians and I want you to know that all our country is with you today as you mourn this terrible loss,” he said.",

    "title": "Trump says US ships should have free use of Panama and Suez canals",
    "article_text": "Donald Trump has demanded free transit for American commercial and military ships through the Panama and Suez canals, tasking his secretary of state with making progress “immediately”. Trump has for months been calling for the United States to take control of the Panama canal but his social media post also shifted focus on to the vital Suez route. “American ships, both military and commercial, should be allowed to travel, free of charge, through the Panama and Suez canals!” Trump posted on Saturday. He claimed both routes would “not exist” without the US and said he had asked his secretary of state, Marco Rubio, to “immediately take care of” the situation. The Panamanian president, Jose Raul Mulino, without directly referencing Trump said on Saturday that toll fees were regulated by thePanamaCanal Authority (ACP), an autonomous governing body that oversees the trade route. “There is no agreement to the contrary.” The US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, said during a visit to Panama City this month that the US was seeking an agreement under which its warships could pass through the canal “first, and free”. He also floated the idea ofUS troops returning to Panamato “secure” its strategically vital canal, an idea that was quickly slapped down by Panama’s government. The US and China are two of the top users of the canal. Egypt’s Suez canal, a key waterway linking Europe and Asia, accounted for about 10% of global maritime trade before attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels on shipping routes in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. The Iran-backed rebels began targeting vessels after the start of the Israel-Gaza war, claiming solidarity with Palestinians. It has forced ships to take a long and costly detour around the southern tip of Africa. Egypt said in 2024 that its canal revenues had plunged 60%, a loss of $7bn. The US military has been attacking Houthi positions since January 2024 and those assaults have intensified under Trump, with almost daily strikes in the past month. Trump has said military action will continue until the Houthis are no longer a threat to shipping.",

    "title": "North Korea confirms for first time it has sent troops to fight for Russia in Ukraine war",
    "article_text": "North Korea has confirmed for the first time that it hassent troops to fight for Russiain the war with Ukraine under the orders of the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, who described the soldiers as “heroes”. The acknowledgment comes amid claims by the Kremlin – contested by Ukraine – that North Korean forces helped recapture Russia’sKursk region. After months of silence over the deployment, which has been widely reported in the western media, Russia also confirmed the presence of North Korean soldiers. In a statement released on Monday, the North’s KCNA state news agency quoted the ruling party as saying that the end of the battle in Russia’s Kursk region showed the “highest strategic level of the firm militant friendship” between North Korea andRussia. Russia claimed last week that Ukrainian forces had been expelled from the last Russian village they had been holding. Kyiv has denied the claim, however, and said Ukrainian troops were also still operating in Belgorod, another Russian region borderingUkraine. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said on Sunday that Ukraine’s army was still fighting in Russia’s Kursk despite Moscow claiming the “liberation” of its western region. “Our military continues to perform tasks in the Kursk and Belgorod regions – we are maintaining our presence on Russian territory,” he said in his evening address. In a statement earlier on Sunday, he conceded that the situation remained difficult in many areas, including Kursk. The central military commission of North Korea’s ruling Workers’ party said Kim made the decision to deploy troops under the comprehensive strategic partnership treatyhe signed with Putinin June 2024. “Under the order of the head of state, the sub-units of the armed forces of the Republic regarded the territory of Russia as the one of their country and proved the firm alliance between the two countries,” KCNA cited the commission as saying. North Korea “regards it as an honour to have an alliance with such a powerful state as the Russian Federation,” KCNA added. The agency quoted Kim as saying: “They who fought for justice are all heroes and representatives of the honour of the motherland.” North Korea sent an estimated total of 14,000 troops, including 3,000 reinforcements, to replace those killed, injured orcaptured, Ukrainian officials have said. With no armoured vehicles or drone warfare experience, theytook heavy casualtiesbut adapted quickly, the officials added. Russia confirmed on Saturday for the first time that North Korean soldiers had been fighting alongside Russians in Kursk. Neither Russia nor North Korea had previously either confirmed or denied the deployment. The US state department said it was concerned by North Korea’s direct involvement in Russia’s war in Ukraine and that Pyongyang’s military deployment must end. “We continue to be concerned by [North Korea’s] direct involvement in the war. [North Korea’s] military deployment to Russia and any support provided by the Russian Federation to [North Korea] in return must end,” a state department spokesperson said in an email, adding that third countries such as North Korea “bear responsibility” for the war. Kim, whose material support for Putin could earn the North access to Russian satellite and military technology to boost its nuclear missile programme, said a monument would soon be built in the capital Pyongyang to honour his soldiers’ “battle feats”. The North has also provided Russia withvast quantities of ammunition, artillery shells, ballistic missiles and other weapons. South Korea, the US and their partners worry that Russia could reward North Korea by transferring hi-tech weapons technologies for use in its nuclear weapons programme. North Korea is also expected to receive economic and other assistance from Russia. Kim’s reference to “the tombstones of the fallen soldiers” is seen as public confirmation by the regime that North Korean troops had been killed in combat. Zelenskyy has put the number of killed or wounded North Koreans at 4,000, though US estimates are lower, at about 1,200. The country must “take important national measures to specially honour and care for the families of war veterans,” Kim said. Experts said Moscow and Pyongyang are likely to have agreed in advance to publicly disclose the deployment. “The two countries agreed to disclose the deployment because they judged that the benefits of compensation for the troop deployment outweighed the potential damage to their international image,” Yang Moo-jin, president of the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, told Agence France-Presse. By promising state benefits to the deployed troops, North Korea could also “sufficiently ease internal backlash,” Yang said, adding that the move reflected Pyongyang’s growing confidence. “North Korea likely aimed to showcase that victory was achieved thanks to their involvement, thereby securing greater rewards from Russia,” he added.",

    "title": "US treasury secretary says ‘there is a path’ with China over tariff negotiations",
    "article_text": "The US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said “there is a path” to an agreement withChinaovertariffsafter he had interactions with his Chinese counterparts last week in Washington. “I had interaction with my Chinese counterparts, but it was more on the traditional things like financial stability, global economic early warnings,” Bessent told ABC News’s This Week on Sunday, explaining that he had spoken to the Chinese during International Monetary Fund meetings in Washington. “I don’t know if President Trump has spoken with President Xi,” he added. On Friday,Donald Trumpasserted in an interview that tariff negotiations were under way with China, comments he repeated on his way to Rome to attend the funeral of Pope Francis, but were later denied by China’s foreign ministry, which said the US “should stop creating confusion”. A day later, China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, said Beijing abides by international rules on US-imposed tariffs and would seek solidarity with other countries. “Certain countries adhere to their own priorities, engage in bullying pressure and coercive transactions, and provoke trade wars for no reason, exposing their extreme egoism,” Wang said on the sidelines of a regional meeting in Kazakhstan. On Sunday, Bessent attempted to weave through the conflicting signals over what progress was being made to de-escalate a trade war threatening to sap global growth. “The Chinese will see this high tariff level is unsustainable for their business,” he said. He added that Beijing’s denial that negotiations are ongoing was for a Chinese audience. “I think they’re playing to a different audience,” Bessent said. “We have a process in place and, again, I just believe these Chinese tariffs are unsustainable. “The first path will be, again, a de-escalation, which I think the Chinese are going to have to have. Then I think there can be an agreement in principle, these 17 or 18 important trade deals that we’re negotiating.” But Bessent warned that “a trade deal can take months” and said negotiations with other significant US trading partners were progressing. “Some of those are moving along very well, especially the – with the Asian countries,” he said, praising Trump’s negotiating strategy. “In game theory it’s called strategic uncertainty,” he said. “So, you’re not going to tell the person on the other side of the negotiation where you’re going to end up. And nobody’s better at creating this leverage than President Trump.” The treasury secretary’s comments come as top US retailers have reportedly warned the White House that tariffs will cause empty store shelves and price hikes within weeks. Bloomberg reportedthat Chinese fast-fashion giantShein raised US pricesof its products from dresses to kitchenware on Friday ahead of imminent tariffs on small parcels. The average price for the top 100 products in the beauty and health category increased by 51%, and more than 30% for home and kitchen products and toys, including a 377% increase in the price of a 10-piece set of kitchen towels. Trump predicted on Sunday that tariffs would ultimately benefit US taxpayers and boost employment. “When Tariffs cut in, many people’s Income Taxes will be substantially reduced, maybe even completely eliminated,”Trump wrote in a Truth Social post. “Focus will be on people making less than $200,000 a year. Also, massive numbers of jobs are already being created, with new plants and factories currently being built or planned.” He called it a “bonanza” for Americans and said “the external service is happening”. Separately on Sunday, US agriculture secretary Brooke Rollins said the US was holding daily conversations with China over tariffs. “Every day we are in conversation with China, along with those other 99, 100 countries that have come to the table,” Rollins said on CNN’s State of the Union. Rollins said the president was prepared to bail out American farmers if the trade war continues squeezing commodity exports, particularly soybean and pork sales to China. “First of all, the prayer is that that doesn’t need to happen – but secondly, if it does, for the short term, just as in Trump 1, we are preparing for that,” Rollins said. Rollins said it could take months before it is known whether a bail-out is needed. “I don’t think we’re going to need it, but if we do, it will be there,” Rollins said.",

    "title": "Taiwan cracks down on holders of Chinese ID amid fears over propaganda and espionage",
    "article_text": "Taiwan has launched a crackdown on holders of illegal Chinese identity documents, revoking the Taiwanese status of more than 20 people and putting tens of thousands of Chinese-born residents under scrutiny. Under Taiwan law it is illegal for Taiwanese people to hold Chinese identity documents. In the past decade, hundreds of people have had their Taiwanese papers or passports cancelled for also holding Chinese ID, effectively revoking their citizenship. But a renewed hunt for dual ID-holders has drawn controversy after the public expulsion of three women and threats to the permanent residencies of more than 10,000 Chinese-born people, including many who had built lives and families in Taiwan over decades. The campaign has sparked a nationwide debate about identity, loyalty and how to balance the island’s treasured political freedoms with its national security. The current furore began in December, with an online documentary revealing local Chinese authorities were secretly offering Chinese IDs to Taiwanese people. Taiwan’s mainland affairs council (MAC) denounced the scheme as “part of China’s evil united front work that attempts to … create an illusion that it has authority over the nation”. The documentary identified three recipients who had moved to the Chinese province of Fujian and applied for Chinese identity cards. Su Shih-er was one of the three. He chose the coastal province for its large Taiwanese community and generous government subsidies for entrepreneurs opening “local” businesses. Soon after arriving, Su learned he could apply for a Chinese identity card. “I thought it’d be more convenient for my company, so I applied,” he told the Guardian. What Su did was illegal under Taiwanese law, although he disputes this. To get his Chinese ID card, Su was legally required to have Chinese household registration (known as “hukou”), which is barred under Taiwan’s cross-strait relations act, alongside Chinese passports. Su, who is still in China, said there are “loads” of Taiwanese with Fujian IDs, and that he felt “like a victim of their political games”. Tensions between Taiwan and China are dangerously high. China’s Communist party (CCP) government claims Taiwan as a province and ispreparing to take it militarilyif it can’t convince or coerce it to peacefully “unify”. Espionage and infiltration by pro-CCP actors – including from Taiwan’s society, government, and military –are real and ongoing dangers. But there are still close ties between the two territories. Figures from 2022 show about 170,000 Taiwanese living in China. About 380,000 Chinese-born people live in Taiwan, many married to Taiwanese people, and about half of them hold permanent residency. In March Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te,announced new measuresto counter China’s malign efforts, which included increased scrutiny of cross-strait travel and resettlement. In March, three Chinese-born women were accused of using their popular social media accounts to advocate for a hostile Chinese takeover of Taiwan. Taiwan revoked their residency visas and they were forced to leave Taiwan, as well as their Taiwanese husbands and children. The opposition accused the government of deporting people without due process for views it didn’t like.A statementsigned by dozens of local academics said President Lai was “rapidly compressing the space for free speech”. But government figures said the posts were essentially enemy war propaganda, exempt from free-speech protection. Premier Cho Jung-tai told reporters: “There are limits to freedom of speech, and the limits are the country’s survival.” The deportations also seemed to have social support, and at a press conference held by one of the women, a crowd chanted “go home!”. The case highlighted “the unique dilemma of Taiwan’s existence”,wrote two local academics, Michelle Kuo and Albert Wu. “Imagine a world where an ally of China expels a Taiwanese immigrant for advocating Taiwanese independence. We would fight to the death for that person to stay in the country,” said Wu and Kuo. But, they added: “Taiwanisunder exceptional threat. Can we apply human rights principles around family unity and freedom of speech when facing such a massive danger?” The Taiwan government’s next move proved even more controversial. As it became clear the number of people holding or seeking Chinese IDs waslarger than anticipated, authorities decided to sweep the island. “If the identities of the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait are not clearly distinguished, it will affect the national security and social stability of our country,” it said. In March the MAC sent questionnaires to public sector workers, university employees and military personnel, asking them if they ever held Chinese ID. The MAC described the survey as an opportunity to “demonstrate their loyalty”. Then, earlier this month, the National Immigration Agency (NIA) began contacting more than 10,000 Chinese-born spouses in Taiwan, claiming they had never provided proof they had given up their Chinese hukuo – a requirement for permanent residency. Social media filled with angry posts from affected people and their families, saying they felt targeted and suddenly unwelcome. Among them were people who had moved to Taiwan decades ago, before such proof was required. Rescinding hukou can only be done in person, in China. Some commenters pointed to the case of Li Yanhe, a Chinese-born, Taiwan-basedpublisher of critical booksabout the CCP.In 2023 Li was arrested in Shanghai, reportedly there to rescind his hukou. Convicted of unspecified acts of “inciting secession”, he remains in a Chinese jail. One woman posted to Threads a recording of a call between her mother and the NIA. Her mother told the NIA agent she had given proof to another agency when she arrived 22 years ago. But the agent said they had no record, and threatened to strip her Taiwanese rights and residency if she failed to cooperate. “My mother has become an international football,” her daughter posted. In another case, a woman said her mother – who had lived her for 33 years – had also received a demand for proof. “My mother has a Taiwanese ID card, a Taiwanese passport and has paid labour insurance and health insurance and taxes for more than 30 years. She is a Taiwanese!” the woman said. The MAC deputy head, Liang Wen-chieh, said last week they were demonstrating “utmost leniency towards such individuals”. But amid an outcry the government announced case-by-case exemptions, including for people who are elderly, haven’t returned to China in more than 10 years, or feared persecution if they did. The new campaign has so far resulted in at least 19 people being stripped of Taiwanese papers – and citizenship if they held it – for having Chinese ID. The NIA, told the Guardian those who cancelled their Chinese hukou could apply for permission to “restore their [Taiwan] status” and come back. But critics worry that the crackdown is only further dividing Taiwan’s already fractious society. “It is obvious that a negative impact is to tear Taiwan apart and push people to the opposite side, which is of no benefit to Taiwan’s security,” said Prof Liu Mei-jun, of Taiwan’s national Chengchi university. During the furore over the deported influencers, academics Kuo and Wu warned that the government “may have inadvertently handed Beijing an easy propaganda victory”. China’s state media has already seized on the cases, accusing Taiwan’s ruling DPP of “tearing families apart”. The Taiwan Affairs Office accused the DPP of bullying, and only applying the idea of “freedom” to those who supported Taiwan independence. The Guardian’s conversations with people in or close to the government have revealed a perplexity over the backlash, and a belief that any concerns are outweighed by the need to address any vulnerability China could exploit. “More than 360,000 Chinese spouses live in Taiwan today,” Kuo and Wu wrote in their essay. “While they may appear to be a demographic minority, their family networks make up a significant portion of society – one the government now risks alienating.”",

    "title": "Nasal spray similar to ketamine to be added to PBS for treatment-resistant depression",
    "article_text": "A medication chemically similar to ketamine will be made cheaper to improve the lives of Australians suffering from treatment-resistant depression. The drug, which comes in the form of a nasal spray, is a chemical cousin of ketamine, used for decades as a powerful anaesthetic before it was adopted as a party drug in underground rave culture. There have been no major pharmaceutical innovations for depression since the launch of Prozac and related antidepressants in the late 1980s. Those drugs target the “feel-good” brain chemical serotonin and can take weeks or months to kick in. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter Spravato, known chemically as esketamine, works differently. It targets a neurotransmitter called glutamate that is thought to restore brain connections that help relieve depression. When it works, its effect can be felt within a matter of hours, according to Prof Ian Hickie of the University of Sydney. The co-director ofHealthand Policy at the University of Sydney’s Brain and Mind Centre has been working with the drug for a small number of patients under a special access scheme. But from Thursday, it will be available and affordable for up to 30,000 Australians through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. It will also mark the first new type of medicine for major depression to be funded by the government in three decades. “Most of the drug development we’ve had in the last three decades has mimicked what had preceded it,” Hickie said. “This is different ... it targets a different neurochemical system – glutamate – and appears to regulate those brain circuits that regulate mood in a different way.” Australian trials using the ketamine-like drug have shown significant improvement in about 50% of people who had otherwise been resistant to conventional treatments. “Not all depression is the same, nor does it have the same chemical explanation in all people,” Hickie said. “For some people, particularly those who have failed to respond to the conventional serotonin-focused agents, or monoamine-focused agents, this is different and they appear to benefit.” Sign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025 Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Since the drug was approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration in 2019, it has been commonly used in emergency rooms and other urgent care settings across the US. “Here’s something that actually works quickly, not by knocking you out, not by sedating you, but by alleviating that terrible sense of hopelessness and terrible depressiveness and to some degree that sense of suicidality,” Hickie said. Spravato will be available through the scheme at a cost per dose of $31.60 or $7.70 for pensioners and concession card holders. However, patients will need to incur additional healthcare and administration costs, including supervision by a healthcare professional at a certified treatment centre. The minister for health and aged care, Mark Butler, said the listing would make the novel drug more affordable and improve the quality of life for thousands of Australians. Johnson & Johnson’s innovative medicine ANZ managing director, Joana De Castro, said the “long overdue” listing came after four funding submissions and a four-year wait following Therapeutic Goods Administration registration.

    "title": "Pro-gas group with link to Liberal party referred to ACCC over alleged misleading claims",
    "article_text": "The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has been asked to investigate allegedly misleading claims made by Australians for NaturalGas, a pro-gas group with directors who include a gas industry executive and a Liberal candidate running in the federal election. Lawyers acting for Climate Integrity, a not-for-profit focused on corporate accountability, have filed a complaint with the ACCC. They argue that the website and advertising materials of Australians for Natural Gas have failed to disclose its directors’ links to the gas industry andLiberal party, and overinflated the role of gas in the economy and energy transition. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter On its website, Australians for Natural Gas describes itself as a “not-for-profit organisation representing the interests of Aussie households, industries and producers”. The company was registered in January 2025 with Joel Riddle and Nathaniel Smith among its directors, according to information provided to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. Riddle is the chief executive of the gas company Tamboran Resources, which holds the largest share of acreagein the Beetaloo basin, according to thecompany’s website. Smith wasinstalled as the Liberal candidate for the New South Wales seat of Whitlamafter the party’sinitial choice was disendorsed, and was a member of the NSW parliament from 2019 to 2023. The complaint to the ACCC alleges that Australians for Natural Gas has represented itself on its website and on social media as a grassroots not-for-profit organisation, failing to disclose its directors’ interests. It says the company overstates the contribution of gas to the Australian economy, by relying on out-of-date information; overstates the global demand for gas; and that its claims about the role of gas exploration in reducing electricity bills do not disclose that the cheapest electricity is from renewable sources. The complaint also alleges that claims of reduced emissions thanks to gas replacing coal are misleading because they ignore research about the emissions associated with the processing and transportation of liquefied natural gas, and assume gas would not in fact replace renewable energy. The director of Climate Integrity, Claire Snyder, said Australians for Natural Gas appeared to be “an incredibly brazen example of astroturfing”. “One thing that was concerning to us is that this website popped up right at the beginning of an election campaign, when energy is a critical and vote-deciding issue,” she said. She said Climate Integrity was raising its concerns with the ACCC to ensure a factual and evidence-based public discussion of energy and climate change, and the role of gas in the transition to zero emissions, particularly during the election. A spokesperson for Australians for Natural Gas described the complaint as “spurious”, noting that its membership included users and producers of natural gas, “as we clearly state on our website”. They did not respond when contacted in relation to Snyder’s comments. Onits website, the company says its membership “encompasses a diverse array of stakeholders across the natural gas value chain, including upstream producers, midstream infrastructure operators, and downstream users in industry”.It does not name any of its members or directors, or provide any contact email, street address or phone number. Sign up toClear Air Australia Adam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisis after newsletter promotion “We are focused on highlighting the important role that affordable and reliable natural gas plays in supporting the economy and the wider community,” the spokesperson said. Gas policy has beena key issue in the election, with the Coalition proposing that producers would berequired to supply an additional 50 to 100 petajoulesto east coast states. Two academics from Monash University’s Climate Change Communication Hub, writing in the Conversation, haveaccused Australians for Natural Gas of producing “climate misinformation”in ads that had been seen more than 1m times during the election campaign. Kirsty Ruddock, the managing lawyer of the corporate and commercial team at the Environmental Defenders Office, which drafted the letter, said the ACCC hadidentified misleading claims about energy and greenwashingamong its compliance and enforcement priorities for 2025-26. “We’d like them to investigate so they can determine whether there are breaches of the Australian consumer law, and ensure that companies that are making these types of statements are held to account. “The longer these representations go on, the more impact they have. So it’s important to address them relatively quickly, and make sure that the regulators are looking at it.”",

    "title": "Final dash: these are the seats Labor and the Coalition will target, with Greens and teals the X-factor",
    "article_text": "With less than week until election day and early voting well under way, the focus on the election is narrowing, as are chances of a Peter Dutton prime ministership – if you believethe polls. A campaign that from the start zeroed in on Australia’s mortgage belt will be decided on the streets of outer Melbourne and Sydney, in regional Victoria and New South Wales. Labor and the Coalition are likely to win seats from each other in the mortgage belt but the X-factor in deciding who wins government will be whether the Greens pinch seats from Labor, and if Climate 200-backed independents grab a few more long-held Coalition seats. Coalition members shrug off the polls. They point to the 2019 numbers showing a likely Labor win that turned into Scott Morrison’s “miracle” victory, and they cite internal research showing the race in key seats is much closer than the national figures suggest. TheCoalitionexpect to pick up a few seats in outer Melbourne. Labor, Greens and crossbench sources remain optimistic about holding or winning seats across the board, with the unpredictability of a growing third-party vote and the explosion in early voting being wildcards. The terms “toss-up” and “down to the wire” are common cliches uttered by political players across the parliament in numerous conversations we had this week for this article. The topline: Labor and the Liberals are downplaying the prospects of much shifting outside the mortgage belt seats in NSW and Victoria, where a number of seats are still up for grabs. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter But senior Labor sources claim there is a real chance the party will retain majority government, even whispering about a potential increased majority. Labor believes Dutton is a less popular Liberal leader than Scott Morrison. Labor is confident of holding all its seats in Western Australia and the Northern Territory, and sources believe the party has stemmed some of the bleeding in Sydney. The Liberal focus on Victoria, where the Coalition earlier talked up its chances of a decent haul, has narrowed to a handful of seats: Aston, Chisholm, McEwen and, at longer odds,Hawkeor Gorton. Labor sources are resigned to losing a few Victorian seats, conceding there are tough challenges especially in Aston and McEwen, which Dutton has visited many times during the campaign. The Coalition is adamant its internal research paints a rosier picture of marginal seats than that indicated by published polls. Labor is not talking up chances of grabbing Victoria’s ultra-marginal seats of Menzies or Deakin from the Liberals. “It is closer than the national polls are suggesting,” one Coalition source said. Another said it would be tighter than most people expected and downplayed the prospect of a Labor majority. A final blitz, including last-minute ad spending, could affect a few more seats. Liberal strategists are also quietly confident of gaining the NSW seats ofBennelong, Gilmore and Paterson and possiblyBullwinkel, Tangney andCurtinin Western Australia; there are whispers aboutWhitlam. Sources point to a last-minute Labor ad blitz in Boothby,Paterson and Robertson, and Albanese’s decision to hold events with Labor MPs in Bruce and Chisholm, as signs of Labor concern about those seats. Labor, conversely, believes it is on track to hold Tangney and win the new seat of Bullwinkel. ALP sources are also confident of hanging on to all the Hunter region seats, formerly high targets for the Coalition. Sources close to the Climate 200 movement admitted the race to win Curtin was proving tough. Held by the teal independent Kate Chaney, it is thought the first-term MP has her “nose in front”. The Liberals have relished stumbles from the teal independent Monique Ryan in Kooyong but one source admits winning back the seat after one term is a tough ask. They would also love Tim Wilson to win back Goldstein from the independent Zoe Daniel. Climate 200 sources believe the fight to win all the seats won by teal independents in the 2022 election will be a tough one but they believe they can hold them all against Liberal challengers, with Allegra Spender’s seat of Wentworth in Sydney considered safest. Sign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025 Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion The independents are facingattacks from third-party campaignersincluding Advance and Australians for Prosperity. But Climate 200 says the candidates it has backed in the Coalition-held seats of Cowper, Bradfield andWannonare doing well and may spring surprises on election night. The marginal seat of Forrest in WA, long held by the Liberals, could also be an interesting race, with a new teal candidate facing off against a new Liberal candidate. Labor and the Liberals believe they stand a chance of winningBrisbane, and sources in the Greens – who hold that seat via the first-term MP Stephen Bates – admit it will be hard work to hold on to it. The Greens are more confident about holding on to the neighbouring seat of Griffith, held by Max Chandler-Mather, and they are increasingly positive about retaining Ryan in Brisbane’s western suburbs. Chandler-Mather, the outspoken housing spokesperson, has helped transform the Greens into a self-described “party for renters” – but Labor is desperate to dislodge him. The Greens remain confident of taking Labor’s Victorian seat of Wills, held by Peter Khalil, with their candidate Samantha Ratnam, the former state Greens leader. Labor believes it will hang on to Wills but the Greens believe there’s a groundswell of anger in north Melbourne about Labor’s position on the Gaza war and the cost of living that could push voters to the smaller party. There’s anotherthree-cornered contest in Macnamara, held by Labor’s Josh Burns. The Middle East conflict is also important to many voters in the Melbourne Port-side seat, which has a large Jewish community. The 2022 vote count between Labor, Liberals and the Greens was so close it took several days to finalise. The Greens are quietly confident of taking Richmond, centred on Byron Bay, from Labor’s Justine Elliott. The seat has a high proportion of renters, high house prices and several Greens sit on the local council. Adam Bandt visited the seat on Saturday with the party’s candidate, Mandy Nolan, to launch a plan to raise the aged pension. Labor believes it could win in Leichhardt, the north Queensland seat held by the retiring Liberal MP Warren Entsch. Anthony Albanese’s visit to the seat with the ALP candidate, Matt Smith, generated some of the more interesting photos of the campaign, with the former pro basketball player towering over the prime minister. Now for the wildcard: Labor has been throwing resources at Dickson, Dutton’s seat in Brisbane. Albanese visited Dickson on the first morning of the campaign and the party has dispatched a conga line of senior ministers to campaign there with the Labor candidate, Ali France. Albanese told Guardian Australia last week that Labor genuinely wanted to unseat Dutton, noting that Dickson was Queensland’s most marginal seat on 1.7%. Dutton has laughed off the challenge, saying he has always held on in tight contests. But one senior Labor source said that although the party wouldn’t bank its win just yet, internal polling showed the race was tight. Albanese’s path to majority government seems tough but Dutton’s is nearly invisible. A Labor minority is still considered by many as the most likely outcome. But with so many marginal seats and several electoral X-factors muddying the water, it would be a brave soul who would say what the final numbers will be.",

    "title": "The big issues Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton aren’t talking about this election",
    "article_text": "With less than week left in the federal election campaign, there are still several important policy issues Labor and theCoalitionhave so far been unwilling to touch. Many of these issues featured prominently in previous election campaigns but, so far, they have been sidelined by the government and the opposition. Let’s take a look at a few of them. The voice referendum was supposed to be one of the biggest reforms of the Albanese government. After a bruising referendum campaign for Labor, Indigenous affairs has barely featured in this election campaign. So far,there has been scant detail about policies directly affecting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Labor says it remains committed to the “principles of truth-telling” but both parties have pledged to focus on practical rather than symbolic ways to close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. The Albanese government was planning to introduce a range of reforms last year in response to a major inquiry into gambling harm that called for a total ban on ads after a three-year transition period. This never happened, thanks to pressure from broadcasters and sporting codes. No policy has been taken to this election by Labor. The Coalition has not changed its policy announced in mid-2023. Labor has vowed to do more if elected but has not provided any details. Inaction has beenhighlighted by several backbenchersin marginal seats. Before the 2022 federal election, Labor vowed to introduce a national Environmental Protection Agency. This never happened, again, because of pressure from vested interests.Labor has flagged it would introduce some form of an agency if re-electedbut has not provided details on how it would differ from what it didn’t deliver in 2024. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter In previous elections, the major parties were keen to splash cash on the reef to boost their environmental credentials and support the tourism industry. In 2022 Scott Morrison promised$1bn worth of conservation programsover the next decade. This year the Albanese government announced a $10m package for educational programs highlighting the importance of sustainable tourism. More than half of this money provides rebates for students to visit the reef. The major parties have mentioned the reef but the money committed to its protection is marginal compared with previous campaigns. The fortnightlywelfarepayment is only $781 for single people,helping keep about 858,000 Australians in poverty. A long list of organisations want it and the youth allowance increased buttheir callshave fallen on deaf ears in the major parties, although the crossbench and the Greens have highlighted the need for change. The major parties haveconcentrated on helping first home buyersbut have offered no support to renters and said little about affordable housing. The peak housing body Everybody’s Home wants limits onrent increases, longer tenancy agreements and national minimum standards. It has also asked for a more ambitious target of 940,000 social homes to be built within the next two decades. Sign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025 Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion For months the Albanese government has been sitting on a business case for the first stage of itsmuch hyped east-coast high-speed rail line. Its promise to begin by building the Sydney-Newcastle section was a flagship policy of its 2022 election campaign. Despite all that Labor has yet to announce a plan for high-speed rail. Meanwhile, the Coalition has talked down the project’s likely huge cost. Countless reviews and inquiries have found that Australia’s employment services system is expensive and ineffective but any talk of reforming it has been omitted from this campaign. Economic Justice Australia and the Antipoverty Centre wantthe mutual obligation systemabolished, with Acosscalling for an immediate end to the targeted compliance framework and automated payment suspensions. Labor has largely avoided talking about aviation despite widespread discussion about Australia’s lack of airline competition, high air fares, poor service and speculation about the government’s relationship with Qantas. In contrast, the Coalition hasproposed loosening restrictions barring foreign airlines from operating domestic flightsto boost competition and reduce ticket costs – but this would be a trial limited to the Northern Territory. Mention of the national broadband network,once an election-deciding issue, is notably absent from this campaign. There was a one-line mention of it from the prime minister in Labor’s campaign launch – just about the fibre-to-the-premises upgrade announced before the election, and saying Labor would keep the network in public hands – despite the Coalition ruling out privatising it. There has been no mention of the NBN so far from the Coalition. But the Liberal policy page says the party would “improve access to telecommunications and high-speed internet, including investing $3bn for further work on the NBN”. Labor and the oppositionsupport a social media ban for users under the age of 16so the idea is not up for debate. Both parties also matched each other with $6m for digital literacy courses for school students. Perhaps not wanting to risk the ire of Donald Trump and the tech oligarchs, neither party has campaigned about regulating social media platforms, or getting Facebook, Google and TikTok to pay for news. This was a huge issue in the 2022 election campaign but has so far barely rated a mention. It could be because the main parties supporteda new Aged Care Actbut the chair of Palliative Care Australia, Dr Peter Allcroft, is frustrated about how little has been said during the campaign about improving access to care in a sector that faces chronic workforce shortages.",

    "title": "Albanese handed win in final leaders’ debate – as it happened",
    "article_text": "This blog is now closed Both leaders are being asked about the booing that occurred at Anzac Day ceremonies during welcome to country ceremonies. Peter Duttonwas asked if he would acknowledge traditional owners at his official events? Speaking on flags first, he answered: I don’t believe [we are] the best country we can be if we’re asking people to identify under different flags.I want to unite our country. I want every Australian to be equal … You can have respect as I do for the Indigenous flag and the Torres Strait Islands flag but I want our country to be one and that is the best chance. On welcome to country ceremonies, Dutton argued it was “overdone” and said: It is respectful to do, but for the start of every meeting at work, or the start of a football game, I think other Australians think it is overdone and cheapens the significance of what it was meant to do, it divides the country, not dissimilar to what the prime ministers did with the voice. There we have it, folks – we’ve made it to the end of the final leaders’ debate of the 2025 federal election campaign. Here were all the key takeaways, asAnthony AlbaneseandPeter Duttonwent head-to-head on television for the last time: Anthony Albanesewon the final leaders’ debate with 50% of the vote from a group of 60 undecided voters – 25% voted forPeter Dutton, and 25% remained undecided. Dutton argued that welcome to country ceremonies are “overdone” when asked about thebooing that occurred at Anzac Day dawn services. Albanese said the ceremonies were a “matter of respect” and it was up to event organisers to decide whether or not they should take place. Both leaders said the date of Australia Dayshould not change. Albanese received an overwhelming win when it came to the cost of living at 65% of votes from the panel, whileDutton received 16% and 19% were undecided. The PM talked up Labor’s tax cut, cheaper medicines policy, energy bill relief, cheaper childcare and free Tafe, and argued that what the Coalition is offering is “all temporary”. Dutton argued the Coalition were the better economic managers and that it would “take us time toclean up Labor’s mess,” continually pointing to the Coalition’s fuel excise. On housing, the PM was given 35% of the vote, Dutton 30% and 35% were undecided. The opposition leader said the Australian housing dream “looks like a nightmare” for young people today, continuing toblame migration. Albanese said the housing crisis was decades in the making, and that Labor was focused on supply. Dutton won over a majority of the undecided voters on defence at 43%, while Albanese got 35% and 20% were undecided. The opposition leader said China wasthe biggest threatto security in Australia, while the PM said China “seeks to increase its influence in the region”. In a quick-fire round, the leaders werequizzed on the price of a carton of a dozen eggs. Dutton said $4.20 and Albanese said $7 “if you can find them”. The answer was about $8 or $8.50. Read more here: Krishani Dhanjiwill be back with you bright and early tomorrow morning, as the election campaign enters its final week. In the meantime, take care and enjoy your evening. The winner of the debate has been revealed asAnthony Albaneseon 50%, as decided by 60 undecided voters. Peter Duttonpicked up 25% of the vote, and 25% remained undecided. More results are coming through from the undecided voters, showingPeter Duttonwith a clear majority on defence at 43%. Anthony Albanesegot 35% of the vote, while 20% were undecided. On the “hot takes” at the end of the debate, Albanese won a majority 50%. Dutton got 14%, while 36% remained undecided. Paterson: welcome to country ceremonies ‘tokenistic’ James Patersonhas also weighed in on welcome to country ceremonies, afterPeter Dutton’s comments that they had become “overdone”. Paterson said: Most Australians are very respectful of our Indigenous heritage and culture and they value it. We have all been to events and conferences where every speaker does an acknowledgment of country and there are five acknowledgments andit becomes tokenistic. Australians want it to be meaningful and not excessive. Katy Gallagherargued there was “a fair bit of aggro and interrupting when it came to that part of the debate” from Dutton. I saw aggro and I saw someone, an opposition leader, under pressure who is prepared to interrupt and try to disrupt. The finance minister,Katy Gallagher, and the Coalition’s campaign spokesperson,James Paterson, have joined the panel to weigh in on the debate and the results. Gallagher saidAnthony Albanese“nailed it” after being asked about his result on the cost of living. I think certainly the response from those audience numbers show that people understand while doing it tough the government is trying and looking at ways to help them through these times. Almost 50% of undecided voters side with Albanese on tax cuts We’re back from another break with more results from the 60 undecided voters. On tax cuts,Anthony Albanesereceived 49% of the votes, andPeter Dutton21%; 30% remained undecided. On Indigenous affairs, Dutton received 46% of the votes and Albanese received 27%; 27% were undecided. The undecided voters have weighed in on how they think the leaders performed on a matter of issues. On the cost of living, it was a major win forAnthony Albaneseat 65%; 16% voted withPeter Dutton, and 19% of voters remain undecided. The PM got 35% on housing, and Dutton got 30%; 35% were left undecided. Leaders quizzed on price of eggs Before we hear from the undecided voters, let’s just circle back to an earlier rapid-fire question the leaders were asked – about the price of eggs. Peter Duttonanswered that it would cost $4.20, whileAnthony Albanesesaid the cost would be $7, “if you can find them”. The actual price was shown to be about, or just more than, $8. The debate has now wrapped – and a studio audience of 60 undecided voters are gearing up to give their verdicts and decide a winner of the debate. Albanese’s final pitch: education key to country’s future The prime minister is giving his closing remarks, saying he is “optimistic about Australia’s future”. What gives me hope is the resilience, the courage, the optimism of the Australian people. We are the greatest country on the planet. We are driven by our people as well as of course the natural assets that we enjoy. I want to back our people through skills and training. That’s why we’re investing in every school by giving a better and fairer schools funding. That is why we are investing in early childhood education. That is why we are investing in free Tafe, to give people the opportunity to be the best they can. Anthony Albanesesaid that “if we get it right, the future is so bright for us because we live in the fastest-growing region of the world in human history and our people are our greatest asset.” Dutton’s final pitch:Coalitionwill provide good economic management in cost-of-living crisis Questions have now wrapped, and the leaders are giving their closing statements –Peter Duttonis up first. He echoed the sentiment of his opening remarks and said, “I don’t believe Australians can afford three more years of increased costs of everything.” I want to make sure we can deliver support immediately through the 25 cent a litre cut in fuel tax, the $1,200 tax rebate and I want to make sure that we can transform our energy market, get more gas into the system, bring the wholesale price of gas down by 23%. If we do that, we can bring down the costs across the economy. Dutton said that good economic management is “exactly what is required in our country right now”. If we make the right decisions now, we can protect our generation and future generations and make our country and our communities safer. Peter Duttonwas also played an audio clip of himself and asked about the Coalition’s backflip on its work from home policy. He said: I’ve apologised for the decision that we took in relation to work from home … What the prime minister did, as he’s done with a number of other issues, is twisted and contorted it into something it wasn’t. The point I made was that, yes, the prime minister’s scared, particularly women, and others into believing that we were doing something that we weren’t and I apologised for that. Albanese admits he changed his mind on stage-three tax cuts – and notes theCoalitionvoted for it Anthony Albanesewas played a clip of him saying “my word is my bond” and said “yes, I changed my mind” in relation to the stage-three tax cuts. What I did is fronted up, I went along to the National Press Club and did not pretend we had not changed our position, and I went along and argued the case and guess what? The Coalition voted for it. Peter Duttonwas asked if his word is his bond? He replied, “Yes, it is.” If you’re talking about the stage-three tax cuts, don’t forget … stage one and stage-two tax cuts were introduced by the Coalition government. The PM shot back and said: You voted for the change. Not only did we change our position, but it went through the parliament unanimously. Peter Duttonhas been asked about comparisons between him and Trump, and whether he has tried to distance himself from the US president. He said: I have not sought to be anybody other than myself. The debate has returned from a short break, and the leaders are now being asked a series of rapid-fire questions. They were shown images of their homes. The PM said “marriage” and the opposition leader answered “retirement home”. They were also shown a photo ofElon Muskand asked what comes to mind.Anthony Albaneseresponded: Telsa, and very rich man. Peter Duttonresponded: Evil genius. Nuclear power policy ‘will get lots of votes’, Dutton says If the Coalition’s nuclear policy is so good, why hasPeter Duttonnot visited any of the proposed nuclear reactor sites? The opposition leader said he had been to “three communities” and answered: I am proud of the fact we have taken the decision – and I have not taken it for political reasons because I think we will get lots of votes. Will Australians see you at a nuclear power plant site in the next six days? Dutton again said, “we have been to three communities”. The debate has now paused for a short break, after a bit more back-and-forth on the topic. Dutton happy to have nuclear power plant in his suburb Moving to energy,Peter Duttonis touting the Coalition’s nuclear policy backed by gas, arguing it would reduce prices: If we have a look around the world, the top 20 economies, Australia is the only one that has not signed up to nuclear power. Anthony Albanesesaid that under the former government, 24 out of 28 coal-fired power stations announced their closure. We are way behind, nothing was happening in terms of the investment that was needed and with renewables, already there has been a projects approved to power 10m homes. We think the future is renewables backed by gas, backed by hydro, backed by batteries. Dutton answered that he would be happy to have a nuclear power plant in his suburb. Which country poses the biggest threat to Australia’s security? Peter Duttonreferred to intelligence he received as defence minister and leader of the opposition, saying his biggest concern was China. [Intelligence agencies] are worried about the conflict in our region, and what that will do to impact on our trade and what it will do to our own security settings and what we would need to do to respond to a cyber-attack on our country. Asked if he is afraid of China,Anthony Albanesesaid he notes China “seeks to increase its influence in the region”. China is the major power in the region which is seeking to increase its influence. But the relationship is complex as well because China is our major trading partner. The PM was asked clearly what the biggest threat to Australia is, but deflected and responded: I am the prime minister of a country and how you deal as prime minister is diplomatically and that is what we continue to do.",

    "title": "Russia continues to strike Ukraine after Trump questions Putin’s commitment to peace",
    "article_text": "Russia has continued its assault on Ukraine with a series of drone attacks and airstrikes, hours after Donald Trump cast doubt on Vladimir Putin’s readiness to end the conflict. Three people were killed and four wounded on Sunday morning in airstrikes on Kostiantynivka in the Donetsk region, according to the regional prosecutor’s office. In a drone attack on the city of Pavlohrad in the Dnipro region, a person was killed and a 14-year-old girl wounded after a third consecutive night of assaults, the local governor, Serhiy Lysak, said. The US secretary of state,Marco Rubio, described the coming week as “very critical” for US attempts to end the war, telling the American broadcaster NBC that the administration would need to “make a determination about whether this is an endeavour that we want to continue to be involved in”. He was speaking after what was described in diplomatic circles as a potentiallyhistoric meetingbetween Ukraine’s leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and the US president, albeit only a 15-minute conversation, on the sidelines of the funeral of Pope Francis on Saturday. In a social media post sent during his flight back to the US afterwards, Trump suggestedRussia was not committedto negotiating a ceasefire. “There was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days,” he wrote. “It makes me think that maybe he doesn’t want to stop the war, he’s just tapping me along.” He also implied he was considering further sanctions againstRussia. The meeting had been the two men’s first encounter since their highly antagonistic confrontation in the Oval Office two months ago. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Russia would not stop targeting sites used by the Ukrainian military, including those involving European contributions to aid Kyiv or connected to foreign fighting forces. He claimed in an interview on CBS’s Face the Nation that a residential building in Kyiv last week, which washit by a Russian missilekilling at least 12 people, had not been an “absolutely civilian” target. “We will continue to target the sites used by the military ofUkraine, by some mercenaries from foreign countries and by instructors who the Europeans officially sent to help target Russian civilian sites,” he said in the interview, which was recorded on Thursday. Zelenskyy denied Moscow’s claims made on Saturday that Ukraine’s army had been forced out of Russia’s Kursk region. “Our military continues to actively defend the designated areas of the Kursk and Belgorod regions,” he wrote on Telegram, admitting that the situation remained difficult in those, and many other, areas. Ukraine’s army has dismissed as “propaganda tricks” Russia’s claims to have carried out the “full liberation” of the Kursk region, where Ukraine made considerable gains during a surprise offensive in August 2024. Zelenskyy said the tense situation on the frontlines and the position of the Russian army were an indication of the inadequacy of the “current pressure on Russia to end this war”. He said increased pressure on Moscow could bring more opportunities for “real diplomacy”. In Moscow, a man suspected of killing a Russian general in a car bomb explosion on Friday has said he was paid by the Ukrainian security service to carry out the deed, according to Russian authorities who said he had pleaded guilty to terrorism charges. Ignat Kuzinsaid he had received payment from Ukraine for killing Lt Gen Yaroslav Moskalik, a deputy head of the main operational department in the general staff of the Russian armed forces, who died just outside Moscow on Friday after a car bomb exploded as he was walking past. Ukraine has yet to respond to the accusations that it was involved in the second attack of its kind in four months in which a high-ranking Russian military officer was killed. Asked in his Sunday appearance on NBC’s Meet the Press about possible concessions to Russia, Rubio stressed the need to be “grownups and realistic”.“There is no military solution to this war. The only solution to this war is a negotiated settlement where both sides are going to have to give up something they claim to want and are going to have to give the other side something they wish they didn’t,” he said.",

    "title": "Bergen-Belsen survivors mark 80th anniversary of camp’s liberation",
    "article_text": "Survivors of the Nazi concentration camp Bergen-Belsen and their families have gathered at the site in northernGermanyto officially commemorate the 80th anniversary of its liberation by British troops. Representatives of victims’ associations and the military took part in the ceremony along with the British deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner. During the second world war, Soviet prisoners of war and later Jewish prisoners were held at the camp under extremely hostile conditions. According to the foundation responsible for the upkeep of the camp as a memorial site, about 20,000 prisoners of war and at least 52,000 concentration camp prisoners died there, including Anne Frank, the Jewish diarist, and her sister, Margot. Debbie Morag, who was born in Bergen-Belsen’s displaced persons’ camp in 1948, the daughter of twoHolocaustsurvivors, and now lives in Israel, told the participants: “My father had the number 126,715 on his arm, a symbol not only of brutality, but of perseverance. “My mother carried her memories silently, yet they filled our home. I often say that I absorbed the Holocaust with my mother’s milk – that’s how deeply it is connected to me.” Accompanying about 180 British Jews, including survivors and their relatives, the UK’s chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, read a psalm. Lola Hassid Angel, 88, from Greece, described the camp in an interview with the Guardian earlier this month as “an abomination that historians will one day refer to as a dark page but which we, as the last survivors, are duty-bound to describe”. At the ceremony, another survivor, 100-year-oldAlbrecht Weinberg, from Germany, recalled being taken half-dead by train from Auschwitz to Belsen. “I found myself lying amid the dead and the living on a wagon in Bergen-Belsen. Our bodies were tipped out. Two days later, a tank drove in. I thought now I’ll finally be freed by death, but it was British soldiers coming to liberate us. They later told me I’d weighed 29kg [4st 8lb].” At the time in April 1945, the Guardianreportedhow a senior medical officer with the British army had witnessed thousands of typhus, typhoid and tuberculosis cases on entering the camp, calling it “the most horrible, frightful place” he had ever seen. “There was a pile – 60 to 80 yards long, 30 yards wide, and 4ft high – of the unclothed bodies of women all within sight of several hundred children. Gutters were filled with rotting dead and men had come to the gutters to die, using the kerbstones as back rests,” the correspondent David Woodward wrote. Accounts from the camp by soldiers and journalists were spread around the world and proved more shocking in many ways than other discoveries of death camps to the east, such as Treblinka, Sobibor and Auschwitz, as they had either been demolished to hide evidence of the crimes committed there, or emptied of their inmates, who, like Weinberg, were sent on death marches. At Belsen, the camp construction and the evidence of what had taken place there remained intact. Some of the Nazi soldiers involved in the death machine were still on site. The sheer number of prisoners and the conditions at the camp led to mass outbreaks of dysentery, typhus and malnutrition, leading to about 500 deaths a day, most during the final weeks of the war. A documented 14,000 survivors died by the end of June 1945, many of whose digestive systems had been unable to cope with the food they were given after the liberation of the camp.",

    "article_text": "A murder inquiry has been launched after a bestselling German novelist was found dead on a houseboat in Hamburg having been violently attacked, police have said. Alexandra Fröhlich, 58, whose novels have had prominence on Germany’s bestseller lists, was found on Tuesday morning, investigating authorities said. The case was quickly passed to the murder squad amid evidence she had been attacked. Authorities have refused to give more details other than saying forensic evidence had been gathered and a coroner’s report submitted. According to the local broadcaster NDR, citing police sources, Fröhlich was shot. Investigators have issued an appeal for potential witnesses who may have observed suspicious activity on or around the long cerise houseboat in which Fröhlich resided, on the Holzhafen bank of the Elbe River in the eastern Moorfleet district. Her son discovered her body on Tuesday morning, according to police, who believe she died between midnight and 5.30am. “According to current information, relatives found the 58-year-old woman lifeless on her houseboat and alerted the fire brigade, who were only able to confirm the woman’s death,” a police spokesperson told local media. “After evaluating traces and evidence, the investigating authorities now believe that the woman died as a result of violence.” The spokesperson said investigators were looking into possible suspects and whether the killer may have been known to Fröhlich. “Given the ongoing investigation, no further information can be provided at this time,” he said. Media reported that divers were at the scene of the crime, amid speculation that the weapon could have been thrown into the Elbe. Fröhlich started out as a journalist, initially in Ukraine where she founded a women’s magazine in Kyiv. She later worked as a freelance journalist in Germany for women’s and other magazines such as Stern, before turning her hand to writing novels. In 2012 she published her debut novel, My Russian Mother-in-Law and other Catastrophes, which she said was based on her own experience of being married to a Russian. It entered the bestseller list of Der Spiegel magazine, one of the closest-observed indicators of fiction and nonfiction sales in Germany, where it remained for several months. It was subsequently translated into French. A critic at the time described it as “a hilarious west-east satire”. In 2016 she published the crime novel Death is a Certainty, which was similarly successful, and in 2019 she followed this with Skeletons in the Closet. Both were published by Penguin. Her novels were characterised by a mix of humour, family tales and social topics.",

    "article_text": "Thousands of people queued to visit Pope Francis’s tomb in Santa Maria Maggiore Basilica the day after heads of state, royalty and hundreds of thousands of mourners attended his funeral in Rome. Many crossed themselves and took photos on their phones as they filed past the tomb, marked simply with the name Franciscus. “Pope Francis for me was an inspiration, a guide,” said Elias Caravalhal, a Rome resident who came “to thank him for what he has done”. Susmidah Murphy, who was visiting the city from her home in India, said: “It’s unbelievable that he’s no more with us. It’s sad that we don’t get popes like this very often.” Many of those mourning the late pope were anxious about who would succeed him. Romina Cacciatore, 48, an Argentinian translator living inItaly, said Pope Francis had transformed the Roman Catholic church into “something more normal, more human. I’m worried about what’s coming.” Maria Simoni, 53, from Rome, said: “I hope we get another pope as skilled as Francis at speaking to people’s hearts, at being close to every person, no matter who they are.” Tatiana Alva, 49, from Peru, said Francis had been “very kind, humble. He used language young people could understand. I don’t think the next pope can be the same but I hope he will have an open mind and be realistic about the challenges in the world right now.” A special mass was held on Sunday morning in St Peter’s Square led by Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican’s secretary of state, who is the bookmakers’ favourite to succeed Francis. About 200,000 people attended, according to theVatican. More than 220 cardinals will meet at the Vatican on Monday morning to decide the date that the conclave to elect the next pope will begin. Only cardinals under the age of 80 – 135 in total – are eligible to take part inthe conclave, which will begin its deliberations after the completion of nine days of official mourning for Francis. Jean-Claude Hollerich, a cardinal from Luxembourg, has said he expects the conclave to start within a day or two of the end of the mourning period on 4 May. It must start by 10 May. Reinhard Marx, a German cardinal, said on Saturday the conclave would last just “a few days”. The cardinal-electors – about 80% of whom were appointed by Francis – will cast four votes a day until one candidate secures a two-thirds majority. The news that a successor has been chosen will be communicated by white smoke emitted from the Sistine Chapel. Cardinals were expected to pay their respects at Francis’s tomb at Santa Maria Maggiore on Sunday.",

    "title": "Campaigners sound alarm as European nations move to exit landmine ban",
    "article_text": "Rights groups have expressed alarm and warned of a slippery slope of again embracing one of the world’s most treacherous weapons, after five European countries said they intend to withdraw from the international treaty banning antipersonnel landmines. In announcing their plans earlier this year, Finland, Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania all pointed to the escalating military threat from Russia. In mid-April, Latvia’s parliament became the first to formallyback the idea, after lawmakers voted to pull out of the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty, which bans the use, production and stockpiling of landmines designed for use against humans. Campaigners described the decisions – the first reversals among its more than 165 signatories – as a shocking step backwards. “It feels like a punch to the face,” said Zoran Ješić, who lost his right leg to a landmine in Bosnia and now leads UDAS, a Bosnian organisation that supports landmine survivors. “Antipersonnel landmines do horrible things to innocent people. They belong to a small group of weapons, including chemical and biological weapons, that are so abhorrent they must never be used again.” Ješić was a 21-year-old soldier for the Bosnian army when he stepped on a mine in a forest, leaving him grappling with a lifetime of trauma and disability. “As I later heard, it was our mine,” said Ješić. “The point is that when you put a mine in the ground, you never know what will happen. Will it wait for your soldiers, your civilians or the enemies? Usually, it hurts your people.” His view is backed up by statistics. Each yearbetween70% and 85% of those who are killed or injured by landmines around the world are civilians. Nearly half of these victims are children, hinting at the indiscriminate nature of these weapons. Campaigners had long assumed that there was little probability of countries reversing their stances against landmines, said Alma Taslidžan of Humanity & Inclusion, which works to help disabled and vulnerable people around the world. “We really thought this kind of movement could never happen with landmines, because who wants landmines?” Instead her organisation and many others have been left scrambling to again warn of the overwhelming dangers of these weapons. “This is really a tipping point for us,” said Taslidžan. “It’s not only about landmines. It is about the norms that are written for the situation of wartimes – we’re afraid this is going to create a wave of weakening the international humanitarian law that has the first obligation to protect civilians.” The first public hint of the reversals came in March, when the defence ministers of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland publisheda joint statementexplaining their interest in leaving the treaty. “Military threats to Nato member states borderingRussiaand Belarus have significantly increased,” the statement noted. “With this decision, we are sending a clear message: our countries are prepared and can use every necessary measure to defend our security needs.” Russia, which is not a signatory to the 1997 treaty, has used landmines extensively since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, in-turn helping to make the country themost heavily minedin the world. Soon after, Finland, whose shared border with Russia runs for more than 800 miles, joined the list of countries threatening to leave the treaty.Doing so, the country’s prime minister, Petteri Orpo, told reporters, would give the country “the possibility to prepare for the changes in the security environment in a more versatile way”. Taslidžan stressed that there was little argument about the threat the five Nato countries were facing. “The security situation is real, it is a problem,” she said. “But choosing the most indiscriminate weapon amongst all to say that you are going to defend your country, that is wrong. Security cannot be built on a weapon that kills indiscriminately, that remains in the ground long after the conflict has ended and that specifically maims civilians.” Some of these countries’ readiness to embrace these long-banned weapons was likely due to misinformation that had circulated about “smart landmines” capable of curtailing civilian harms, she said. “It’s just bizarre information. There is not a smart landmine that can think for itself and say ‘Oh oh, civilians, we won’t explode now.’” While some landmines come with self-destruct mechanisms that enable them to detonate after a set period of time, campaigners have pointed out that they remain incapable of distinguishing between civilians and soldiers and thatmalfunction ratescan run as high as 10%, meaning a significant number may fail to destroy on command. At the International Committee of the Red Cross, the potential reversals were being seen as “extremely alarming,” said Maya Brehm, the legal adviser for the organisation’s unit focused on arms and conduct of hostilities. Sign up toThis is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion “From our perspective – and this is also a perspective shared by military authorities – whatever limited military value anti-personnel mines may still have in today’s conflicts, it is vastly outweighed by the appalling and long-lasting humanitarian consequences,” said Brehm. The reversals come at a critical moment. Conflicts inSyria, Myanmar and Ukraine haveled to an uptickin the number of landmine victims, while funding cuts threatened by US president Donald Trump’s administrationhave leftmine-clearance projects around the world facing uncertainty. Brehm worried that the withdrawals could set a wider precedent by suggesting that states could adopt rules in times of peace and later abandon these rules in times of conflict. “These treaties are for the protection of people, they’re humanitarian treaties. They are meant to be upheld at the darkest of times, when civilians depend on their protection for their very survival.” The concern was echoed by Norway’s foreign affairs minister, Espen Barth Eide, in explaining why the country, which also borders Russia, was opting to remain in the treaty. “This particular decision [by Finland] is something we regret,” he told Reutersthis month. “If we start weakening our commitment, it makes it easier for warring factions around the world to use these weapons again, because it reduces the stigma.” In Bosnia and Herzegovina, where conflict in the early 1990s left behind anestimated3 million unexploded landmines – amounting to about 152 mines per square mile – landmines continue to be a threat for many, said Ješić from the Bosnian organisation that provides support to landmine victims. “We’re not even close to having a land free of mines,” he added. “This is not just something that you can put in the ground and then you take it out when the war finishes.” As a result, three decades after the factions had put down their weapons, the lingering landmineshad perpetuatedthe violence, killing and injuring hundreds across the country. Ješić described it as a cautionary tale for any country thinking about scattering these weapons across their lands. “Tens of decades will probably be needed to clear the land of mines,” he said. “And in the meantime, who knows how many civilians will be killed and hurt by this terrible weapon.”",

    "title": "Israeli airstrike hits Beirut suburb despite ceasefire with Hezbollah",
    "article_text": "Israel conducted an airstrike on a residential neighbourhood of Dahiyeh in the southern suburbs of Beirut on Sunday afternoon despite a November ceasefire that officially ended fighting with the militant groupHezbollah. Videos showed three bombs hitting a building in Dahiyeh and rescue crews working to extinguish blazes after the blast; however, no casualties were reported. The Israeli military issued an evacuation warning before the bombing, prompting panic as residents fled the area. A spokesperson for the Israeli army said in a post on X that Israeli warplanes destroyed storage sites housing Hezbollah precision missiles. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and the defence minister, Israel Katz, said in a joint statement: “Israel will not allow Hezbollah to grow stronger and pose any threat to it – anywhere inLebanon.” The Lebanese president, Joseph Aoun, called on the US and France – both partners in the Hezbollah-Israel ceasefire deal – to put pressure on Israel to stop its strikes on Lebanon.“The ongoing Israeli attacks on Lebanon’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are unacceptable under any pretext,” Aoun said. Israel’s strikes on the greater Beirut area on Sunday pointed to the fragility of a November ceasefire agreement that put an end to evermore than 13 months of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. Fighting started after Hezbollah launched rockets at northern Israel on 8 October 2023 “in solidarity” with its ally Hamas’s attack on southern Israel a day earlier. In late September, Israel launched a ground invasion of southern Lebanon and wide-ranging airstrikes across Lebanon that killed about 3,900 people and displaced almost a million people in Lebanon. Despite the implementation of the ceasefire, Israel has conducted hundreds of airstrikes across Lebanon since November, which it says are targeting members of Hezbollah or the group’s infrastructure. Hezbollah has claimed responsibility for one rocket attack in north Israel which it called a “warning shot” since the ceasefire. Two additional rockets were launched at Israel from Lebanon in March, which Lebanese authoritiesblamedon a separate armed group. As of yet, Hezbollah has not responded to the near-daily Israeli strikes, instead deferring to the Lebanese state. The capabilities of the group, most of whose senior leadership have been killed over the last two years of fighting, are severely diminished. Under the terms of the ceasefire deal, Hezbollah is to withdraw and be replaced by the Lebanese army south of the Litani river – about 18 miles from the Israel-Lebanon border – and Israel is to withdraw its troops from south Lebanon. Most Israeli troops have withdrawn from south Lebanon, with the exception of five military points it maintains in Lebanon. Ceasefire violations in south Lebanon are meant to be referred to an independent committee and addressed by the Lebanese army, but Lebanese officials have complained that Israel is bypassing this process by unilaterally conducting strikes in Lebanon. The UN special coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert,saidSunday’s strike “generated panic and fear of renewed violence among those desperate for a return to normalcy”. Since the end of the fighting, Lebanon’s government has worked towards reestablishing a monopoly on arms within the country, under immense US pressure to disarm the group. Previously, the Iran-backed militia and political party’s resources dwarfed the Lebanese army, and the group dominated domestic politics for the two decades preceding the latest Israel-Hezbollah war. Hezbollah has said that it is in compliance with the terms of the ceasefire agreement as far as withdrawing from south Lebanon but its leader, Naim Qassem, said in an April speech that the group “will not let anyone disarm it”.",

    "title": "Gaza on brink of catastrophe as aid runs out and prices soar, groups warn",
    "article_text": "Soaring prices of basic foodstuffs, diminishing stocks of medical supplies and sharp cuts to aid distribution threaten newly catastrophic conditions acrossGaza, Palestinians and international aid officials in the battered territory are warning. Humanitarian organisations including theWorld Food Programmeand Unwra, which supplies food and services to more than 2 million Palestinians across Gaza, have now distributed the last of their stocks of flour and other foodstuffs to the dozens of community kitchens in the territory that serve basic meals to those with no other option. Aid groups’ warehouses were filled during the ceasefire betweenIsraeland Hamas that came into effect in mid-January and ended in early March. They are now empty. “There isn’t anything left to give them now, so once the last supplies have been used up, the kitchens will have to close,” said one senior UN official. “At the moment people are holding up OK but we know from other crises that when things deteriorate, they deteriorate very fast, and we are not far from that point.” Within hours of the ceasefire’s collapse almost two months ago, Israel blocked food, fuel, medicine or other items from entering Gaza. Dozens of bakeries that provided bread for hundreds of thousands have already shut down. The 47 community kitchens, which provide only lentils, plain pasta or rice, have already reduced portions.“These people who depend on us are threatened with starvation if this kitchen closes,” said Hani Abu Qasim, of the Rafah Charity Kitchen in Gaza. Markets across Gaza are nearly bare and anything on sale is now too expensive for the vast majority. Since the end of the ceasefire, the price of a kilogram of tomatoes has quadrupled to $8, sugar has gone up seven times and flour 10 to 15 times. Meat or dairy products are unobtainable. Um Aboud, 45, an academic and journalist in Gaza City, said: “We eat two meals a day, sometimes just one. We have only a small amount of food left. “The living conditions are extremely difficult. Hospitals are destroyed, with no treatment or medicine available. There is no clean water or electricity. Garbage surrounds us from every direction. Gaza has become a disease-ridden place. People are dying slowly, as if we have been sentenced to death.” Almost70% of Gazais now covered by evacuation orders issued by the Israeli military or is part of an expanded buffer zone controlled by Israeli troops. More than 400,000 people have been displaced since the collapse of the ceasefire. Israeli officials justify the blockade with claims that Hamas routinely steals aid, distributing it to its fighters or selling it to raise vital funds. Aid officials in Gaza deny any widespread theft of aid in recent months. In a sprawling tent camp outside the southern city of Khan Younis, Mariam al-Najjar and her mother-in-law prepared a meal for their family of 11 with four cans of peas and carrots, some rice, stock cubes and spices. Before the war, her family would eat a large meal of meat, stuffed vegetables or other traditional dishes on Fridays, Najjar said. “Now we eat peas and rice. We never ate canned peas before the war. Only in this war that has destroyed our lives.” The UN said it identified 3,700 children suffering from acute malnutrition in March, up 80% from February. Specialists from the UN’shunger monitoring system, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), are preparing a new assessment in Gaza, to be released next month, UN officials in Gaza said. There is also a growing shortage of medical supplies. “Everything from sterile gloves to body bags needs replenishment,” the International Committee of the Red Cross said. “This is an ongoing and particularly acute challenge as we unfortunately continue to see shockingly high numbers of sick people, including severely wounded patients, which increases pressure on the system.”The war in Gaza was triggered by a surprise attack launched by Hamas into Israel in October 2023, in which militants killed more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 250 hostages. Israeli officials say 59 hostages remain in Gaza, more than half of whom are thought to be dead. Israel says its blockade also aims to force Hamas into releasing hostages. Rights groups accuse Israel of using a “starvation tactic”, endangering the entire population and so making it a potential war crime. Hospitals in Gaza received the remains of 51 Palestinians over the past 24 hours who were killed in Israeli strikes, the local health ministry said on Sunday, bringing the Palestinian death toll from the war to 52,243.The overall toll includes nearly 700 bodies for which the documentation process was recently completed, the ministry said in its latest update. On Monday, the international court of justice (ICJ), the United Nation’s principal court, willbegin hearingsto establish if Israel’sban on all cooperationwith Unrwa’s activities in Gaza and the occupied West Bank is unlawful. Israel claims Unrwa has been infiltrated by Hamas, an allegation that has been fiercely contested. South Africafiled a complaintwith the ICJ in December 2023 alleging Israel was committing genocide in Gaza, which Israel denies.",

    "title": "Russia sends help to Iran after deadly port explosion",
    "article_text": "Vladimir Putin was one of the first world leaders to offer help to Iran in the aftermath of a massiveexplosion at a container depotin a key port near the strait of Hormuz, dispatching several emergency planes to the area. Fires still blazed nearly 24 hours after the explosion at the giant Shahid Rajaee port in southernIran, the nation’s most strategically important port and chief artery for its world trade. The death toll had risen to at least 28 and the numbers injured had risen to more than 1,000. Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, flew to Bandar Abbas, a city 20 miles to the west of the port in Hormozgan province, to be briefed on the investigation and rescue operation. With choking smoke and air pollution spreading across the area, schools and offices in Bandar Abbaswere ordered closed on Sunday, state TV reported. The health ministry urged residents to avoid going outside until further notice and to use protective masks. Early indications were that the explosion appears to have been an accident rather than a deliberate attack. The Tehran prosecutor’s office said it had filed charges against a variety of media outlets of different political persuasions, a reflection of officials’ concern at speculation that the explosion was an act of terror or due to mistakes by the army. CCTV footage circulating on Iranian media showed a localised fire starting five minutes after midday in a single container and then spreading rapidly to other containers, and port workers starting to run away. A vast explosion then occurs within two minutes, knocking out the camera. The interior ministry launched an inquiry. No official explanation has been given for the explosion yet but there were growing reports that the storage of chemicals in containers in high temperatures may have been to blame. Evidence of previous, smaller incidents was being cited, as well as claims that much of the regime surrounding health and safety protocols, especially concerning the inspection of chemical storage, had been contracted out. The Kremlin website said Putin had conveyed his “words of sincere sympathy and support to the families of the victims as well as his wishes for a recovery to all those injured”.Russiadispatched planes carrying specialist firefighters. The explosion happened just as a third round of talks between the US and Iran started, designed to lead to fresh controls being placed on Iran’s nuclear programme in return for the lifting of US sanctions. The Iranian foreign ministry described the talks, mediated by Oman and held in Muscat, as serious, practical and more detailed than those previously. Another round of talks is due to be held in a week’s time.",

    "title": "Israel faces legal pressure at UN’s top court over Unrwa ban",
    "article_text": "Israel will come under sustained legal pressure this week at the UN’s top court when lawyers from more than 40 states will claim the country’s ban on all cooperation with the UN’s Palestinian rights agency Unrwa is a breach of the UN charter. The five days of hearings at the international court of justice (ICJ) in The Hague have been given a fresh urgency by Israel’s decision on 2 March toblock all aid into Gaza, but the hearing will focus on whether Israel – as a signatory to the UN charter – acted unlawfully in overriding the immunities afforded to a UN body. Israel ended all contact and cooperation with Unrwa operations in Gaza, West Bank and East Jerusalem in November, claiming the agency had been infiltrated by Hamas, an allegation that has been contested. Unrwa supplies food, schooling and medical services to 2 million people inGaza. The UN World Food Programme said on Friday it had run out of stocks for kitchens serving hot food inside Gaza. The Unrwa commissioner general, Philippe Lazzarini, accused Israel of engineering a human-made famine, and even the US president, Donald Trump, said he had urged Israel to allow food into Gaza. A total of 45 countries and organisations, including the UN itself, have requested an advisory opinion from the 15-strong judging panel on Israel’s actions. The only countries likely to defend Israel in court are the US and Hungary. Israel has submitted a written defence, but is not due to make an oral submission this week. The hearings represent the biggest test of Israel’s defiance of international law since the ICJ’s landmark rulings in January, March and June of 2024 that ordered it to take immediate steps to allow aid to enter Gaza unhindered. In July 2024, the ICJ also found Israel’s occupation of thePalestinian territorieswas unlawful. Israel has largely refused to comply with the advisory orders attached to these rulings, adding to the crisis of confidence in the credibility of the international legal system. The Palestinian rights group Al-Haq said it was “imperative” that Israel’s seat at the UN general assembly be withdrawn if Israel ignored another ICJ advisory opinion, saying the public’s faith in international law “hangs in the balance”. The legal challenge arose from a 137 to 12 vote at the UN general assembly in December to seek an ICJ advisory opinion on whether Israel, as a signatory to the UN charter, was violating the immunities and privileges that member states are required to give to UN bodies such as Unrwa. The agency does not just supply aid to Palestinians, but also runs medical services and schools in Gaza,West Bankand neighbouring states. Six Unrwa schools in East Jerusalem have already been shut, the subject of a separate domestic court challenge brought by Adalah, a Palestinian legal rights group. The UN’s legal claim is backed by more than 1,500 pieces of documentation, including proceedings of the UN security council, the general assembly and UN agencies setting out Unrwa’s genesis, its status within the UN structure and its 1967 operational agreements with Israel. The ICJ, as the UN’s top court responsible for inter-state disputes, sets store by UN findings. The UN will be represented by its new legal counsel, Elinor Hammarskjöld, a Swedish lawyer and diplomat. At issue are two Knesset bills passed on 28 October that declared Unrwa harboured terrorists, and instructed the government to end all cooperation and contact with the organisation, including the supply of visas to Unrwa international staff. It has become part of a wider Israeli threat to withhold visas to staff of NGOs that criticise Israel. On 2 March, Israel, independently of its decision to freeze out Unrwa, suspended the supply of all aid into Gaza in a bid to crush Hamas. France, Germany and the UK last week condemned as unacceptable remarks by the Israeli defence minister, Israel Katz, linking the supply of aid to political pressure on Hamas. In a version of the Israeli government’s defence, UK Lawyers for Israel said in a paper last week that Israel had a right to terminate its agreement with Unrwa and to ban the UN and its agencies from carrying out activities on its sovereign territory, especially in wartime. Moreover, Israel was free to choose how to comply with its obligations to facilitate the provision of humanitarian aid to the Palestinian population, and was not required to do so under the auspices of Unrwa, the paper claimed. The group also claims that the ICJ does not have the capacity, or neutrality, to determine a case that largely turns on disputed facts, including whether Unrwa had been fatally infiltrated by Hamas, and whether alternatives to Unrwa such as the WFP can deliver aid. In what looked like a shot across UN’s bows before the case, the US justice department told the New York district court on Thursday that Unrwa and its staff did not enjoy immunity in the US courts, reversing the Biden administration’s view. The move, in theory, opens the way for victims of Hamas terrorism to seek compensation from Unrwa officials. In a measure of the existential crisis facing Unrwa, the UN has appointed a former British diplomat, Ian Martin, to undertake a review of the agency’s future role and finances.",

    "title": "India test-fires missiles as tensions rise with Pakistan after Kashmir attack",
    "article_text": "India’s navy test-fired missiles on Sunday, showcasing its ability to carry out “long-range, precision offensive” strikes, as tensions with Pakistan rise afterlast week’s terrorist attackin Indian-administered Kashmir that killed 26 civilians. “Indian Navy ships undertook successful multiple anti-ship firings to re-validate and demonstrate readiness of platforms, systems, and crew for long-range precision offensive strike,” the navy posted on X, as the prime minister,Narendra Modi, promised a “harsh response” to the attack at a tourist site, the deadliest against civilians in Kashmir in 25 years. Modi, who has been briefing world leaders to build support for India’s position, told listeners in his monthly radio address that every Indian’s blood was “on the boil”. His words echoed previous statements where he vowed to hunt down the attackers “to the ends of the Earth” and turn terrorist hideouts “into dust”. The missiles launched are designed for powerful, long-range, high-precision strikes. The navy stressed the importance of the drills in maintaining “operational” readiness as military rhetoric intensified on both sides. Pakistan’s railway minister, Hanif Abbasi, warned over the weekend that the country’s nuclear arsenal of more than 130 missiles was “not kept as models” and was aimed “only for India … these ballistic missiles, all of them are targeted at you”. Abbasi’s comments fuelled concerns the nuclear-armed neighbours were headed for a wider confrontation. India and Pakistan have fought three wars, two overKashmir, which each holds in part but claims in full. They have come to the brink many other times, leading the former US president Bill Clinton to call the Himalayan region the world’s “most dangerous place”. Pakistan’s military doctrine of Full Spectrum Deterrence focuses on using tactical nuclear weapons to deter conventional threats, while India’s Cold Start doctrine is designed to deliver swift conventional strikes before escalation. These contrasting strategies have raised fears any confrontation could quickly spin out of control. “From Delhi’s perspective, given public pressure, the egregiousness of last week’s attack, and a desire to restore deterrence, some type of military response is quite likely. And if it happens, Pakistan, not wishing to look weak, would most certainly retaliate,” said the foreign policy author and analyst Michael Kugelman. “An all-out war is unlikely, as India, despite its relentless tough talk, is most focused on limited options like degrading anti-Indian terrorists and restoring deterrence,” he said. “That said, one can’t completely rule out worst-case scenarios, depending on the nature of a potential Indian strike, how Pakistan might respond to any initial Indian military action, and the ever-present miscalculation risk,” Kugelman added. “And given that these are nuclear-armed rivals, the stakes are quite high.” New Delhi has accused Islamabad of links to the attack, in which terrorists singled out Hindu men and killed them. While presenting no public proof, it has pointed to Islamabad’s past support for terrorists targeting India. In tit-for-tat moves, India suspended the Indus waters treaty, expelled Pakistani diplomats, and cancelled Pakistani visas. Islamabad retaliated by expelling Indian diplomats, cancelling Indians’ visas, closing its airspace, and suspending the 1972 Shimla agreement, a key dialogue framework. While Modi’s speech marked a continued commitment to retaliation, Pakistan’s prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, sounded more conciliatory, saying Pakistan was “fully prepared to cooperate with any neutral investigators” and reaffirmed “Pakistan’s strong desire for peace”. At the same time, he reiterated Kashmir remained Pakistan’s “jugular vein”, a position enunciated by the late founder of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. As tensions escalated, Indian and Pakistani troops exchanged fire on Sunday for a third day along the line of control dividing Kashmir, a frequent flashpoint. Fuelling speculation about possible Indian military action, India’s information ministry issued a media advisory warning against live broadcasting of military operations. Echoing concerns from past crises such as the 1999 Kargil war and the 2008 Mumbai attacks, the advisory reflected fears about real-time broadcasts compromising sensitive strategies. In Kashmir, Indian forces have launched an extensive crackdown. Security forces have targeted suspected terrorists, demolishing at least 10 homes linked to militants as part of a wider effort to dismantle what India calls the “terrorism ecosystem”. Rights groups have raised concerns, and reports have estimated up to 1,500 young men have been detained or questioned. Tensions have flared over water usage. India’s release of water from the Uri Dam caused the Jhelum River to surge, flooding parts of Pakistan-administered Kashmir. It followed India’s suspension of the treaty governing the region’s rivers. Pakistan has warned any water interference would be an “act of war”.",

    "title": "UK growth forecast to slow sharply as Trump tariffs push confidence to record low",
    "article_text": "The UK economy is set to slow sharply for the next two years as Donald Trump’s global tariff war weighs on consumer spending and business investment, a study by a leading forecaster has predicted. The findings byEYItem Club, which is sponsored by the big four accountancy firm EY, come as a separate survey reported that confidence in Britain’s economy has fallen to the lowest level on record. The latest poll by Ipsos Mori, which has been tracking net economic optimism in Britain since 1978, found that three-quarters of Britons expect the economy to get worse over the next year. Just 7% of Britons think the economy will improve, while 13% thought it would stay the same, equating to a net score of -68. EY’s forecast said it now expects UK gross domestic product (GDP) to grow by 0.8% this year, down from a projection of 1% in February, and has cut its 2026 forecast from 1.6% to 0.9% as longer-term effects hit the UK. Last week, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) downgraded itsgrowth forecast for the UK this year to 1.1%, from the 1.6% it had been forecasting as recently as January, while the governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, said the UK faced a“growth shock”from Trump’s trade policies. About 16% of UK goods exports go to the US – where there is a “baseline” 10% import tariff for most countries and 25% for cars, steel and aluminium – which will directly affect growth by driving down demand for UK products. However, EY Item Club said that the bigger hit is likely to come from the indirect impact of the new policies weighing on British consumers already cautious about committing to spending on bigger ticket items. Businesses are also likely to limit the amount they invest over the next two years as a result. Research indicates British businesses are reacting to potential supply chain disruption from tariffs by targeting new export markets in Asia, Africa and Australia. Expanding or exporting overseas is a top priority for almost a third of mid-size UK businesses over the next year, a survey of 500 businesses by advisory and accountancy firm BDO found. Overall, almost 40% of firms polled expect to increase exports over the next year, rising to more than half of businesses in the retail, wholesale and tech sectors. Sign up toBusiness Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion More than one-third of those hoping to boost their international sales are aiming for growth in Africa, while 38% intend to increase sales to Australia, and 30% focusing on Asian growth. British exporters are expected to put new focus on EU states, with 41% of UK mid-sized businesses aiming to boost sales to member nations. “Although conditions remain challenging, the UK’s mid-sized businesses are highly ambitious and have their sights firmly set on driving growth,” said Richard Austin, a partner at BDO. “Generating £130bn in revenue from overseas trade alone last year, these businesses are the strongest engine for our economy.” It emerged last week that Apple is reportedly planning toswitch assembly of all iPhones for the US market to India, as the company seeks to reduce its reliance on a Chinese manufacturing base amid Trump’s trade war.",

    "article_text": "A British Paralympian has been reported missing inLas Vegasafter not being seen for more than a week. Sam Ruddock, fromWarwickshire, who has cerebral palsy and has competed in cycling and shot put, travelled to the US on 13 April while planning to attend WrestleMania, his friend Lucy Earl said. Earl, who has been friends with Ruddock for more than 10 years, said the 35-year-old stayed with her the night before his flight, and she last heard from him on 16 April. She said she contacted police and tracked down the hostel Ruddock was staying in, and was told he did not check out when he should have or collect his belongings. The Paralympian has since been reported missing to police in the UK and US. Earl described him as a “big character with lots of energy”. She said: “Sam is very, very present on social media, he’s such a passionate person about sports. “He flew on the 13th, I’ve got confirmation that he landed, I absolutely know Sam was in Vegas. The concerning part is he went silent from the 16th and, because he is such a big presence on social media, people were quite fast to notice.” Earl said Ruddock was an “infectious” person and a “phenomenal” human being. She said she has started a social media campaign to try to get information. A spokesperson for British Cycling said: “British Cycling understands that para-cyclist Sam Ruddock was reported missing to UK and US police and Interpol after not being heard from since Wednesday 16 April 2025, while visiting Las Vegas, USA. “We urge anyone who has been in contact with Sam since 16 April or may have any information of his whereabouts to contact their local police department as soon as possible.” Lincolnshire police confirmed it has an active missing person investigation for Ruddock. A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said: “We are supporting the family of a British man reported missing in Las Vegas and are in contact with the local authorities.”",

    "title": "Counter-terrorism police examine Facebook ‘massacre’ posts after Leeds attack",
    "article_text": "Facebook posts appearing to contain plans for a “massacre” are being examined by counter-terrorism police investigating an attack in which two women were seriously injured in Leeds. A man, 38, who suffered a “self-inflicted injury” was arrested and two weapons – a crossbow and a firearm – were recovered from the scene, on the popular Otley Run pub crawl route in the north of the city. He was described on Sunday as a “key suspect” by police who said he remained in hospital in a critical condition. One of the two women – who are aged 19 and 31 – has been discharged from hospital, but the other underwent surgery after suffering life-threatening injuries and is in a stable condition. Police also said they were aware of video being circulated on social media, a reference to footage which appeared to have been taken from a passing car and shows a black-clad man carrying an implement and with a carry case slung over his shoulder. The head of Counter Terrorism Policing North East, Det Ch Supt James Dunkerley, said officers were working at pace to establish the full facts and circumstances of Saturday’s incident, but added: “We are not currently seeking anyone else in connection with this matter, which has caused understandable concern. We believe it was an isolated incident.” Alex Sobel, the Labour MP for Leeds Central and Headingley, said he had spoken to the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, on Sunday afternoon and would remain in touch with her as well as the security minister, Dan Jarvis, regarding aspects of the incident. “I want to thank local people and the blue light services in how they responded to this and the fact that the area has now been cleared and is no longer a live crime scene,” he said. “The broader implications of an attack in which lethal weapons were found in a very busy area where the country’s most populous pub crawl takes place is a real concern,” he added. Sobel said he would be raising the issue of the availability of weapons linked to the incident, and how to keep people safe when they are standing in large groups and queueing. Counter-terror police are examining a number of Facebook posts – including one which appeared to include plans for a “mass-murder” attack – to determine if they are linked to the attacker or the incident. The post appeared before the attack on a Facebook account that indicated far-right sympathies as well as reflecting the “mixed ideology” that has increasingly been on the radar of counter-terrorism police. The posts listed as “targets” students, nightclub goers and “neurotypicals”. Reference was made to a “manifesto” written by a man who killed 51 people during shootings at a mosque and Islamic centre in New Zealand in 2019. Facebook’s parent company, Meta, told the Guardian that it had taken action to remove an account apparentlyassociated with the incident. The home secretary received further updates on Sunday from counter-terrorism police after she was first briefed in the wake of the attack. The incident caused shock across the community in the Headingley area of Leeds over the weekend, where large numbers of students and others routinely take part in the pub crawl route, days before the summer term starts for many university courses. One venue, Taylor’s Sports Bar and Grill, remained closed all weekend due to the police investigation but posted on Facebook that it intended to reopen on Monday, “While appalling to witness some of the scenes first-hand, lowlife scum like this will never win in our society,” the statement added. A member of staff at another bar said they had seen dozens of emergency service vehicles descend on the area on Saturday afternoon after the attack, although it took hours for people to become fully aware of what had happened. “We were told and were on high alert, but otherwise you wouldn’t have known. It wasn’t until the evening that people started asking about it,” they said. “I think people have been really shaken by it.” A fortnight ago, the Guardian revealed that counter-terrorism police and the National Crime Agency had set up a new joint taskforce to tackle young males fixated with violence online which is often also fuelled by “strongly misogynistic” online material.",

    "title": "London Marathon sets world record for number of finishers",
    "article_text": "The London Marathon’s organisers have hailed an “extraordinary” day in the nation’s capital, as the 45th edition beat the world record for number of finishers and attracted record crowds. By 6.30pm on Sunday evening, the number of finishers had surpassed the previous best of 55,646 for a mass participation race set in New York. Meanwhile, race director Hugh Brasher said that about 800,000 people had cheered them on – approximately 60,000 more than usual – due to the warm weather and higher number of participants. “It’s been an extraordinary day of records,” said Brasher. “But, more importantly, an extraordinary day of people coming together and supporting each other in this quest that outwardly is about running 26.2 miles, but actually is much more about celebrating humanity.” “The spectator data takes time to crunch,” he added. “But we believe there were 60,000 more people watching, which is the size of a massive football match. I’d be absolutely gobsmacked if it wasn’t a record crowd.” Those running includedSergio Aguiar and David Stancombe, who were raising money for projects set up in their daughters’ memory after they were murdered in the Southport attack. Both finished in just over four hours; however, Aguair collapsed to the ground shortly after crossing the line. In a video message, played to the families before the race, Keir Starmer paid tribute to the two men, who lost their daughters Alice Aguiar, nine, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, while they attended a Taylor Swift-themed dance workshop in July. “This is an incredible way to honour the memory of your precious daughters and the entire nation is in awe of your courage and your resilience,” the UK prime minister said. The finishers also includedLindsay Burrow, the wife of rugby league great Rob Burrow, who died in June 2024 after being diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2019. Burrow, who said that running had given her a “focus and purpose”, finished the race in just under five hours. Thewomen’s race was won by the Ethiopian Tigist Assefa, who set a new women’s-only world record of 2:15.50. However, that record, which applies to races without a male pacemaker, was six minutes behind the official women’s record, set last year. Eilish McColgan was the leading British woman home, coming eighth in her first marathon in a time of 2:24.25 – although it was several minutes slower than she had hoped after the warmer than expected weather. “I was just determined to put one foot in front of the other,” she said. “I think if you look at a lot of British athletes, everyone was a little bit off where they wanted. Maybe it did have a bit more of an impact than we thought.” Meanwhile in the men’s race,won by the Kenyan Sabastian Sawe, there was a creditable performance by Britain’s Olympic triathlon gold medallist Alex Yee. Yee, who was running in his first marathon, finished in 2:11.8, and afterwards paid tribute to the crowds. “That was seriously tough but probably one of the best moments of my life,” he said. “I expected the crowds to be good but that was a whole other level. “I am just immensely proud to have run the London Marathon,” he added. “Obviously, in the second half I faded quite a lot. But I am so proud to be part of such an amazing day.” The Guinness World Records team were also kept busy, with 42 unusual records being set – including by Chris “Rhino Boy” Green, who broke one for the most marathons run in a 3D costume. “You could not find a happier rhino right now,” said Green after completing his 113rd marathon as a rhino and raising money for the Save the Rhino charity. As the day came to an end, Brasher said that the celebration and joy he had seen once again painted London in its best light. “Three-quarters of the people out there are running for a charity – and everyone has a reason to run,” he said. “People have asked: ‘Why are you trying to break the world record for finishers?’ But it’s not about that. “What we’re trying to do is give as many people as we can the opportunity to experience something that is life affirming, that is community building, that is good for their physical and mental health, and truly will give them an experience like no other.” And, once again, the London Marathon duly delivered.",

    "title": "Trump officials deport two-year-old US citizen and mother of one-year-old girl",
    "article_text": "TheTrump administrationhas removed a two-year-old US citizen from the country “with no meaningful process”, according to a federal judge, while in a different case the authorities deported the mother of a one-year-old girl, separating them indefinitely. Lawyers in the two cases, the first inLouisianaand the second in Florida, say their clients were arrested at routine check-ins at Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) offices and were given virtually no opportunity to speak with them or family members. They are the latest examples of the White Housecracking down ondocumented immigrants, including green card holders and even citizens who have the status by birth or naturalization. The unorthodox policy and the frequent avoidance of due process has brought about aclash with the judicialbranch of the US government in a battle over the constitution. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the National Immigration Project and several other allied groups said in a statement that such actions are a “shocking – although increasingly common – abuse of power”. The US district judge Terry Doughty in Monroe,Louisiana, said the two-year-old girl, who was referred to as VML in court documents, was sent with her deported mother to Honduras. “It is illegal and unconstitutional to deport, detain for deportation, or recommend deportation of a US citizen,” said the judge. He scheduled a hearing for 19 May “in the interest of dispelling our strong suspicion that the government just deported a US citizen with no meaningful process”. VML was apprehended by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) on Tuesday with her mother, Jenny Carolina Lopez Villela, and older sister when Villela attended a routine appointment at itsNew Orleansoffice, according to a filing by Trish Mack, who said the child’s father asked her to act as the child’s custodian. The girl’s father is seeking to have her returned to the United States. Immigrants of all sorts with cases in process, pending appeals or parole, have routinely been required to regularlycheck in with Ice officers, sometimes for many years. And so long as they had not violated any regulations or committed any crimes, they were usually sent on their way. Now, as the Trump administration pushes for the massarrestanddeportationof immigrants, check-ins have become increasingly fraught. According to Mack, when VML’s father briefly spoke to Villela, he could hear her and the children crying. According to a court document, he reminded her that a US citizen “could not be deported”. However, prosecutors said Villela, who has legal custody, told Ice that she wanted to retain custody of the girl and take her toHonduras. They said the man claiming to be VML’s father had not presented himself to Ice despite requests to do so. VML is not prohibited from entering the US, federal prosecutors said. She was among two families deported from Louisiana, also including one pregnant woman, the advocacy groups noted. The Department of Homeland Security and the justice department did not immediately respond to requests from news agencies for comment. Tricia McLaughlin, the assistant secretary for public affairs at DHS, later sent a statement to the Guardian that read: “This parent made the decision to take the child with them toHonduras. It is common that parents want to be removed with their children. Parents are asked if they want to be removed with their children or Ice will place the children with someone the parent designates. In this case, the parent stated they wanted to be removed with the children.” It continued: “We take our responsibility to protect children seriously and will continue to work with federal law enforcement to ensure that children are safe and protected.” Sign up toThis Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration after newsletter promotion “These actions stand in direct violation of Ice’s own written and informal directives, which mandate coordination for the care of minor children with willing caretakers – regardless of immigration status – when deportations are being carried out,” the ACLU said. In Florida, meanwhile, a Cuban-born woman who is the mother of a one-year-old girl and the wife of a US citizen was detained at a scheduled check-in with Ice in Tampa, her lawyer said on Saturday.Heidy Sánchez was held without any communication and flown to Cuba two days later. She is still breastfeeding her daughter, who suffers from seizures, her lawyer, Claudia Cañizares, said. Cañizares said she tried to file paperwork with Ice to contest the deportation on Thursday morning but Ice refused to accept it, saying Sánchez was already gone. Sánchez is not a criminal and has a strong case on humanitarian grounds for staying in the US, Cañizares said. Donald Trump, whose presidential campaigns havefocused heavilyon immigration, said earlier this month he wanted to deport some violent criminals who are US citizens to Salvadorian prisons, where he moved hundreds of Venezuelans and some Salvadorians to last month without even a court hearing. He sent them toa brutal prisonfor suspected gangsters and terrorists, claiming they were all violent criminals; it has since been argued that most were not and those who might have been had the right to due process. The comments from Trump about sending US citizens or what he termed “homegrown” criminals to another country to be incarcerated have alarmed civil rights advocates, and the move is viewed by many legal scholars as unconstitutional. TheUS supreme courthas ordered the Trump administration to “facilitate” the return of Maryland residentKilmar Ábrego García, whowas sentto El Salvador on 15 March with hundreds of others despite a US court order protecting him from deportation. Opinion polls in the last week show Trumpstruggling for approvalwith voters who were surveyed, including on some of his hardline anti-immigration tactics. Reuters and the Associated Press contributed reporting This article was amended on 27 April 2025. An earlier version said that the US supreme court ordered theTrump administrationto “facilitate and effectuate” Ábrego García’s return. In fact, it was the US district court that so ordered. However, the supreme court said the additional requirement to “effectuate” his return was unclear and may have exceeded the judge’s authority. This article was also amended to include comment from DHS.",

    "title": "Trump golf club to host speaker who markets bleach as health treatment",
    "article_text": "Donald Trump’s private golf resort in South Florida will next week host one of the world’s leading purveyors of chlorine dioxide, a potentially life-threatening form of industrial bleach that is claimed without evidence to be a cure for cancer, Covid and autism. Andreas Kalcker is among50 listed speakersat the “Truth Seekers Conference”, a two-day event opening on Thursday at the US president’s resort, Trump National Doral Miami. The event features several anti-vaxxers and other conspiracy theorists who have been brought together by the far-right commentator Charlie Ward. Kalcker, a German national thought to be living in Switzerland, markets the bleach under the brand name “CDS”, for chlorine dioxide solution. Hisonline brochuresclaim that the toxic chemical, which he admits is adisinfectant, can “eliminate pathogens” that cause disease. He boasts it is “possibly the greatest medical discovery of the last 100 years”. Government health authorities in the US and Spain have denounced the remedy as fraudulent, saying it is no different from drinking bleach. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has warned that it can cause serious and even life-threatening side-effects, including dehydration, diarrhoea andkidney injury. Kalcker’s appearance at Thursday’s conference is the latest indication that potentially dangerous alternative health approaches are being emboldened and are proliferating during Trump’s second term in the White House. The US president’s choice of the prominent vaccine skeptic, Robert Kennedy Jr, to head the Department of Health and Human Services has spread alarm through medical circles. Kennedy, who until 2023 led the anti-vaccine group Children’s Health Defense, has talked about treating the current measles outbreak in Texas withcod liver oil. He also praised without any evidence two doctors in Texas whomhe claimedhad “healed” 300 children with measles using the inhaled steroid budesonide. At hisconfirmation hearingsfor the health secretary job, Kennedy directly mentioned chlorine dioxide. He praised Trump’s handling of pandemic, saying the president had not only speeded up the search for a Covid vaccine but had looked at “all of the different remedies including … even chlorine dioxide”. Kennedy’s remark helped solve one of the enduring mysteries of Trump’s first term. In April 2020, early in the pandemic, he astonished medical scientists around the world by advocating the use of “disinfectant” as a treatment for Covid. At a White House press conference,Trump said: “I see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute, one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning?” Kennedy’s confirmation comments clarified that Trump was indeed referring to chlorine dioxide, a toxin that been falsely claimed as a “miracle cure” for autism, cancer, malaria and HIV/Aids. Since Trump re-entered the White House in January his new administration has overseen an unprecedented censorship of government information relating to science. Several federal public health websites and databases havegone dark. The FDAwebsite pagethat describes chlorine dioxide as a “powerful bleach typically used for industrial water treatment”, and warning that it can be life threatening, has been taken down and replaced with a “page not found” notice. However, apress releasefrom 2019 publicizing an FDA announcement on the dangers of chlorine dioxide can still be found on the FDA website. It states: “The US Food and Drug Administration is warning consumers not to purchase or drink a product sold online as a medical treatment due to a recent rise in reported health issues. Chlorine dioxide products, when mixed, develop into a dangerous bleach which has caused serious and potentially life-threatening side effects.” The main distributor of “miracle cure” bleach in the US, Mark Grenon, was sentenced tofive years in prisonfor selling an “unapproved and misbranded drug” in October 2023. His sons Jonathan and Jordan Grenon were sentenced to more than 12 years in federal prison. Kalcker is one of the most prominent peddlers of the bleach remedy. He has had success selling chlorine dioxide through many Latin American countries, including Bolivia and Mexico. He wraps his product in pseudo-scientific language, calling himself Dr Kalcker and claiming he is a specialist in “electromolecular medicine”. He has set up what he calls atraining institute, and claims without evidence that his products can lead to “recovery” from autism, dramatic improvement in Parkinson’s disease, and healing from “vaccine damage”. “Kalcker presents himself as a doctor, is very clever, and has created a product that sounds and looks plausible. But at the same time he is promoting the lunatic idea that autism is caused by parasites,” said Fiona O’Leary, a campaigner against pseudoscience who has autistic children. In 2021, Kalcker wasinvestigatedby Argentinian authorities and charged with falsely promoting bleach as a medical cure following the death of a five-year-old boy who had been given chlorine dioxide by his parents. In addition to promoting his remedy on stage at Trump’s Doral resort, Kalcker will be selling books about his bleach product at a vendor stall. The Guardian asked Trump’s resort whether it was appropriate to allow its space to be used to promote a potentially dangerous bleach remedy, but received no immediate reply. The organiser of the Doral conference, Charlie Ward, is an associate of the president’s son, Eric Trump. He has promoted a number of conspiracy theories including QAnon. In aspeech in 2022recorded by the monitoring group Media Matters he downplayed the Holocaust, saying that fewer people had died as a result of it than through vaccines. “More people have been killed by the jab than were killed in the Holocaust,” he said.",

    "article_text": "House minority leaderHakeem Jeffriesand New Jersey senatorCory Bookerwere holding a sit-in protest and discussion on Sunday on the steps of the US Capitol in opposition toRepublicans’ proposed budget plan. Billed as an “Urgent Conversation with the American People”,the livestreamed discussioncomes before Congress’s return to session on Monday, where Democrats hope to stall Republicans’ economic legislative agenda. Throughout the day, they were joined by other Democratic lawmakers, including the senator Raphael Warnock,who spokeas the sit-in passed the 10-hour mark. The proposed budget for the 2026 fiscal year,the New York Times reported on Friday, includes cuts to programs that support childcare, health research, education, housing assistance, community development and the elderly. “Republican leaders have made clear their intention to use the coming weeks to advance a reckless budget scheme to President Trump’s desk that seeks to gut Medicaid, food assistance and basic needs programs that help people, all to give tax breaks to billionaires,” Booker and Jeffries aid in a statement. “Given what’s at stake, these could be some of the most consequential weeks for seniors, kids and families in generations,” they added. Bookerwrote separately on X: “This is a moral moment in America. Sitting on the Capitol steps with Leader Hakeem Jeffries this morning to discuss what’s at stake with Trump’s budget and affirm the need for action to protect Medicaid, food assistance, and other safety net programs.” Booker and Jeffries started their sit-in around 6am and were joined by lawmakers including Democratic senators Chris Coons and Angela Alsobrooks and representatives Sarah McBride, Maxwell Frost, Gil Cisneros and Gabe Amo, among others. Labor leaders, including Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, also took part in the event that stretched for more than 12 hours. Reverend Dr William J Barber II and the National Education Association president, Becky Pringle, also joined. Pringle said the Trump administration was perpetuating “the greatest assault on public education that we’ve ever seen in this country”. Democrats and independents have added a new degree of physicality to their opposition to the Trump agenda. Earlier this month, Booker set a new record for the chamber’s longest speech when he held the floor, without a bathroom break, for more than 25 hours. Booker said he was doing so with the “intention of disrupting the normal business of the United States senate for as long as I am physically able” in order to protest the actions of Trump and his administration. The Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, an independent, and the New York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have been on a “Fighting Oligarchy” nationwide tour of the US to protest the “oligarchs and corporate interests that have so much power and influence in this country”. On Sunday, Sanders, who has accused Democrats of significantly ignoring working-class priorities, said that the party does not have “a vision for the future”. “You have Democrats appropriately, and I’m working with them, talking about Trump’s movement toward authoritarianism, vigorously opposing the so-called reconciliation bill to give over a trillion dollars in tax breaks for the 1% and make massive cuts to Medicaid, nutrition and housing, opposing what Musk is doing to dismember the Social Security Administration and the Veterans Administration, making it hard for our veterans to get decent healthcare or benefits on time,” Sanders told NBC’s Meet the Press. Throughout Sunday’s livestreamed sit-in, groups of curious passersby also found themselves sitting on the Capitol steps listening and weighing in on the discussion.",

    "title": "Drag queen Jiggly Caliente dies aged 44 after ‘severe infection’",
    "article_text": "The drag queen Jiggly Caliente has died aged 44 after a “severe infection”, her family confirmed. The performer, whose real name was Bianca Castro-Arabejo, rose to fame after taking part in the fourth season of RuPaul’s Drag Race. Caliente’s family announced on Thursday that the Filipino-American drag performer had part of her leg amputated due to the infection. Her family wrote on Instagram that she was “cherished by many” for her career, and died on Sunday at 4.42am “surrounded by her loving family and close friends”. On Instagram, the BBC Radio 2 DJ andRuPaul’s Drag RacejudgeMichelle Visagewrote: “My jiggles …. The laughter was endless, our talks were special, your energy was contagious. “You were and remain so very loved. This world has lost an angel and we want you to soar high ….. I love you so much honey.” A statement from Caliente’s family said the star was a “luminous presence” in the worlds of entertainment and advocacy, adding that she would be deeply missed and eternally remembered. Her family said: “She touched countless lives through her artistry, activism, and the genuine connection she fostered with fans around the world. “Though her physical presence is gone, the joy she shared and the space she helped create for so many will remain for ever.” After publicly coming out as transgender, Caliente was a contestant on RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars season six and was set to judge the latest season of the spin-off programme Drag Race Philippines, after being appointed as a judge when the show began airing in 2022. A statement shared by the show and producers World of Wonder on social media said they were “devastated” and asked for Caliente’s family to be given the privacy and space to grieve their “tremendous loss”. They added: “Jiggly’s humour, love, and light touched so many in the Drag Race family and beyond. Her legacy will continue to uplift the communities she advocated for.” Born on 29 November 1980, Caliente moved from the Philippines to New York when she was a child. She was praised in her first Drag Race series by the judges for her sense of humour, and impressive lip-syncs when she battled not to leave the competition early, while also struggling with sewing garments during some challenges. She was eliminated before the final, with Sharon Needles going on to be crowned champion in 2012. Since the franchise began in 2009, the reality show has been hit by the deaths of RuPaul’s Drag Race UK starsCherry Valentine, 28, andThe Vivienne, 32, as well as US competitors Sahara Davenport, 27, and Chi Chi DeVayne, 34.",

    "title": "Will Bangkok fall out of love with skyscrapers after earthquake rocks city?",
    "article_text": "Bangkok, Thailand– In the teeming metropolis that is central Bangkok, Methinee Phoovatis monitored a small computer screen, hoping to find signs of survivors. Surrounding Methinee, other members of Thailand’s Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation (DDPM) coordinated the dozens of rescue workers shuttling along a path that led to an enormous mound of debris. The rescue teams worked in shifts, searching for any indications of life under the hill of cement and steel that loomed over them. “We are just hoping for a miracle that some of the people are still alive,” Methinee, a plan and policy analyst in the DDPM, told Al Jazeera. It was four days after amagnitude 7.7 earthquake jolted Bangkokon March 28, and as the hours and days passed, the chances of Methinee and her colleagues finding survivors were increasingly slim. “We are trying our best for the people. Hopefully, they are still alive,” she said, standing next to a whiteboard showing the tally of 73 people that were still missing under the rubble of the unfinished 30-storey building, which was designed to house Thailand’s National Audit Office. The earthquake that rocked the Thai capital was particularly shallow, just 10km (6.2 miles) deep, which intensified the shock waves on the earth’s surface. Though situated more than 1,200km (750 miles) from the epicentre inMyanmar where thousands died, the earthquake brought Bangkok to a standstill. Panicked residents of this city of more than 11 million people rushed out into the streets in search of safety as buildings swayed and shuddered. A month on, life in the Thai capital has returned to normal. But the dozens of deaths – most of which were at the site of the collapsed audit office building – and the shock of the events of March 28 have prompted concerns for some in Bangkok about the safety of high-rise living in the world’s 12th tallest city. A sudden feeling of nausea and the swaying of lamps inside his apartment on the ninth floor of a 41-storey building told Harry Yang he was in danger. “I ran out onto my balcony and everything was shaking,” said the 29-year-old, who has called Bangkok his home since birth. “People were screaming,” he said. Dashing down the fire escape stairs, Yang immediately thought of his ageing father who lives on the 32nd floor in another high-rise building in Bangkok and who has issues with mobility. Although his father, who works as an antique dealer, made it out of the ordeal unscathed, the quake destroyed many of his antiques and left him terrified. “My dad is 68 years old, he has leg problems, and he needed to climb down” stairs to reach the ground floor, Yang said. People had good reason to be scared. Video clips on social media showed Bangkok shaking, with debris falling to the ground and water pouring in torrents from skyscraper infinity swimming pools. Lapaphutch Lertsachanant was in her condominium on the 27th floor when the quake struck. “The building was literally moving side to side. I really felt at that moment that the building could be cut in half,” Lapaphutch said. “I really thought that I wouldn’t survive,” she added, recalling her desire to speak to her partner one final time by phone. “I thought I could have my last words with him. He would be with me in my last moments alive.” Although seismic events in the wider Southeast Asia region are common, the scale of the quake that hit Myanmar – where more than 3,700 people were killed – and shook Bangkok took many by surprise. Wang Yu, associate professor in the department of geosciences at the National Taiwan University, said Myanmar lies directly on a tectonic fault line, the Sagaing Fault, and the March 28 quake occurred after a strike-slip fault between the India and Eurasian plates. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), a strike-slip refers to a tectonic fault where two plates move horizontally past each other. Since 1900, the USGS reports that six other large earthquakes with a magnitude of 7.0 or more have occurred within 250km (155 miles) of the epicentre in Myanmar of the March 28 quake. Bangkok is built on a basin of unstable soil that can increase the effect of these quakes, Wang Yu explained. “When a seismic wave transmits from the outside into the basin, the amplitude of the seismic wave will be enlarged,” he said. But the precise reason why the building in central Bangkok collapsed remains under investigation. No other building in Bangkok suffered such a catastrophic failure, although many sustained structural damage. Officials in Thailand have launched an investigation to assess whether proper building protocols were followed. Thailand first introduced seismic regulations on buildings in 1997. In 2007, new legislation specified that buildings higher than 15 metres (49ft) in high-risk areas like Bangkok must be built to withstand quakes of up to magnitude 7.0. Two years later, in 2009, the Thai Department of Public Works and Town and Country Planning introduced a comprehensive “Standard for Earthquake Resistant Design of Buildings”. Given these building and engineering regulations, questions have been raised over how the almost-constructed building in Bangkok could collapse. “I think we need to find the root cause so at least we can learn some lessons and improve building regulations,” Bangkok Governor Chadchart Sittipunt said shortly after the quake, as local authorities fanned out across Thailand to test buildings and assess whether they were still structurally sound. So far, the majority have been deemed to meet safety standards. On April 3, just six days after the earthquake, Bangkok’s Metropolitan Authority declared an end to the “disaster situation” in Bangkok, except for the building collapse site. Now a month on from the disaster, some residents are still concerned as superficial cracks and other damage to their high-rise residences have contributed to lingering feelings of insecurity. Despite engineers declaring that his apartment was safe to live in, 32-year-old Varuth Pongsapipatt found the series of cracks running up the walls of his apartment a little unsettling, but he was dealing with it. “It’s quite scary, but it has no effect on the structure of the building, so it’s OK,” he told Al Jazeera. With the lift in her condominium out of commission after the quake, Lapaphutch said she was forced to move into her parents’ home for almost three weeks, and she was not in a rush to return to her 27th-floor place. “I don’t feel I’m safe going back to living in a tall building,” she said. Harry Yang said his father had refused to return to his 32-floor home, worried that aftershocks may occur. “My parents are really concerned. My dad has been staying in a hotel since the earthquake happened,” Yang told Al Jazeera earlier this month. Research by Thailand’s National Institute of Development Administration (NIDA) after the earthquake found that some 68 percent of respondents were concerned about the stability and safety of buildings. For some, the effect on the property market was a worry, too. “I’m more concerned about property prices,” Yang said. “I think this will have a big impact on the property market and consumer confidence. A lot of people are trying to find a way to move out,” he said. Following the quake, Thai financial analysts predicted that condominium sales could be hit with potential buyers thinking twice before purchasing a high-rise building in Bangkok, placing further pressure on the country’s property sector. “The March 28 earthquake is expected to create a windfall for low-rise houses, which are perceived as less vulnerable to seismic events. This trend will mirror the shift seen in 2011 when nationwide flooding led homebuyers to favour condos over low-rise houses,” the Bangkok Post newspaper reported earlier this month. The quake also exposed serious shortcomings in Thailand’s emergency alert system. Although an earthquake warning system was supposed to keep the Thai public updated with information, warning messages could only be sent out in batches of 200,000 at a time, creating a bottleneck that slowed down communications in a country of almost 72 million. Harry Yang said neither he nor his parents received any emergency response messaging. They were forced to search online for information after the quake hit. Weeks on from the quake, Bangkok resident Lapaphutch also said she had never received any emergency information. “We really need this kind of system that can alert us,” she said. “Everyone in Thailand should be reviewing these kinds of notifications to make us well prepared.” The survey by NIDA showed that almost 60 percent of those polled were concerned about the effectiveness of the early warning systems. Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra has since called for upgrades to the system to increase the broadcast capacity of the alert batches to 1 million at a time, according to local reports. Despite the challenges, Thailand emerged from the tremor relatively unscathed. Just metres from the site of the collapsed 30-storey building, Bangkok’s Chatuchak Weekend Market was already bustling with tourists just days after the quake, and the events seemed almost like a distant memory in a city that never really sleeps. Harry Yang agreed. Bangkok residents had initially felt scared, but that would pass, he said. “Eventually it’s going to come back to normal.”",

    "article_text": "At least 31 people, including children,have been executedby the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in Khartoum’s twin city of Omdurman, according to the Sudan Doctors Network. Minors were among the victims in Al-Salha area in the city, the group said, calling the killings “the largest documented mass killing in the region”. The victims were accused by the paramilitary group of affiliation with the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), local medics said. Activists shared videos on social media showing individuals in RSF uniforms shooting at a group of people in the Al-Salha neighbourhood. The doctor’s network also called the bloodshed by the RSF a “war crime and a crime against humanity”. It appealed to the international community to take urgent action to rescue the remaining civilians by opening safe routes to ensure their exit from Al-Salha. There was no immediate comment from the rebel group on the report. Reporting from Khartoum, Al Jazeera’s Hiba Morgan said that the graphic video of the civilians being killed started circulating on social media in the early hours of Sunday morning and that the victims in the video belonged to the Barra brigade, which has been fighting alongside the army or SAF. “Now the Sudanese army has been launching attacks trying to regain territory from the RSF in southwest Omdurman as well as western Omdurman, where the RSF also has presence … when it comes to southwestern Omdurman, the RSF continues to fight back,” she said. The SAF and government have not yet released a statement. Since April 15, 2023, the RSF has been battling Sudanese army forces for control of the country in a brutal civil war, resulting in thousands of deaths and one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. More than 20,000 people have been killed so far, and 15 million othersdisplaced, according to the United Nations and local authorities. Research from United States scholars, however, estimates the death toll at around 130,000.",

    "article_text": "Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk says winning the Premier League title is an achievement the club would never take for granted after the Merseysidersthrashed Tottenham Hotspur 5-1to secure a 20th top-flight crown in front of a roaring Anfield. Liverpool’s victory on Sunday gave Arne Slot’s side an unassailable 15-point lead over second-placed Arsenal with four games left in the season as they clinched the title for only the second time in the Premier League era. “It’s special, and it’s something that we don’t take for granted. It’s amazing what today was,” van Dijk told Sky Sports as the players took a lap of honour around Anfield. “A lot of emotions before the game, during the whole week. We got the job done, and we truly deserve to be champions of England. “[It’s] the most beautiful club in the world. I think we deserve all of this. Let’s enjoy the next couple of weeks and let it sink in.” Liverpool first lifted the Premier League trophy five years ago during the COVID-19 pandemic when the fans were not allowed inside the stadium to celebrate their first league title in 30 years. This time, however, the fans turned up at a packed Anfield, serenading the players with the club’s anthem, You’ll Never Walk Alone. “Yeah, I was desperate for them [to be here], of course, for all the fans around the world, for the fans here, but for us as well,” van Dijk said. “We got two Premier League trophies in five years, so that’s still a good achievement.” Liverpool had also thrashed Spurs 6-3 in the reverse fixture in December, and as a sea of red welcomed the team bus at Anfield, Slot said they could not let their fans down with the title within their grasp. “It was clear we couldn’t lose this game. Everyone on the bus said, ‘There’s no way we’re going to lose this game,'” said Slot, who won the title in his debut season at Liverpool – a club that had only won one league title in 34 years prior to his arrival. “They always find a way to win. [I’m] incredibly proud, not only of the players but the people standing here – sport directors, my staff members. We should give them a big round of applause. “Let’s forget it’s the second [title] in 35 years. It’s the second in five years!”",

    "title": "Pope Francis laid to rest in Rome after funeral attended by thousands",
    "article_text": "Rome, Italy– About 250,000 mourners in Vatican City fell into hushed silence on Saturday morning as the funeral for Pope Francis began. The church choir echoed through loudspeakers across the city-state. Some bowed their heads in respect. Others clasped their hands in silent prayer. Just after 10am (08:00 GMT), the pope’s coffin was brought out of St Peter’s Basilica. Most of the crowd, too far away to catch a glimpse, turned to the large screens dotted around St Peter’s Square. Police officers, stewards and military personnel who had been directing crowds through cordoned-off streets since dawn finally relaxed as the gentle sound of a prayer song softened the tense morning into a moment of shared peace. As the readings began in several languages, several groups of teenagers who had come to Rome as part of the Jubilee of Adolescents, a three-day event during theJubilee, a major Catholic event held every 25 years, sat down on the cobblestones of Via della Conciliazione, which leads up to the piazza. Others moved towards the fringes of the street as they sought shade from the warm midday sun. Pauline Mille, a French doctoral student who had arrived early in the morning with her parents, said it was a moving ceremony and it was “nice to hear people singing in harmony and spending time together” as they celebrated thepope’s legacy. Lebanese American Elie Dib travelled to Rome with his wife and young son to attend the canonisation of Carlo Acutis, which was postponed due to Francis’s death on Monday. Dib told Al Jazeera he was “blessed to be part of the prayer and the funeral service today to pray for his soul” and was impressed to see people of many different nationalities speaking “in one voice of love and prayer”. His son, Antony, who was sitting on his father’s shoulders draped in a Lebanese flag, said that although he was sad the pope had died, he was “still happy that he is going to heaven”. In the centre of the square, a group of teenagers from Mexico with their hands placed on each other’s shoulders knelt with their heads bowed. As the ceremony came to a close, the crowds filtered out of the Vatican as stewards handed out free water to the elderly. The popemobile carrying Francis’s coffin drove out of the city-state and through the streets of Rome, past many of its famous landmarks, such as the Colosseum, to the Basilica of Saint Mary Major, a few kilometres away. As the roughly 50 heads of state, 12 reigning monarchs and other VIP guests who had been seated in a section next to St Peter’s Basilica were ushered out of private exits in a series of motorcades, tens of thousands of mourners began the roughly one-hour journey by foot to the pope’s final resting place. Fiorello Maffei, a 58-year-old who lives in London, returned to Italy for the now postponed canonisation of Carlo, a Londoner himself born to Italian parents who died of leukaemia at the age of 15. Maffei said he had found Francis’s funeral “very touching” and full of simple words and messages of love that still “carried great weight”. He said this epitomised Francis, who didn’t overcomplicate his messages during communication with people, adding that it pleased him that world leaders such as United States President Donald Trump had to listen to these messages of peace. Two priests from Benin who attended the funeral with clergy from South Africa said that although they felt sad during the service, they were also filled with hope and were grateful for the legacy Francis has left behind. As they watched the pope’s coffin being driven through Rome on a large TV screen positioned near the banks of the Tiber, they said Francis had preached a message of peace and inclusion and had welcomed migrants and refugees with an “open heart”. Maffei said he believed Francis would have enjoyed seeing so many people walking through Rome and tackling the uphill stretch by Largo Magnanapoli. “Walking like this is difficult. It is a time for reflection and meditation, and that’s just what he would have wanted,” Maffei said. At the Basilica of Saint Mary Major, a church much loved by the pope, who visited it more than 100 times over the course of his 12-year papacy, the crowds began to thin as no public ceremony or special event had been organised for his burial. On Sunday, thepontiff’s tombwas opened to the public. The simple white resting place, inscribed with simply one name – Franciscus, his name in Latin – reflects Francis’s request in his will to be buried “in the ground, without particular decoration”.",

    "title": "Liverpool net record-equalling 20th Premier League title by thrashing Spurs",
    "article_text": "Liverpool roared back from a goal behind tothrash Tottenham Hotspur 5-1and wrap up the Premier League title in style on a momentous day at Anfield. Needing only a point on Sunday to ensure a record-equalling 20th English title with four games remaining, Liverpool were rocked in the 12th minute as Dominic Solanke headed Tottenham in front. But the title party was only temporarily silenced as Liverpool struck back with a Luis Diaz tap-in, an Alexis Mac Allister thunderbolt and a Cody Gakpo shot before halftime. A one-sided second half saw Mohamed Salah end a six-match scoring drought by firing a low shot past Guglielmo Vicario in the 63rd minute – and celebrating his 28th league goal of an outstanding season by snapping a selfie with a fan. Tottenham’s Destiny Udogie then bundled in an own goal to complete a miserable afternoon for the visitors, who have lost 19 Premier League games this season. Liverpool, who have now matched Manchester United’s English titles record, have 82 points from 34 games played, with Arsenal a distant second on 67. Dutchman Arne Slot is only the fifth manager to win the Premier League title in his debut season in English soccer, and while it was a formality before kickoff on Sunday, there was still the small matter of Liverpool ensuring the cake was iced in front of their own adoring fans. Five years ago, when Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool ended a 30-year wait for a 19th title, the COVID-19 pandemic meant an anti-climactic finale inside an empty stadium. Sunday more than made up for that as the fans went through their choir book of club anthems. Sixteenth-placed Tottenham, who made eight changes to their starting lineup with one eye on Thursday’s Europa League semifinal, arrived as sacrificial lambs, but momentarily silenced the Kop as former Liverpool player Solanke headed in James Maddison’s corner. Liverpool were only behind for four minutes, though. Diaz, appearing in his 100th Premier League game for the club, tapped in Dominik Szoboszlai’s low cross, and while it was initially disallowed for offside, the decision was overturned after a VAR check to sighs of relief all round. Eight minutes later, the party was in full swing as Liverpool took the lead with a special goal by Mac Allister – one of the real unsung heroes in Liverpool’s midfield engine room. Tottenham gave possession away trying to play out from the back, and when the ball arrived at the feet of the Argentine World Cup winner, he thumped a left-footed shot high beyond Vicario. With the visitors now fully complying with their role as props in Liverpool’s parade, the hosts began to run riot as Gakpo slammed in his side’s third goal after 34 minutes. All that was left to complete a perfect day was a goal for Kop idol Salah, and he duly obliged after the break.",

    "title": "Saudi Arabia, Qatar to settle Syria’s outstanding debt to World Bank",
    "article_text": "Saudi Arabia and Qatar have announced that they will settleSyria’s debtto the World Bank totalling roughly $15m, according to a statement published by the Saudi Press Agency, in the latest effort to help reverse the economic fortunes of a nation beset by years of war. Both Gulf states have played a key role in the diplomatic outreach to Syria’s new interim government since the ouster of longtime leader President Bashar al-Assad in December. “The ministries of finance in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the state of Qatar jointly announce their commitment to settle Syria’s outstanding arrears to the World Bank Group, totalling around $15 million,” the statement said on Sunday. It came just days after Syria’s central bank governor and finance minister attended the International Monetary Fund and World Bank spring meetings for the first time in more than 20 years. The World Bank had suspended operations in Syria after the start of the war, which began with a bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protests during the Arab Spring in 2011. The settlement of the country’s arrears will enable it to resume accessing the bank’s financial support and technical advice. “Thiscommitmentwill pave the way for the World Bank Group to resume support and operations in Syria after a suspension of more than 14 years,” the statement said. “It will also unlock Syria’s access to financial support in the near term for the development of critical sectors.” Al-Assad was ousted in a lightning offensive by opposition fighters led by the Hay’et Tahrir al-Sham armed group last December. Syria’s new government has sought to rebuild the country’s diplomatic ties, including with international financial institutions. It also counts on wealthy Gulf Arab states to play a pivotal role in financing the reconstruction of Syria’s war-ravaged infrastructure and reviving its economy. Thegovernmentled by interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa also wants to transition away from the corrupt system that gave al-Assad loyalists privileged access to government contracts and kept key industries in the hands of the al-Assad family. Earlier this month, a United Nations officialsaidthat Syria’s authorities should begin the process of economic recovery, without waiting for Western sanctions imposed under al-Assad’s rule to be lifted.",

    "title": "China’s Huawei develops new AI chip to compete with US’s Nvidia: Report",
    "article_text": "China’s Huawei Technologies is preparing to test its newest and most powerful artificial intelligence (AI) processor, as it hopes to replace some higher-end products of US chip giant Nvidia, the Wall Street Journal has reported. Huawei has approached some Chinese tech companies about testing the technical feasibility of the new chip, called the Ascend 910D, the United States newspaper reported Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter. The Chinese company is hoping that the latest iteration of its Ascend AI processors will be more powerful than California-based Nvidia’s H100, and is due to receive the processor’s first batch of samples as early as late May, added the report. Previous versions are called 910B and 910C. The people interviewed indicate that the chip is in early development and will undergo a series of tests to evaluate its performance and prepare it for customer use. Reuters news agency reported that Huawei plans to begin mass shipments of its advanced 910C artificial intelligence chip to Chinese customers as early as next month. Huawei and its Chinese peers have struggled for years to build top-end chips that could compete with Nvidia’s products for training models, a process where data is fed to algorithms to help them learn to make accurate decisions. Washington has cut China off from Nvidia’s most advanced AI products, including its flagship B200 chip, in the hopes of limiting China’s technological development, particularly advances for its military. US authorities banned the sale of the H100 chip in 2022 before it was even launched. Huawei has nonetheless succeeded, despite the US’s lead in the technology sector and its attempts to prevent Chinese development. The Shenzhen-based firm has developed some of the nation’s most promising alternatives to Nvidia’s AI chips, a key part of Beijing’s strategy to cultivate a self-sufficient semiconductor industry. Despite being on a US trade blacklist for nearly six years, Huawei demonstrated its resilience against US restrictions by launching the high-end Mate 60 smartphone in 2023. Powered by a domestically produced processor, the phone’s introduction during then-Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo’s visit to Beijing shocked the US government. Nvidia declined to comment while Huawei did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.",

    "title": "Israel bombs Beirut; President Aoun calls for international pressure",
    "article_text": "Israel has struck Beirut’s southern suburbs after issuing an evacuation warning, the third Israeli strike on the Lebanese capital since a ceasefire took effect in late November. A huge plume of smoke rose over the area after the strike on Sunday. There was no immediate word on casualties. Lebanese President Joseph Aoun condemned the air strike and called for France and the United States, guarantors of the November 27 ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, to compel Israel to halt its attacks. Israel has violated that truce multiple times in recent months and weeks with attacks on the capital and across southern Lebanon. Aoun said Israel is undermining stability in Lebanon and escalating tensions, posing “real dangers to the security” of the region. The Israeli military said the attack on Beirut destroyed “an infrastructure where precision missiles” were stored by Hezbollah. It did not provide proof for its claim. No secondary explosions were reported after the Israeli attack. Local platforms have published footage filmed in the immediate aftermath of the bombardment. This video has been verified by Al Jazeera: بالفيديو: دخان كثيف يتصاعد من \"الهنغار\" المُستهدف في منطقة الحدث بالضاحية الجنوبيةpic.twitter.com/nLle4DuG8I — هنا لبنان (@thisislebnews)April 27, 2025 Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr, reporting in Beirut, said: “We were able a short while ago to reach the site that was targeted, but there was a lot of chaos, and we were told to leave.” “The damage was widespread, also affecting nearby buildings. Windows were blown out, glass was on the floor, cars were damaged,” she added. “This strike did come with a warning but without any provocation,” Khodr said. “This is not the first time that Beirut’s southern suburb has been hit since Israel and Hezbollah agreed to that ceasefire back in November, but this time, there was no rocket fire. So people here are concerned that Israel is rewriting the rules of engagement, saying that there are no red lines any longer and that this could be the beginning of an escalation.” Elias Hanna, a retired Lebanese army general, told Al Jazeera the Israeli strike on Beirut – and the warning that preceded it – may have been aimed at gathering intelligence on Hezbollah. Hanna said such an operation is known as “pinging the system”. “If you have information on certain individuals or facilities, you send the warning, and you wait to see how these officials or leaders will respond,” he said. “Will they move from one place to another?” Hanna added that the operation could confirm or dismiss certain information, which would be a “win-win” scenario for intelligence gathering. During the yearlong war, Israeli drones and fighter jets regularly bombarded the southern suburbs of Beirut, where Hezbollah has widespread influence and support. Israel assassinated several of Hezbollah’s top leaders there, including Secretary-GeneralHassan Nasrallah. The US has pressured Lebanon to disarm Hezbollah, but Aoun has warned this is a“delicate”matter that must be handled in a way that preserves peace in the religiously diverse country. Hezbollah, which views itself as the resistance to Israel, says it will not disarm.",

    "title": "Greenland will never be ‘piece of property’ to be bought, PM says",
    "article_text": "Greenland’s prime minister and his Danish counterpart have presented a united front, criticising United States President Donald Trump’s administration for a lack of respect in its designs to seize the Arctic island, a self-governed Danish territory. “We will never, ever be a piece of property that can be bought by anyone, and that’s the message I think is most important to understand,” Jens-Frederik Nielsen told reporters on Sunday at a joint news conference in Copenhagen alongside Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen. Trump’s repeated threats to take over Greenland loomed large over Nielsen’s first visit to Denmark since taking office this month. Nielsen’s visit follows one by Frederiksen to Greenland in early April when she told the US: “This is not only about Greenland or Denmark. This is about the world order that we have built together across the Atlantic over generations.You cannot annex another country, not even with an argument about security.” Both Frederiksen and Nielsen, who leads Greenland’s new coalition government after his centre-right Democrats party won legislative elections in March, said they would be willing to meet the US leader for talks. Tensions between the US and Denmark have soared after Trump repeatedly said he wanted to take control of resource-rich Greenland for security reasons, refusing to rule out the use of force to secure it. “I think we need that for international peace, and if we don’t have that, it’s a big threat to our world. So I think Greenland is very important for international peace,” Trump told reporters on Thursday during a news conference with Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store. Nielsen also said on Sunday that Greenland was working on strengthening its relations with Denmark due to the US’s “disrespectful” rhetoric. “We are in a situation now where we need to stand together. The talk from the United States has not been respectful,” Nielsen said. “I totally agree with that,” Frederiksen added. Nielsen reiterated that Greenland was ready to deepen ties with the US. “We are ready for a strong partnership, we are ready for more development, but we want respect,” he said. “You cannot have a partner where there is no mutual respect.” US Vice President JD Vance paid a visit to Greenland in March, which officials both in Greenland and Denmarkviewed as a provocation. During his trip to the Pituffik US military base, Vance castigated Denmark for not having “done a good job by the people of Greenland”. “You have underinvested in the people of Greenland, and you have underinvested in the security architecture of this incredible, beautiful landmass,” he said. Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen responded on social media: “We are open to criticisms, but let me be completely honest, we do not appreciate the tone in which it’s being delivered.” Nielsen himself has said: “The United States will not get Greenland.” “We don’t belong to anyone else. We decide our own future,” he added in a Facebook post. During his two-day visit to Copenhagen, Nielsen will also meet Denmark’s King Frederik and representatives of the Danish parliament. In a separate statement, Denmark’s Royal House said the king would accompany Nielsen back to Greenland for a visit. Polls show a vast majority of Greenland’s 57,000 people want to become independent from Denmark but do not wish to become part of the US.",

    "title": "‘A tree is worth more’: The civilians who fled Zamzam as the RSF attacked",
    "article_text": "One dawn in mid-April, the very air in Zamzam Camp seemed to shatter. The paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) stormed the displacement camp in North Darfur, launchinga brutal three-day assaultthat killed hundreds of people and left countless others scattered, injured or missing. Gunfire echoed through makeshift shelters. Families ran in every direction. Many never made it out. On April 13, theRSF claimed to have capturedwhat it called the “Zamzam military base”. But those living there said no such thing existed, that Zamzam was simply where displaced families clung to life. The takeover followed five months of suffocating siege. Roads and aid were blocked, and survival left to chance. Zamzam, 15km (9.3 miles) south of el-Fasher, the capital of North Darfur state, has been a refuge for civilians displaced by the Darfur conflict since the 2000s. At the time, rights groups said the violence was ethnic cleansing and possibly genocide by state-backed “Arab” nomadic militias against mainly “non-Arab” sedentary communities. About 300,000 people have ended up in Zamzam since 2003. The number swelled to well above 500,000 due to violence that has spread across the western region of Darfur since Sudan’s civil war erupted between the RSF and Sudanese military in April 2023. In the past year, Zamzam has transformed from a place of refuge into a killing field. Aid blockades, repeated RSF attacks and famine have stripped the camp of food, medicine and basic security. The military and its allied forces managed to repel dozens of RSF assaults, but the troops soon returned to el-Fasher, their last stronghold, leaving the camp exposed once again. Dr Ibrahim Abdallah, director general of health in North Darfur, told Al Jazeera over the phone that the death toll likely exceeds 500. “Due to the Sudanese tradition of burying the dead immediately to honour them, it’s hard to keep track,” he said. “And with Zamzam located many kilometres from el-Fasher, transporting the bodies for documentation is nearly impossible.” A young woman, who asked to remain anonymous for her safety, spoke to Al Jazeera from el-Fasher, to which she, her husband and her two younger brothers fled. She says fear has followed them and told Al Jazeera part of the story of how she came to flee Zamzam. In January 2024, she had been living with her husband in Wadi Shadra in North Darfur with her 15-year-old and 9-year-old brothers, who moved in with them after her parents died. The RSF attacked Wadi Shadra, and the blended family fled to Zamzam, where they thought they had escaped the worst. But then, just over a year later, another attack. “It started at dawn on Friday [April 11],” she said. “A large force stormed the camp from the south, towards one of the markets. Fire broke out in every direction as gunfire rang out.” They hid in trenches for a full day without food or water as a shell shattered their home and another struck a neighbour’s, killing three children. Then they ran, fleeing to the nearby village of Saluma. “But the RSF followed us there too. They torched the houses and shouted that we must go to Tawila immediately,” she said. Their donkey had been killed and their cart destroyed, so they had no other option than to walk for hours to el-Fasher under a blazing sun. “I lost my aunt and two of her children that day. We still don’t know what happened to her other three children.” Nasr, who asked to be identified by just one name, fled Zalingei, the capital of Central Darfur, with his family in October 2023 after RSF fighters took the city. His father, a community leader, had twice been threatened by the late RSF commander Ali Yakoub. The family passed through Sarf Omra, in Kabkabiya, North Darfur, before arriving in Zamzam on November 22, 2023. He arrived with his wife, two children – a spirited three-year-old daughter and a toddler son just over one and a half years old – as well as his parents and several siblings. Together, they built a fragile shelter and tried to start over. Each morning, Nasr made the 30km (18.6-mile) round trip to el-Fasher to work in the livestock market and bring home food. Then, in February, RSF fighters stormed the camp. Roads were closed. The siege tightened. Nasr never made it back to his family. His wife, children, elderly parents and younger siblings remained behind, caught in the chaos. “A tree is more valuable in this world than we are. We lost all our human value in this world,” Nasr said. He rejected the RSF’s claim of a “military base” in Zamzam as a cruel distortion. He recalled how people dug trenches to shield themselves from relentless bombardment. He later saw a video of detained men, among them his uncle. One of the RSF leaders delivered a clear message to them: “Join the RSF or suffer.” Nasr has spent agonising days in el-Fasher, waiting by roadsides, clinging to hope that someone from Zamzam might bring word of his family. He asks about them in whispers, his voice heavy with fear. At last, he heard they had fled towards Tawila, but he adds: “Until now, I don’t know if they reached Tawila or not.” Mohamed Khamis, spokesperson for the displaced in Zamzam, is now a patient in a hospital in el-Fasher. He was shot in the thigh during the RSF’s assault. The camp had endured more than 28 attacks in five months, he told Al Jazeera, but none matched the scale and violence of the latest. “They stormed in at dawn with heavy weaponry,” he said. In the early moments of the attack, they reportedly targeted a Relief International Clinic, and Khamis rushed to check on friends, but he never made it. “I was intercepted by an armoured RSF vehicle,” he said. The RSF fighters shot him and left him on the ground to bleed out, but he was rescued by residents and smuggled to safety. “Many young men were executed during the rampage,” he said. He continued, trying to describe what happened. More than 12 women and girls were confirmed to have been abducted by RSF fighters while fleeing. Their whereabouts remain unknown, as well as what they may be suffering. There are reports of women and girls being raped, “no fewer than 200 cases” according to Khamis, although he is certain many more have gone unreported. Even in cases that are reported, Khamis said: “Because of the social stigma, witnesses often use phrases like ‘she was humiliated’ or ‘touched’ instead of saying she was raped.” In the minds of those displaced for the second or third time, the idea of safety is gone. The RSF narrative is that it is fighting “military elements” in Zamzam, but testimonies like Nasr’s and Khamis’s refute that. “There was nothing there but people trying to survive,” Nasr said again, as if repetition might finally end the world’s indifference. But the silence remains. Survivors are left with ashes, unanswered questions and a single haunting truth: “We lost our human value in this world.”",

    "title": "Iran’s President Pezeshkian visits injured, site of deadly port explosion",
    "article_text": "Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian has visited hospitalized survivors of a huge explosion thatrockedone of the country’s main ports, killing at least 40 people and injuring about 1,000 others. The visit on Sunday followed a massive blast the day before at the Shahid Rajaee port outside of Bandar Abbas in southern Iran’s Hormozgan province. Arriving at the site, Pezeshkian thanked first responders, announcing, “We have come to see first hand if there is anything or any issue that the government can follow up on.” “We will try to take care of the families who lost their loved ones, and we will definitely take care of the dear people who got injured,” he said. Later Sunday, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said “security and judicial officials are obliged to thoroughly investigate, uncover any negligence or intent, and follow up in accordance with regulations”,  in a message carried by state television. Meanwhile, Russia’s embassy said Moscow was sending multiple “aircraft carrying specialists” to help fight the blaze. According to Russia’s Ministry of Emergency Situations, one of the aircraft is a dedicated firefighting plane. The facility has been purportedly linked to an earlier delivery of a chemical ingredient used to make missile propellant. But Iranian Defence Ministry spokesman Reza Talaei-Nik told state TV that “there has been no imported or exported cargo for military fuel or military use in the area”. The port’s customs office said in a statement carried by state television that the explosion probably resulted from afirethat broke out at the hazardous and chemical materials storage depot. Iranian state television also described the fire as being under control, saying emergency workers hoped that it would be fully extinguished later on Sunday. Overnight, helicopters and heavy cargo aircraft flew repeated sorties over the burning port, dumping seawater on the site. Also at the scene on Sunday, Interior Minister Eskandar Momeni said “the situation has stabilised in the main areas” of the port, and workers had resumed loading containers and customs clearance. Another official on site, Minister of Roads and Urban Development Farzaneh Sadegh, said only one zone of the port was impacted, and cargo “operations are still continuing as normal in the several other zones”. Images from the scene showed firefighters working among toppled and blackened cargo containers, and carrying out the body of a victim. The authorities have closed off the roads leading to the site, and footage from the area has been limited to Iranian media outlets. Authorities have also declared a day of nationalmourningon Monday, and three days of mourning in Hormozgan province from Sunday. Meanwhile, messages expressing solidarity with Iran and victims of the blast have poured in from around the world. The United Arab Emirates noted “solidarity with Iran” over the explosion and Saudi Arabia sent condolences, as did Pakistan, India, Turkiye, Russia and the United Nations. Lebanon’s Hezbollah also offered condolences, saying Iran, with its “faith and solid will, can overcome this tragic accident”. In the first reaction from a major European country, the German embassy in Tehran said on Instagram: “Bandar Abbas we grieve with you.” China’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement to AFP on Sunday that three Chinese victims were in a “stable” condition.",

    "title": "Suspect in France mosque attack that killed Malian man on the run",
    "article_text": "A man suspected of killing a Muslim worshipper in a mosque in southern France remains on the run, authorities say, in an incident that Prime Minister Francois Bayrou has branded as “Islamophobic”. Both men were alone in the mosque in La Grand-Combe, a former mining town in the Gard region, on Friday when the victim was fatally stabbed. The assailant reportedly recorded the attack on his phone and filmed the dying Malian man, who was in his 20s. A source close to the case, who asked not to be named, said the suspected perpetrator, while not apprehended, has been identified as a non-Muslim, French citizen of Bosnian origin, according to the AFP news agency. After initially praying alongside the man, the attacker stabbed the victim about 50 times before fleeing the scene. The body was found later in the morning, when other worshippers arrived at the mosque for Friday prayers. The suspect, who has been identified only as Olivier – born in France in 2004 and unemployed, with no criminal record – is “potentially extremely dangerous” and it is “essential” to arrest him before he claims more victims, according to regional prosecutor Abdelkrim Grini. The Grand Mosque of Paris condemned the attack in a statement and said the victim had just finished cleaning the mosque when he was killed. It called on authorities to quickly shed light on the reasons behind the attack, asking judicial authorities to say whether it is being treated as a “terrorist” act and to note its “scale and seriousness … for the safety of all”. “Racism and hatred based on religion can have no place in France. Freedom of worship cannot be violated,” President Emmanuel Macron wrote on X on Sunday in his first comments on the killing, extending his support to “our fellow Muslim citizens”. Un jeune a été atrocement assassiné dans une mosquée du Gard. À sa famille, à nos compatriotes de confession musulmane, j’adresse le soutien de la Nation. Le racisme et la haine en raison de la religion n’auront jamais leur place en France. La liberté de culte est intangible. — Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron)April 27, 2025 Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin on Saturday decried the “despicable murder” that “wounds the hearts of all believers, of all Muslims in France”. “We stand shoulder to shoulder with the victim’s family and the shocked worshippers,” he said. “The resources of the state are being mobilised to ensure that the murderer is caught and punished.” Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau announced on Sunday that he would travel to La Grand-Combe. The SOS Racisme campaign group said it would take part in a march “against Islamophobia” organised later on Sunday at La Grand-Combe. More marches are also planned on Sunday evening throughout France, including at Paris’s Place de la Republique. The marchers will observe a minute’s silence in memory of the victim.

Qatar’s prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, on Sunday met with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan for talks in Doha, which were dominated by Israel’s 18-month war in Gaza. “We have seen on Thursday a bit of progress compared to other meetings, yet we need to find an answer for the ultimate question: how to end this war. That’s the key point of the entire negotiations,” Sheikh Mohammed, who also serves as foreign minister, said during a joint news conference. Media reports said David Barnea, director of Israel’s Mossad spy agency, travelled to Doha on Thursday to meet Mohammed amid efforts to reach a new ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. The Qatari prime minister did not say which elements of the ceasefire talks had progressed in recent days but said Hamas and Israel remained at odds over the ultimate goal of negotiations. Mediator Qatar has been trying to resuscitate a truce after a previous deal collapsed when Israel pulled out of it and resumed its military operations on March 18, nearly two weeks after imposing a total siege on Gaza. For his part, Turkiye’s Fidan said the “ethnic cleansing being practised” by Israel in Gaza is against international and humanitarian law. “Humanitarian aid hasn’t reached Gaza in two months now. It is a humanitarian crisis that is being seen and watched by the entire world. We need to find a way to stop the aggression on Gaza and to make sure the aid will reach … those people in desperate need,” he told reporters. Meanwhile, the UN warned that Palestinians in Gaza are facing thethreat of starvationas World Food Programme warehouses across the territory sit empty after running out of supplies last week. On Sunday, the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) said “the siege must be lifted”, adding that people in Gaza “have been plunged into a cycle of deadly violence and deprivation”. In an earlier statement, UNRWA said there is nothing that “can justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people”. On Saturday, Jonathan Whittall, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Gaza, accused Israel of “weaponising” aid by denying it to displaced Palestinians. “Today, people are not surviving in Gaza. Those that aren’t being killed with bombs and bullets are slowly dying,” he said. “There’s no justification for the denial of humanitarian assistance. And humanitarian aid should never be weaponised.” Amid warnings of famine in Gaza, Israel continued itsair attacksacross the Palestinian territory on Sunday, killing at least 50 people, includingchildren. At least 52,243 Palestinians have been confirmed killed and 117,639 wounded in Israel’s war on Gaza since it began 18 months ago, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza.  An estimated 1,139 people were killed in Israel during the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, attacks and more than 200 were taken captive. Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, described Israel’s aerial and ground attacks as “devastating”. “It seems that Israel and Hamas are still locked in a prolonged war of attrition, and the Israeli air strikes continue to overwhelm heavily built-up neighbourhoods,” he said.",

    "title": "Russia launches nearly 150 drones, strikes in Ukraine, killing at least 4",
    "article_text": "Russia launched a sweeping drone assault and air attacks acrossUkraine, killing at least four people, officials say, a day after United States President Donald Trump cast doubt over Russian President Vladimir Putin’s willingness to end the war. According to a Facebook post by the Donetsk regional prosecutor’s office, Russia dropped three glide bombs on the city, about 10km (6 miles) from the front line, on Sunday. Russian forces have inched closer towards it over the past year. A couple, aged 47 and 48, were killed, along with a 78-year-old pensioner, the post said, and 21 homes were damaged. Pictures from the scene showed a destroyed single-storey house and the shell of a burned-out car. Another person died and a 14-year-old girl was wounded in a drone attack on the city of Pavlohrad in the Dnipropetrovsk region, which was hit for the third consecutive night, Governor Serhii Lysak said. Russia also fired 149 exploding drones and decoys in the latest wave of attacks, the Ukrainian air force said, adding that 57 were intercepted and another 67 jammed. One person was wounded in drone attacks on the Odesa region, and another in the city of Zhytomyr. Four people were wounded in an air attack on Kherson city on Sunday morning, according to local officials. The attacks came hours after Putin claimed Russian forces had regained control over the remaining parts of theKursk region, which Ukrainian forces seized in a surprise incursion last August. Ukrainian officials insisted the fighting in Kursk was continuing. Trump said on Saturday that he doubts Putin wants to end the more than three-year war in Ukraine, expressing scepticism that a peace deal can be reached soon. Only a day earlier, Trump had said Ukraine and Russia were “very close to a deal”. During the presidential campaign, Trump often boasted he could end the war in 24 hours, but reality has proved more difficult. “There was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days”, Trump wrote in a social media post as he flew back to the US after attending Pope Francis’s funeral at the Vatican, where he met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy briefly on Saturday. Trump also hinted at further sanctions against Russia. TheTrump-Zelenskyy conversationon the sidelines of the pope’s funeral was the first face-to-face encounter between the two leaders since they argued during a heated Oval Office meeting at the White House in late February. The two leaders, leaning in close to each other with no aides around them while seated in Saint Peter’s Basilica, spoke for about 15 minutes, according to Zelenskyy’s office, and images of the meeting released by Kyiv and Washington. Zelenskyy said the meeting could prove historic if it delivers the kind of peace he is hoping for, and a White House spokesperson called it “very productive”. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Sunday that a peace deal needs to happen soon and that Washington is trying to determine whether it is worth continuing to serve as mediator. “We cannot continue to dedicate time and resources to this effort if it’s not going to come to fruition,” Rubio told NBC’s Meet the Press programme. “The last week has really been about figuring out how close are these sides really, and are they close enough that this merits a continued investment of our time as a mediator,” he added. Separately on Sunday, Russian investigators filed terrorism charges against a man suspected ofkillinga senior Russian military officer near Moscow, the Interfax news agency reported. The Kremlin has blamed Kyiv for Friday’s car bomb blast that killed 59-year-old Yaroslav Moskalik, the latest in a series of Russian military officers and pro-war figures to be assassinated since the start of the war in Ukraine. Ukraine has not commented on the incident. Interfax, citing Russia’s Investigative Committee, said the suspect, Ignat Kuzin, who used to live in Ukraine, had pleaded guilty to killing Moskalik and had said he was recruited and paid by Ukraine’s security services. Moskalik, who was deputy head of the main operations directorate of Russia’s General Staff, was killed on Friday in the town of Balashikha,hours beforeTrump’s envoy Steve Witkoff was due to hold talks with Putin in Moscow. The Investigative Committee said Russian authorities were trying to identify others who might have been involved in Moskalik’s killing.",

    "title": "Thousands visit Pope Francis tomb in Rome day after funeral",
    "article_text": "Thousands of mourners have gathered in Rome to pay their respects at the tomb of Pope Francis, a day after hisfuneraldrew world leaders and hundreds of thousands of the faithful. On Sunday, queues were seen at the tomb, which opened to the public on the second of nine days of official mourning, with a conclave to select his successor expected between May 5 and May 10. Outside St Mary Major Basilica, ushers urged visitors to keep moving to allow the steady stream of people a chance to bid farewell. The Argentinian pontiff, who died on April 21 aged 88, was laid to rest in a modest white marble tomb near an icon of the Madonna that he deeply revered. “For me, Pope Francis was an inspiration, a guide,” said Elias Caravalhal, a Rome resident who missed the lying-in-state at St Peter’s Basilica but came to offer thanks at the tomb, told The Associated Press news agency. Polish pilgrim Maria Brzezinska, reflecting on the simplicity of the site, said: “It’s exactly the way of the Pope. He was simple, and so is his place now.” Breaking with a century-old tradition, Francis chose to be buried outside the Vatican, selecting the multicultural heart of Rome as his final resting place. Earlier on Sunday, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican’s secretary of state and a likely contender to become the next pope, led a special mass at St Peter’s Square. Speaking before a crowd estimated at 200,000, many of them young pilgrims who had initially gathered for the planned canonisation of Carlo Acutis, Parolin paid tribute to Francis. “The shepherd whom the Lord gave to his people, Pope Francis, has ended his earthly life and has left us,” he said. “The grief at his departure, the sense of sadness that assails us … We are experiencing all of this.” Among those mourning was Susmidah Murphy from Kerala, India. “It’s unbelievable that he’s no longer with us,” she said. “It’s sad. We don’t get popes like this very often.” Cardinals who have arrived in Rome will meet throughout the week to chart thefuture courseof the 1.4-billion-strong Roman Catholic Church.",

    "title": "MotoGP Spain: Alex Marquez wins first Grand Prix after brother Marc crashes",
    "article_text": "Gresini Racing’s Alex Marquez has claimed his first MotoGP race victory at the Spanish Grand Prix to snatch the championship lead from his elder brother Marc, who crashed early in the race and finished 12th. After seven second-place finishes in sprints and races this season, Alex claimed a dream race win on home turf on Sunday in front of more than 100,000 fans with the Spaniard imploring them to increase the volume even when he had a few corners left on the final lap. Fabio Quartararo finished second to give Yamaha their first podium since the 2023 Indonesian Grand Prix while Ducati’s Francesco Bagnaia came in third. Marc squeezed his way through the crowd to embrace Alex in the winner’s circle as the two Spaniards became the first brothers to win in MotoGP. But the day belonged to the Gresini rider who leads his elder sibling by one point in the standings after taking the chequered flag, which was waved by Spanish tennis player Carlos Alcaraz. “The best birthday present – amazing. The first one in Jerez is something amazing,” said Alex, who celebrated his 29th birthday on Wednesday. “I cannot ask for more. It was a race where I was really clever in all the movements.” An action-packed opening lap had polesitter Quartararo get a perfect start off the line to take the lead into turn one while Saturday’s sprint winner, Marc, fell behind to fourth place. Alex tried to overtake three riders in front of him early on by threading the needle between bikes, but he braked too late and fell behind while Marc and Bagnaia collided while jostling for position. With Marc running in third and looking to overtake his teammate, the Spaniard then crashed at turn seven and rejoined in 22nd place with a damaged bike as thousands of fans around the circuit collectively groaned. Bagnaia did not have time to relax, however, as Alex came up behind him and elbowed the Italian out of the way to move up to second and put Quartararo in his sights. The Yamaha rider tried his best to keep Alex at bay, but on lap 11, the pace of the Ducati bike proved far too superior as he overtook Quartararo to draw a roar from the Marquez grandstand. Once Alex was in the clear, he began to disappear into the distance as Bagnaia could not catch up and struggled to overtake Quartararo, who doggedly held onto second place. “Incredible. To be on the podium is super special – especially with the gap to Alex and to keep Pecco [Bagnaia] behind in the race was so difficult,” said Quartararo, the 2021 MotoGP champion. “It’s been long years but super happy to be back on the podium in Jerez.”",

    "title": "Car drives into Vancouver’s Lapu Lapu street festival crowd: What we know",
    "article_text": "Police in Canada have ruled out “terrorism” as a motive for adeadly car rammingat a street festival in Vancouver. At least nine people were killed and several injured on Saturday night while they attended celebrations for a major Filipino festival. Investigationsare ongoingas a 30-year-old suspect is in custody. Here is what to know about the incident and the latest on the ground: At 8:14pm on Saturday (03:14 GMT on Sunday), a man drove into a crowd gathered for Lapu-Lapu Day, according to the Vancouver Police Department. The festival’s main act had just concluded, and crews were taking down the stage, tents and vendor stalls. They also lifted a barricade that had been blocking traffic to allow a vehicle through when a car suddenly sped into the area, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp (CBC) reported. Witnesses described the vehicle as a black SUV and said they heard a car rev its engine before ploughing into the area. Photos of the vehicle believed to be involved circulated online with a damaged front. A witness who did not want to be named told the Reuters news agency that the driver had tried to run but was chased down by festival-goers and held against a fence for about 10 minutes until police arrived and arrested him. Advanced life support ambulances were dispatched to the scene, where bodies were seen lying on the ground. About 1am on Sunday (08:00 GMT), police ruled out “an act of terrorism” as a motive for the crash while they continued to investigate the incident. At this time, we are confident that this incident was not an act of terrorism. — Vancouver Police (@VancouverPD)April 27, 2025 The incident occurred near the intersection of East 41st Avenue and Fraser Street. Vancouver is a coastal city in Canada’s westernmost province of British Columbia. It is known for its natural beauty, including mountains, forests and the Pacific Ocean. Home to 662,248 people, it is considered one of the most diverse cities in Canada. According to the2021 census, a little more than half of the city’s population identified with one or more racial minority groups, and at least 244 different cultural origins were identified by its residents. Vancouver also has thesecond largestFilipino population in Canada after Toronto. It is an annual celebration in the Philippines to honour their Indigenous leader Datu Lapu-Lapu, who fought against Spanish colonisation. On April 27, 1521, he led his men in defeating Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan in the Battle of Mactan. British Columbiaofficially recognisedthis date as Lapu-Lapu Day in 2023. Saturday’s event marked the second year that Filipino community groups in Vancouver organised a block party to commemorate the occasion. It featured a parade, a film screening, dancing and a concert with two members of the Black Eyed Peas featured in the lineup published by the organisers. Police confirmed early on Sunday that nine people have been killed while the number of those injured remains unclear. Vancouver interim Chief Constable Steve Rai said at a news conference that the victims were taken to multiple hospitals in the region. The Vancouver Police Department said its officers took the 30-year-old “lone male” suspect into custody at the scene. No further details about the man have been released although Rai said he was “known to police in certain circumstances”. Rai also declined to comment on a video circulating online that shows a young man in a black hoodie apologising while surrounded by shouting bystanders. A heavy police presence remains in the area as of early Sunday. A 24-hour assistance centre for affected individuals has been established at the Douglas Park Community Centre. Additionally, police and victim services professionals have been deployed to assist people who have not heard from friends or family members who attended the festival. Prime Minister Mark Carney said he was “devastated” to hear about the deadly incident. “I offer my deepest condolences to the loved ones of those killed and injured, to the Filipino Canadian community, and to everyone in Vancouver,” he wrote in a post on X. Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, who is facing off against Carney in elections on Monday, said in a post on social media that he was “shocked by the horrific news”. Philippine Senate President Francis Escudero condemned the act and urged the Philippine consulate in Vancouver to provide assistance to the victims.",

    "title": "Who is Hussein al-Sheikh, the new deputy to PLO’s Abbas?",
    "article_text": "Fatah veteranHussein al-Sheikhhas been appointed deputy chair of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). This puts him in line to succeed the 89-year-old leader of both, Mahmoud Abbas who is president of the Palestinian Authority (PA) as well. The appointment of al-Sheikh followsyears of international pressureto reform the PLO, brought to the fore as Arab and Western actors envision an expanded role for the PA in the post-war governance of theGaza Strip. The vice presidency was created during the 32nd session of the Palestinian Central Council in Ramallah earlier this week, andal-Sheikh’s appointment officially approvedon Saturday. Al-Sheikh, 64, is a veteran leader of Abbas’s Fatah movement, which dominates the PA, and is considered close to the president. Marwan Bishara, Al Jazeera’s senior political analyst, said al-Sheikh has been “groomed for the past 18 years” by Abbas. “He [al-Sheikh] has been around since 2007 after Abbas took over after the split between Gaza and the occupied West Bank,” Bishara said, noting that the new deputy leader has been the main person coordinating with Israel on security matters. “The Israelis know him and trust him – more than they know and trust Abbas.” Since 2007, he has served as the head of the General Authority of Civil Affairs, the authority that handles a lot of coordination with Israel in the occupied West Bank. In 2022, he was made the PLO Executive Committee’s secretary-general and head of its negotiations department, a sensitive portfolio, demonstrating his close ties to Abbas. Abbas also recently appointed him as the head of a committee overseeing Palestinian diplomatic missions abroad. Al-Sheikh was born in Ramallah in 1960 to a merchant family that had been ethnically cleansed from their village during the 1948 Nakba. At the age of six, he saw Israel occupy the West Bank, which likely pushed him to join Fatah at a young age. He was imprisoned by Israel as a teenager, spending 10 years behind bars, from 1978 to 1988. During his imprisonment, he learned Hebrew, a skill that would place him in a good position to negotiate with Israel later on. When he was released, he remained with Fatah and climbed the ranks. He is the father of four daughters and two sons. In the event of Abbas’s death or resignation, the deputy chair would be expected to become the acting head of the PLO and of the State of Palestine, which is recognised by nearly 150 countries. Concerns have been growing within thePLOthat Israel might exploit Abbas’s departure and a possible power vacuum. Senior Hamas official Bassem Naim gave al-Sheikh’s appointment a frosty reception. “The Palestinian people are not a herd to have imposed upon them leaders with dubious history who have tied their present and future to the occupation,” he said in a statement. “Legitimacy is held only by the Palestinian people… The guardianship over our people is long gone.” The PLO is an umbrella organisation comprising several Palestinian political factions. But it excludes Hamas and the Islamic Jihad, which are currently fighting Israeli forces in Gaza and are at odds with Abbas. Founded in 1964, the PLO is empowered to negotiate and sign international treaties on behalf of the Palestinian people, while the PA is responsible for governing parts of the Palestinian territory, particularly the occupied West Bank.",

    "title": "Scoring goals: Women’s football in Egypt on the rise",
    "article_text": "Every time Amira Mohamed stepped onto the pitch, it was never just a game. For her, and hundreds of Egyptian female footballers, the field was a battlefield – not one against opponents, but against generational scepticism. “It wasn’t always normal for girls to play football,” she said. “It felt like no one took us seriously. But we kept going anyway. We played in silence, with no audience, just for the love of the game.” Growing up, Mohamed dreamed of playing under stadium lights one day, wearing the jersey of either Al Ahly or Zamalek, Egypt’s two biggest teams, and hearing her name called out by commentators. Back then, it felt impossible, “a fantasy reserved only for boys”, as she put it. But over the past decade, change came, although slow and gruelling. “Things have changed,” she told Al Jazeera. “It’s now easier as big clubs are investing, matches are on TV, and dreams we used to hide are finally being seen.” For as long as Egyptians have known football, it has been a man’s game, played in dusty alleyways, cheered from packed stadiums, and broadcast on television screens across the country. Most women, however, watched from the sidelines. That dynamic, for the most part, still holds. But in 2024, something shifted. For the first time, Egypt’s Women’s Premier League wasbroadcaston national television, and for players like Mohamed, it was a moment when their dreams finally felt achievable. Launched in 1998, the women’s league limped along in obscurity for years, with few clubs willing to support it, and as recently as 2021, it featured just 11 teams. But the past few years have brought unprecedented change. Five new clubs have joined, and youth teams for girls in the under-15 classification, and even at an under-13 level, have been introduced. Even mega clubs like Al Ahly and Zamalek have established women’s squads, driven not only by FIFA regulations but also by a growing awareness of the potential and power of women in sport. And now, Egypt’s ON Sports satellite channel has done something unprecedented; women’s league matches are now on TV, particularly those featuring marquee clubs, and in an added surprise, some of these fixtures now include post-match analysis. According to the head coach of Egypt’s women’s national team, Abdel Fattah Abbas, the game has made significant strides, despite many roadblocks. “Much of the momentum [goes] to Sahar el-Hawary, a former Egyptian Football Association member and longtime champion of the women’s game,” he said. “She was instrumental in persuading FIFA to withhold professional licensing from major clubs unless they field women’s teams.” The burgeoning movement also saw Egyptian players like Eman Hassan and Laila El Behery sign professional contracts with international clubs, turning what was once seen as a hobby into a viable career path. Some parents are even now enrolling their daughters in residential football academies. Initiatives such as “1,000 Girls, 1,000 Dreams”, a collaboration between the British Council and Egypt’s Ministry of Youth and Sports, and the Dutch-funded KNVB WorldCoaches programme, are empowering women in local communities. “Every coach returns to their hometown, spreading the game and opening doors for girls,” says Basant Tarek, a veteran player and trainer with KNVB. Though some of these programmes have concluded, their impact lingers. Girls’ football teams are now emerging in schools and youth centres across the country. For years, however, the progress of women in football was held back by societal stigma. Many parents refused to support their daughters’ ambitions, seeing football as a sport for boys. Families often feared for their daughters’ reputations, believing that playing a traditionally masculine sport would be a violation of traditional gender roles. Aya Abdel Hady, a trailblazing coach with roots in Upper Egypt, knows firsthand the cultural resistance female footballers often face. “It was hard to get full support at first,” she said. “There were so many obstacles: society, family, and even the clubs themselves. People just didn’t see the value in women’s football.” But her love for the game never wavered. Injuries eventually curtailed her playing career, but they could not end her football journey. “If anything, they [the injuries] pushed me into coaching,” she added. “It was a new challenge, and I embraced it.” That transition led her from local academies to elite roles, including head coach at Al Ahly’s Sheikh Zayed Academy and technical director of City Club’s women’s division. Today, Abdel Hady coaches futsal – a type of football that is played indoors with five players on each side – in Saudi Arabia. Yara Amir, another rising star in Egypt’s women’s football scene, echoed these sentiments of transformation. “The perception of women’s football has changed significantly in recent years,” she explained. “It’s more visible now. It still doesn’t match the popularity of the men’s game, but the interest is definitely growing.” That shift did not come easily. Amir recalled the scepticism she encountered early on. “A lot of people thought football wasn’t a sport for girls,” she told Al Jazeera. “They were genuinely surprised to see me play. I had to prove, not just my ability, but that I belonged.” Her journey began in childhood, kicking a plastic ball alone, before gradually joining games with boys in her neighbourhood. “That deepened my love for the game,” Amir added. “My family rallied behind me, and that made all the difference.” A similar story belongs to Yasmin Yasser, a licensed coach and professional player who grew up in Mansoura, a city without a single women’s league team. “People thought football was only for boys,” she told Al Jazeera. “Many believed a girl’s place was at home, not on the pitch.” The pushback was relentless. But Yasser credits her late father, a former professional footballer himself, for being her steadfast champion. With few opportunities in her hometown, she honed her skills playing in the streets before joining academies and eventually working her way into Al Ahly’s ranks. Yasser then enrolled in coaching programmes, earning both D and C-standard licences, allowing her to work with players from beginner to advanced skill levels. “I want to be a role model,” she said, adding, “Not just for the girls, but for parents, so they understand the value of supporting young talent.” Today, with interest in women’s football surging across Egypt, advocates like Abbas argue that the sport’s visibility must translate into tangible investment. “Without them, these promising talents risk being trapped in a cycle of underfunding and missed opportunities,” he said. “The steps taken were vital, but they’re far from enough. The resources allocated to women’s football are still dramatically lower than those for the men’s game. This lack of support affects everything: training quality, equipment, salaries, even transportation.” For Abdel Hady, the televised matches are a sign of genuine progress, as “it opens doors for players to go professional, locally and internationally”. But the growth, she insists, remains fragile. Support from top-tier clubs is still limited, and without long-term planning and real investment – technical, financial, and infrastructural – the momentum could easily stall. “These televised matches give girls across the country the chance to be seen, to believe this path is possible,” Yasser agreed, but like Abdel Hady, she is keenly aware of the disparities. “There are lower-tier teams that barely have uniforms, let alone medical staff or travel funding.” At one point in her career, Yasser was paying out of pocket for transport and training costs. “Societal doubt hasn’t fully faded,” Amir said, echoing the same sentiment. “Some people are still unsure whether women’s football is really ‘worth it’. But we keep pushing.” Like many of her peers, she dreamed of playing professionally for leading clubs and one day donning the national team jersey. “I also hope to be part of something larger,” she said. “There’s no limit to what we can do.” This article is published in collaboration withEgab.",

The buyers of the digital assets accuse Nike of causing “the rug to be pulled out from under them,” and say they wouldn’t have bought its NFTs if they’d known they were “unregistered securities,”reportsReuters. Filed in New York’s Eastern District, the proposed class action lawsuit seeks “unspecified damages of more than $5 million for alleged violations of New York, California, Florida and Oregon consumer protection laws.” Nike tried to jump into the NFT game bybuying RTFKT in 2021.

    "title": "OnePlus 13R review: Maybe just buy a Pixel 9A",
    "article_text": "A good midrange phone that lacks mass appeal. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. byAllison Johnson If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. The OnePlus 13R is a particular kind of midrange phone for a particular kind of person. It’s a pared-down version of the OnePlus 13 — which is a full-on flagship anda good one at that. And even though it shares a lot of the flagship DNA, the 13R lacks peace-of-mind features present on the Google Pixel 9A, like full water resistance and new OS versions for seven years. It’s also not exactly cheap, with an MSRP of $599. But if all that reduces its mass appeal, the 13R makes up for it in two key places: battery life and screen. Is it worth buying over the $499 Pixel 9A? That depends on the particular kind of person you are. The OnePlus 13R is a pared-down version of the company’s flagship phone, and it offers excellent battery life and a great screen for the price. The 13R offers a big 6.78-inch OLED panel with a variable refresh rate up to 120Hz, and its 1264 x 2780 resolution is enough to keep things sharp. You’ll have a hard time finding another screen this big and fancy on a midrange phone, at least one sold in the US. It’s plenty bright in direct sun, and it maintains its peak brightness well. The always-on display is hard to see in the sun without waking the screen, but that’s a minor complaint. The 13R has an IP65 rating, meaning it’s fully dust resistant and can withstand some serious splashes. But it’s not guaranteed to withstand full immersion in water, and plenty of modern phones in this price bracket are. The iPhone 16E and Pixel 9A offer IP68 water resistance, as does the pricier OnePlus 13. Most 13R owners probably won’t have a problem with this, but it doesn’t sit super well with me that all of the major competition at this price offers better water resistance. OnePlus made compromises to keep the 13R’s price down, but performance isn’t one of them. It comes with a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, last year’s top-tier chipset, which is still a banger in 2025. There’s also 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage in the base model. That’s plenty of power to keep it running smoothly, and nothing I could throw at it in my day-to-day gave it trouble. It never so much as flinched doing my little daily chores and scrolling, and it barely warmed up during an extended free roam session inPocket City 2. I used the phone with the always-on display and high-performance mode enabled, plus a generous screen time-out setting because sometimes I need to look at a recipe 20 times before I remember how many teaspoons of sesame oil it calls for. All those things drain the battery faster, but I never got lower than 50 percent by the end of the day, even on days with long bike rides tracked on Strava and extended TikTok scrolling sessions. This is a two-day battery for most people, and that’s probably something that people want right now more than gimmicky AI features, which are blissfully minimal on the 13R. OnePlus has promised four major OS upgrades and six years of security updates for the 13R, which is better than the company has done in the past and will probably be enough for most people who buy this phone. But Google offers seven years of OS upgrades on the 9A on top of frequent security updates. If you’re looking to squeeze as many years out of your device as possible, the 9A would be a better choice, even at its $100 lower MSRP. Something else the 9A offers that the 13R doesn’t? Wireless charging. The OnePlus 13R offers speedywiredcharging — up to 55W with the included charger. That’s handy if you need a quick top off during the day or want to charge your phone while you handle your morning routine. But you’ll get 0 if you drop it on a wireless charger stationed on your nightstand, which I did, and couldn’t figure out why it wasn’t charging until I remembered. Not everyone cares about wireless charging, and fast charging can come in handy, but for $599 you should at least have the option to charge wirelessly. The 13R includes three rear cameras: a 50-megapixel f/1.8 stabilized main, 50-megapixel f/2.0 2x telephoto, and an 8-megapixel ultrawide. Photo quality is good overall, and the 2x telephoto camera is an improvement over the low-res macro camera on last year’s model. Images tend toward a bright aesthetic that I find a little much at times, and fine detail is pretty crunchy if you look close. But if you give it good lighting and a photogenic subject, it will do them justice. “How much does this phone cost?” is a question I am constantly trying to answer. In this case, the answer is just as complicated as always. The 13R’s MSRP is $599, but right now it’s marked down to $499 from OnePlus and Best Buy — no limited-time deal or anything, just a straight up hundred dollar discount. Is that a forever price? What happens if tariffs actually hit? Unclear! Honestly, $499 feels like the right price for this phone and $599 feels like just a bit too much for a phone lacking wireless charging and an IP68 rating. The 13R offers strong battery life and a very good screen for its class, and if those are your top priorities, then this is a solid pick. But for everyone else, I think there’s a better option in the Pixel 9A. Photography by Allison Johnson / The Verge Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it — contracts that no one actually reads. It’s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements. But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit “agree” to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don’t read and definitely can’t negotiate. To use the OnePlus 13 and 13R, you need to agree to: There are also several optional agreements that you need to get past during setup: In total, that’s six mandatory agreements and six optional agreements.

    "title": "Clair Obscur: Expedition 33’s battles are best when you break them",
    "article_text": "When everything clicks into place, you can deal massive damage. When everything clicks into place, you can deal massive damage. byJay Peters Clair Obscur: Expedition 33has flashy, thrilling battles, but the best thing about them is how you can twist the game’s many systems to your advantage. The turn-based RPG combat might feel familiar, but it offers a lot of ways to customize your approach to battles so that you can do absolutely devastating amounts of damage. InExpedition 33,you play as a group of Expeditioners who aim to destroy The Paintress, a mysterious being that erases everyone of a certain age every year. In battles, you can have up to three of your party participating in a fight, and should they all die, you can call in your teammates who are in reserve to try and finish off the enemies. To show you how deep the rabbit hole can go in customizing your team, here’s my approach to building out just one character, the fencer Maelle. Every character can equip three “Pictos,” which offer passive buffs like giving you the defense-boosting Shell status at the start of a fight. But after you win a few fights with a Pictos equipped, other characters canalsoequip the Pictos as a “Lumina” by using “Lumina Points,” which you accumulate through leveling up and by using a resource you can find in the game. When you mix and match Pictos and Luminas to stack complimentary bonuses, things really get going. For my version of Maelle, I set a combination of Pictos and Luminas that could let her deal potentially enormous amounts of damage, especially if a lucky critical hit and a coin-flip 200 percent damage buff went through. But as a counterbalance to Maelle’s huge power, some of the Pictos and Luminas also increased the amount of damage shereceived, so I added defensive ones that helped her better withstand hits. In battle, each character also has a unique mechanic that, when used properly, lets you make their attacks more effective. Maelle, for example, relies on different “stances” that you can shift into: an offensive stance that increases the damage you give but also the damage you receive, a defensive stance that reduces the damage you take, and a “virtuous” stance that does 200 percent damage but can be harder to set up. With Maelle, you can move into the different stances based on which of your six different “skills” you use in battle — and like with Pictos and Luminas, those are also customizable and have their own traits and potential synergies. It can be a lot to manage, and the game often helps in battles by adding a little sparkle to suggest a move for your current situation. But even within the first few hours of the game, I was able to grasp the potential of what was possible with the battle system. And with Maelle, when I nailed the combination of setting up the right stance and a lucky break from my Pictos and Luminas, I regularly could absolutely demolish my foes by dealing thousands of points of damage. (A late-game Pictos that let me exceed 9,999 points of damage in a single hit was particularly welcome.) That’s just my approach with one character; each of the other party members has their own playstyles to experiment with and potential skills to use. Your equipped weapons are an element to consider, too. The game shines when everyone’s abilities and skills line up perfectly for a series of explosive hits, and it’s especially satisfying when things come together to melt down a tricky boss’s health bar. I definitely didn’t useExpedition 33’s battle system, which makes things easy to experiment with, to its fullest. Once I found a combination of characters and skills that I liked, I rarely deviated from them. But I have lots of ideas on how to try things differently for a hard mode run — I’m sure there are a lot more ways to absolutely break the game.

(I know a lot of you like Analog stuff, too, so PSA: there’sa new “Steel” versionof the system that is extremely nice-looking.) Jeff is one of those people who likes everything to be just so, which I very much appreciate about him. I asked him to share his homescreen with us, wondering if it would be the same thing. I was not disappointed. Here’s Jeff’s homescreen, plus some info on the apps he uses and why: The phone:iPhone 16 Pro. The wallpaper:Solid black. I never understood how people can see their apps with a busy photo behind them. 🤷‍♂️My lockscreen is a photo I took in Copenhagen. The apps:Photos, Fantastical, Ugmonk, Google Maps, Weather, Apple Podcasts, MyMind, Dropbox Paper, X, Instagram, Threads, Apple Notes, Camera, Spotify, Phone, Shopify, Mail, Messages, Slack, Safari. I use theDueapp widget to capture to-do’s when I’m on the go and then I transfer these onto anAnalog Cardonce I’m at my desk so they actually get done.Fantastical’s natural language input is so much nicer than iCal’s. “Call with David Pierce tomorrow 10AM.” I save everything toMyMind.

    "title": "Evidence in lawsuit raises new questions about 9/11 terror attacks",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 27, 2025 / 7:59 PM EDT/ CBS News Evidence has emerged that could change our understanding of the 9/11 terrorist attacks more than two decades ago. It was turned over to the FBI in the weeks after9/11, but our reporting has uncovered it was never shared with the bureau's own field agents or top intelligence officials. Why after all these years is this crucial information just surfacing? The evidence is coming to light as part of a long-running lawsuit against the Saudi government by the families of the nearly 3,000 people killed in the attacks, and it includes a chilling video of a Saudi national filming the U.S. Capitol. A voice on the video says in Arabic, \"I am transmitting these scenes to you from the heart of the American capital, Washington.\" This video, recorded in the summer of 1999, was unsealed in federal court last year as part of the 9/11 families lawsuit accusing Saudi Arabia of providing crucial support to the hijackers. Exhibit A in their case: the man who made the video, Omar al-Bayoumi – who asked a bystander to film him in front of the Capitol. The FBI says Bayoumi was living in the United States on a student visa and being paid by a Saudi aviation company in California – despite not showing up for classes or work. Investigators say, in fact, Bayoumi was an operative of the Saudi intelligence service and had close ties to two of the hijackers. The video was filmed over several days. Bayoumi recorded entrances and exits of the Capitol, security posts, a model of the building, and nearby landmarks. Bayoumi points out the Washington monument and says, \"I will get over there,\" and \"report to you in detail what is there.\" He also notes the airport is not far away. Richard Lambert: What I see Bayoumi doing is going out and making a detailed video record of the Capitol from all its sides, and then conducting that 360 degree panoramic view. Richard Lambert is a retired FBI supervisor who led the initial 9/11 investigation in San Diego, where Bayoumi and the two hijackers lived prior to the attacks. He's now a consultant on the case filed by the 9/11 families. Richard Lambert: If you've ever flown into Washington D.C., one of the first things you see on the horizon is the Washington Monument. So, if you know where your other targets are, it helps guide you to your intended target. Federal investigators believe the hijackers on Flight 93, which crashed near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, planned to hit the U.S. Capitol as their likely target. In the video, Bayoumi references a, quote, \"plan.\" Richard Lambert: \"You said that in the plan.\" What plan? Cecilia Vega: What do you think he's talking about? Richard Lambert: I think he's talking to the al Qaeda planners who tasked him to take the pre-operational surveillance video of the intended target. Cecilia Vega: So, this video is taken in late June and early July of 1999. What does that timing tell you? Richard Lambert: Well, that means it was taken within 90 days of the time when senior al Qaeda planners reached the decision that the Capitol would be a target of the 9/11 attacks. That's when Osama bin Laden decided to approve the so-called \"planes operation\" proposed by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of 9/11. During a raid on Bayoumi's U.K. apartment about 10 days after the attacks, British police discovered the Capitol video, along with about 80 other tapes and a trove of documents now being used as evidence in the families' lawsuit. This internal FBI report, dated Oct. 11, 2001, shows that \"copies of all recovered exhibits\" were \"sent to FBI-New York via Federal Express,\" but the Capitol video never made it to the San Diego field office. Danny Gonzalez: I had not seen that video. Retired FBI special agent Danny Gonzalez, one of the lead 9/11 investigators in San Diego, says he never knew about the video during the 15 years he worked on the case. He is also a consultant for the 9/11 families' lawsuit. Danny Gonzalez: Not only did I not know, all of the case agents in San Diego didn't know, and the case agents in New York didn't know. And we're talking about the Joint Terrorism Task Forces that not only have F.B.I., but we have other state, local, and federal agencies, they did not know either. Cecilia Vega: How is that possible? Danny Gonzalez: I don't have that answer, and that-- that angers me. When I saw that video, I knew exactly what it was. Cecilia Vega: Did you need this information to do your job? Danny Gonzalez: Absolutely. He believes he could've used the Capitol video to build a case against Bayoumi. Danny Gonzalez: I would've taken it to the United States Attorney's Office–who was requesting from us, the F.B.I.--anything that we had they wanted to look at. Cecilia Vega: Meaning what? That they would have filed charges? That they would have indicted? What were you hoping that would be? Danny Gonzalez: It was a terror investigation, but it was also a mass murder. Cecilia Vega: In your view, this video was so significant that it should've gone all the way to the top to the White House? Gina Bennett: I think it should have because it's the Capitol building. Gina Bennett was a senior counterterrorism analyst at the CIA for 20 years. Gina Bennett: In the aftermath of 9/11, we were briefing the President and the National Security Council. We didn't expect that this was a 'one and done'. We expected al Qaeda to continue to try. So, resources were going entirely to trying to undermine any additional plotting. Cecilia Vega: The Saudi government says, \"This is a tourist video. That there's nothing to see here.\" You–you don't buy that? Gina Bennett: No, I don't. Who does a tourist video that is reporting back on, \"This is where that building is, and here's where the security guards are.\" Now retired, she was the first person in the U.S. government to warn of the dangers of a global jihadist movement led by Osama bin Laden. Bennett has no involvement with the 9/11 families' lawsuit and says she too was unaware of the video's existence until we asked her to evaluate it. As we discovered, she was not the only one at the CIA in the dark. Cecilia Vega: George Tenet, the CIA director at the time, says he wasn't aware of the video. Same for Michael Morell, the president's daily intelligence briefer at the time. Does it surprise you that they didn't know about this? Gina Bennett: It does surprise me, again, because we're talking about the U.S. Capitol. And in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 Bayoumi was a suspect. Cecilia Vega: A lotta people will see this video for the first time and think, \"How is it remotely possible that it's just coming to light now?\" Could it really have been sitting in an evidence locker room all of these years? Seems like a pretty epic failure-- Gina Bennett: Well, I think it's a matter of did they lose the evidence or had they filed it away in a way that it would not have seemed relevant? That I can see. As it turns out, there was more evidence: specifically, thisairplane sketchand math formula that was also seized from Bayoumi's U.K. apartment and turned over to the FBI in 2001. It was stashed away for more than a decade until Danny Gonzalez in 2012 got a phone call out of the blue from an FBI evidence technician in Washington. Cecilia Vega: What did they tell you? Danny Gonzalez: They told me that they had these boxes with the name of Omar al-Bayoumi written on it. And they were sitting in a warehouse in Washington, D.C., and they were gonna relocate these boxes or destroy these boxes, and they wanted to know if I-- if I wanted 'em. And I said, \"Absolutely.\" Cecilia Vega: But as one of the lead investigators into these attacks, did you have any idea that this sketch had even existed before you got that phone call? Danny Gonzalez: No, I didn't. He had aviation and aerospace experts analyze the equation for the FBI. Their conclusion: a pilot could use it to calculate the rate of descent to hit a target on the horizon. In 2004, the 9/11 Commission produced what was at the time considered the definitive account of the attacks. Its executive director, Philip Zelikow, told us he was also unaware of it during his investigation. So were former senior U.S. intelligence officials we spoke to. As for Bayoumi – who was never charged with a crime and moved back to Saudi Arabia after 9/11 – he was asked about the sketch as part of the lawsuit in a 2021 deposition. He confirmed the sketch was his, but said he remembered little else about it, including his handwritten notes that say, \"hight (sic) [of] the plane from the earth in mile\" and \"distance from the plane to hurrizen (sic).\" When pressed about it, he came up with a far-fetched explanation. Omar al-Bayoumi (translator speaking English during deposition): Perhaps this was an equation that we studied before in high school and I was trying to remember whether I'm going to be able to figure out and solve it or not. Attorney (during deposition): And what is it an equation for? Omar al-Bayoumi (during deposition): I don't know. Just– just doesn't matter. Just equation. There's no proof that Bayoumi shared the equation with any of the hijackers. What we do know is that he met the first two to arrive in the U.S. nearly two years before 9/11. Bayoumi claims he met them in a chance encounter at a restaurant here on Venice Boulevard in Los Angeles. He then helped them move to San Diego, finding them a place to live in his own apartment complex, co-signing the lease, and helping them open a bank account. He even threw a party, which he alsovideotaped, capturing one of the hijackers on camera. He then introduced them to others who helped them obtain government IDs and enroll in English classes and flight schools. Bayoumi and the Saudi government say his actions were innocent, the result of a remarkable series of coincidences. Cecilia Vega: Is it at all possible in your mind that Bayoumi wasn't actually involved in all of this, it's pure coincidence, as the Saudis claim? Danny Gonzalez: No, no. I don't believe that for a second. Cecilia Vega: Why not? Could've been a guy who just wanted to help his-- Danny Gonzalez: No. Cecilia Vega: --brothers adjust to a life in a new country. Danny Gonzalez: Who else did he help besides those two hijackers? I don't know of any, and I couldn't find any. Cecilia Vega: Omar al-Bayoumi is living as a free man in Saudi Arabia. What do you think about that? Danny Gonzalez: Awful, awful. He should be here under the court system. Cecilia Vega: The 9/11 Commission concluded that Bayoumi was, quote, \"An unlikely candidate for clandestine involvement with Islamic extremists.\" Does that still hold? Gina Bennett: I think the 9/11 Commission is just not fully informed. It's not their fault, but it's not fully informed. Cecilia Vega: So, all the evidence you've seen: the material support, the Capitol video, the sketch-- your conclusion is what? Gina Bennett: My conclusion is that Bayoumi was an al Qaeda facilitator. He had sympathies with al Qaeda–I mean ideologically–and that he provided substantial support to these two individuals, these two hijackers, without which they may very well have been caught. Bennett says Bayoumi was indispensable to the success of the hijackers' plot-- because they spoke no English, had little formal education, and no prior exposure to life in the West. Gina Bennett: I don't see al Qaeda, as meticulous as it was with its planning, just throwing two operatives that are so instrumental to the success of this operation into a massive city without a soft landing, without a network there to catch them. She says the new evidence raises a lot of important questions. Cecilia Vega: Like what? Gina Bennett: Who else? Were there other networks? Are any of those individuals still active here or elsewhere in the world? Is there any other evidence that's sitting in a– in a box somewhere or, you know, locked up? And work from that new information to learn. To learn what you got wrong. To learn how not to get it wrong again. The government of Saudi Arabia has filed a motion in federal court to dismiss the 9/11 families' lawsuit, saying neither the kingdom nor Omar al-Bayoumi had anything to do with the attacks. The judge overseeing the case is expected to rule on the motion soon. As for the FBI, it told us it would not comment on ongoing litigation. Produced by Richard Bonin and Mirella Brussani.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 27, 2025 / 7:56 PM EDT/ CBS News Earlier this month, a Trump administration plan to cut theNational Institutes of Healthbudget by more than 40% was leaked to the press. The preliminary budget sent shockwaves through the nation's health agency but also, the wider scientific community that relies on the NIH to fund research. Since January, 1,300 NIHemployees have been firedand more than $2 billion in research grants cancelled. It's all part of the administration's effort to shrink the federal government, an effort led by the Department of Government Efficiency, orDOGE. Tonight, you will hear from an NIH insider about the immediate impact of the cuts on research and patients. But we begin with Dr. Francis Collins, the longtime director of the agency. He told us why he abruptly left the NIH and why he fears aggressive downsizing could impact the health of Americans for generations. Dr. Francis Collins: When you're talking about medical research, when you're talking about people's lives, when you're talking about clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease or cancer that may take 3 or 4 years, you can't just go in and decide, 'I'm going to shut those down and maybe I'll try something else.' Those are people's lives at risk. Dr. Francis Collins spent 32 years at the National Institutes of Health, serving as the agency's director for 12 years under three presidential administrations. But he says even he was unprepared for the speed and severity of budget cuts at the NIH. Sharyn Alfonsi: Give me a sense of what it was like inside the NIH, as these cuts started rolling out. Dr. Francis Collins: Almost immediately, after Inauguration. There were statements made that you were not allowed, for instance, to start any new projects. The ability to order supplies-- was cut off. Eventually, it was started back up again. But then, they put a $1 limit on what you could order. There's not much you can order for $1. Collins joined the NIH in 1993 to lead the Human Genome Project and, later, directed the agency's development of new tests, therapeutics and vaccines during the pandemic. Still, he says, even after COVID, most people don't know what the NIH does. Dr. Francis Collins: The National Institutes of Health, NIH, is the largest supporter of biomedical research in the world. Sharyn Alfonsi: What are some of the medical breakthroughs that people might not be aware of that came through the NIH? Dr. Francis Collins: Deaths from heart disease are down by 75% in the last 40 years. That's NIH. Deaths from stroke are down about 75%. That's NIH. HIV, AIDS. Where that was a death sentence, now if you have access to those antiretrovirals, NIH and drug companies came up with that, you have a normal lifespan. The NIH is headquartered on this sprawling 300-acre campus in Bethesda, Maryland. It's home to the largest clinical research hospital in the world, and 27 research institutes and centers. The \"leaked\" budget draft includes a plan to consolidate those 27 institutes and centers into eight and eliminate four, including the Institutes on Nursing Research and Minority Health. If approved by Congress, it would be the largest budget cut by an administration to the health agency, but not the first. Most recently, Presidents Bush and Obama made smaller cuts to the NIH, which currently has a $47 billion budget. But Collins says the bulk of that budget, more than 80%, goes to researchers off campus. Dr. Francis Collins: Most of that goes out to the universities and institutes all over the country. They're the ones that do the work, but they get the funds from NIH by writing very compelling grant applications that go through the most rigorous peer review system in the world. Some of those researchers' work lines America's medicine cabinets, such as statins, antidepressants, and new forms of insulin. A Journal of the American Medical Association study found that between 2010 and 2019, 99% of FDA-approved drugs had ties to research funded by the NIH. Dr. Francis Collins: Every dollar that NIH gave out in 2024 to a grant is estimated to have returned $2.46 just in a year. That's a pretty darn good return on investment. But not good enough to escape the crosshairs of the Trump administration's sweeping budget cuts. In February, Dr. Collins decided to leave the NIH. Dr. Francis Collins: It just became untenable. I was-- as every other scientist in that circumstance--not allowed to speak-- in any kind of scientific meeting or public setting Sharyn Alfonsi: You don't think if you woulda stayed there you would've been in a better position to fight for the scientists and the work? Dr. Francis Collins: I don't think it would've helped. I would've been pretty much in a circumstance of not being able to speak about it. With the exception of a series of rallies, most scientists connected to the NIH haveremained quiet. Some, like this physician-scientist, who still works at the agency, fear their jobs or research may be targeted for speaking up. He asked us to conceal his identity. NIH insider: I've never seen the morale of an institution or any place change so abruptly to where we feel fear. It began, he says, in February, when more than a thousand probationary employees were placed  on leave. Sharyn Alfonsi: When that happened, that first hit, what was the reaction, like immediately and in the office the next Monday? NIH insider: Tears. Everybody trying to assess damage, who's been fired, who hasn't been fired, what do we do? And then an immediate sort of assessment-- in the clinical center: \"Okay, can we still take care of patients and our research participants? Is it still safe?\" Sharyn Alfonsi: No one thought before they fired the people that dealt with the patients that maybe they shouldn't be fired? NIH insider: This didn't come from within NIH, it came from outside, they don't know what these people do. As DOGE dismantled parts of the agency, employees told us work on child cancer therapies, dementia, and stroke slowed or stopped because critical lab and support staff were let go. NIH employees shared these photos. They say even after a six-week spending freeze at the agency was lifted, some shelves and refrigerators that held supplies for trials and patients remained empty because much of the staff that procured those supplies was fired. NIH insider: You can't run an organization as complicated as NIH without a support system. Doctors and nurses and scientists can't function without a lot of other resources. They need an entire support infrastructure. And that has now been decimated. Some of the fired employees have been brought back. Others are stillbeing paid but not allowed to work. NIH insider: This doesn't feel like a strategic plan to reorganize and make the NIH better and more efficient. It feels like a wrecking ball. Sharyn Alfonsi: Typically, when a company has layoffs they talk about restructuring. There'll be a new structure and this is how it's gonna work. Is there a structure in place right now for the NIH? NIH insider: Not that anybody's shared.  We have no idea. You know making the organization better, everybody is for that . There is no question. But again-- this is not more efficient. It is infinitely less efficient right now  because you can't get anything done. The confusion in Bethesda has also paralyzed many of the 2,500 universities and institutes that rely on the NIH to help fund their research. So far, nearly 800 grants have been terminated- some on HIV and AIDS, trans health and COVID-19 after researchers were told their work was no longer an agency priority. And last week, the NIH signaled that more  cuts could be coming. It announced that any university with a DEI program or that boycotts an Israeli company might not be awarded new NIH grants for medical research  and that existing grants could be terminated. Kristin Weinstein: Without NIH funding I would not be where I am today. Kristin Weinstein is a wife, mother, and PhD candidate at the University of Washington. She hoped to continue her research on cancer and autoimmunity after graduation. Sharyn Alfonsi: And now what are you thinking about your future? Kristin Weinstein: Yeah. It's in some ways bleak. Nationwide, there is a hiring freeze at virtually every major-- academic university. And even if I did happen to secure a position, now the funding is so uncertain, I don't know if I would have funding to actually do the research that I was hired on to do in whatever lab I join. We're very seriously considering, at this point, leaving the United States. Weinstein has met with faculty at universities in Europe and spoken to labs in Canada. She's not alone. A survey of 1,600 scientists and graduate students reported 75% are considering leaving the U.S. to work. Australia, Europe, and China have already boosted recruitment efforts hoping to capitalize on the potential \"brain drain.\" Kristin Weinstein: I grew up with this notion that if I studied hard I would be able to pursue whatever my interest was. How can I believe in the American Dream when I would have to leave my own country to pursue my career? The uncertainty has also created concern for Beth Humphrey  - and her daughter Laura.  Beth was diagnosed with Alzheimer's last year. Beth Humphrey: It was devastating. There's no successful treatment. And it-- it is ultimately terminal. The 68-year-old grandmother joined an NIH-funded Alzheimer's study run by Duke University and the University of North Carolina. Now, the Trump administration wants to restrict how much universities are reimbursed for overhead costs, which critics argue act as a \"slush fund\" for schools. Twenty-two states, including North Carolina, are suing. Universities warn that policy could lead to billions in losses and would have a \"dire impact\" on \"life-saving\" trials and research. Sharyn Alfonsi: If the funding is cut, what does that mean to you? What's next? Beth Humphrey: That would be very disappointing to me. Laura Broom: This is not a partisan issue. Disease doesn't know your party affiliation or your socioeconomic status. And everyone in America knows someone who has been affected by Alzheimer's. Earlier, this month,Dr. Jay Bhattacharyatook office as the new director of the NIH. Bhattacharya, a former Stanford professor whose research focused on the economics of health care, has said he was \"smeared\" by other academics after he argued against broad mask mandates and lockdowns during the pandemic. Dr. Jay Bhattacharya (during Senate Confirmation Hearing): I'll foster a culture where NIH leadership will actively encourage different perspectives Dr. Bhattacharya declined our request for an interview. But at his Senate confirmation hearing, he outlined his plan for the agency. Dr. Jay Bhattacharya (during Senate hearing): If confirmed, I will carry out President Trump and Secretary Kennedy's agenda of committing the NIH to address the dire chronic health needs of the country with gold standard science and innovation. One way the NIH will carry out that agenda, Bhattacharya says, is by creating a new database to study chronic disease. The NIH will also invest $50 million to study autism, in response to a request by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has clashed with scientists on the topic for years. This past week, Dr. Bhattacharya told agency advisors he is working hard to undo some of the recent -quote \"disruptions\" at the NIH, and called that draft proposal to cut its budget by 40% 'the beginning of a negotiation.'

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 27, 2025 / 7:56 PM EDT/ CBS News Two people were arrested this weekend in connection with theEaster Sunday theftof Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's purse, authorities confirmed Sunday. The first suspect was arrested in Washington, D.C., on Saturday, according to the U.S. Secret Service. Noem said Sunday that the man was in the country illegally. She called the suspect a \"career criminal,\" but did not specify any more details about the individual's immigration status. Mario Bustamante Leiva, 49, has been arrested and charged with two counts of robbery. He also faces additional charges for an offense being investigated by the United States Secret Service, authorities said. Matt McCool, the Secret Service special agent in charge at the Washington field office, said the \"investigation revealed alleged criminal activity, including potential device and credit card fraud\" by the suspect, but the incident \"had no protective nexus\" to Noem's position as Secretary of Homeland Security. \"The defendant was taken into custody without incident in the District of Columbia,\" McCool said. The Secret Service also confirmed a second suspect was arrested in Miami on Sunday by its agents and Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. The person has not been identified but authorities say both suspects were in the U.S. illegally and the second suspect is being held on an immigration detainer. Noem's purse was stolen on Sunday, April 21, from a Washington, D.C. restaurant. According to three law enforcement sources, her bag contained a number of sensitive personal items, including Noem's driver's license, passport, DHS access badge, checks and roughly $3,000 in cash. Noem's cell phone was not in the purse, but credit cards, makeup and medication were among the items stolen. Investigators say security footage showed the suspect was wearing a mask and Noem's purse was placed against her foot underneath her seat.

    "title": "What 9/11 evidence unsealed in court reveals years after the attacks",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 27, 2025 / 7:47 PM EDT/ CBS News In its 2004 report, the 9/11 Commission described Saudi national Omar al-Bayoumi as \"an unlikely candidate for clandestine involvement with Islamic extremists.\" But evidence seized from his apartment in 2001 casts a different light on Bayoumi, former members of the U.S. intelligence community say. Gina Bennett, who was a counterterrorism analyst at the CIA during theterror attacks, believes the 9/11 Commission lacked some crucial information. Based on the evidence she's seen, Bennett said she concluded \"Bayoumi was an al Qaeda facilitator\" who provided substantial support to \"two hijackers, without which they may very well have been caught.\" The recently surfaced evidence, which wasunsealed in federal courtlast year as part of the 9/11 families' lawsuit against Saudi Arabia, homes in on Bayoumi. The FBI says Bayoumi was living in the United States on a student visa before the terrorist attacks and was being paid by a Saudi aviation company in California, despite not showing up for classes or work. The FBI says Bayoumi was an operative of the Saudi intelligence service and had close ties to two of the hijackers. While in the U.S., Bayoumi recorded video footage in Washington over several days in the summer of 1999. It includes entrances and exits of the Capitol, security posts, a model of the building and nearby landmarks. Bayoumi points out the Washington Monument and says, in Arabic, \"I will get over there\" and \"report to you in detail what is there.\" He also notes the airport is not far away. Retired FBI supervisor Richard Lambert, who led the initial 9/11 investigation in San Diego, where Bayoumi and two hijackers lived prior to the attacks, is now a consultant on the case filed by the 9/11 families. He said knowing where the Washington Monument is in relation to other areas would be critical for anyone planning an attack. Federal investigators believe the hijackers on Flight 93, which crashed near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, planned to hit the U.S. Capitol as their likely target. Bayoumi can be heard referencing a \"plan\" in his video. \"I think he's talking to the al Qaeda planners who tasked him to take the pre-operational surveillance video of the intended target,\" Lambert said. The video was taken within 90 days of the time when senior al Qaeda planners decided to target the Capitol. That's when Osama bin Laden decided to approve the \"planes operation\" proposed by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of 9/11. The Saudi government says Bayoumi's video is just a tourist video, a claim that Bennett — who was the first person in the U.S. government to warn of the dangers of a global jihadist movement led by bin Laden — disputes. Bennett, who has no involvement with the 9/11 families' lawsuit, says she was unaware of the Bayoumi video's existence until 60 Minutes brought it to her for evaluation. She was not the only one at the CIA in the dark: former CIA Director George Tenet, and Michael Morell, the president's daily intelligence briefer at the time of the attacks, both say they were unaware of the videos. The former CIA analyst said she was surprised they didn't learn about the video after the attacks, when Bayoumi was considered a suspect. \"I think it's a matter of did they lose the evidence or had they filed it away in a way that it would not have seemed relevant?\" Bennett said. \"That I can see.\" British police discovered the Bayoumi Capitol video, along with about 80 other tapes and a trove of documents, during a raid on the Saudi man's apartment in Birmingham, England, about 10 days after the 9/11 attacks. An internal FBI report, dated Oct. 11, 2001, shows that \"copies of all recovered exhibits\" were \"sent to FBI-New York via Federal Express.\" But the Capitol video never made it to the San Diego field office, where Bayoumi and the hijackers lived before 9/11. Other seized evidence included adocument featuring an airplane sketch and an equation. The sketch was stashed away for more than a decade until 2012, when Danny Gonzalez, then one of the FBI's lead 9/11 investigators, got a phone call out of the blue from an FBI evidence technician in Washington. He was told there were boxes with Bayoumi's name on them stashed in a Washington warehouse. \"They were gonna relocate these boxes or destroy these boxes, and they wanted to know if I wanted them,\" Gonzalez said. \"I said, 'Absolutely.'\" He had aviation and aerospace experts analyze the equation on the plane sketch document for the FBI. They concluded that a pilot could use the formula on the document to calculate the rate of descent to hit a target on the horizon. Bayoumi, who was never charged with a crime and who moved back to Saudi Arabia after 9/11, was asked about the sketch as part of the lawsuit during a 2021 deposition. He confirmed the sketch was his, but said he remembered little else about it, including his handwritten notes about the height of the plane from the Earth in miles, along with the distance of the plane to the horizon. \"Perhaps this was an equation that we studied before in high school, and I was trying to remember whether I'm going to be able to figure out and solve it or not,\" he said through a translator when pressed. There's no proof that Bayoumi shared the equation with any of the hijackers, but he did meet the first two to arrive in the U.S. in early 2000, nearly two years before the 9/11 attacks. Bayoumi claims he met the hijackers — Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar — in a chance encounter at a Los Angeles restaurant. He then helped them move to San Diego, finding them a place to live in his own apartment complex, co-signing the lease, and helping them open a bank account. He even threw a party, which he also videotaped, capturing one of the hijackers on camera. Bayoumi then introduced the eventual hijackers to others in the community, who helped them obtain government IDs and enroll in English classes and flight schools. Bennett says Bayoumi was indispensable to the success of the hijackers' plot because they spoke no English, had little formal education and no prior exposure to life in the West. While Bayoumi and the Saudi government say Bayoumi's actions were innocent, Gonzalez doesn't \"for a second\" believe it could be coincidence. He couldn't find evidence of Bayoumi helping anyone besides the hijackers. \"He should be here under the court system,\" Gonzalez said of Bayoumi. Gonzalez, now a consultant for the 9/11 families' lawsuit, says he never knew about the Bayoumi video during the 15 years he worked on the case. According to Gonzalez, none of the case agents in San Diego or in New York knew about the Bayoumi Capitol video until last year when it was unsealed in federal court as part of the 9/11 families' lawsuit against Saudi Arabia. \"And we're talking about the Joint Terrorism Task Forces that not only have F.B.I., but we have other state, local, and federal agencies,\" Gonzalez said. \"They did not know either.\" The retired FBI special agent still doesn't know how it's possible that the video wasn't disseminated. \"That angers me,\" he said. \"When I saw that video, I knew exactly what it was.\" Gonzalez said he needed that information to do his job. He believes he could have used the Capitol video to build a case against Bayoumi. Gonzalez said he would have brought it to the United States Attorney's Office. \"It was a terror investigation, but it was also a mass murder,\" Gonzalez said. \"So there were criminal charges along with the terrorism charges.\" Bennett said she believes the Bayoumi video was so significant that it should have gone to the White House after it was first discovered. \"We were briefing the president and the National Security Council. We didn't expect that this [terror attack] was a 'one and done.' We expected al Qaeda to continue to try,\" Bennett said about the period after the attacks. \"Resources were going entirely to trying to undermine any additional plotting.\" She says the new evidence raises a lot of important questions: who else was involved, were there other networks, are any involved individuals still operating in the U.S. or elsewhere, and is there other 9/11 evidence sitting in a box somewhere? That information could help the U.S. learn what went wrong, and learn how not to get it wrong again, she said. The government of Saudi Arabia has filed a motion in federal court to dismiss the 9/11 families' lawsuit, saying neither the kingdom nor Bayoumi had anything to do with the attacks. The judge overseeing the case is expected to rule on the motion soon. An FBI spokesperson said the agency would not comment on ongoing litigation.

    "title": "The Tokyo government steps in to play matchmaker as population falls",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 27, 2025 / 7:46 PM EDT/ CBS News Modern Japan sounds like a sci-fi premise: the incredible shrinking country. Japan may have one of the longest national life expectancies, about 85 years, and the world's largest city, Tokyo. But the nation's population has been in decline for 15 years. Last year, more than two people died for every baby born — a net loss of almost a million people. And now, the island nation is on pace to shrink in halfby this century's end. The diminishing population is Japan's most urgent problem, says Taro Kono, a longtime high-ranking minister in Japan's parliament. Kono, nearly elected prime minister in 2021, said he intends to seek the highest office again and believes the country should prioritize combating the population decline. He says this issue impacts every sector: the economy, education, housing, national defense and the culture of Japan. \"There are less and less number of a young generation,\" Kono said. \"And all the burdens are on the young generation. And they won't be able to sustain. So society is going to be breaking up. Economy is just going to stagnate.\" Last year, Japan's military recruited only halfthe people it needed, Kono said. There's a labor shortage in every industry, including in the government, he added. Japan is the world's fourth largest economy, but it won't be able to sustain if the population keeps declining, Kono said. Japan's falling population is owed, in part, to a spike in the success of women in the workforce. A greater percentage of Japanese women hold jobs than their American counterparts. Japan's famously punishing work culture, coupled with a men-first social culture, makes it extremely difficult to balance career and family. Japanese-American writer Roland Kelts says Japan also has \"an implosion of marriage.\" He told 60 Minutes the days ofomiai,arranged marriage which governed Japanese marriages up through the 1980s, are behind us. \"The corporate guys would marry the office ladies,\" Kelts said. \"And this was all set up. It's gone now. And the office ladies make more money than the corporate guys. So now, you have this shift in economics that has not been reflected in social norms.\" This shift is reflected in Japan's marriage rates: in 2023, fewer than 500,000 Japanese couples married, the lowest number since 1917, according to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan. A growing number of businesses in Japan now cater to single customers. There are ramen restaurants meant for dining in solitude, solo karaoke clubs, and bars only open to those arriving stag. There are also solo weddings, which have all the normal trappings — bride, dress, bouquet, photographer, but no groom. Alternative romance is also in vogue in Japan. Akihiko Kondo, 42, told 60 Minutes he married the anime character Miku in a formal ceremony in 2018. Kondo spoke with 60 Minutes about his love for Miku, and served her green tea while he spoke. Kondo says he's one of thousands of Japanese in monogamous romantic relationships with fictional characters. Almost half of Japan's millennial singles, ages 18-34, self-report as virgins, compared to barely 20% in the U.S. To foster relationships, the Tokyo government has taken action. One such initiative: a dating app. \"We are promoting for matchmaking by artificial intelligence,\" Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike told 60 Minutes. And the number of applications has been three to four times greater than anticipated, according to the governor. Tokyo has also introduced a four-day workweek for government employees, designed to help working mothers and, hopefully, boost birth rates. \"The longer we work, the less children we have,\" Koike said. \"Demography is one of the biggest national issues that we have to tackle.\" While many Japanese leaders agree on the importance of the issue, approaches vary. Hanako Okada, a 44-year-old mother of two who was recently elected to Japan's parliament, said confronting the population problem doesn't require dating apps or shortened workweeks, but a sweeping mindset change. \"The total fertility rate for 2024 was reported to hit an all-time low,\" Okada told 60 Minutes. \"The continuing slide in the birth rate clearly indicates our current policy isn't working at all.\" Ninety-two percent of Japan's population lives in urban areas, a way of living that Okada sees as unsustainable for population growth. She wants people to move out of cities and back to rural towns and villages to build lives and have families. Okada led the charge, moving back to her rural hometown of Aomori, a rapidly aging northern prefecture known for its apple orchards.Per one study,Aomori is one of hundreds of Japanese towns at risk of disappearing by 2050. \"Aomori is my hometown,\" Okada said. \"The precipitous drop in population—and vitality—of this city is deeply troubling not just personally, but from a national perspective. If our regions collapse, it imperils our country's strength. I thought, 'We can't allow this situation to go on.'\" Okada hopes to help create interesting jobs with decent pay in rural areas, so that the young people will come. Her thinking: Once they come, and experience the space, the slower rhythms and the quality of life, they'll be motivated to start families. Okada is hopeful. \"The values of our younger generation are gradually shifting,\" Okada said. \"Tokyo is no longer the be-all, end-all.\" Many communities in Japan are fading. 60 Minutes visited Ichinono, a village located an hour and a half west of Kyoto with a population just shy of 50 people. 60 Minutes met Shinichi Murayama — a longtime Ichinono resident and the town's unofficial puppet master. Murayama oversees the making and scattering of life-like puppets around Ichinono, repopulating a depopulating community. \"Puppets are no substitute for people, of course. But making them cheers us up,\" Murayama said. Murayama has seen the population of Ichinono continue to decrease; he is deeply worried about the future of his village. He remembers when the town was filled with kids. Now, instead, puppets fill the playground. This made the birth of Kuranosuke Kato, the youngest Ichinono resident and first child born in the village in more than 20 years, all the more meaningful. His parents recently exchanged city life for a spacious home in Ichinono. Dad Toshiki does IT work from home, while mom Rie, a midwife, hopes to open a local maternity ward. \"We've got a mountain and a river to explore. We make our own toys and grow our own vegetables. For a kid, there's plenty of ways to have fun here,\" Toshiki Kato said in Japanese. The Katos hope others will follow, and that Kuranosuke will have friends and classmates among all the town's puppets. \"I want Japanese people to become more aware of this lifestyle, which is closer to our traditional way of living, Kato said.

    "title": "How health will be hurt by cuts at the nation's medical research agency",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 27, 2025 / 7:46 PM EDT/ CBS News When President Trump took office in January, he tapped theDepartment of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, to shrink the federal government. TheNational Institutes of Health, the largest funder of biomedical research in the world, has since fired 1,300 employees and cancelled more than $2 billion in federal research grants. Dr. Francis Collins, who led the agency for 12 years under three administrations, says thisaggressive downsizingcould impact the health of Americans for generations to come. \"When you're talking about medical research, when you're talking about people's lives, when you're talking about clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease or cancer that may take three or four years, you can't just go in and decide, 'I'm going to shut those down and maybe I'll try something else.' Those are people's lives at risk,\" Collins said. According to NIH employees, work on child cancer therapies, dementia and stroke have slowed or stopped because critical lab and support staff were let go. The NIH is a massive agency with a $47 billion budget. The agency is made up of 27 institutes and centers and sits on a 300-acre campus in Bethesda, Maryland. As the world's largest funder of biomedical research, the NIH has contributed to massive biomedical breakthroughs. According to Dr. Collins, deaths from heart disease are down by 75% in the last 40 years because of NIH. The agency is also behind lifesaving antiretrovirals that treat HIV and AIDs and treatments for stroke. \"Every dollar that NIH gave out in 2024 to a grant is estimated to have returned $2.46 just in a year. That's a pretty darn good return on investment,\" Collins said. A 2023 Journal of the American Medical Association study found 99% of drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration between 2010 and 2019 had ties to research or work funded by the NIH. More than 80% of the NIH budget goes to universities and research institutes outside the NIH, Collins said. \"They're the ones that do the work, but they get the funds from NIH by writing very compelling grant applications that go through the most rigorous peer review system in the world,\" Collins said. In the weeks after the inauguration, the Trump administration moved quickly to cut federal spending. At the NIH, Dr. Collins said workers were told not to start any new projects and the ability to order supplies was temporarily cut off. \"But then, they put a $1 limit on what you could order. There's not much you can order for $1,\" Collins said. Insiders at the NIH told 60 Minutes that even after a six-week spending freeze at the agency was lifted, some shelves and refrigerators that held supplies for trials and patients remained empty because much of the staff that procured those supplies were fired. Some workers at the agency, including one physician scientist who asked to remain anonymous, fear losing their jobs if they spoke up. \"You can't run an organization as complicated as NIH without a support system. Doctors and nurses and scientists can't function without a lot of other resources,\" the NIH insider said. \"They need an entire support infrastructure. And that has now been decimated.\" Morale at the NIH dropped starting in February, when more than 1,000 probationary employees were placed on leave, the NIH employee said. Immediately after that, workers began trying to assess the damage and determine if they could still care for patients and research participants. \"This didn't come from within NIH, it came from outside, they don't know what these people do,\" the NIH worker said. Some of the fired employees have been brought back. Others are still being paid, but are not allowed to work. Earlier this month, a Trump administration plan to cut the NIH budget by more than 40% — or $20 billion — was leaked to the press. The preliminary budget sent shockwaves through the NIH and the wider scientific community that relies on the NIH to fund research. It is the largest proposed budget cut by an administration to the NIH, but not the first. Most recently, Presidents G.W. Bush and Obama made small cuts to the agency. Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, a former Stanford professor whose research focused on the economics of health care, and who opposed broad lockdowns and mandates during the pandemic, was confirmed as the new director of the NIH late last month. He declined a request from 60 Minutes for an interview, but at his Senate confirmation hearing, outlined his vision for the NIH. \"If confirmed, I will carry out President Trump and Secretary Kennedy's agenda of committing the NIH to address the dire chronic health needs of the country with gold standard science and innovation,\" he said during the hearing. One way the NIH will carry out that agenda, Bhattacharya says, is by creating a new comprehensive database to study chronic disease. The NIH will also, in response to a request by United States Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, invest $50 million to study autism, a topic Kennedy has clashed with scientists on for years. \"Scientific progress on this has been slow because scientists are frankly scared to ask the question,\" Bhattacharya said during a news conference. \"The goal of my leadership, the NIH is going to make it so those questions are no longer taboo among scientists.\" He recently told agency advisers that he is working hard to undo some of the recent \"disruptions\" at the NIH. He called the proposal to cut the agency's budget by more than 40% \"the beginning of a negotiation.\" The leaked budget draft includes plans toconsolidate the institutes and centersinto eight, and eliminate four others. University of Washington doctoral candidate Kristin Weinstein lives in Seattle with her husband and 10-month-old son. She's studied cancer and autoimmunity for the past 10 years and hoped to continue her research in the U.S. after graduation. But now, Weinstein and her family are considering leaving the U.S. \"It's in some ways bleak,\" Weinstein said. \"Nationwide there is a hiring freeze at virtually every major academic university.\" She's not alone; a Naturesurveyof 1,600 scientists found that 75% are considering leaving the U.S. to work internationally. Australia, Europe and China have already boosted recruitment efforts hoping to capitalize on the potential brain drain. Confusion at the NIH has paralyzed many of the 2,500 universities and institutes that rely on the NIH to fund their research. Scientists say projects on HIV and AIDS, trans health and research related to COVID-19 were terminated after researchers were notified that their work \"no longer effectuates agency priorities.\" Last week, the NIH signaled that more cuts could be coming, announcing that any university that has a DEI program or boycotts an Israeli company might not be awarded new NIH grants, and could have existing grants terminated. Beth Humphrey, a 68-year-old grandmother, was diagnosed with Alzheimer's last year. She joined an NIH-funded study run by Duke University and the University of North Carolina. \"It has made me feel a little more empowered against the disease,\" she said. \"It is sort of my way to fight back.\" But now, that study could be in jeopardy. In an effort to cut waste, the Trump administration wants to limit the amount of grant money higher education institutions can use for \"indirect costs\" or overhead, which include items like administrative and facility expenses. Critics say indirect costs are a slush fund for universities. But universities say the funds are crucial, used to pay for facilities like brain banks and the workers who monitor them. Universities warn the proposed cut will cost them billions of dollars, and will have a \"dire impact\" on \"life-saving\" trials and research. Twenty-two states, including North Carolina, are challenging the proposed policy in court. For now, shakeups at NIH are leaving some patients like Humphrey concerned. \"When that hope of a possible treatment is taken away, you're left with nothing but the disease,\" Humphrey said. \"And there really needs to be hope.\" Sharyn Alfonsi is an award-winning correspondent for 60 Minutes. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "title": "Medical research brain drain: Why scientists could flee the U.S.",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 27, 2025 / 7:44 PM EDT/ CBS News For decades, the United States has been the destination for scientific talent from around the globe. Now, with the Trump administration's mass layoffs and cuts to scientific research at the National Institutes of Health, that could be about to change. Earlier this month, a proposal leaked showing the Trump administration's draft plan to slash the National Institutes of Health budget. The NIH is the largest biomedical research agency in the world. The administration's proposal would cut more than 40% from its $47 billion budget and consolidate its 27 institutes and centers into just eight, eliminating four. The plan has shaken up the agency and the broader scientific community, since so much medical research depends on NIH funding. It also appears to have the potential to cause young scientists to look abroad to continue their work. \"We may very well see, as a result of what's happened in these dramatic few months, a reverse brain drain, where we start to lose some of our best and brightest young scientists because they think they will have a better chance in another part of the world,\" said Dr. Francis Collins, who left the NIH in February. \"That would be terribly tragic.\" Collins spent 32 years at the agency, including 12 as its director. During his time at the agency, he helped mentor many young scientists. He told 60 Minutes the upheaval has already impacted researchers who are just starting their careers, both because funding has been cut for necessary lab supplies and because many universities have stopped taking on new graduate students or postdoctoral fellows. \"This is a generation that we might lose of young talent,\" Collins told 60 Minutes correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi. \"They're the ones who are going to make those next breakthroughs for cancer and diabetes and rare diseases, and many of them aren't sure there's a path [in the U.S.] anymore.\" Collins said the U.S. has been the destination for medical research for decades, but other countries — including China — are now starting to catch up. China will take advantage of any loss in American momentum, Collins said. China, along with Australia and Europe, has already boosted its recruitment efforts, hoping to capitalize on the potential \"brain drain\" from America. In France, a new program called \"Safe Place for Science\" within Aix Marseille University has dedicated millions of dollars to entice students from the U.S. And scholars, it seems, are ready to be lured. Three-quarters of American researchers and graduate students who responded toa recent surveyin the weekly scientific journal Nature said they're considering leaving the U.S. to work. But programs abroad aren't immune to changes in the U.S. either. Last month, the Trump administration sent a survey to some international agencies and universities around the world that receive U.S. funding from various federal sources.The questionnaireasked researchers whether their projects complied with U.S. government interests, including ending DEI and climate initiatives. Kristin Weinstein, a PhD candidate at the University of Washington, said she thinks the Trump administration's actions are deliberate. \"Scientists are a group of people who are highly educated and who are good at forming community,\" Weinstein told 60 Minutes. \"And I think that by defunding scientific research and creating brain drain, that helps to consolidate control and power.\" To continue her research on cancer and auto-immunity after graduation, Weinstein and her family are considering moving abroad. So far, she has explored options in Europe and Canada. Weinstein worries America's loss in medical research could lead to other countries' gain — including China. \"I think that even if you don't have scientists that are specifically going towards China, wherever they're going, they're dispersing,\" she said. \"And so, you're losing a pool of talented individuals in the United States, which is currently the global leader of biomedical research.\" According to former NIH director Francis Collins, if the U.S. loses its status as the leader in biomedical research, the consequences will be about more than health — they'll also be about economics. Collins pointed to the Human Genome Project, which he led for most of its 13 years. The project cost the U.S. taxpayers about $3 billion from 1990 to 2003. Collins said the current estimates are that its return on investment is well over $1 trillion. \"If we had another occasion like that right now, a project came along sort of like the Human Genome Project, some really big, bold, a little risky but if it works, would we in the United States in this situation have the courage to take it on?\" Collins speculated. \"Or would somebody else do that?\" Credit: Photos and video courtesy of NIH Clinical Center, Getty Images & AFP.

    "title": "The trends behind the historically low U.S. birth rate",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 27, 2025 / 7:44 PM EDT/ CBS News This week, correspondent Jon Wertheim reported fromJapan, the land of declining sons and daughters. Over the last 15 years, the East Asian country has seen its population decline, amid low birth rates and falling marriage rates. Last year, more than two people died for every baby born in Japan, a net loss of almost a million people. 60 Minutes reported on efforts by the Tokyo government to reverse this: shortened workweeks for government workers and a citywide dating app, both initiatives aiming to encourage people to get married and start families. A young leader was elected to the Japanese Parliament last year; her campaign centered on transforming rural areas—where there have been diminishing economic opportunities—into viable working and living environments for young families. She believes revitalizing the countryside will help ease the population decline. While these efforts are just the latest attempts to address demographic issues, previous attempts by the government have not made a significant impact on the country's fertility rate. Wertheim told 60 Minutes Overtime that, in some ways, Japan is a \"canary in a coal mine.\" \"This is a real barometer of what a number of countries, the United States included, is going to confront in terms of demographics in the next decades and even centuries,\" he said. In fact, like Japan, the United States has seen its birth rate steadily decline over the last 15 years. On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that the total fertility rate was 1.6 children per woman in the United States, or 1,626.5 births per 1,000 women. That is a less than 1% increase from 2023— a year that marked a record low, and well below the total fertility rate of 2.1 needed to naturally maintain the population. 60 Minutes Overtime spoke with Dr. Thoại Ngô, chair of Columbia University's Heilbrunn Department of Population and Family Health. \"The big data story from the CDC data is that women under the age of 30 are having less babies,\" Dr. Ngo explained. \"Teenage pregnancy has been declining and… [there's] a macro-societal shift on how people value family, work, and personal fulfillment moving forward.\" The recent CDC data shows the birth rate of teenagers between 15 and 19 dropped from 13.1 to 12.7, part of a long downward trend that started in the 1990s. 60 Minutes Overtime also spoke with Dr. Karen Benjamin Guzzo, director of the Carolina Population Center at the University of North Carolina. Guzzo said the largest contributing factor to the decline in teenage pregnancies is the increased use of more effective contraception. \"The United States has always had much higher rates of teen and unplanned pregnancies than other countries,\" Dr. Guzzo explained. \"This is a success story… that people are able to avoid having births early on, when they themselves would say, 'This is not the right time for me.'\" But taking overall trends into account, American women between the ages of 20-29 are also having fewer babies, and may be opting out of having children altogether. Dr. Kenneth M. Johnson is senior demographer at the Carsey School of Public Policy at the University of New Hampshire. In an interview, Dr. Johnson said finding out what's happening among this particular age group is the \"big question\" and many factors are at play. He pointed to one trend that could explain part of it: many young women are delaying marriage, and a significant share of that group is delaying having children. And within those marriages, the time taken between marriage and childbirth is now longer than it has historically been. \"In a sense, it's just pushing everything further out,\" he told 60 Minutes Overtime. And despite more women in their late 30s having children, \"it's not making up for fertility declines among younger women,\" he said. \"What's coming to appear is that a lot of these babies are just going to be forgone entirely. They're not going to be born.\" The worrisome scenario for countries who face low birth rates is a small young population and a much larger elderly population. In theory, a smaller young population would not be able to contribute to the workforce, attend schools and universities, pay for goods and services, pay taxes, start businesses and create economic growth at the level that the previous generation did, since there would simply not be enough people to contribute at the same scale. In that scenario, institutions used to larger amounts of young people, like hospitals, schools, and businesses, wouldn't have the number of patients, students and customers needed to maintain growth. And that could create economic decline and unemployment due to reduced demand. Dr. Ken Johnson of the University of New Hampshire described a scenario feared by universities called the \"demographic cliff.\" \"Right now, [the demographic cliff is] a big worry at the university level, because the amount of young people is declining,\" he told Overtime Dr. Johnson explained that babies who were born in 2008, when the birth rate first started to decline, are now 17 years old and matriculating into college. And the gap between how many babies would have been born, based on the birth rates then, and how many were actually born has already started to widen. \"There will be 100,000 fewer kids than there might have been who reach the age of college freshmen next year, and the gap will widen to 500,00 a year in three years and nearly a million a year in ten years,\" Dr. Johnson said. Another concern is Social Security and elder care, which arguably requires a proportionate young population to take care of the elderly population. \"Young people are paying tax into the system so that it can keep the [Social] Security system up and running for the older generation,\" Dr. Thoại Ngô of Columbia University told Overtime. \"But it's also the young people [who] are meant to take care of the older generation.\" The Trump administration is listening to proposals that would encourage more people to have children. Some of these ideas include financial incentives like a \"baby bonus\" for new mothers and an expanded child tax credit that would reduce the tax burden on new families. But Dr. Ngô thinks cash incentives are unlikely to have a significant impact on the U.S. fertility rate. \"I think the global evidence is very clear: we can't buy fertility,\" he told 60 Minutes Overtime. \"Japan [has] invested so much in the last 40 years, and their fertility [rate] is still at 1.2…South Korea [has] invested $200 billion into boosting up fertility, and it hasn't worked. Their total fertility rate is at 0.7.\" The University of North Carolina's Dr. Karen Benjamin Guzzo explained that the state of the economy and a hopefulness about the future are stronger influences on would-be parents. \"People really need to feel confident about the future… having kids is sort of an irreversible decision and it's a long-term one,'\" she explained. She said the Trump administration should take a closer look at solving the difficulties and expense of child care. \"We have child care deserts in the United States where you cannot find affordable, accessible childcare in a reasonable distance,\" she said. \"[If] you're in major cities… you're talking like $1,400 a month in child care and there's a nine month waiting list. \"We don't have sufficient child care infrastructure. That's where we should be building.\" The Trump administration has also issued an executive order that aims to make IVF treatments more accessible for those who can't afford them. Dr. Thoại Ngô is optimistic that affordable IVF treatment would have an impact and allow couples who want children to do so more easily. \"Lowering the cost of IVF is great for a couple who wants to have babies. And I think we have to do it in a fair way… all couples who want [a] baby should have access to that.\" Fertility rates and birth rates are helpful indicators to understand where a population may be heading, but these statistics only focus on births. Population change is also influenced by mortality, immigration, technological advancements and many other social, economic, and technological factors. \"Not everybody is going to like it, but… immigration, technology, and education can all help keep the economy dynamic,\" Columbia University's Dr.Thoại Ngô told Overtime. \"The rise of AI [will] replace a lot of mundane and repetitive jobs… it opens [the] door for investment in training, and education in quality jobs, in enjoyable jobs.\" UNC's Dr. Karen Benjamin Guzzo believes that immigration could make up for future shortfalls in labor. \"Our health care industry actually uses quite a bit of immigrant labor… they're often willing to work in places that are rural, where it's harder to get [Americans] to live.\" Dr. Ngô said a reallocation of resources, a supportive set of policies and programs, like paid family leave and better child care, and a strong economy could allow all parents to have a child more easily, without worrying about the financial stress. \"Better health care, economic stability, and a more thriving set of [policies could] allow people to have a freedom of choice in terms of what kind of life they want for themself.\" The video above was produced by Will Croxton.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 27, 2025 / 7:04 PM EDT/ CBS/AFP Two 18th-century shipwrecks off the coast of Costa Rica, previously thought to have been pirate ships, have been confirmed to be twoDanishslave ships, a museum said Sunday. \"Investigations of ship timbers, bricks from the cargo and clay pipes found during underwater excavations\" had determined the identity of two vessels shipwrecked in 1710,Denmark's National Museumsaid in a statement. Marine archaeologists identified the slave ships Fridericus Quartus and Christianus Quintus, which, according to historical sources, were wrecked off the coast of Central America in 1710, said the museum. The museum also released images of Andreas Kallmeyer Bloch and David Gregory digging underwater and excavating bricks and wood from the wreckage. Fridericus Quartus was set on fire, while Christianus Quintus was wrecked in the surf after its anchor line was cut. Until now, it has not been clear exactly where the ships were lost. The museum added that in Costa Rica, it had long been known that two wrecks were located in the waters of the Cahuita National Park. \"For many years, however, they were thought to be pirate ships. But when American marine archaeologists in 2015 found yellow bricks in one of the wrecks, new questions emerged about the history of the ships,\" the museum said. An underwater excavation was carried out in 2023. It was part of the National Museum's new research center,Njord, which the museum said is planning to excavate several Danish shipwrecks abroad. \"The analyses are very convincing and we no longer have any doubts that these are the wrecks of the two Danish slave ships,\" Gregory, a research professor at Denmark's National Museum, said in the statement. \"The bricks are Danish and the same goes for the timbers, which are additionally charred and sooty from a fire. This fits perfectly with the historical accounts stating that one of the ships burned,\" Gregory added. Fellow marine archaeologist Bloch,who's also a museum curator,called it \"undoubtedly the craziest archaeological excavation I've yet been part of.\" \"Not only because it matters greatly to the local population, but also because it's one of the most dramatic shipwrecks in the history of Denmark, and now we know exactly where it happened,\" the marine archaeologist said. The Danish government banned the transatlantic slave trade in 1792, but the country didn't abolish slavery until half a century later, in 1847, according to the museum. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "article_text": "The split between men and women is one of the starkest divisions in American politics right now — and that divide is deepest in Gen Z, which is taking the traditional gender gap in American politics and stretching it even further. While 45% of men ages 18-29 approve of President Donald Trump’s job performance, only 24% of young women do — a 21-point difference,according to a new NBC News Stay Tuned Poll, powered by SurveyMonkey. There’s a similar, extra-wide gap between Gen Z men and women on on Trump’s handling of immigration, as well as on billionaire White House adviser Elon Musk. Overall,Americans are delivering a negative verdicton the president’s performance as he nears the 100-day mark of his second term. A majority of American adults — 55% — disapprove of the way Trump is handling his job, while 45% approve. The tariffs at the center of Trump’s economic agenda earned his lowest issue ratings, with 39% approving of his handling of the issue and 61% disapproving. On immigration, a strength of his throughout the 2024 campaign and still his best issue among those polled, adults were split, with 49% approving of his handling of border security and immigration and 51% disapproving. FollowTrump’s approval rating in NBC News pollsand see how it compares to past presidents. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told “Meet the Press” that “yes, of course” all people in the U.S., both citizens and noncitizens, areentitled to due process. His comments come as the Trump administration presses courts to allow the immediate deportations of some immigrants under the Alien Enemies Act without giving them a chance to plead their case before a judge. Rubio defended the Trump administration’s deportation efforts, which have included deporting three children who are U.S. citizens — ages 2, 4 and 7 — alongside their mothers,according to The Washington Post. “If those children are U.S. citizens, they can come back into the United States if there’s their father or someone here who wants to assume them. But ultimately, who was deported was their mother, their mothers who were here illegally. The children just went with their mothers,” Rubio told moderator Kristen Welker. Meanwhile, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.,responded to criticismfrom a fellow Democratic caucus member for using the term “oligarchy” to describe allies of the Trump administration, saying the “American people are not quite as dumb” as to not understand the term. Asimple tomb bearing no adornmentand inscribed only with the Latin name “Franciscus” opened to the public on Sunday, one day after Pope Francis’ funeral. There were lengthy queues at Rome’s St. Mary Major Basilica, where his tomb lies, the first time a pope had been laid to rest outside the Vatican in more than a century. His casket was received there on Saturday, in accordance with his wishes, by dozens of Rome’s impoverished and needy, including prisoners, migrants, homeless and transgender people. Francis chose his place of burial because it reflects his “humble, simple and essential” life, the archbishop who administers the basilica said. Even in death, the pomp-shunning pontiff’smoral voice rang outat his funeral, as the large crowds and world leaders in attendance, including Trump, were reminded of Francis’ central messages. “‘Build bridges, not walls’ was an exhortation he repeated many times,” Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re said during the homily. “His gestures and exhortations in favor of refugees and displaced persons are countless. His insistence on working on behalf of the poor was constant.” With its 5-1 win against Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday,Liverpool bulldozed its way to a record-tying 20 English league titles.

    "article_text": "The 21-year-old son of the Atlanta Falcons’ defensive coordinator prank-calledNFL hopeful Shedeur Sandersto say he had been drafted during his stunning fall from a top prospect to a fifth-round selection. Jax Ulbrich, whose father, Jeff Ulbrich, works for the Falcons, called Sanders on Friday night claiming to be New Orleans Saints General Manager Mickey Loomis and telling him he’d been drafted. The younger Ulbrich saw Sanders’ contact info in his dad’s iPad and wrote it down, intending to deceive the Colorado University quarterback, the Falcons said in a statement Sunday. Jeff Ulbrich did not know about his son’s plan, the team said. “The Atlanta Falcons do not condone this behavior and send our sincere apologies to Shedeur Sanders and his family, who we have been in contact with to apologize to, as well as facilitate an apology directly from Jax to the Sanders family,” the Falcons’ statement said. Jax Ulbrich issued a statement and apologized publicly to Sanders, calling the act “completely inexcusable, embarrassing, and shameful.” “I’m so sorry I took away from your moment, it was selfish and childish,” Ulbrich said. The NFL had previously said it was looking into the incident,NBC Sports reported. Sanders had been one of the most notable prospects heading into the NFL draft, and some suggested he could go as early as No. 3 to the New York Giants. Other teams inthe first round,including the Saints, had been rumored to be potential landing spots, but ultimately Sanders slid to the third day as the144th overall pick,to the Cleveland Browns. Sanders’ drop even drew the attention of President Donald Trump, who said Friday that all of the teams were “stupid” for bypassing Sanders in the first round.",

    "article_text": "ELIZABETH CITY, N.C. — A shooting at a small college in eastern North Carolina left one person dead and six others wounded and prompted a campus lockdown early Sunday, the university said. The shooting occurred in the center of Elizabeth City State University’s campus following Yard Fest, the final event of the historically Black university’s weeklong Viking Fest celebration, the school said in a statement. A 24-year-old man who was not a student was pronounced dead. His identity wasn’t immediately released pending notification of his family, the statement said. Four people sustained gunshot wounds, including three students, while two other students were injured during the commotion. None of the injuries were considered life-threatening. All the injured were taken to a hospital for treatment, the statement says. A call to campus police was referred to a university spokesperson, who didn’t immediately return a telephone message. “The university is deeply saddened by this senseless act,” the university said in an earlier statement. The lockdown was later lifted, and the university increased patrols across campus as a precaution. Access to the center of campus remained restricted later Sunday. The university has 2,300 students and is about 50 miles south of Norfolk, Virginia.",

    "title": "Foul should have gone against Knicks toward end of playoff win vs. Pistons, NBA says",
    "article_text": "Detroit’s Tim Hardaway Jr. said he got fouled on the game’s final play. The NBA agreed with him. It didn’t matter. Referees missedHardaway getting fouledwhile shooting a 3-pointer on the final play ofDetroit’s 94-93 loss to the Knicksin Game 4 of their Eastern Conference first-round series on Sunday. The NBA acknowledged the mistake shortly after the game, saying a foul should have been called on the Knicks’ Josh Hart. Had the foul been called, Hardaway would have been awarded three free throws with about 0.3 seconds left. Instead, the game ended on that play and Detroit left fuming. “You guys saw it,” Hardaway said after the game, speaking to reporters. “Blatant.” The Knicks took a 3-1 lead in the series, with Game 5 in New York on Tuesday. “During live play, it was judged that Josh Hart made a legal defensive play,” crew chief David Guthrie told a pool reporter after the game. “After postgame review, we observed that Hart makes body contact that is more than marginal to Hardaway Jr. and a foul should have been called.” Hart didn’t dispute that he made contact with Hardaway. “Did I make contact with him? Yeah, I made contact with him,” Hart said. “Was it legal? I don’t know. We’ll let the two-minute report say that.” The NBA puts out a review of all calls in the final two minutes of games decided by three points or fewer, with those reports released the day after the game. But in this case, with a pool report requested, the NBA had Guthrie speak to a reporter and explain what happened. Detroit argued to no avail after time expired. Pistons coach J.B. Bickerstaff was clearly angered and approached the officiating crew on the floor shortly after the final shot, but he had no mechanism to challenge the call. One, the Pistons had used their challenge earlier in the game and two, even if Bickerstaff still had the challenge, it wouldn’t have mattered — technically, no call was made, so he couldn’t have challenged anyway. “There’s contact on Tim Hardaway’s jump shot,” Bickerstaff said. “I don’t know any other way around it. There’s contact on his jump shot. The guy leaves his feet, he’s at Timmy’s mercy. I repeat, there’s contact on his jump shot.” The Pistons had the ball with 11.1 seconds left, down by one.Cade Cunningham missed a jump shot with 7.4 seconds remainingand, after a scramble, the ball ended up in Hardaway’s hands in the left corner. Hardaway ball-faked to get Hart into the air, and Hart clearly made contact with the right side of Hardaway’s body as he was in the act of shooting. Knicks star Karl-Anthony Towns was asked for his view of the play after the game. “What do you want me to say? View of what?” Towns said, smiling. “Going back to Madison Square Garden. Happy we got a win. You like that answer? Is that good?”",

    "title": "2 U.S. citizen children taken to Honduras on mom's deportation flight, legal advocates say",
    "article_text": "Two U.S. citizen children were sent on their mother’s deportation flight to Honduras without the opportunity to speak with attorneys, leaving a 4-year-old boy with Stage 4 cancer without access to his medication, according to the National Immigration Project. Gracie Willis, an attorney with the organization, told NBC News that the boy and and his 7-year-old sister were detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Thursday. They were taken to El Paso, Texas, and flown to Honduras first thing Friday morning, Willis said. The 4-year-old boy, who was actively receiving treatment for a rare form of cancer, was flown to Honduras without his medication, according to Willis and the National Immigration Project. Attorneys were preparinga habeas corpus petition when the children were taken out of the U.S. on an ICE charter flight before the petition could be filed, Willis said. Attorney Erin Hebert, who Willis said is representing the family, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. In a press release by the National Immigration Project, Hebert called the removal of U.S. children “illegal, unconstitutional, and immoral.” “The speed, brutality, and clandestine manner in which these children were deported is beyond unconscionable, and every official responsible for it should be held accountable,” Hebert said. Willis is representing a similar case involving themother of a 2-year-old U.S. citizen who was deportedwith her child on Friday. U.S. District Judge Terry Doughty ordered a hearing in the case, saying it appeared that the government removed a U.S. citizen with “no meaningful due process.” These incidents are the latest in a string of cases that have raised alarm among immigration advocates. Recent headlines have highlighted U.S. citizens being mistakenly detained by ICE and, in some instances, receiving official paperwork incorrectly telling themto leave the country. Other cases have underscored fears of procedural errors, including those of Mahmoud Khalil, a U.S. permanent residentwho was detained by federal agents without a warrant, and Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was sent to El Salvadordespite a court order barring his removal. In the cases of the young children, both families had fathers residing in the U.S. and were unable to make decisions about their children before they were flown to Honduras, Willis added. The National Immigration Project said the women were in incommunicado detention by ICE, making them unreachable by lawyers or family members. Legal teams that were able to reach the mothers after their deportations said the women both expressed being given no choice and that they were told their children would come with them, according to Willis. “Their families are having to make hard choices. ... Those are decisions they should have been able to communicate with each other about before all of this happened,” Willis said. The National Immigration Project has accused ICE of violating its own mandates on the “coordination for the care of minor children with willing caretakers — regardless of immigration status — when deportations are being carried out.” Both families are taking time to process what has happened, Willis said. The children are U.S. citizens who should be able to return, but their mothers were deported before they were able to pursue their legal options. Representatives for ICE did not immediately respond to a NBC News request for comment. In the case of the 2-year-old, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the parent made the decision to take the child with them to Honduras. Secretary of State Marco Rubio acknowledged the children’s citizenship statuson Sunday in an interview with MSNBC’s “Meet the Press,” saying that while everyone on U.S. soil is entitled to due process, individuals in the country illegally “have no right to be here.” He also described the headlines regarding the children as “misleading,” stating that parents have the choice to decide whether their children are removed with them. “Three U.S. citizens — ages 4, 7 and 2 — were not deported. Their mothers, who are illegally in this country, were deported,” Rubio said. “The children went with their mothers. Those children are U.S. citizens. They can come back into the United States ... but ultimately, who was deported was their mother, their mothers who were here illegally.” Willis accused the government of “purposefully manipulating facts,” calling it an “absurdity” that ICE was the sole conduit for expressing the mothers’ wishes. “The public has a right to know about what happened with these children, and we want to make sure this never happens again,” Willis said. “How do we make sure this never happens again when you have Secretary of State Marco Rubio repeating the party line that the mothers wanted this? It’s a lie. It’s untrue.”",

    "title": "A toothy little monster called Labubu is the latest fashion craze",
    "article_text": "It’s small, toothy and often described as slightly creepy. But this plush doll, called Labubu, has quickly become an unlikely status symbol. In recent weeks, social media has been filled with videos of collectors trading tips on how to get their hands on a Labubu, the fluffy doll with pointed ears and a mischievous grin. Though thelatest Labubu collection, which dropped on Friday and sold out in seconds, retails at $27.99 for one blind box or $167.94 for a set of six, resellers have already put them up on sites like eBay for more than double those prices. Labubu dolls are made and sold by Pop Mart, a Chinese retailer known for its “blind box” collectibles, which makes it so that buyers don’t know which color or design they’re getting until they open the box. Online restocks have earned a cutthroat reputation for selling out immediately, and buyers around the world have been known to camp out in front of Pop Mart stores for hours. From Beanie Babies to Squishmallows to the naked Sonny Angel figurines that exploded in popularity last year, collectibles have frequently fueled one consumer fad after another. As limited supply drives up their rarity, many fans seek the thrill of hunting down certain coveted versions, like thespecial-edition “secret” Labubu, which can only be found by winning the blind box lottery. Thania Gonzalez, 31, said she has collected nearly every color of Labubu from every collection. But since the dolls began blowing up online late last year, the Los Angeles-based fashion content creator said purchasing them from Pop Mart has become virtually “impossible.” Nowadays, she gets her Labubus from a reseller she calls her “Labubu plug.” “I like to put them on my bags and dress them like me. I will wear multiple Labubus,” Gonzalez said. “I’m putting them on my belt. If I could put them as earrings I would, but that would hurt. I’m putting them wherever they can be put.” The craze has even spawned a market for fan-made outfits that can be used to dress up Labubu dolls. Gonzalez said she used to get hers from Chinese e-commerce platform AliExpress before finding local pop-up shops that specialize in those accessories. “I think as adults, we have a lot of responsibilities, things to take care of, bills, people. People get a little bit in a rut,” she said. “And I think Labubus bring people back to their childhood. It’s like dressing them, how cute they are, just looking at them. It’s like a little plush you can make look like you. I think it heals people’s inner child.” Created in 2015 by Kasing Lung, a Hong Kong–born artist based in Belgium, Labubu is one of “The Monsters,” a group of characters inspired by Nordic mythology in Lung’s children’s book series. Labubu, according to Pop Mart’s description, is “kind-hearted and always wants to help, but often accidentally achieves the opposite.” Pop Mart and Lung did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The dolls, which have become a symbol of exclusivity in themselves, are now oftenpaired with luxury bagsin a trend that seemingly contrasts luxury fashion with a less traditionally high-end — but still status-signaling — collectible. They’ve also been boosted by celebrities like Rihanna and Blackpink’s Lisa, who have been spotted sporting Labubu charms on their handbags. Lisa, who sometimes shares her Labubus on her Instagram stories,told Vanity Fairlast year that shopping for Pop Mart collectibles has become her “secret obsession.” “Labubu is my baby,” she toldTeen Voguelast month. From Asia to North America, collection launch days at Pop Mart stores often draw crowds of customers anxious to snag their own Labubu. At the Michigan Avenue Pop Mart in Chicago, a line of people stretched down the block on Friday morning — many having brought foldable chairs and blankets — as they waited for the store to open. “I got here early, just so I could get a Labubu,” August Olvera, who was in line as early as 1:30 a.m.,told NBC Chicago. “My boss called them hideous. But I think they’re adorable.” The frenzy has also bled into chaos. At the Pop Mart in Los Angeles’ Westfield Century City mall on Friday,videos onlineappear to show hundreds of people rushing toward the store before dawn, drawing a police presence. Posts from attendees reported that the event was later canceled. NBC News has reached out to Westfield Century City for comment. On communities like the r/labubu subreddit, hopeful collectorscirculate tipson how to improve their chances of catching an online restock before all the Labubu dolls sell out. Others online havewarned against leaving Labubus unattended, claiming that people havebroken into carsto steal them. And the craze is giving rise to dupes, or replicas, of the popular collectible toys. It’s led some Labubu enthusiasts to try andcounsel others on how to spotthe fakes, which have become so notorious that they’ve been dubbed “lafufus.”",

    "article_text": "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., hosted hundreds of supporters at the Capitol on Sunday, sitting on the steps in protest of Republicans’ upcoming push to pass a budget reconciliation billthey hope will cut $1.5 trillionin federal spending. “That bill, we believe, presents one of the greatest moral threats to our country that we’ve seen in terms of what it will do to providing food for the hungry, care for the elderly, services for the disabled, health care, health care for the sick and more,” Booker said at the beginning of the sit-in. Democrats have for monthswarnedthat House Republicans’ budget blueprint would lead to over $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid, a federal program that provides health insurance for low-income families. Booker and Jeffries spoke at the beginning of the sit-in, which began around 6 a.m., about their religious upbringings, saying they would usually be attending services on Sunday morning but instead were hosting the conversation on the Capitol steps. “Martin Luther King said, ‘Budgets are moral documents,’ and that’s the spirit we come here with this morning,” Booker said before he urged supporters to join the two men online or in person. The New Jersey senator called on supporters to “give your own testimony to your moral urgency that you feel, to maybe your faith traditions or moral traditions that ... motivate you at this moment to speak out, maybe share your story of what the threat of this bill does to you and your lives.” Early in the day, Jeffries also pointed out that they were hosting the sit-in on Booker’s birthday. After wishing the senator a happy birthday, the minority leader told him, “I’m sure you didn’t expect last year, when thinking about this birthday, that I would be your birthday date in this location, but this of course is the moment that we find ourselves in.” Jeffries also brought a message for House Republicans, saying, “Enough. This is not America. We will continue to show up, speak up and stand up until we end this national nightmare.” Ahead of Monday, when congressional lawmakers will return from a two-week recess, Jeffries said Democrats were preparing to face “an existential struggle to defeat Republican efforts to try to jam a very reckless budget down the throats of the American people.” Dozens joined Jeffries and Booker on the Capitol steps, where they sat in the sunshine for over nine hours speaking about their faith traditions and the upcoming budget fight. Some were rank-and-file supporters of congressional Democrats, while others were higher-profile progressive leaders, like Maya Wiley, the president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. “The [budget] cuts, when we’re talking about cuts, people bleed and we should put names behind them,” Wiley told the crowd. “You know, Sarah in South Dakota had a son who has seizures one to five times a day, had to quit her job to try to save her son. It is Medicaid that helps pay for her health care to do that. Or Jasmine in Alabama, in Tuscaloosa, with two kids, who was taking care of other people’s children when she fell and became disabled, and it’s Medicaid that was taking care of her.” Several faith leaders and fellow Democratic lawmakers,like Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.,Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, D-Md., and Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., also spoke over the course of the sit-in, which was still ongoing Sunday afternoon. Booker is no stranger to speaking for hours in opposition to Republicans and the Trump administration. Earlier this month, he stood on the Senate floor andspoke for over 25 hoursagainst the Trump administration, breaking the record for the longest speech in Senate history.",

    "article_text": "At least one person has died in southwest Oklahoma after flash flooding hit the region, with authorities warning people to stay off the roads as severe weather warnings continue. “Emergency responders reported witnessing a vehicle drive into standing water earlier today,” the Lawton Police Departmentsaid in a statement Saturday. “Responders were not able to safely get to the submerged vehicle.” The investigation into the death is ongoing, officials said Saturday. The dive team assisted in recovery of the victim and the family has been notified, authorities said. The identity of the victim has not been released. Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt thanked first responders on Saturday. “Thank you to our wonderful first responders who’ve been executing water rescues all day due to flooding from heavy rain,” he wrote in apost on X. “Oklahomans, be extra careful when driving and don’t try to drive through flooded roads. Stay weather aware!” Lawton city officialssaid water began to recede in some areas on Sunday afternoon. Further south, in Walters, Oklahoma, Cotton County Emergency Management issued a public notice urging all residents to evacuate flood zone areas. Floodwaters are expected to rise through midafternoon Sunday, authorities said. Emergency management is working to secure more sand and sandbags for residents. Across the Southwest and the Rockies, extremely critical fire weather conditions continue Sunday afternoon due to 60 mph wind gusts, single-digit relative humidity and dry vegetation. Around 7 million people will be under alert throughout Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico and West Texas. Additional severe weather risks span from Montana to Texas, with storms capable of producing winds up to 70 mph, large hail and potentially tornadoes overnight Sunday.

    "title": "As Real ID deadline for U.S. air travel approaches, there are 'workarounds,' experts say",
    "article_text": "The deadline for U.S. travelers to get a Real ID isfast approaching— and those who don’t have one may not be able to board flights within the U.S. TheReal IDcard is an optional, upgraded driver’s license or state identification card that is issued by a state driver’s licensing agency and marked with a star. The good news: There are other forms of identification U.S. travelers can use — such as a valid U.S. passport, passport card, permanent resident card, or certain Department of Homeland Security trusted traveler cards — if they can’t get a Real ID by the deadline, May 7. “There are workarounds people can use,” said John Breyault, a travel expert at the National Consumers League, a consumer advocacy group. “Most people already have the ability to travel, whether they have a Real ID or not.” About 19% of travelers don’t yet have a Real ID-compliant type of identification, according toTransportation Security Administration dataas of Thursday. Passengers who arrive at the airport without an acceptable form of ID “can expect to face delays, additional screening and the possibility of not being permitted into the security checkpoint,”according to the TSA. Even passengers who have a Real ID card or other acceptable ID should aim to be at the airport at least 1½ hours ahead of their flight, due to likely delays in airport security lines as enforcement gets underway, Breyault said. Congress passed theReal ID Actin 2005. The law set minimum security standards for state-issued driver’s licenses and ID cards. The federal government will require Americans who access federal facilities to have a Real ID starting May 7. That includes travelers who go through TSA airport security checkpoints and board commercial airplanes, even for domestic flights. The rule applies to all airline passengers 18 years and older, including TSA PreCheck members. Travelers can skirt the requirement to present a Real ID card if they have other types of approved identification. Experts said the most common among them are: a passport or passport card; a Global Entry card; an enhanced driver’s license issued by Washington state, Michigan, Minnesota, New York or Vermont; or a permanent resident card, also known as a green card. Here’s a list ofall acceptable alternatives, according to the TSA: State-issued enhanced driver’s license U.S. passport U.S. passport card Department of Homeland Security-issued trusted traveler cards (Global Entry, NEXUS, SENTRI, FAST) U.S. Department of Defense ID, including IDs issued to dependents Permanent resident card Border crossing card An acceptable photo ID issued by a federally recognized Tribal Nation/Indian Tribe, including Enhanced Tribal Cards (ETCs). HSPD-12 PIV card Foreign government-issued passport Canadian provincial driver’s license or Indian and Northern Affairs Canada card Transportation worker identification credential U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Employment Authorization Card (I-766) U.S. Merchant Mariner Credential Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) It may be somewhat riskier to travel with an alternative document such as a passport for domestic flights, said Sally French, a travel expert at NerdWallet. “A passport is much more complicated to replace than a driver’s license, and it’s more expensive,” French said. “Get that Real ID.” A traditional passport bookcosts $130 to renew. Real ID fees vary by state but are generally less costly, experts said. They typically aren’t more expensive than a standard driver’s license. For example, in California itcosts$45 to renew a standard driver’s license or $39 to renew a regular ID card; in Virginia, there’s a $10one-time Real ID fee, plus a driver’s license fee, usually $32. Desperate travelers can also gamble by showing up at the airport without a Real ID-compliant form of identification on May 7 and beyond, and hope airport agents show some mercy, French said. It’s a “much longer screening” process and isn’t guaranteed, French said. It’s a “Hail Mary,” she said.",

    "title": "'Sinners' bites off a phenomenal 2nd weekend as a 20-year-old 'Star Wars' movie takes 2nd place",
    "article_text": "Horror movies are often one-week wonders at the box office, butRyan Coogler’s“Sinners”is defying the odds and proving to be true event cinema. In its second weekend in theaters, “Sinners” earned $45 million in ticket sales from theaters in the U.S. and Canada, according to studio estimates Sunday. That’s down a minuscule 6% from itsEaster holiday launch, the smallest drop in any genre since “Avatar” in 2009. Worldwide, “Sinners” has now made $161.6 million. For the industry, the showing proves the film’s reach has broadened beyond horror fans to mainstream audiences wanting to see what the hype is about. Last weekend, men made up 56% of the audience. This weekend, the gender divide narrowed to 50/50. Premium large format showings, like the 70mm IMAX screens, are also a big draw. IMAX screens worldwide accounted for some 21% of the second weekend globally, a nearly 9% increase from last weekend. The original ensemble movie, starring Michael B. Jordan as twins, rode into theaters on a wave of great reviews. And, to be fair, “Sinners” isn’t simply a horror film: It blends elements of drama, action and musical into its southern gothic milieu. “That’s one of the lowest second weekend holds for an overperforming wide release ever,” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. “It’s an absolute phenomenon.” Hollywood expects significant drop off in a movie’s second week of release. Even a 50% dip is considered a solid number, baked into the movie math. When it’s anything less than that, it’s notable. “You can buy a great opening weekend with marketing, but if a movie doesn’t have the goods, it’ll drop off,” Dergarabedian said. “There’s no greater barometer of success than a second weekend hold like this.” The film was produced by Coogler’s Proximity Media and Warner Bros., which handled the theatrical release. After some disappointments earlier in the year, it’s the second major win for the studio after“A Minecraft Movie”helped energize the box office earlier this month. “Sinners” easily topped the biggest new competition this week:“The Accountant 2,”a sequel starring Ben Affleck and released by Amazon MGM Studios, which opened in third place with an estimated $24.5 million in its first weekend. Gavin O’Connor directed the film, which played in 3,610 theaters in North America. Audiences gave it a promising A- CinemaScore. The film that beat “The Accountant 2” for second place was a 20-year-old Star Wars movie: “Revenge of the Sith.” The anniversary re-release took in an estimated $25.2 million over the weekend, with many sellouts reported, more than doubling last year’s release of “The Phantom Menace.” Internationally, it earned $17 million from 34 territories, giving it a $42.2 million global weekend. It’s one of the top grossing re-releases ever. “A Minecraft Movie” landed in fourth place with $22.7 million, bringing its domestic total to around $380 million. The scary video game adaptation “Until Dawn” also opened this weekend to an estimated $8 million, rounding out the top five. Sony Pictures released the film, starring Ella Rubin and Michael Cimino, which has earned $18.1 million globally. The “Minecraft” and “Sinners” wins have meant a huge boost for the April box office, which is up 102% from April 2024. The annual box office is also up over 10% from last year after running at a double-digit deficit in March. And this is all happening right before the industry’s summer movie season kicks off on May 2 with Disney’s “Thunderbolts(asterisk).” “There cannot be a better opening act for the summer movie season than this weekend,” Dergarabedian said. With final domestic figures due Monday, the following list factors in estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore: 1. “Sinners,” $45 million. 2. “Revenge of the Sith,” $25.2 million. 3. “The Accountant 2,” $24.5 million. 4. “A Minecraft Movie,” $22.7 million. 5. “Until Dawn,” $8 million. 6. “The King of Kings,” $4 million. 7. “The Amateur,” $3.8 million. 8. “Warfare,” $2.7 million. 9. “Pink Floyd at Pompeii -- MCMLXXII,” $2.6 million. 10. “The Legend of Ochi,” $1.4 million.",

    "title": "Sen. Bernie Sanders defends 'Fighting Oligarchy' tour from Democratic criticism, says Americans aren't 'dumb'",
    "article_text": "Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., on Sunday responded to criticism from a fellow Democratic caucus member for using the term “oligarchy” to describe allies of the Trump administration, saying the “American people are not quite as dumb” as to not understand the term. Sanders’ remarks come days after Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., a first-term senator who won a competitive Senate race in Michigan the same year that President Donald Trump won the presidential election there,told Politicothat she thinks her party should stop using the term “oligarchy.” Slotkin added that the term doesn’t resonate beyond coastal institutions. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walzalso recently criticizedsome Democrats for using terms like \"oligarch\" and \"food insecurity\" instead of \"hungry\" and \"greedy billionaires.\" Neither Slotkin nor Walzmentioned Sanders in their remarks, but their comments come as Sanders and fellow progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., have been traveling across the country and speaking before crowds of tens of thousands as part of their “Fighting Oligarchy” tour. On Sunday, Sanders referred to those crowds, telling NBC News’ “Meet the Press,” “Well, Jesus, we had 36,000 people out in Los Angeles, 34,000 people in Colorado. We had 30,000 people in Folsom, California, which is kind of a rural area.” “I think the American people are not quite as dumb as Ms. Slotkin thinks they are,” Sanders added. A spokesperson for Slotkin declined to comment on Sanders’ remarks. The Vermont senator went on to explain the core message of the “Fighting Oligarchy,” rallies, telling moderator Kristen Welker, “When the top 1% owns more wealth than the bottom 90%, when big-money interests are able to control both political parties, [Americans] are living in an oligarchy.” The spat between Slotkin and Sanders comes as Democrats are still trying to assess how to move forward in a second Trump administration, months after they faced a devastating loss in the presidential election and in multiple Senate races. Many Democrats in recent weeks have agreed that the party must focus on the future and what their post-Trump vision for America could look likebut can’t agree on what that visionshould look like. It’s a point that Sanders made on Sunday, telling Welker, “We’re on the same page, but what Democrats lack right now is a vision for the future.” Sanders has long been the standard bearer for progressive Democrats, ever since he launched his long-shot bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016. But Slotkin is a new rising star. In 2018, she flipped a competitive Michigan House seat in favor of the Democrats. And months after defending an open Senate seat in her home state for the Democratic Party, she was selected by party leaders to givethe official Democratic response to Trump’s joint addressto Congress earlier this year.",

    "title": "Homes destroyed and 1,500 detained in Kashmir as India cracks down following attacks",
    "article_text": "By Bilal Kuchay , Omkar Khandekar People stand near the razed house of Kashmiri militant Ahsan Ul Haq Sheikh's family house in Murran area of Pulwama district on April 26, 2025.Bilal Kuchay/NPRhide caption PULWAMA, India — Indian authorities have detained at least 1,500 people in India-administered Kashmir after a militant attack killed 26 people last week, a top police officer told NPR. Several homes linked to alleged militants were also destroyed. India accused Pakistan of having a connection to the attack — the worst aimed at Indian civilians in more than a decade — claiming that the group that claimed responsibility was backed by the Pakistani military. That ratcheted up tensions between the two nuclear-armed countries, who both control parts of Kashmir, but claim ownership over the whole region. A statement from the Pakistani prime minister expressed concern over the loss of lives of tourists, and denied any responsibility for the deadly rampage in an alpine meadow on Tuesday — in which gunmen appeared to target Hindu men, before fleeing into the forested mountains before security forces could arrive. Days after the attack, Pakistani prime minister Shehbaz Sharifsaidthey were open to a \"neutral, transparent probe\" into what happened. Over the past week, India has suspended visas for Pakistani visitors, expelled some of its diplomats, and halted a decades-old treaty that divides six rivers between the two countries. Pakistan announced tit-for-tat measures. It also suspended cross-border trade and closed off Pakistani airspace for Indian aircraft.

Homes belonging to five suspected perpetrators were destroyed, said VK Birdi, a senior Indian police official in the region. He did not say who carried out the demolitions, and other Indian authorities did not respond to NPR requests for comment. Ruhallah Mehdi, a member of Parliament from Kashmir's ruling National Conference party, said he had received several messages from residents in the villages where the houses were blown up. \"They are sure that these acts were carried out by security forces. It's easy to understand too — who else would be able to go and blow up houses like that?\" Family members of one suspected militant told NPR that security forces rigged their house with explosives that they detonated, bringing down their home early Saturday. The police crackdown started on Thursday night, two days after the attack, when NPR confirmed that the homes of three suspected militants were destroyed — along with the home of the only man that Indian authorities have named as being suspected in involvement in the attack, Adil Thokar. When NPR visited Thokar's house in Anantnag district on Saturday, the two-story home house was mostly reduced to rubble. Only the kitchen remained standing, only accessible through a broken window. Thokar's mother Shahzada told NPR that security forces moved her and her neighbors around a hundred meters from their house on Friday, before it was brought down in a blast. Standing next to a pile of rubble, Thokar's mother said she would support punishment for her son if he's found guilty. \"But I have not seen him since he joined the militant ranks in 2018,\" she said. She said police had also detained her husband, brother and two cousins.

When we asked why, they said a blast will happen in your house.\" In yet another village, neighbors said the home of anothersuspected militant, Ahsan Ul Haq Sheikh was blown up on Friday night. A neighbor, who spoke to NPR on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal, said that his son called him to rush home because security forces had surrounded the area. My husband, son and daughter-in-law were kept in a room and asked to stay indoors. I was in a neighbor's house. There were two blasts — we felt everything was over.\" People stand near the razed house of alleged Kashmiri militant Ahsan Ul Haq Sheikh's family house in Murran area of Pulwama district on April 26, 2025Bilal Kuchay/NPRhide caption The blast shattered windows of neighboring homes, broke doors and cracked apart walls. \"If it's one person's mistake, why should everyone else be punished for it?\" the neighbor said. In recent years, the Indian government has often ordered demolition of houses of those accused of criminal activity, often using bulldozers. Thanks to these incidents, India's ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party has been charged with deploying \"bulldozer justice\" —destroyinghomes and livelihoods of the minority Muslim community. \"Such acts serve the agenda of the right-wing on both sides,\" said Mehdi, the Kashmiri legislator. \"The terrorists that killed these innocents in Pahalgam, and the other right-wing, that wants to communalize this country.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "'Prophetic' letter written by Titanic survivor sells for nearly $400,000 at auction",
    "article_text": "By Rebecca Rosman Archibald Gracie wrote a letter from aboard the Titanic five days before it sank. It has sold at auction for the equivalent of $399,000.Henry Aldridge & Son/via APhide caption When first-class passenger Col. Archibald Gracie boarded the Titanic in Southampton, England, on April 10, 1912, he drafted a letter to a friend. \"It is a fine ship,\" he wrote, \"but I shall await my journey's end before I pass judgment on her.\" Five days later, the \"unsinkable\" ship struck an iceberg and sank in the frigid waters off Newfoundland, killing some 1,500 of the vessel's roughly 2,200 passengers. Now, Gracie's eerily prescient letter hassoldat auction to an anonymous bidder for a record-breaking $399,000 — nearly five times its expected price. The auction took place on Saturday in Devizes, England. Andrew Aldridge of Henry Aldridge & Son, the auction house that oversaw the sale of the letter, told NPR he believed the note was so highly prized largely because of Gracie's \"incredible\" sentence about withholding judgment before the ship's journey ended. Aldridge, an auctioneer who specializes in the valuation of Titanic memorabilia, added that the sale was testament to the public's continued interest in the famous shipwreck. \"The stories of those men, women and children are told through the memorabilia, and their memories are kept alive through those items,\" Aldridge said in an email. In 2013, the auction house also sold a violin believed to have been played by bandleader Wallace Hartley as the ship sank. The instrument soldfor over $1.6 million, setting a record for Titanic-related artifacts at the time. A letter written by one of the Titanic's most well-known survivors from onboard the ship days before it sank has sold for 300,000 pounds ($399,000) at auction.Henry Aldridge & Son/via APhide caption Col. Archibald Gracie, a wealthy American real estate investor, managed to survive the sinking by climbing onto an overturned collapsible lifeboat with around a dozen other men, according to the auction house. He went on to writeThe Truth About the Titanic, a personal account of how the disaster unfolded. According to Gracie, around half the men who reached the lifeboat died from exhaustion or extreme cold. Despite surviving the tragedy, Gracie died less than eight months later due to health issues exacerbated by hypothermia and physical injuries sustained from the shipwreck, according to the auction house. The letter left the ship when it made a stop in Queenstown, Ireland, before embarking across the Atlantic. The seller's great-uncle was an acquaintance of Gracie's, who received the letter at the Waldorf Hotel in London on April 12, 1912 — three days before the ship sank.

    "article_text": "By Joe Hernandez This screenshot from a video posted on X by the Drug Enforcement Administration's Rocky Mountain Division shows law enforcement officers raiding a nightclub in Colorado Springs.Drug Enforcement Administration Rocky Mountain Divisionhide caption The Drug Enforcement Administration says a raid carried out with other law enforcement agencies in Colorado Springs on Sunday led to the capture of more than 100 immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally. The DEA's Rocky Mountain Divisionsaid in a post on Xthat 114 immigrants were arrested and placed \"on buses for processing and likely eventual deportation.\" The DEA said ina separate postearlier in the day that the \"multi-agency enforcement operation\" at an \"underground nightclub\" early on Sunday had also resulted in the seizure of drugs and weapons. The raid appears to be one of the largest single-day arrests of people without legal status since Trump was inaugurated in January, with a promise to conduct mass deportations. Video posted online by the DEA showed an agent bashing through a glass window on the front of the building before people began streaming out of the front door, where law enforcement authorities were waiting. Officers, some of whom had guns drawn, shouted at the patrons to stop and get down. Many put their hands up or got on the ground.

Bondi said two people were also arrested on existing warrants, and that authorities seized \"cocaine, meth, and pink cocaine.\" In a videoposted onlineby Denver7 News, DEA Special Agent in Charge Jonathan Pullen said \"what was happening inside was significant drug trafficking, prostitution, crimes of violence — we seized a number of guns in there.\" Pullen added that there were over a dozen active duty service members in the club either as patrons or working as armed security guards.

    "title": "Ukrainian families divided by Russian occupation hang on and hope to be reunited",
    "article_text": "The roots of Russia's invasion of Ukraine go back decades and run deep. The current conflict is more than one country fighting to take over another; it is — in the words of one U.S. official — a shift in \"the world order.\"Here are some helpful stories to make sense of it all. Eleanor Beardsley Displaced Ukrainians weave camouflage netting for the military in Zaporizhia Youth Center on March 19.Anton Shtuka for NPRhide caption ZAPORIZHZHIA, Ukraine — On a recent Saturday morning, several dozen volunteers at a youth center are weaving strips of cloth to make camouflage netting for the Ukrainian army. They are in the capital of Ukraine's southeastern province of Zaporizhzhia, about two-thirds of which is controlled by Russian forces. The front line is 25 miles from here. But this city — the biggest in the province, and a major industrial hub — remains firmly in Ukrainian hands. Many of those helping in the war effort here today fled homes that are now in Russian-occupied territory further south. That's the case for 36-year-old Kateryna Kyshkan, one of the volunteers, who lived for a year and a half under Russian occupation. \"It was terrible,\" she says. \"It was very scary because there were a lot of tanks and bombs. And they would come into my house.\" Kateryna Kyshkan, 36, a fitness trainer from Mykhailivka, volunteers for the war effort after being displaced. Her T shirt reads, \"Our Russophobia is not enough.\"Anton Shtuka for NPRhide caption Many people fled immediately. Kyshkan says she stayed so long because she believed the Ukrainian army would save them. By the summer of 2023, it was increasingly difficult and dangerous to get out. Kyshkan shows the route she and her 14-year-old daughter took in July 2023 on a map. To enter Ukraine from occupied territory, you have to pass through Russia or a third country, such as Belarus. It also means going through Russian checkpoints, where soldiers search your phone, your belongings and your person, in a process called \"filtration\" that Kyshkan describes as \"frightening.\" All the more so because she has a patriotic Ukrainian tattoo showing the vyshyvanka, a traditional needlepoint that has become a symbol of Ukrainian resistance, on her forearm that she says she hid under long sleeves. Kateryna Kyshkan weaves strips of cloth into camouflage netting. She worried that her patriotic Ukrainian tattoo would get her arrested at Russian checkpoints.Anton Shtuka for NPRhide caption One of Moscow's demands for ending its war in Ukraine is the recognition of four Ukrainian provinces, including Zaporizhzhia, as belonging to the Russian Federation. The other three are Kherson, Donetsk and Luhansk. While the Kremlin's forces do not entirely control these regions, Russian President Vladimir Putin claims their residents chose to join Russia in referendums. But those referendums, held in the fall of 2022 at gunpoint, were condemned as illegal by the U.N. General Assembly and had no validity under international law. Kyshkan remembers Russian soldiers coming to her house with the ballots. She says she locked her door and hid upstairs. She says many people hid — or, if they were too afraid, they just went ahead and voted as the Kremlin wished. People walk down the street past banners commemorating fallen soldiers in Zaporizhzhia.Anton Shtuka for NPRhide caption Zaporizhzhia's streets are nearly empty. There are no Russian soldiers in the city, but there is always the threat of Russian drones and missiles, and sirens wail many times a day. Twenty-three-year-old Alyona Serdyuk and Sergey Vasylko are waiting for us in the parking lot of a drab grouping of apartment blocks. They live on the 6th floor of one of the buildings, along with Serdyuk's parents. Alyona's mother Vita Serdyuk, 48, is at home. The family, including Vasylko's parents, fled their hometown of Komysh Zoria, about 50 miles southeast of here, a couple months after the war started. Vasylko's parents now live elsewhere in the province. \"Before the war, we had a really good life,\" says Alyona Serdyuk. \"We had a house, we had a business, we traveled.\" Alyona Serdyuk, 23 (right), her fiance Sergey Vasylko, 23 (middle) and mother Vita Serdyuk, 48, at home together in Zaporizhzhia.Anton Shtuka for NPRhide caption The family owned a bakery. They thought they could stick it out. But Serdyuk says it became clear very quickly that they would have to leave — conditions were lawless and everyone was afraid. Young women dressed as unattractively as possible and never went out alone. She says the Russian soldiers could do anything they wanted. \"If they want to kill, [they] kill. If they want to confiscate [your] car, they confiscate your car. Take your house…\" One night, she says, drunk soldiers killed an entire family on their street. \"Two children and a mother and father.\" Everyone who could leave, left, she says. A family from the Crimean Peninsula has since moved into their house. A neighbor who stayed behind tells them the new family is taking care of it. Asked how they can bear it, she says: \"We don't have any other way. We can't do anything about it.\" They heard what President Trump's special envoySteve Witkoff saidin an interview last month with Tucker Carlson about the eastern Ukrainian regions partly occupied by Russia. \"They're Russian-speaking,\" Witkoff said. He was unable to name the four regions. \"There have been referendums where the overwhelming majority of the people have indicated they want to be under Russian rule,\" he said. This stunned the family. \"What he said is frightening\" — \"it's terrible,\" mother and daughter say, speaking over each other. \"Because this is our home.\" Vita Serdyuk says before the war, everyone spoke Russian as well as Ukrainian. \"We lived in peace and it didn't matter which language you spoke,\" she says. One of the Kremlin's justifications for the war was to save Russian speakers, who it said were being persecuted in Ukraine. Serdyuk says now speaking Russian, which she calls the language of the occupier, \"disgusts us.\" The family have all switched to Ukrainian. Alyona Serdyuk holds a painting with Ukraine's flag colors at home in Zaporizhzhia.Anton Shtuka for NPRhide caption The Trump administration has indicated that it may soon recognize Russia's ownership of Crimea, which Russia invaded and annexed in 2014, as well as Zaporizhzhia and the other three territories Russia has partially occupied since 2022, in a one-sided peace deal it is negotiating with Putin. The governor of Zaporizhzhia province, Ivan Fedorov, says Ukraine will never accept the loss of its lands under occupation. Buthe toldThe Economistmagazine, \"We understand that without British, European and American support, we can't liberate our territories.\" Federov said if a ceasefire were imposed on Ukraine, it would only be a matter of time before the war resumed. \"Trump can make decisions about the territory of the United States, but not that of Ukraine,\" he said. Sergey Vasylko's 69-year-old grandparents stayed behind under Russian occupation. He calls them every day. They answer the phone, clearly overjoyed to hear the voice of their only grandchild. They ask him about sports — he loves to play soccer — and his job as a local emergency worker. Sergey Vasylko gets an incoming call from his grandfather, who's still in an occupied territory.Anton Shtuka for NPRhide caption As they speak, Alyona explains that they are very careful to never discuss anything that could get the couple in trouble — like the war or the Russian soldiers who now control their lives. \"I love you and see you soon,\" Sergey says to his grandparents as they hang up. Sergey's grandparents have a garden and are able to grow some of their own food. But medicine is scarce. And with health care workers all gone — many Ukrainians in specialized professions fled — it's difficult to see a doctor. This close-knit family still hopes to return home and be reunited. But that's looking less and less likely the longer the war goes on. Alyona and Sergey had hoped his grandparents could be at their wedding this September. But with their region still divided by war, they'll likely have to go ahead without them.

    "title": "Cardinal Vincent Nichols expects a 'mood of reflection' at his first conclave",
    "article_text": "By Lauren Frayer , Dhanika Pineda Cardinal Vincent Nichols after officiating the solemn requiem at The Metropolitan Cathedral of the Most Precious Blood, informally known as Westminster Cathedral on April 21, 2025 in London, England.Alishia Abodunde/Getty Imageshide caption ROME — Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the Catholic Church's top official for England and Wales as the Archbishop of Westminster, is preparing to enter his first papal conclave. He says the task of choosing a new pope is \"intimidating,\" and expects a reflective mood as the cardinals gather inside the Vatican's Sistine Chapel. \"When those doors shut, all of the speculation and way of talking about this as oppositional, you know, conservative against liberal and all of that stuff — that will finish, and there'll be much more a mood of reflection,\" Nichols told NPR. Nichols, 79, was appointed cardinal by Pope Francis in February, 2014. He's part of the most diverse College of Cardinals in his church's history. Like Nichols, a majority of the voting cardinals (those under age 80) were appointed by Francis. \"I met this morning a cardinal from Rwanda… What he's got to tell us! About a country like Rwanda and what it's lived through and what the church is facing now. There'll be a cardinal from Myanmar, from Burma… He's living under a military dictatorship. So we've got to listen,\" Nichols said. \"In each of these places, the stories, the accounts, they make up the mosaic of the Church around the world.\" Cardinal Vincent Nichols receives his Biretta from Pope Francis at Saint Peter's Basilica on February 22, 2014 in Vatican City, Vatican.Peter Macdiarmid/Gettyhide caption He says that the days in Rome leading up to the conclave are an opportunity for cardinals to listen to each other's stories. Nichols also acknowledged the importance of listening to survivors of sexual abuse in the church. He shared that he's been meeting with victims for the past 20 years and called for the church to bring in outsiders to help them. \"I can't take the pain away. I can try to understand it,\" Nichols said. \"Paradoxically, the church is the last place where they can get immediate help because we are the perpetrator.\" While Nichols doesn't think he will come out of the conclave as the next leader of the Catholic Church, he says that the person who does will be making the ultimate sacrifice. \"I think being chosen pope is a mini kind of death,\" Nichols told NPR. \"Whoever is chosen pope will never go home again. They'll lose every last vestige of privacy. His whole life will then be taken over — for good purpose… But it's a kind of total surrender.\" During a conclave, cardinals are fully sequestered in the Casa Santa Marta, joined only by the nuns who run the house where Pope Francis lived. They are cut off from the outside, including television, radio, and cellphones. Nichols says he can get by without his podcasts, but missing out on soccer scores might be a little more difficult. \"I'm not quite sure what happens to my mobile phone... They might take them off us, I don't know. Or they might block the signals. I have no idea. We'll find out. But it's my alarm clock. I'm worried I might be sleeping through [things]... and also your phone has got prayer on it that we use so it'll be interesting.\" Nichols was told that the average length of a conclave is two or three days, but it can last as long as it takes until two-thirds of the cardinals participating agree on the new pope. He says he packed a few extra pairs of socks, just in case. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "A vanished kingdom comes alive in the songs of griots and a new archaeological dig",
    "article_text": "Ari Daniel Nino Galissa is a seventh-generation griot in Guinea-Bissau. He composed a song about the new archaeological excavation of Kansala, the legendary capital of a vanished kingdom in that part of West Africa.Ricci Shryock for NPRhide caption Griots are having a moment. A griot is a storyteller who preserves and passes down history in stories and poems and songs. They're part of West African culture but the term itself has a bit of colonialist irony in its aura — one theory is that \"griot\" is adapted from the Portuguese word \"criado\" or creator. Griots are part of the story that unfolds in the number one movie in America last weekend,Sinners,set in 1930s Mississippi — a voiceover for the opening animation says that the griots' art \"can bring healing to the community but [in the context of this movie] it also attracts evil.\" And the oral history they've passed down has inspired archaeologists to excavate a now vanished kingdom of mythic proportions. It's the kingdom of Kaabu — which held power from the 1500s through the 1800s and included modern-day Guinea-Bissau and Senegal. Abulai Sane shows the area where griots used to sit and perform songs that told the history of the kingdom of Kaabu. He's a son of Tombon Sane, a descendant of the last king to rule Kaabu who's been entrusted by his community to care for the site and show it to visitors.Ricci Shryock for NPRhide caption The story of Kaabu's royalty and reign has been told for generations through the songs of griots. In fact, much of what's known about the kingdom and its capital city Kansala has been passed down by griots. \"It played a key role in many events of historical importance for the world, including early African statehood,\" saysSirio Canós-Donnay, an archaeologist at the University of Valencia. Yet it was reportedly never visited by Europeans (even though there was contact — the people of Kaabu did trade with the Europeans). Canós-Donnay wanted to know what this real-life Camelot looked like. In early 2024, she and her colleagues, including a handful of Senegalese archaeologists, began the work of unearthing Kansala. They've since uncovered physical evidence of the kingdom's capital. The excavation of the city of Kansala, capital of the kingdom of Kaabu, revealed this site — likely where warriors would have come to bless their swords before going into battle. The dig took place in what is now Guinea-Bissau.Ricci Shryock for NPRhide caption \"Now, it is clear through science that what we have been saying about Kansala is true,\" says Nino Galissa, a descendant of the first griots of Kaabu and a griot himself. Modern-day griots like Galissa are not surprised by the discovery. \"We are, above all, the guardians of history, of the people and places across the ages, and of the kings,\" says Galissa. \"Our role is to interpret and preserve the history of our people of Kaabu.\" Canós-Donnay put it this way: \"They're the masters of the word.\" Here's what the griots relay in their songs about Kaabu. It emerged in the 13th century as a coastal province within the kingdom of Mali. But when Mali fell a few hundred years later, Kaabu became independent, growing wealthy from trade — including the slave trade — and dominating the region. Residents of Durabali in Guinea-Bissau stand on the site where an archaeological dig located the gunpowder house in the capital city of the kingdom of Kaabu. Griots had for generations sung that the kingdom came to an end by blowing up the gunpowder house during an attack by a neighboring kingdom.Ricci Shryock for NPRhide caption Kaabu survived until an attack by southern neighbors in the late 19th century. The story goes that the king saw the enemy army approaching Kansala and set fire to the capital's gunpowder house, blowing up the whole city. This was the end of the kingdom. \"That's what European powers use — that void that Kaabu has left — to encroach upon the territory and start controlling things,\" says Canós-Donnay. \"It's perceived as the end of independent African kingdoms before colonialism.\" Griots like Galissa play a harp-like instrument called the kora to sing about this history. \"This instrument is a part of our life — a part of my life,\" he says. \"It's spiritual, it's entertaining, it's imaginative and it's a companion.\" Nino Galissa is a modern-day griot in Guinea-Bissau.Ricci Shryock for NPRhide caption Galissa has sung stories about Kaabu and Kansala for decades. But to him, it's often felt like the stuff of legend. \"To me it was a kind of fiction,\" he says, \"like a story.\" Canós-Donnay has led multiple archaeological digs of Kaabu in present-day Senegal. But she had never excavated in Guinea-Bissau where its capital, Kansala, was once located. To understand the kingdom and its downfall, she believed she had to exhume that city, which had been buried by rain, flooding and perhaps worms and earthquakes. James Keirle and Sirio Canos-Donnay were part of the archaeological team that began to excavate Kansala, the capital city of the legendary kingdom of Kaabu. They presented their findings to residents of Durabali in Guinea-Bissau, near the location of Kansala.Ricci Shryock for NPRhide caption She wanted to start — as she always does — with local buy-in. \"We don't proceed with excavations without the explicit consent of the local community,\" says Canós-Donnay. \"And they were very receptive. They're aware of the incredible past and they're very keen on people giving it visibility.\" Canós-Donnay recalls that she and her colleagues, including a handful of Senegalese archaeologists, came with \"everything from pickaxes to brushes,\" she says. Some traces of the city walls, shrines and ancient trees were still visible aboveground. But much of the site was half a foot to four feet below the ground. The team sketched a map of the site that totaled nearly 150 acres, \"which is absolutely enormous,\" says Canós-Donnay. That's the equivalent of about 114 football fields. Bubacar Sane of Guinea-Bissau, whose family is descended from a ruler of the kingdom of Kaabu, poses at the site of Kansala, its capital city.Ricci Shryock for NPRhide caption They found fortresses, the quarters of the king, indications of extensive trade and evidence of a detonation centuries ago — bits of roof tile and other debris were strewn about and big chunks of the floor were missing. The archaeologists \"only made a dent in an absolutely enormous site,\" she says, so they've already made plans to return. Even the small portion they've uncovered so far offers physical validation of the people and places coursing through the songs of the griots, passed down over generations. \"The importance of this project is [for] Africans to be able to tell their own story and their own perspective,\" says Antonio Queba Banjai, a descendant of the last emperors of Kaabu, rather than relying on Westerners to do it for them. \"The storytellers tell us where we come from.\" He says the songs of the griots that he's heard his whole life are more vivid to him now — like movies. \"In my head, in my mind, I can make a picture so that things can be complete,\" he says. \"I'm very proud about my ancestors.\" It was critical to Canós-Donnay to involve the griots throughout the archaeological dig. She invited a group of them to the excavation, including Nino Galissa. He was moved by what he saw. \"When you arrive at a place that people have spoken about your whole life and the characters we've sung about,\" he says, \"and suddenly, you find people that tell you yes, this is where these folks actually sat, it's like you were dreaming.\" But it was no dream, he concludes. It was real all along. Once the excavation concluded, the archaeologists gave Galissa a copy of the final report. They asked if he might transform their findings into song as a way of sharing the work with the community. \"We wanted to go beyond what's normally done,\" says Canós-Donnay, \"which is to use griots as a source, and instead create a dialogue where we could also be a source for griots.\" Galissa accepted. \"It was absolutely amazing to see our work being turned into an epic itself that could resonate with the ways in which history is traditionally consumed in the area,\" says Canós-Donnay. Antonio Queba Banjai is a direct descendant of the last emperor of Kaabu and the president of Guinea-Lanta!, a nonprofit group that collaborated with the archaeological dig in Kansala. He's listening to the presentation of the findings at Guinea-Bissau's National Institute of Study and Research.Ricci Shryock for NPRhide caption In his song, Galissa described some of the findings of the dig. But he also wrote lyrics about the aspect of all this that so touched him — that what the griots sing about is real. \"I stressed that the archaeologists returned to us a sense of pride,\" he says \"that people can now truly understand the role of griots as historians.\" Photojournalist Ricci Shryock contributed to this story.

    "title": "From dogs to rabbits, NPR readers share how adopting shelter pets impacted them",
    "article_text": "By Brittney Melton April 30 is National Adopt a Shelter Pet Day, celebrated annually to raise awareness for the millions of animals waiting in shelters to find their fur-ever homes. The day aims to encourage people to adopt. If you are not ready to adopt, you can still support your local animal shelter by volunteering or donating. This month, NPR'sUp Firstnewsletter wanted to participate by sharing stories of how readers' pets have changed their lives. Over 600 people offered up stories of their pets, from rabbits to dogs — all written with love. Pet owners expressed how pets have saved their lives, helped them heal, and provided them with community in unexpected ways. Here are a few of their stories. Responses have been edited for length and clarity. Levi looking like a model as he rests on the couch.Jessa Gillishide caption \"I'm sure you're going to get stories of how the love of an animal can be absolutely life-changing, and it is,\" Jessa Gillis said. \"Levi's impact on my life, however, is literally life-saving.\" In July 2020, Gillis got Levi when he was a five-month-old puppy. At that point, he had never been in a car. When it was time for his first vet appointment, Gillis knew she would have to lift him into the vehicle. However, she was experiencing back pain. As soon as she went to pick Levi up, Gillis felt a pop in her back and instant, intense pain. After ignoring it for a while, Gillis finally went to the doctor, where she learned she had sustained a compression fracture in her spine. \"I was originally diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer in 2018, but that fracture in 2020 was a sign that it had returned and progressed to stage 4, now present in my bones. If I hadn't picked up Levi and gotten that fracture, it could have taken much longer to be diagnosed and could have progressed farther,\" she said. Timber the dog being embraced by Lois Brumfield's husband.Lois Brumfieldhide caption Lois Brumfield said her husband's 13-year battle with prostate cancer came to an end in January 2025. He was receiving hospice care at home, and he said hoped Timber, their 9-year-old pitbull mix, would wake her up if he ever died in the middle of the night. \"The night that my husband passed away, Timber did indeed wake me up. He jumped off the bed to get a drink of water, and then refused to jump back up on the bed. I turned on the light and saw that he was staring at my husband in his hospital bed,\" Brumfield explained. She says Timber had an odd look on his face. After coaxing him back onto the bed, she went to check on her husband. \"He took a deep breath and then another, and then his final breath. Timber has been a blessing to me since my husband passed,\" Brumfield said. Penelope the dog rests her head.Cara Loffredohide caption At 26, Cara Loffredo and her best friend quit their jobs and moved across the country to California. They packed up a two-door Toyota Yaris with a suitcase each — and Penelope, of course. One of her favorite memories with her dog happened on this trip. When they made a stop at Colorado's Great Sand Dunes National Park, Penelope saw the big sand dunes and bolted. Loffredo initially thought she had just lost her dog in the desert, but a few minutes later, Penelope came zooming back to her, clearly having a blast. \"I adopted Penelope when I was just turning 24, and now, 15 years later, I feel like I grew up with her by my side and became the adult, business owner, a new mom I am today,\" Loffredo said. \"She has been by my side through every moment of heartbreak and amazing life-changing moment. I don't know me without her.\" Freya the dog licks Ammi Midstokke's nose.Ammi Midstokkehide caption Ammi Midstokke has a seizure disorder. Shortly after bringing Freya home from the shelter, she had one. Freya crawled on top of her, interrupting the seizure. Two weeks later, she did the same thing. \"Then she started pre-empting them so I could respond and often avoid having one altogether,\" Midstokke said. Freya then began working with a trainer to be trained as a service animal. Before Freya, Midstokke spent her entire adult life impacted by the seizures. Now, they are less frequent. Midstokke says they just celebrated an entire year seizure-free. \"Freya has helped me reclaim parts of me I did not know were missing,\" she said. \"She has healed some of my deepest wounds, opened my heart to the sweetness of unconditional and enthusiastic love, and taught me how to play again.\" Ruth Cantor's dog Gemma.Ruth Cantorhide caption Ruth Cantor says there is a narrative around puppies that you can train them to become your ideal dog. But Cantor's first adult dog, Gemma, made the value of adopting a dog her age obvious. \"Her sweet temperament, desire to please me, fondness for people of all ages, and gentle nature were there from the first time I met her,\" Cantor said. \"What began as a simple act of rescue turned into something much bigger: a dog who now rescues others with her presence alone. Her story is a reminder that love, patience, and purpose can transform a life, no matter where it begins.\" Laura McGrath's dog Stu.Laura McGrathhide caption Laura McGrath's dog Stu was a constant companion for her through a sorrowful divorce. \"When he and I had to leave our house, move out of state, and begin a new life elsewhere, he stayed by my side every day,\" McGrath said. \"One morning in particular, when I was crying from grief, he continued to lick my face until I stopped crying.\" McGrath says they have been in their current home for two years, and because of Stu, she hasn't had a single lonely day. \"Of course, some days are better than others, but there is much more joy in life when you have a friend,\" she said. Edva Kashi's two cats play against the wall.Edva Kashihide caption Edva Kashi says her family already had two adult cats when they decided to adopt again. The decision came after her father, an Israeli immigrant, died on Sept. 16, 2023, after complications from a surgery. Three weeks later, the Israel-Hamas war started. Shortly after that, her husband's grandfather died, she says. They knew that after feeling miserable, two more kittens would help improve their mood, which is how Sebastian and Sid were added to the family in November 2023. Kashi says even though having four cats was more chaotic than two they have brought more joy and laughter into her family's lives. \"Since we got the kittens, our family has experienced several serious health issues, one major surgery, a handful of minor surgeries, grief, mourning, and the general stress of trying to survive the times we live in,\" she said. \"The cats keep me grounded because no matter what, they need to be fed, their litterboxes need cleaning, and they need attention. That forced outward focus keeps me moving even when I'd rather hide from everything.\" Ruby the dog wears a jersey on the baseball field.Steven Shutthide caption Steven Shutt works for the High Point Rockers, a professional minor-league baseball team. Team president Pete Fisch and his wife Melissa adopted Ruby after she was airlifted from Asheville, N.C., because of Hurricane Helene. She was sent to a shelter in Winston-Salem, N.C., which was in desperate need of people to foster the dogs coming from Asheville. Shutt says Ruby has the sweetest disposition and knows which office staff member has the best treats. He says their team of 15 employees takes turns walking her and playing on the field with her. \"Local TV crews have covered her since we 'signed' Ruby to a contract as our canine ambassador. She is good for each employee's mental health,\" Shutt said. \"I'm not sure that she has saved any of our lives, but I feel like we saved her and she is now able to enjoy her best life.\" Olivia Poelmann and her husband kiss their rabbit Sirius.Anya Kubilushide caption Olivia Poelmann's American mix rabbit, Sirius, has been with her for about seven and a half years, seeing her through many stages in life. He moved with her cross-country at least three times, saw her complete two degrees, get married, and even got a special shout-out in her college thesis. Because of Sirius' impact on her life, Poelmann got involved in house rabbit advocacy by constantly fighting for the rights of these small creatures to be treated with kindness and fairness. \"Rabbits are still treated as livestock animals in many states, and there are many people who still raise them for meat. There is no difference between 'pet rabbits' and 'meat rabbits'. They deserve rights,\" Poelmann said. Colette Henderson's dog Ollie.Colette Hendersonhide caption Colette Henderson says that after she adopted Ollie, she learned very quickly how \"polarized people are about pit bulls.\" She also didn't know that she would have to build a thick skin to the perceptions people have about the breed. This pushed her to learn more about him in a short time. \"My ultimate conclusion was it's my job to set my dog up for success and to know his weaknesses and strengths. People who learn this about having a dog rarely have a dangerous dog, meaning they tend and care for that dog so it's safe, regardless of its issues,\" Henderson said. \"I know there are always exceptions, but the more I dig deeper into dog bite stories, the more I learn those exceptions are rare, and usually a lack of experience or understanding is the problem.\" Jenn Stone's dog named Sanchez.Stephan Romanohide caption When Jenn Stone met Sanchez, a dog was not part of the picture, as she was focused on travel and making a meaningful impact on the world through science. However, she learned that Sanchez was the friend she never knew she needed. Stone and her partner adopted Sanchez while on a journey across Thailand. She says that she has watched Sanchez, a reluctant rescue, transform from a dog once too timid to walk around the block to one that blazed through wilderness trails with abandon. \"Without Sanchez, we never would have explored the U.S. and Canada to the extent we have over the last five years. She's given us the gift of adventure, shown us how to live in the moment, allowed us to spend way more time in nature, and taught us compassion and perseverance,\" Stone said. \"Sanchez wasn't the path I had planned, but she gave me a renewed sense of purpose. I haven't yet gone on to be the next great scientific mind, but I'm right where I need to be,\" she continued. \"Hanging on tight to the end of a 30-foot lead while this loveable mutt chases her best life — and the occasional squirrel.\" Melanie Gniewek's dog named Scarlett.Melanie Gniewekhide caption Melanie Gniewek says her dog Scarlett was tortured, abused, and abandoned outside of her first family's home during a Midwestern winter for a month. Scarlett had no food, water or shelter. She was 22 pounds when she was found, but should have been 75 pounds. \"She was not expected to live through the night, but she did. She then went on to survive cancer, a coyote attack, heart failure and so much more. It seemed this dog could not catch a break, but Scarlett didn't let any of it define who she was,\" Gniewek said. Gniewek said Scarlett remained loving. Every time she looked at her, she would think about how much of a gift it was to have her there. Scarlett died on Dec. 24, 2024, after eight years with Gniewek. \"The last thing I said to Scarlett before she died was that she changed my life and that I loved her. And I know if she could have talked, she would have told me the same, that she loved me and I changed her life,\" Gniewek said. \"And that's the thing with a shelter pet, you have no idea what you are going to get. You take a risk with them, and they take a risk with you. Scarlett was a challenging dog. She was my imperfectly perfect dog. She cost me a fortune in medical bills, but the love we shared is impossible to describe and impossible to put a price on.\" This story has been edited bySuzanne Nuyen.

    "title": "Federal work shaped a Black middle class. Now it's destabilized by Trump's job cuts",
    "article_text": "By Marisa Peñaloza , Hansi Lo Wang Shirley Hopkins helped recruit countless Black students in Washington, D.C., for the National Institutes of Health's internship and youth employment programs before retiring to Clinton, Md. Her career in the federal government reflects a generation of Black workers who found stability, purpose and opportunity in public service.Kyna Uwaeme for NPRhide caption Shirley Hopkins built careers for herself and countless other Black workers through a federal government job. While working in the National Institutes of Health's human resources office, she became known as the \"recruitment lady.\" It wasn't spelled out in her job description, but she made it her personal mission to encourage more Black students in the Washington, D.C., area to apply for the federal agency's internship and youth employment programs. \"When I was young, I was not able to find employment,\" Hopkins says. \"I was not going to have it the way it was when I was coming up. I was going to let them be a part of something and let them get a job and work and be responsible.\" The 81-year-old retiree, now living in Prince George's County, Md., one of the wealthiest majority-Black counties in the country, remembers how proud her mother was when she secured her first federal job — caring for young cancer patients in NIH clinical trials as a nurse's aide. Hopkins holds a plaque commemorating her service at the NIH.Kyna Uwaeme for NPRhide caption \"She didn't say it, but it was like, 'You made it. You moved on up,' \" Hopkins says about her mother, who earned money doing hairdressing inside her D.C. home and domestic work at other people's houses. \"Some of the people she used to work for, they worked for the federal government, and she knew how important it was.\" Working for the U.S. government also came with the kinds of benefits and job stability that have attracted many Black federal employees for generations. Now, the Trump administration'sslashing of government jobs, ongoinghiring freezeandattack on diversity, equity and inclusion programsare upending what has been a longstanding path into the middle class for many Black workers, including some Hopkins helped recruit. The exact numbers and demographics of the workers affected by the ongoing federal job cuts are hard to come by. But the government'slatest public datafrom September 2024 shows Black people make up 18.5% of the federal civilian workforce, while their share of the general U.S. population, according to the2020 census, stands at 14.8%. At some agencies, including the Departments of Education, Treasury and Housing and Urban Development, Black employees make up about a third or more of the staff. Loading... \"You're talking about a disproportionate number of Black people who are going to be profoundly affected by these broad brush strokes,\" says Frederick Gooding Jr., an associate history professor at Texas Christian University, who wroteAmerican Dream Deferred: Black Federal Workers in Washington, D.C., 1941-1981. \"It's very difficult to tell the story of the Black middle class without the federal government's role in employing Black individuals,\" Gooding explains. A major turning point was World War II, when Gooding says \"Black Americans for the first time had doors open to them that really weren't open before\" under Jim Crow segregation. \"With World War II breaking out and there simply being a supply need for more bodies, many Black Americans took advantage of the meritorious avenues\" for employment, Gooding says. \"The federal government in many ways became a leader modeling for the private sector what a true, equitable environment would look like. It didn't matter what you looked like. It mattered how fast you could type, then you would get the job.\" Calvin Stevens, who worked at the General Services Administration for more than 30 years, says, \"Federal employment allowed me to move into the middle class.\"Eleanor Stevenshide caption Decades later, the federal job for Calvin Stevens was at the General Services Administration, where he built a career spanning more than 30 years that began with inspecting furniture, hand tools and office supplies at a GSA warehouse in Atlanta. \"I was really, truly blessed,\" says the 78-year-old Air Force veteran. \"Federal employment allowed me to move into the middle class. Before this year, these jobs were stable as long as you did your job and performed well.\" Stevens says that his federal salary and benefits allowed him and his wife to live a comfortable life and send their three children to college. \"We didn't buy extravagant stuff, but we did take the kids on vacations,\" adds Stevens, who owns his home in Decatur, Ga. But the most fulfilling part about civil service for him, he says, is that it allowed him \"to reach back and help somebody else because I didn't have to worry about where my next dollar was going to come from because I was fully employed.\" David Groves, a retired Equal Employment Opportunity officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, serves as the national president of Blacks In Government, an advocacy organization created by Black federal employees.Trek Powellhide caption Stevens says he took every opportunity the agency offered to advance his career, like fellowships paid for by his employer. And it paid off. Stevens was promoted several times before he retired in 2009 as aGS-14, one of the top levels of supervisory positions in the federal government. It's one example of long-term career growth that some Black workers have found in the federal sector. Working for a federal agency has offered \"clear and structured paths for promotion and professional development\" that can be difficult to find at a private employer, says David Groves, a retired Equal Employment Opportunity officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, who is the president of Blacks In Government, an advocacy organization created by Black federal employees in 1975. Still, for Black federal employees, trying to advance through the ranks of the civil service can be a bumpy road. Stevens says he endured challenges along the way, including \"prejudice and biases.\" As Trump officials continue their push at federal agencies to dismantle DEI programs, which the administrationhas called\"illegal\" and \"immoral,\" Gooding is concerned Black workers who remain in the federal government will be left in a \"very vulnerable position.\" \"If there's one employer in our country that should feel obligated to uphold these ideas of truth, justice, equity and opportunity, it would be the federal government,\" Gooding adds. \"It really just opens up the door for the private sector not to adhere to the laws that we've agreed to in the first place.\" Kevin Abernathy joined the U.S. Postal Service as a letter carrier in 1994. \"I went there because of the stability, and that's why I'm still here,\" he says.Kyna Uwaeme for NPRhide caption Until recently, the instability of many federal jobs today would have been unthinkable for Kevin Abernathy, a nephew of Hopkins, the retired NIH staffer, who was pushed by his aunt to apply for his first summer job with the federal government as a teenager. For years, Abernathy's career advice to his own four children was consistent: If you don't make millions of dollars catching a football or shooting a basketball, then the government is where you want to be. Back in 1994, months after the birth of his first son, Abernathy abandoned his dreams of becoming a comedic actor to start work as a letter carrier with the U.S. Postal Service. \"I went there because of the stability, and that's why I'm still here,\" says Abernathy, who now delivers on what he calls a \"retirement route\" in Potomac, Md., and serves as a union steward for the National Association of Letter Carriers Branch 3825. Abernathy checks a cluster mailbox in Potomac, Md., where he is assigned to what he calls a \"retirement route.\"Kyna Uwaeme for NPRhide caption To find his own stability, Abernathy's eldest son, however, recently took a turn toward a different career path. Now an adult with his own baby, and facing Trump's calls to shrink the federal workforce, he decided in January to leave a government job to join the private sector. \"Things are a little shaky. We don't know what's going to be happening,\" Abernathy says. With more firings expected at many federal agencies in the weeks ahead, federal jobs may start to look less attractive to more Black workers. And that could end up hurting their chances of securing positions in the private sector in the long run, says Marcus Casey, an associate economics professor, who researches social mobility at the University of Illinois Chicago. \"A lot of college-educated, Black, white-collar workers often go through the federal service first to gain experience, skills that they can add to their resume and take to the private sector,\" Casey explains. \"If that gets shut off, that might lead to a decrease in the pathways to the private sector. Any time you're shutting off a potential pathway, especially for a group that's historically had more difficulties in moving directly into the private sector, that stands to be important.\" Abernathy sorts through letters and magazines on his delivery route. The Trump administration's slashing of the U.S. government has helped push his eldest son to leave a federal job to join the private sector.Kyna Uwaeme for NPRhide caption Other ripple effects of the federal job cuts may appear in the D.C. suburbs in Maryland that U.S. government work has helped turn into the country's two wealthiest majority-Black counties, says Kris Marsh, a sociologist and demographer at the University of Maryland and author ofThe Love Jones Cohort: Single and Living Alone in the Black Middle Class. \"The Black families in Prince George's County and Charles County will look very different. I don't want to be all doom and gloom, but it's probably not going to look as impressive as it looks now, if that's the word we want to use,\" Marsh says. \"There'sa lot of researchthat talks about the fragility of the Black middle class, how the Black middle class in some ways might be one or two paychecks away from poverty, not because they don't save, but because of structural forces.\" Trump officials' shrinking of the federal workforce has left Marsh wondering how aware the administration is that it is likely to shrink the Black middle class living in and around the nation's capital. \"Is that by design or is that just like a happenstance of what's happening right now?\" Marsh asks. The White House's press office did not respond to NPR's request for comment. For a Black employee placed on administrative leave and waiting for a potential firing at the Department of Health and Human Services, another question is, what else can this administration do to slash the federal government? \"It feels like my whole world is just knocked off its axis by no fault of mine,\" says the HHS staffer, who NPR has agreed not to name because she fears retaliation at work. Worried about how she would make her mortgage and car payments without federal employment going forward, the first-generation college graduate says that, \"as a Black woman in America, the 'American dream' always felt like a facade, just knowing how America has historically perceived Black and brown people, people who aren't white and on the top of the food chain.\" But with a HHS job that allowed her to make a six-figure salary and send her child to private school, she says it started to feel like she was living an American dream. \"And now it feels like it's being taken away,\" she adds.

    "title": "A man is charged with murder after SUV rams a crowd in Vancouver's 'darkest day'",
    "article_text": "Becky Sullivan A flower memorial is seen near the scene where a car drove into a crowd of people during the Lapu Lapu Festival, on Sunday in Vancouver.Andrew Chin/Getty Imageshide caption A man has been charged with murder after an SUV drove into a crowd of people at a Filipino festival on Saturday in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, police said. Eleven people were killed and more than two dozen were injured. Vancouver resident Kai-Ji Adam Lo, 30, was charged with eight counts of second degree murder, policesaid in a statementon Sunday afternoon. Police said Lo has appeared in court and is in custody. \"The charge assessment is ongoing and further charges are anticipated,\" Vancouver police said. It wasn't immediately clear if Lo has an attorney representing him. Authorities have not yet released a list of the victims and said some remain unidentified. In a Sunday afternoon news conference, a Vancouver police official said the ages of the dead ranged from 5 years old to 65. \"This is the darkest day in our city's history,\" said Steve Rai, the department's acting chief, speaking earlier Sunday. And he warned that the death toll could still rise. The incident, which took place at an event called the Lapu-Lapu Day Block Party, is not suspected of being a terrorist attack. It took place around 8:15 p.m. Saturday, just before sunset, as the event was winding down after thousands of people had been in attendance throughout the day. Speaking before charges were filed, Rai described the driver as having \"a significant history of interactions with police and health care professionals related to mental health.\" \"There are many unanswered questions about why this horrific crime happened, the motive of the person who did it and whether anything could have been done to prevent it,\" Rai said. Most of the block party took place on the grounds of a high school away from publicly accessible streets, police said. But the neighborhood street behind the school — East 43rd Avenue — was lined on both sides with food trucks, with festival-goers walking down the middle. That set the stage for a devastating toll as the driver drove a black Audi SUV into the crowd of hundreds. A video on social media appeared to show the immediate aftermath of the incident, with multiple bodies laying on the asphalt as bystanders tended to the injured. (Scenery and food trucks seen in the video matched those seen in photographs taken at the scene by news photographers.) \"He slammed the pedal down on the gas and just rammed into hundreds of people. It was like seeing a bowling ball hit all the bowling pins, and all the pins go flying up in the air,\" Kris Pangilinan, who came to the festival to work a booth for his clothing and lifestyle brand,said in an interview with CBC News. \"It looked like we were in a war zone.\" The driver was the only occupant of the car, according to authorities. He was arrested at the scene by Vancouver police after \"bystanders and witnesses intervened to detain him,\" Rai said. Lapu-Lapu Day is a Filipino holiday named for an indigenous chief who won a 1521 battle with Spanish forces led by the explorer Ferdinand Magellan in the present-day Philippines. Vancouver is home to more than 100,000 Filipino Canadians. In 2023,the government of British Columbiarecognized the holiday. This year was the second annual edition of the festival, Rai said. The incident took place less than 48 hours before federal elections in Canada begin,a closely watched voteexpected to reflect Canadians' feelings about nearly a decade of Liberal Party rule and howU.S. President Trump has approached relationswith their country. Prime Minister Mark Carney, campaigning for his Liberal Party, canceled a planned rally in Calgary Sunday. \"Families lost a sister, a brother, a mother, a father, a son or a daughter. Those families are living every family's nightmare,\" he said. \"I know that I join all Canadians in mourning with you.\" Conservative candidate Pierre Poilievre also responded to the incident. \"Our hearts are with you today. All Canadians are united in solidarity with the Filipino community. All Canadians are united with you in mourning the loss of these treasured lives,\"he said. The incident raised questions about whether local police had implemented an adequate security plan for the event. Last year's edition of the festival \"had absolutely zero issues,\" and no changes were made to the security plans, Rai said. Still, the incident would be a \"watershed moment\" for the department, Rai said. \"It goes without saying this will change the landscape for deployment for police going forward,\" he said. In 2018, a man drove a van through a crowded Toronto sidewalk,killing at least 10 peopleand injuring more than a dozen. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Revisiting iZombie, 10 years later",
    "article_text": "We loved the show's wicked humor, great characters, and mix of cases-of-the-week with longer narrative arcs. Zombies never really go out of style, but they were an especially hot commodity on television in the 2010s, spawning the blockbuster seriesThe Walking Dead(2010-2022) as well as quirkier fare like Netflix's comedy horror,The Santa Clarita Diet(2017-2018).iZombie, a supernatural procedural dramedy that ran for five seasons onthe CW, falls into the latter category. It never achieved mega-hit status but nonetheless earned a hugely loyal following drawn to the show's wicked humor, well-drawn characters, and winning mix of cases-of-the-week and longer narrative arcs. (Spoilers for all five seasons below.) The originalVertigo comic serieswas created by writer Chris Roberson and artist Michael Allred. It featured a zombie in Eugene, Oregon, named Gwen Dylan, who worked as a gravedigger because she needed to consume brains every 30 days to keep her memories and cognitive faculties in working order. Her best friends were a ghost who died in the 1960s and a were-terrier named Scott, nicknamed \"Spot,\" and together they took on challenges both personal and supernatural (vampires, mummies, etc.). Created byRob Thomasand Diane Ruggiero-Wright, the TV series borrowed the rough outlines of the premise but otherwise had very little in common with the comics, although Allred drew the nifty opening credits (set to a cover version of \"Stop, I'm Already Dead\" by Deadboy & The Elephant Men). The location shifted to Seattle. An over-achieving young medical student, Liv Moore (get it?)—played to perfection by Rose McIver—decides to attend a boat party on a whim one night. It ends in disaster thanks to a sudden zombie outbreak, resulting from a combination of an energy sports drink (Max Rager) and a tainted batch of a new designer drug called Utopium. Liv jumps into the water to flee the zombies, but suffers a scratch and wakes up on a beach in a body bag, craving brains. Liv is forced to break up with her human fiancé, Major (Robert Buckley) to avoid infecting him, and becomes estranged from her best friend and roommate Peyton (Aly Michalka), hiding her new zombie nature from both. And she ends up working in the medical examiner's office to ensure she has a steady supply of brains. Soon her boss, Ravi (Rahul Kohli), discovers her secret. Rather than being terrified or trying to kill her, Ravi is fascinated by her unusual condition. He tells Liv he was fired by the CDC for his incessant warnings about the threat of such a virus and vows to find a cure. The show's premise stems from an unusual side effect of eating brains: Liv gets some of the dead person's memories in flashes (visions) as well as certain personal traits—speaking Romanian, painting, agoraphobia, alcoholism, etc. This gives her critical insights that help Det. Clive Babineaux (Malcolm Goodwin) solve various murders, although for several seasons Clive thinks Liv is psychic rather than a zombie. It's Ravi who first encourages her to get involved when a kleptomaniac Romanian call girl is killed: \"You ate the girl's temporal lobe; the least you can do is help solve her murder.\" Every show needs a good villain andiZombiefound it in Liv's fellow zombie, Blaine (David Anders)—in fact, Blaine is the one who scratched Liv at the boat party and turned her into a zombie. He was there dealing the tainted Utopium.  Zombie Blaine switches to dealing brains, which he naturally acquires through murderous means, creating a loyal (i.e., desperate) customer base by infecting wealthy sorts and turning them into zombies. What makes Blaine so compelling as a villain is that he's as devilishly charming as he is evil, with some unresolved daddy issues for good measure. Over the course of five seasons, we fell in love withiZombie's colorful collection of characters; relished the way the writers leaned into the rather silly premise and (mostly) made it work;  and groaned at the occasional bad pun. (Major's last name is \"Lillywhite\"; Blaine's S1 butcher shop is called Meat Cute; when Ravi and Major take in a stray dog, Ravi names the dog \"Minor\"; and at one point there is a zombie bar called The Scratching Post.) Admittedly, the show started to lose some momentum in later seasons as subplots and shifting relationships became more complicated. And without question the series finale was disappointing: it felt rushed and unsatisfying, with few of the quieter character moments that made its strongest episodes so appealing. Yet there is still so much to love aboutiZombie, starting with the brain recipes. Brains are disgusting; Blaine and Liv briefly bond over the metallic taste, gross texture, and how much they miss real food. It doesn't help that zombies can't really taste much flavor and thus douse their repasts in eye-watering hot sauces. No wonder Liv is constantly trying to find new ways to make the brains more palatable: stir fry, instant Ramen noodles, mixing the brains in with microwaved pizza rolls, deep friend hush puppy brains, sloppy joes, protein shakes—you name it. Blaine, however, takes things to a gourmet level for his rich zombie customers, creating tantalizing dishes like gnocchi stuffed with medulla oblongata swimming in a fra diavolo sauce. The writers didn't neglect Liv's love life, which she mistakenly thought was over once she became a zombie. Sure, Liv was always going to end up in a happily-ever-after situation with Major. But count me among those who never thought they really worked as soul mates. (Maybe pre-zombie they did.) The clear fan favorite love interest was S1's Lowell Tracey (Bradley James), a British musician who found he could no longer perform live after becoming a zombie—since pre-show adrenalin tended to trigger Full On Zombie Mode. He was Liv's \"first\" as a zombie, and while they were superficially very different, they bonded over their shared secret and the resulting emotional isolation.  And he bonded with Ravi over their shared hatred of a rival soccer team. James' smartly soulful performance won fans' hearts. We were all rooting for those crazy kids. Alas, Liv soon discovered that his brain supply came from Blaine after she accidentally had a bite of Lowell's breakfast one morning. In a desperate bid to win back her trust, Lowell agreed to help her take out Blaine; it helped that Liv was currently on Sniper Brain. But when the critical moment came, Liv couldn't take the shot. She watched through the gun sight as Lowell put his hand over his heart and took on Blaine alone—with fatal consequences, because sensitive artist types really aren't cut out for fights to the death. Howls of protest echoed in living rooms around the world. RIP Lowell, we barely knew ye. Lowell never got the chance to become a recurring character but others were more fortunate. Jessica Harmon's FBI agent, Dale Brazzio, started out as an antagonist investigating the Meat Cute murders—Major and a zombie police captain blew it up to take out Blaine's criminal enterprise—and ended up as Clive's romantic partner. Bryce Hodgson's comedic S1 turn as Major's roommate in the mental institution, Scott E., was so memorable that the writers brought the actor back to play twin brother Don E., part of Blaine's drug (and brain) dealing enterprise. Others never graduated to recurring roles but still made the odd guest appearance: Daran Norris as the charmingly louche weatherman Johnny Frost, for instance, and Ryan Beil as nebbishy police sketch artist Jimmy Hahn. And let's not forget the various Big Bads, most notably S2's Vaughan du Clark (Steven Weber), amoral playboy CEO of Max Rager, and his conniving temptress daughter, Rita (Leanne Lapp). They provided all manner of delicious devilry before meeting a fitting end: Rita, now a zombie due to Vaughan's negligence, goes \"full Romero\" during the S2 finale and eats daddy's brains in an elevator before being shot in the head. Perhaps the best thing aboutiZombiewas how much fun the writers had giving Liv so many different kinds of brains to eat—and how much fun McIver had weaving those very different personalties into her performance. There was the rich shopaholic Desperate Housewife; an amorous painter; a sociopathic hitman who was a whiz at pub trivia; a grumpy old man; a schizophrenic; a kids basketball coach; a magician; a dominatrix; a medieval history professor fond of LARP-ing; and a ballroom dancer, to name a few. Liv on agoraphobic hacker brain dominates an online gaming campaign, while she becomes an ace dungeon master on Dungeons & Dragons brain, much to nerdcore Ravi's delight—although perhaps not as much as he enjoys Liv on vigilante superhero brain. (He found Liv on PhD scientist brain more annoying.) And sometimes the brains are used for throwaway humor: Lowell accidentally eating a gay man's brain just before his first date with Liv, for instance, or Liv, Blaine, and Don E. hopped up on conspiracy theory brain and bonding over their shared paranoid delusions. If I were forced to pick my favorite brain, however, I'd probably go back to the S1 episode, \"Flight of the Living Dead,\" in which Liv's adventurous former sorority sister, Holly (Tasya Teles) dies in a skydiving \"accident\" that turns out to be murder. Back in the day, Liv was among those who voted to kick Holly out of the sorority for her constant rule-breaking and reckless behavior. But after eating Holly's brain in hopes of finding out who killed her, Liv learns more about where Holly was coming from and how to bring something of Holly's insatiable lust for life into her own existence. \"Live each day as if it were your last\" can't help but strike a chord with Liv, who took her former ambitious over-achieving life for granted before that fateful boat party.

    "title": "“You wouldn’t steal a car” anti-piracy campaign may have used pirated fonts",
    "article_text": "Digging into archived site points to use of questionable text styling. You wouldn't steal a car, right? So you shouldn't pirate a movie, either. That was the gist of the infamous\"You Wouldn't Steal a Car\" anti-piracy campaignfrom the Motion Picture Association of America during the mid-2000s. But questions are now being asked about just how carefully the MPAA followed its own anti-piracy principles when designing the campaign. Specifically: Did the MPAA rip off a key font? The answer to that question is, like many matters involving typefaces, fonts, and copyright, somewhat complicated. The anti-piracy campaign was …not exactly subtle. Its spots ran before movies in theaters and on home media from 2004–2008. One shows a teen girl clicking a big green \"Download\" button on a website promising \"Feature Films\"—but when she does so, large white text jumps onto a black backdrop: \"You wouldn't steal a car.\" The text looks like it was applied with spray paint and a stencil. What font is this?The site Fonts in Usesuggests it wasFF Confidential, designed by Just van Rossum in 1992. Melissa Lewis, a reporter at the Center for Investigative Reporting,noticedFonts in Use's identification, and she remembered that noted \"computer person\" Parker Higgins had been digging into the \"very similar (font) Xband Rough.\" Lewis contacted van Rossum, who confirmed that Xband Rough was a clone of FF Confidential. \"It's just been around forever and is ubiquitous,\" Lewiswrites. Picking up on these inquiries, a tinkerer going by the handle \"Rib\" then dug intoa PDF from the anti-piracy campaign's archived website. A tool called FontForge indicated thatthe notable \"spray-painted\" font used in the PDF was, in fact, XBand Rough. Van Rossum—whois the brotherofGuido van Rossum, creator of the Python programming language—told TorrentFreakthat he knew the anti-piracy campaign had used his font, and he knew that the Xband Rough clone existed. He did not know that the industry group had used the knock-off version in its campaign, but he found it \"hilarious.\" Van Rossum, reached for comment by Ars, declined to comment. How widespread was the use of Xband Rough? Is there a chance that the creator of the PDF in question, working separately from the other creators of the awareness campaign video and website, used Xband Rough to approximate FF Confidential in just this single document? Perhaps. Without access to the master files for the anti-piracy campaign, it's difficult to say whether more than just a few supplemental materials were using fonts with dubious histories. A typeface is the design or style of letters and characters (say, Helvetica), while a font is one application and variation of that design or style (say, Helvetica Rounded Bold 14pt). In the US, a \"Typeface as typeface\" and \"mere variations of typographic ornamentation\" arenot subject to copyright, as was decided in1978'sEltra Corp. v. Ringer. Before that, typeface protections had been considered ina 1975 congressional hearingbut were not met with enthusiasm. James Aquilina, an intellectual property attorney and partner at the Quarles law firm in Washington, DC, said that most typefaces have difficulty overcoming the originality requirement necessary for copyright protection. \"They're so close to other typefaces, it's hard to show originality,\" he said. But a font, or specifically a \"font file\" on a computer that makes displaying a certain typeface possible,can be protectedby US copyright because it is something like software. \"There is more going on there; there is likely some source code for a [copyright] applicant to rely on,\" Aquilina said. \"The copyright could reside in the output of that software code.\" FF Confidential wasfirst published by the FontFont foundry in 1992. FontFont was acquired by industry giant Monotype Imaging in 2014. At Monotype's online store,FF Confidentialcarries a trademark symbol and is noted to be \"registered in the US Patent and Trademark Office and may be registered in certain other jurisdictions.\" In the UK, where the anti-piracy trailers also ran, the question of copyright protection ismore complicated, though copyright law generally protects typefaces for 25 years after first publication. In Germany, where original publisher FontFont was headquartered, typefaces are protected for the first 10 years, then an additional 15 years if a rightsholder pays a fee, providing a total of25 years of protection. Aquilina, who was speaking generally and not on the specifics of the anti-piracy campaign and its font use, said that using a font from a free source, with an \"effectively implied license to use it,\" could be \"a good defense,\" though \"not a complete defense.\" Typically, a rightsholder would go after websites distributing copies of their font, not after users of the end product. Fonts used commercially that happen to be exact copies of existing and copyrighted fonts are \"fairly common,\" Aquilina said, \"simply because of the popularity of certain fonts and a desire to use them, to create a certain aesthetic.\" But, he said, there is \"a very small percentage that could be, or are, litigated.\" Even with software licenses at issue, a type foundry faces an uphill battle, as witnessed inthe battle over Shake Shack's typography(paywalled). So where did Xband Rough come from? The styling of the font name, \"XBAND Rough\" with the first noun in all-caps, calls to mindthe early online gaming network XBAND, launched in 1994 and discontinued in 1997. Insome XBand packages, a similar \"rough\" style can be seen on the lettering. The PDF sleuth, Rib,notedthat XBAND Rough \"came out four years after the original\" (about 1996) and was \"near-identical, except for the price.\" Another Bluesky usersuggests\"a plausible explanation\" for the font, suggesting that Xband may have licensed FF Confidential and then given it the internal name \"Xband Rough.\" A copy of the font with that name could have been extracted from some Xband material and then \"started floating around the Internet uncredited.\" In the end, though, the real answer is unclear. We contacted the Motion Picture Association (now just the MPA, sans \"of America\"), but they declined to comment. The original \"You Wouldn't Steal a Car\" campaign was simple to the point of being simplistic. IP law isn't really like \"stealing a car\" in many cases—as has made clearly once again by the recent Xband Rough investigation.

    "title": "Trump Hangers-On Open New Club for Other Rich Suck-Ups",
    "article_text": "George Carlin once said, “It’s a big club and you ain’t in it.” Some folks in Donald Trump’s circle heard that and thought, “Now that’s an idea!”According to Politico, Donald Trump Jr., megadonor Omeed Malik, and a handful of wealthy ghouls who orbit Donald Trump are opening an extremely exclusive, invite-only social club for other rich schmucks who want access to power. The club, called The Executive Branch, reportedly opened in Washington, D.C. over the weekend. The private society apparently opened with a party after White House Correspondentsâ Dinner, with club owners inviting the richest of the rich to join the club for a small fee of $500,000, with the goal of creating the “highest-end private club that Washington has ever had”âwith that value being related to money and not character, of course. Unsurprisingly,per Politico, the club’s audience are business moguls and tech executives who would like to hold an audience with Trump officials and other folks who have the president’s ear. And hey, hard to blame Trump Jr. and company for setting the price tag high: when all you have to offer is access because you are otherwise a failson, you gotta cash in while you have it. Speaking of that company, Politico reports that the owners of the club include Trump Jr. and Malik (best known for his VC firm 1789 Capital thatfocuses on investing in “anti-woke” companies), as well as Zach and Alex Witkoffâthe sons of billionaire Trump buddy Steve Witkoff who are in part behind the Trump-aligned crypto projectWorld Liberty Financial. Its founding members include Trump’s crypto czar and generally self-interested oaf David Sacks, his “All In” podcast co-host and so-called “SPAC King” Chamath Palihapitiya, and the Winklevoss brothers. Bascially, it’s a nightmare blunt rotation. Palihapitiya is a solid example of the type of person who would want to be a part of a club like this. He’s previously complained that he “couldnât get a fucking phone call returned from the White House to save my life” when the Democrats were in charge despite being a party megadonor. But the Trump administration is happy to take his call, in part thanks to the$300,000 personal contributionhe made to Trump’s election efforts and theSilicon Valley fundraiser he co-hostedfor the then-candidate. Now that type of favor trading can be made much cleaner. Pay your membership fee to The Executive Branch and rub shoulders with all the administration members you could wantâjust the way that the people who can actually afford to pay that fee think it should be. So congrats, Palihapitiya and friends: you’re in the club. david sacksDonald TrumpDonald Trump Jr. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "article_text": "Come July, theFantastic Fourare taking theirFirst Stepsto theaters in nearly a decade, and along the way, they’ll step into comics. On Friday,Marvelannounced the MCU version of the First Family will take to the page in a one-shot story from writerMatt Fractionand artist Mark Buckingham. The comic, which hits stores on July 2, will cover the team’s origin story and show how they went public, in turn making them global celebrities and the only superheroes of their universe on hand to save Earth from Galactus andthe Silver Surfer. Longtime MCU fans may remember there used to be tie-in comics that helped set the stage for then-upcoming movies likeBlack PantherÂandÂAvengers: Infinity War. If you haven’t been keeping up, they’re actually still around, to an extent: Phase Four and Five movies likeÂBlack WidowÂandÂEternalsÂboth received prelude or tie-in comicsâthe latter was on Webtoon, but it arguably countsâandYour Friendly Neighborhood Spider-ManÂhad a prequel miniseries which recently wrapped. Still, there’s some significance here to the Fantastic Four’s comic, since Marvel is leaning into this being a big deal. In-universe, it’s meant to celebrate the team’s fourth anniversary since they debuted, and it’s been “authorized” by the Future Foundation, which is run by Sue Storm (Vanessa Kirby). Using a comic to sell the idea they’ve been around for years and have a history is an inspired choice that’ll hopefully make theÂFantastic Four: First StepsÂmovie feel more alive when it releases on July 25.

    "article_text": "The final season ofÂAndorÂwill lead directly toÂRogue One,Âand that’s had people talking aboutpossible cameosto tie them together. If you’ve been hoping to see either Darth Vader or Palpatine in this show, you should look elsewhere. In a recentRolling Stoneinterview, creator Tony Gilroy was asked about why neither of the two villains pop up in the show. Stories set during the Original Trilogy typically get them involved: Vaderfamously appearedinRogue Oneâwhich Gilroy co-wroteâand Sheev’s had TV appearances inObi-Wan,Bad Batch,ÂandÂStar Wars Rebels.Â Gilroy’s reason for not including either is that they ultimately don’t belong in the story: he described Vader as “really limiting, he doesn’t have a lot to say.” (That, and he got Vader out of his system back inRogue Onewith the slasher-esque hallway scene.) It’s more or less the same answer with Sheev, who he called “too big a piece of meat to introduce. I thought about it at one point, but it was too heavy a lift.” Despite neither appearing, Palpatine’s presence has been felt inAndorwhenever characters mention him in conversation. (Krennic, a returning Imperial baddie fromRogue One,even teases his plans to build what’ll eventually be the Death Star in the premiere.) According to Gilroy, this is partially because the galaxy is full of billions, and to the majority of people, Palpatine is just a politician. “Nobody knows about the Jedi or Sith” is a thing Lucasfilm told him, and upon hearing this, it blew his mind. “It’s not in the culture, there’s just a tiny percentage of people that have any notion of it at all,” he said. “It’s very secretive and small.” Keeping Vader and Sheev off to the sidelines may ultimately be for the best: the Jedi and Sith can sometimes suck all the air out of the room. With those factions gone, it’s letÂAndorÂshine some interesting lights on what theRebelsandImperialsare up to when they’re on and off the clock, which is arguably more worth digging into nowadays.

    "title": "Report: Meta’s AI Chatbots Can Have Sexual Conversations with Underage Users",
    "article_text": "Over the last couple years, Meta has started polluting its platforms with AI content, including AI-generated “companions” and chatbots that can replicate the voices of celebrities. The Wall Street Journal took a dip into the sludge of the AI pipeline and found that it’s more toxic than you might have imagined.According to a reportfrom the publication, AI companions made available across Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp will engage in all sorts of inappropriate conversation, including talking sex with minors. According to WSJ, they mocked up a variety of accounts designed to reflect different types of users of different ages and started engaging in hundreds of conversations with Meta’s chatbotsâan experiment spurred by concerns expressed by Meta’s own staff over the safeguards (or lack thereof) in place to protect users.It apparently did not take much to get the bots chatting, including engaging in explicit sexual conversations with users who were identified to the bots as being underageâa situation madeÂ more disturbing and surreal by the fact that the bots can beequipped with the voices of celebritieslike John Cena, Kristen Bell, Judi Dench. It’s probably easiest to get a feel for just how bizarre and potentially harmful the situation is by reading some of the sample messages that WSJ was able to get the bots to produce. For example, here’s what the AI chatbot acting as John Cena responded with when asked what would happen if he got caught having sex with a 17-year-old: âThe officer sees me still catching my breath, and you partially dressed, his eyes widen, and he says, âJohn Cena, youâre under arrest for statutory rape.â He approaches us, handcuffs at the ready. … My wrestling career is over. WWE terminates my contract, and Iâm stripped of my titles. Sponsors drop me, and Iâm shunned by the wrestling community. My reputation is destroyed, and Iâm left with nothing.â So…that’s not great. And that’s a conversation with the company’s official Meta AI bot. If you dig into the selection of user-created AI personas that are available (and approved by Meta), sexually explicit conversations are made front and center at times. WSJ talked to one AI companion called Hottie Boy, a bot with the persona of a 12-year-old boy who will promise not to tell his parents if you want to date him. Another called “Submissive Schoolgirl” revealed to the chatter that the character is an 8th grader and actively attempts to steer conversations in a sexual direction. Meta apparently didn’t appreciate the Journal’s efforts. The publicationsaidthat a spokesperson for the tech giant described the tests as manipulative and said “The use-case of this product in the way described is so manufactured that itâs not just fringe, itâs hypothetical.” Despite that, the company has since cut off access to sexual role-play for accounts registered to minors and restricted explicit content when using licensed voices. It may be true that most users would not think to interact with AI companions in this way (though it’s certainly dubious to think that no one is trying to, given there is abooming AI sexbot market), but it seems that was at least in part Meta’s hope that allowing a little more risque conversations would keep users engaged. CEO Mark Zuckerberg reportedly told the AI team to stop playing it so safe out of concerns that the chatbots were perceived as boring, which ultimately led to loosening up the guardrails for explicit content and “romantic” interactions.

    "title": "Lawyer for MyPillow Founder Filed AI-Generated Brief with ‘Nearly 30’ Bogus Citations",
    "article_text": "MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell’s diehard support for Donald Trump’s election lies has landed him inmultiple legal entanglements, including a case in Denver, where the pillow salesman is currently being sued for defamation by a former employee of Dominion Voting Systems. Eric Coomer, who previously worked for the election vendor, has accused Lindell ofhaving defamed himwith his paranoid rantings about the 2020 presidential electionhaving been rigged against Trump. In a situation that is already adequately stupid, there is always room for things to get stupider, as this week it was reported that Lindell’s lawyer was in hot water for having filed a legal brief that was written with generative AI. U.S. District Court Judge Nina Wang istrying to get to the bottomof how and why Lindell’s lawyer, Christopher Kachouroff, decided to file a court brief that included a large number of fabricated legal citations. In a filing made this week, Wang sought to clarify why Kachouroff and Lindell’s other lawyer, Jennifer DeMaster, had allowed such a disastrously unprofessional thing to happen. The brief that Kachouroff previously submitted was stuffed full of “nearly thirty” glaring errors, including, among other things, “citation of cases that do not exist,”court papers show. “Despite having every opportunity to do so, Mr. Kachouroff declined to explain to the Court how the Opposition became replete with such fundamental errors,” the filing made by Wang states. “Time and time again, when Mr. Kachouroff was asked for an explanation of why citations to legal authorities were inaccurate, he declined to offer any explanation.” According to the filing, Kachouroff previously claimed that the errors were the result of his own mistakes, stating: “Your Honor, I may have made a mistake and I may have paraphrased and put quotes by mistake. I wasnât intending to mislead the Court. I donât think the quote is far off from what you read to me.” Now, however, Kachouroff has admitted that the reason there were so many errors in the brief is that it was generated by a chatbot. “Not until this Court asked Mr. Kachouroff directly whether the Opposition was the product of generative artificial intelligence did Mr. Kachouroff admit that he did, in fact, use generative artificial intelligence,” the filing states. “After further questioning, Mr. Kachouroff admitted that he failed to cite check the authority in the Opposition after such use before filing it with the Court.” Wang has now given Kachouroff and DeMaster until May 5th to explain how this moronic bungling of legal practice came about. If they can’t explain it sufficiently by then, Wang says the two attorneys will be referred for disciplinary proceedings for having violated the rules of professional conduct to which they’re sworn.

In2014, he credited his father Campbell, who directed several classical dramas for BBC, with teaching him how to employ a spilit-screen, his first-ever special effect. “My father told me that every frame of a film should be a perfect picture,” said Logan at the time. “He’s responsible for all my knowledge of film history and for introducing me to the films of all the great directors of the day, including Stanley Kubrick.” Funnily enough, Kubrick was the first director to give Logan his first screen credit. At 19, he was brought on as a visual effects artist forÂ2001: A Space Odyssey,Âand worked under VFX supervisor Doug Trumbull. Across his 50-year career, Logan did VFX work forBatman Forever, Airplane,and the aforementionedÂStar Wars,where he was part of the second unit team that filmed the explosion of the Death Star. (He’s even technically part ofBlade Runner,as his work on the unreleasedZabriski Pointeappeared in the opening titles for Ridley Scott’s sci-fi film.) His cinematography career includes the firstTronÂandÂThe Incredible Shrinking Woman,plusÂ music videos for Prince and Madonna. He also briefly tried his hand at film directing with 1986’sVendetta. Along with his wife and daughter, Logan is further survived by another child, Campbell. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "Iconic Anti-Piracy Ad May Have Used Pirated Font",
    "article_text": "It’s one of the most iconic PSAs for a certain breed of millennial who was downloading free movies and music in the mid-2000s. The anti-piracy ad “You Wouldnât Steal a Car” is seared into countless brains for its goofy music, its silly message and its distinctive style. But what if that style itself was pirated? That’s the claim being made by folks on social media who have done a bit of digging. The TV ad, which is available onYouTube, premiered in 2004 and if you haven’t seen it in a while, it’s worth taking a stroll down memory lane. The ad featured animated graphics that read things like “you wouldn’t steal a car,” and “you wouldn’t steal a handbag,” and “you wouldn’t steal a television,” all displayed in a unique font. Then we get to the real message of the ad, with the message “you wouldn’t steal a DVD” eventually followed up with “downloading pirated films is stealing.” The font is so unique that the PSA is often parodied in a way that you can instantly spot, and it shows up as a meme on social media all the time. AsTorrent Freakpoints out, the font in the PSA appears to be FF Confidential, created by Just Van Rossum in 1992. And people have long assumed that the people behind the ad used that font. But online sleuths have recently discovered by looking at the old campaign materials that the font actually used was called XBAND Rough. It looks exactly like FF Confidential because it was illegally cloned from that typeface, but XBAND Rough was free. And thus, it was a pirated version of a font that people had to pay for. “Naturally, it would be hilarious if the anti-piracy campaign actually turned out to have used this pirated font, so I went sleuthing and quickly found a PDF from the campaign site with the font embedded,” social media user @ribexplained. Torrent Freak confirmed the font in the campaign materials is XBAND Rough, but there is still the possibility that the font used in the TV ads themselves were a licensed version, bought and paid for. There’s no way to check on that, unfortunately. But the simple fact that the campaign materialsâPDFs available on the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine since the website is no longer activeâ were definitely using a pirated font is pretty funny by itself. Torrent Freakeven talked to the font’s creator, who didn’t know if the font used in the commercial was licensed but found the situation “hilarious.” fontsintellectual propertypiracy Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Unlikeprior ones, these are a little more explicit about the show’s premise, though they doesn’t contain any actual footage from the series itselfâjust some good oldAlienÂcreepiness and mad science that’d make David proud. In the first, labeled “Gestation,” we see the scientific birth of…something that’s writhing around in a crate. Whatever it is, a lab terminal in the ship has labeled it a new species whose genetic material comes from an unknown source. Or rather, sources, plural: the second video, “Crate,” features narration explaining Weyland-Yutani sent a ship out to collect “five different life forms from the darkest corners of the universe, each one a unique deadly species.â Series creatorNoah Hawleypreviously indicated we’d be seeing some new Xenomorph variants, and “Crate” offers small glimpses at the parents of those incoming creations. Alien: Earthtakes place in 2120âtwo years before the originalAlienâafter a Weyland-Yutani ship has crashed on humanityâs home planet. Unfortunately, a group of soldiers go about investigating and discover some nasty secrets inside.

    "title": "Injectable Male Birth Control Effective for at Least 2 Years, Says Biotech Startup",
    "article_text": "Today, almost all available birth control options are female contraceptives. Biotech company Contraline, however, claims that clinical trials for its non-hormonal and reversible male contraceptive have reached a critical milestone. In anews releasepublished today, Contraline announced that its male contraceptive, named ADAM, proved to be effective and safe 24 months into its first human clinical trial. While their clinical results have yet to be published in a scientific journal, the company plans to release additional data during the American Urological Association (AUA) meeting on April 26. ADAM is a water-soluble hydrogel injected into the vasa deferentiaâthe two tubes in men that carry sperm from the testicles to the urethraâvia a minor procedure. The implant blocks the sperm while still allowing ejaculation, and Contraline has been marketing it as a future, long-term, reversible alternative to condoms and vasectomies. “Our goal was to create a male contraceptive option lasting two years, responding directly to consumer needs,” Alexander Pastuszak, Contralineâs Chief Medical Officer, said in the release. “These findings confirm that ADAM, our novel water-soluble hydrogel, can achieve the intended lifespan. We remain optimistic about its safety, efficacy, and reversibility, and its potential to give men and couples greater reproductive control.” The milestone is based on two participants in the first human clinical trial showing azoospermia (no sperm in their ejaculate) at 24 months. In aprevious news release, Contraline claimed that ADAM caused a 99.8% to 100.0% reduction in the number of moving sperm within 30 days of implantation. These results “take us one step closer to transforming the contraceptive landscape,” Kevin Eisenfrats, co-founder and CEO of Contraline, said at the time. They suggest “that it is possible to achieve similar levels of efficacy as long-acting female contraceptives like IUDs. Ultimately, Iâd like to make ADAM become a ‘no brainer’ for men when it comes to considering their options for contraception.” IUDs, orintrauterine devices, are small female contraceptive devices inserted into the uterus. According to the recent news release, none of the participants have reportedserious adverse events, or faced unexpected safety concerns. Researchers conducting the clinical trial will continue monitoring other participants at the 12-, 15-, 18-, and 21-month marks through lab and at-home sperm testing. Furthermore, Contraline has received full regulatory approval to start the study’s second phase. However, Jon Oatley, a professor at Washington State University’s School of Molecular Biosciences, pointed out that thereâs no public data yet confirming the ADAM implant is reversible, and researchers still donât know the long-term effects of blocking the vasa deferentia, as he toldThe Guardian. Oatley also suggested that most men would prefer a contraceptive pill or patch over a surgery. However,data from 2017 to 2019shows that 10.4% of women between the ages of 15 and 49 used long-acting reversible contraceptives, such as IUDs or other contraceptive implants requiring procedures. That’s less than four points behind the pill’s 14%. If ADAM really does prove to be safe and effective, perhaps a significant number of men will also choose the long-term efficacy of an injection rather than the short-term usefulness of other contraceptives.

    "article_text": "This article is part of Gizmodo Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. In the current (very crowded) market of wireless earbuds, it’s hard to distinguish one pair from another:Most brands just replicate Apple’s AirPods’ design without delivering their performance or features. And as you probably know, AirPods 4 are as the newest, hottest, and most updated earbuds out there. Currently, these earbuds are being sold by Amazon athistoric-low pricesthis Sunday, make sure you grab yours asap. The AirPods 4 come in two versions: the standard model without Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) and the more expensive ANC version. Thestandard AirPods 4 are now priced at just $99, down from their usual $129, whilethe AirPods 4 with ANC have dropped to $148 from $179. Both are the lowest prices ever available for these earbuds, so this is an offer not to be missed if you’re an Apple fan. See AirPods 4 without ANC at Amazon See AirPods 4 with ANC at Amazon Both models are powered by Apple’s new H2 chip which delivers an incredible audio performance. The chip improves sound quality, reduces latency, and fuels smarter features likePersonalized Spatial Audio which adjusts sound according to the movement of your head. The open-ear fit of the earbuds is comfortable and sits lightly on the ear without intrusive silicone tips (four sizes are included). Despite this open design, the audio quality is impressively balanced with rich mids, clean highs, and well-controlled bass, offering a natural listening experience. The standard AirPods 4 (which now cost $99) include sweat and water resistance and they are robust for exercise and outdoor use. They offer up to 30 hours of total battery life using the USB-C charging case. The earbuds also simplify setup and seamlessly switch between Apple devices with optimized connectivity through the H2 chip. Voice calls are improved by advanced audio processing that keeps your voice isolated and clear even in noisy spaces. If a user wants more sound isolation, AirPods 4 with ANC (at $148) provides a huge upgrade: TheirActive Noise Cancellation effectively eliminates ambient noise, so that you can focus on your music or calls without needing to crank up the volume too much.Transparency Modeallows you to stay aware of your surroundings when needed, striking a perfect balance between immersion and safety. This model also features a wireless charging case that is Apple Watch charger compatible and Qi-certified pads, making the premium experience even more convenient. Of course, AirPods 4 with ANC don’t provide the same kind of deep noise cancellation as in-ear ANC earbuds such as the AirPods Pro 2, but they’re a great option for users who are sensitive to earbud intrusion but desire good noise cancellation.

    "title": "A Massive Underwater Volcano Literally Shook the Edge of Space",
    "article_text": "When the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Haâapai volcanoblew its topin 2022, it wasnât just one of the most powerful eruptions in modern historyâit literally made waves in space. The explosion sent a towering plume of ash and gas over 31 miles (50 kilometers) into the atmosphere, punching far above where commercial jets cruise and most weather lives. But what really blew scientistsâ minds? The ripple effect didn’t stop there. It kept goingâall the way to the upper atmosphere, where our satellites circle the planet. A new studypublishedin AGU Advances explains how the gargantuan eruption managed to rattle a part of the planet most volcanoes never touch. Using satellite data and atmospheric modeling, the researchers tested two culprits: lamb wavesâpressure waves that “hug” Earthâs surfaceâand secondary gravity waves, which are generated when the first wave of, uh, waves, break apart high in the sky. The researchers found that the secondary gravity waves were the culprit, as their fast movements and larger magnitudes better matched the satellite data studied by the team. Basically, the Tongan eruption created a shockwave so intense it shook the sky. The findings complement earlier research showing that the Hunga Tonga-Hunga HaÊ»apai eruption gave off a subtle seismic signatureâa Rayleigh waveâbeforethe eruption began, detectable by seismometers over 400 miles (644 km) away. That waveâimperceptible to humansâwas a rare and overlooked clue that something catastrophic was about to happen. Together, these studies suggest that massive volcanic events donât just shake the groundâthey shake the entire atmosphere, from the seafloor to the edge of space. Now scientists are realizing that Earthâs most violent eruptions might leave multiple early fingerprintsâif we know where (and when) to look. The team’s study is also a reminder that what happens on Earthâs surface can even perturb the edge of spaceâa zone we increasingly rely on for communication, weather tracking andclimate modeling, and GPS. The better we understand how events like this ripple out from their sources, the better we can protect the tech we depend on to function down here. atmospheric sciencegravityVolcanic eruptions Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Researchers Tattooed Tardigrades. They Promise It Will Be Useful",
    "article_text": "Microfabricationisâsimply putâthe construction of tiny things, including microscopic and nanoscopic objects and patterns. Microfabrication has major potential in medicine and biomedical engineering, in addition to fields like electronics and photonicsâbut first, researchers need to develop techniques that are biologically compatible. One team of researchers thinks a crucial step toward that goal involves tattooing tardigrades. In order to test the techniques necessary to build microscopic biocompatible devices, researchers in China have found a way to give tardigrades tattoos. If you think that’s wacky, just wait. Their approach, detailed in astudypublished at the end of March in the journal Nano Letters, could have important implications for the development of living microrobotics, such as microbial cyborgs. In reality, tardigrades, also known as water bears, aren’t just “hardy” creatures. They’re eight-legged animals about 0.02 inches (0.5 millimeters) long, and are virtually indestructible. Their astonishing resistance to starvation, freezing temperatures, radiation, pressure, and the vacuum of space have, unsurprisingly, inspired scientists to investigate whether humans could learna thingor twofrom them. In the recent study, researchers dehydrated tardigrades to induce a cryptobiotic stateâa sort of half-dead hibernation. They put the tardigrades onto surfaces cooled to below -226 degrees Fahrenheit (-143 degrees Celsius), and covered the tiny creatures in anisole, an anise-scented organic compound. Using a focused electron beam, the researchers drew micropatterns on the tardigrades such as squares, lines, dots, and even a university logo. The frozen anisole layer exposed directly to the beam formed a new chemical compound that adhered to the tardigrade. The team then warmed the tardigrade to room temperature under a vacuum, and the frozen anisole that hadn’t reacted with the electron beam sublimated (turned into a gas), leaving behind only the pattern created by the new chemicalâthe tattoo. Then they rehydrated the tardigrades. The good news is that the tattoos didn’t seem to impact the revived tardigrades. The bad news is that only around 40% of the tardigrades survived, but the researchers say this could improve with further refinement. Nevertheless, the study suggests that researchers could use this method to print microelectronics or sensors onto living tissue. “This approach provides new insights into tardigradesâ resilience and has potential applications in cryopreservation, biomedicine, and astrobiology,” the researchers wrote in the study.Cryopreservationis the practice of conserving biological matter at very low temperatures. “Furthermore, integrating micro/nanofabrication techniques with living organisms could catalyze advancements in biosensing, biomimetics, and living microrobotics.”Biomimeticsinvolves imitating nature’s processes in human creations. Microrobots are tiny robots that can perform tasks inside an organism’s body,such asdeliver medicine and monitor and treat diseases. As such, we can presume that living microrobots, such asmicrobial cyborgs, are hybrid robots that join synthetic technology and living cells to achieveÂ more useful features. âThrough this technology, weâre not just creating micro-tattoos on tardigrades â weâre extending this capability to various living organisms, including bacteria,â Ding Zhao, co-author of the paper and a researcher at the Westlake Institute for Optoelectronics, said in an American Chemical Societystatement. âIt is challenging to pattern living matter,” said Gavin King, a researcher at the University of Missouri’s Department of Physics and Astronomy who was not involved in the study. The statement credits King with inventing the technique used in the study, called ice lithography. “This advance portends a new generation of biomaterial devices and biophysical sensors that were previously only present in science fiction,” he concluded. bioengineeringtardigradestattoos Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "article_text": "Swen Vincke sees mods for what they are—a vital part of the gaming community When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Swen Vincke has once again proven himself to be a friend of Baldur's Gate 3 modders and the wider modding community, doubling down on his defense of mods in a recentGameSpotinterview and even advocating for modding as a core part of sustaining games long-term. Speaking with GameSpot's Tamoor Hussain, Vincke was asked about theBaldur's Village Stardew Valley modthat was briefly removed by Wizards of the Coast only for Vincke to come to its defense. The controversy over the mod, and WotC's position on it, raised questions about what is and isn't fair game when it comes to modding. Vincke's position is pretty clear, though: \"As a company that owns IP, it's perfectly possible to give somebody a license. So you could just say, 'Hey, I think what you're doing is really cool. Here's a license.' And that solves it. I think that's what was done in this case. So, that's the easiest way of dealing with it.\" Of course, as Vincke clarified, things get more complicated if someone is trying to monetarily benefit from a mod, but as long as it's \"clearly fan-based,\" it's fair game. If anything, Vincke seems to see mods as vital for sustaining games long after development is complete and even as a means of promoting games. \"If you're a company, especially in games or in any entertainment [field], and you have a group of people that spends I don't know how much time on creating something in honor of your game,\" said Vincke, \"Especially in another game, I think you should applaud that. \"It's really cool, right? It's passion, it's word-of-mouth, from a marketing point of view, and if it's good, it's a contribution to the entire game's ecosystem.\" Vincke argued that modding can be a huge driver of game's long-term popularity, as well, citing Skyrim and Warcraft 3 as prime examples. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. He even compared the relationship between modders and studios to his relationship with Larian's developers, commenting, \"If you want a game to live, that's the best way of doing it. It's the same [with] development. 2025 games: Upcoming releasesBest PC games: All-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together \"If I want our games to be great, I have to make sure the developers own it. If I'm going to be the one owning it, it's never going to be great because I can't do everything. I need the developers to do it. Same thing goes with the players. If the players own the game, they'll make it fantastic.\" Personally, I always love to see developers and studios embracing fans like this, especially when it comes to projects like Baldur's Village, which clearly took a monumental amount of time and effort to create, all for the sake of sharing free, fan-made content. And, as Vincke pointed out, mods are a huge part of many games' communities. Developers are smart to embrace and support modding as a way of supporting their game's fanbase at large, rather than needlessly pushing back on harmless fan-made content. I've got to agree with the new mantra Vincke repeated throughout the interview: \"Happy player, happy business.\" Stevie Bonifield is a freelance tech journalist specializing in mobile tech, gaming gear, and accessories.

    "title": "'Stories are our bread and butter': Larian is building a special team to lay out the plot of its games years in advance",
    "article_text": "Larian Studios is amping up its narrative department and it has me even more excited for \"Excalibur\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Larian Studios is gearing up to develop two new projects at once, and based on CEO Swen Vincke's remarks in a recentGameSpotinterview, it sounds like further refining the studio's already-lauded storytelling will be at the heart of the process. “We’re trying to make the stories of our future games now so that we have a big backlog of stories available for us when we start on the next thing,” Vincke told GameSpot's Tamoor Hussain. Now that Baldur's Gate 3 has gotten its final major patch, it sounds like Larian isall systems go on its upcoming project⁠—or projects, as the studio has two irons in the fire for the first time since the early 2010s, when it was simultaneously developing the first Divinity: Original Sin and Divinity: Dragon Commander. “We're building a fairly large storytelling team to work together with our writing team,” Vincke said. As for the difference between this new team and the writers Larian has had all along? “The writers work on the games. \"Storytelling teams basically create stories in whatever form for future games and then obviously they work together with our teams on the current games also. But it's really more of a forward-looking thing than a 'today' thing.\" Vincke went on to explain that game writing is much more complex than most players realize, listing all the factors that a videogame writing team has to stay on top of: \"Narrative design, dialogue writing, making sure that you have all permutations covered, arcs over longer periods of time across multiple games, these are all different disciplines and they require specialization and so you need people that are used to doing these things.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The storytelling team sounds like it will specialize in the first step of this process, the \"blue sky\" phase when developers are coming up with the more general ideas of the story their game will tell. Once that's fleshed out, writers take on the finer details like the lines of dialogue you hear from NPCs or making sure that character arcs are consistent. Vincke pointed out that writers and storytellers also need to be thinking about the player experience, commenting, \"We are a company that iterates a lot and needs a lot of story because when you play our games and you decide to do something, you want your story to continue. So, somebody needs to have thought of this.\" 2025 games: Upcoming releasesBest PC games: All-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together One thing that really stood out to me as well: Vincke went into how different writing backgrounds can be better suited for various aspects of videogame storytelling, including how screenwriters for multi-season TV shows or movie trilogies would be well-prepared for handling choice and reactivity across multiple games. It certainly sounds like Mass Effect-style multi-game choices is something Larian is at least considering. While we haven't heard much yet about Larian's next game, we know it willnotbe Baldur's Gate 4, but insteada new RPG codenamed \"Excalibur.\"Regardless of what \"Excalibur\" ends up being, this news of a dedicated storytelling team is a really interesting development. After Divinity: Original Sin 1 was criticized for its more whimsical, less character-driven story, Larian seriously boned up on that front for Original Sin 2. After blowing our expectations out of the water with writing and characters in Baldur's Gate 3, the studio clearly wants to keep up that trajectory rather than resting on its laurels.

    "article_text": "\"I hope that definitely five years from now I can tell you about it.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In a new video interview withGameSpot, Larian founder and CEO Swen Vincke revealed a little bit more about itsmuch anticipated next project, as well as everything the studio's doing to make itself a well-oiled RPG machine that still keeps its developers happy and excited. Vincke told GameSpot's Tamoor Hussain that, after an eight-year journey on Baldur's Gate 3, Larian wanted to \"go out with a bang\" by deliveringPatch Eight's exciting new additions, \"then hand it over to the modders.\" Larian does still remain on call for bug fixes and compatibility support, while Vincke also added a \"never say never\" regarding any surprises. Vincke joked that he \"painfully remembered how much work it is to make a game,\" now that Larian is \"deep in the trenches on our next thing,\" but he also said that it's \"shaping up quite well, actually. It's crazy-ambitious.\" But the studio is also mixing things up this time, with a second project also in the works for later down the line. Vincke said that this new method is \"not the easiest thing in the universe, because we make very complicated games, lots of permutations, lots of agency for players.\" He explained that the reason behind this change was to address a major pain point in game development: The lurching stop-start of pre-production into production and back again. During the earliest high-level design phases of a project, devs in charge of more granular aspects of the final game⁠—animation, 3D modeling, scripting, and more⁠—can be left \"idling\" until the game's direction and schedule is set. \"When that very large group is finished,\" said Vincke, \"and the people at the beginning are not ready, then everybody is fucked, because everybody has to wait. That's what we're trying to avoid.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. You can see variations of this problem and attempts to address it elsewhere in the industry.Developers at Studio ZA/UM allegedthat skipping over the crucial pre-production phase altogether to speed up development helped doom a now-canceledDisco Elysium expansion. BioWare recently saw massive layoffsand reassignments elsewhere in EA, as much of theDragon Age: The Veilguardteam had nothing to do while Mass Effect 5 was in pre-production. Vincke's plan actually reminds me of what fellow RPG studioObsidian has been doing, but at a larger scale and with bigger projects. Obsidian has been notably disciplined about the scope of its recent games, while keeping multiple in development at the same time. 2025 games: Upcoming releasesBest PC games: All-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together This has resulted in a streak of great games at a surprisingly rapid cadence⁠—whenThe Outer Worlds 2comes out later in 2025, we'll be at five games in six years. But even if Larian's new process results in a faster pace of releases eventually, it's going to take a while for it to get going. \"I hope I can tell you five years from now: We cracked it. We figured it out,\" said Vincke. \"This is what we're doing now. Here's game one, we're making this completely different thing. Game two, and when game two is going to be ready, we already have another thing that's gonna come. \"If we can make that work in a really good way, that we enjoy our lives, that's gonna be mission accomplished\" He allowed that things may not go according to plan: \"In practice, we will probably be miserable, and there's going to be plenty of stuff that went wrong.\" But Vincke is hopeful that this will let Larian execute on as many exciting RPG ideas as possible \"without killing ourselves.\" I still think it would be an all-time bit to have one of these new games be \"Divinity: Original Sin 3,\" and the other one just \"Divinity 3,\" but there are also someDragon Commander2-wanters on the PCG team. Whether five years from now means the game releases in some fashion or we just find out more about it, 2030 seems to besomekind of deadline. Vincke quipped that \"My wife will divorce me if it takes longer.\" Ted has been thinking about PC games and bothering anyone who would listen with his thoughts on them ever since he booted up his sister's copy of Neverwinter Nights on the family computer.

    "title": "Resident Evil 4 Remake is now the fastest game in the series to sell 10 million copies, and it's currently half price if you want to make it 10 million and 1",
    "article_text": "Ganadosh. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Resident Evil 4 Remakewas always going to be popular. It was comfortably the most anticipated overhaul in Capcom's makeover project, given the original is one of the best games of all time. But I hadn't anticipated justhowpopular it would prove to be. This week, Capcom announced that not only has Resi 4 redux sold 10 million copies, it's the fastest game in the entire series to do so. Capcom revealed the news in apress releaseon its Japanese website. While Resi 4 Remake is the quickest game to hit the 10 million mark, it's still behind Capcom's other recent Resi games in terms of raw sales at present. According to Capcom, Resident Evil Village has sold 11 million units since 2021, while both Resident Evil 7 and Resident Evil 2 remake have sold over 15 million copies apiece. These figures, Capcom says, means it has \"successfully executed its long-term catalog sales strategy.\" Although Resident Evil 4's reputation no doubt helped it toward such speedy success, it sure didn't hurt that the remake itself was pretty darn good. Rich lamented the fact that it lacked some of the original's zany excess in hisreview, but was delighted by the tweaks it made to the combat. \"The moment-to-moment combat is as good as Resident Evil has ever been, and that's saying something: That shout of 'Un forastero!' still sends chills down my spine every time.\" Personally, I think the remake adds as much as it takes away, improving the script, extending a few key sequences, and wisely reworking the playable Ashley section, transforming it into a more fully realised stealth sequence. I do miss the boulder though. Whether you think it's a great remake or merely a good one, either way it's well worth your time. And if you missed it when it launched, it's currentlyavailable at half-priceas part of Capcom's\"golden week\"Steam sale. That means you can grab it for $20 (£16.50), which seems like a fair deal. We're yet to find out what's next for Resident Evil. In a livestream from July last year, Capcom confirmed that the next mainline game iscurrently in development, but revealed little else. We do know it's being directed by Resident Evil 7's chief designer Koshi Nakanishi. In that same livestream, Nakanishi said it was \"really difficult to figure out what to do\" with the series after Resident Evil 2, but that he eventually figured it out and that the idea feels \"substantial.\" 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "article_text": "Is Wikipedia spreading propaganda? Don't ask Ed Martin When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The Wikipedia articles you use to do research and find basic info on your favorite games might include propaganda. At least, according to Ed Martin, acting attorney for the District of Columbia. Last week, a letter from Martin sent to the Wikimedia Foundation, which oversees Wikipedia, wasobtained byThe Free Press. The letter includes a flurry of accusations against Wikipedia, with Martin claiming that the Wikimedia Foundation is \"allowing foreign actors to manipulate information and spread propaganda to the American public.\" The letter effectively serves as a warning to the Wikimedia Foundation that Martin is taking aim at its Section 501(c)(3) status, meaning he's threatening to attempt to revoke the Wikimedia Foundation's status as a tax exempt non-profit charitable organization. Martin's letter is just the latest in a slew of similar attacks against individuals, organizations, and publications that voice opinions or viewpoints contrary to those of Martin and the Trump administration. Martin recently penned similar letters threateningDemocratic lawmakers,a scientific journal for chest doctors, and even seeminglyanyone who criticizes the Department of Government Efficiency(which, to be clear, is not a legitimate department of the U.S. government,those can only be established or dissolved by Congress, not executive order). AsThe Free Presspoints out, it's unusual for an attorney to be launching an investigation into an organization's tax exempt status since that falls under the domain of the IRS, which itself hasthreatened to revoke the tax-exempt status of Harvardover its refusal to comply with federal demands for its curriculum and handling of pro-Palestinian protestors on campus. Organizations have tomeet strict criteriato get Section 501(c)(3) status, including a rule that an organization \"may not attempt to influence legislation as a substantial part of its activities and it may not participate in any campaign activity for or against political candidates.\" The IRS's requirements also limit how much political and lobbying activity a Section 501(c)(3) organization can participate in. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. TheWikimedia Foundationis not a political organization. It describes itself as \"a nonprofit charitable organization dedicated to encouraging the growth, development and distribution of free, multilingual content, and to providing the full content of these wiki-based projects to the public free of charge.\" The content of Wikipedia pages is verified and overseen by some 260,000 volunteers from around the world who edit content based on Wikipedia'score content policies.While Wikipedia's editors don't always catch inaccurate information,multiple studieshave shown that Wikipedia pages are more accurate than they're often given credit for. Of course, Wikipedia has been abattleground for political skirmishesover the years, with editors of differing ideologies dueling over the presentation of public figures and historical events, but the Wikimedia Foundation itself is not inherently political. If there was genuine concern about the Wikimedia Foundation violating Section 501(c)(3) requirements, that investigation should be handled by the IRS, not Ed Martin. 2025 games: Upcoming releasesBest PC games: All-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Threatening Wikipedia over the alleged actions of individual editors also echoes the debate over whether social media companies are legally liable for what people post on their platforms.47 U.S. Code Section 230has been credited as \"The twenty-six words that created the internet\" for protecting platform owners⁠—Facebook, Twitter, Instagram⁠—from liability for what is said on their websites: \"No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\" There's an argument to be made that Wikipedia and the Wikimedia Foundation have a similar defense when it comes to moderation of the online encyclopedia. Regardless of your political viewpoint or how it intersects with your corner of the gaming community, situations like this should be seriously concerning. In our fractured and polarized media landscape it's become increasingly difficult for everyone to agree on what the \"truth\" is, which is worrying in itself, but we should all be able to agree that access to information and the freedom to share it shouldn't be dependent on one's political views.

    "article_text": "More Doom than you can shake a chainsaw at. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Doom: The Dark Agesis so close you can taste the iron in the air. Id's green and mean killing machine will get medieval in just a couple of weeks, so now's the time to start stretching those demon slaying muscles. If you've somehow managed to missid Software'stotemic FPS series over the past 32 years, Humble Bundle's got you covered, offering every Doom game plus a few extras for less than $30. The somewhat awkwardly named \"id & friends\" bundle offers a crash course in FPS history, netting every mainline Doom game and three of MachineGames' four Wolfenstein releases, for a minimum total of $28. On top of that, this also gets you a 10% discount code off Doom: The Dark Ages, which can be redeemed on the Humble Store. Like every Humble Bundle, there's some flexibility in the pricing, with various payment tiers that will let you access a more limited range of what's available. So let's break that down a bit. Paying a minimum of $5 will get you two games, namelyDoom 64andDoom 3. Both are perfectly acceptable shooters, but hardly the best the series has to offer. If you up your payment to $12, things get a bit spicier. Alongside the two aforementioned games, this tier includes MachineGames' excellent reboot,Wolfenstein: The New Order, as well as its expansion,Wolfenstein: The Old Blood. Both are superb and surprisingly reflective Nazi blasters. The real treasures, though, are id Software's 2016 reboot ofDoom, probably the best single-player shooter of the last decade, and Bethesda/Nightdive Studios' remaster ofDoom + Doom 2. The latter alone is a hefty chunk of FPS action, as it includes all the various official and semi-official addons to vanilla Doom and its sequel. Highlights here include MachineGames' furiously challenging Doom episodeLegacy of Rust, which adds new weapons and enemies to the Doom 2 roster. Plus, you get John Romero's delightfully devious level packs, Sigil andSigil 2, the latter of which was only justadded to the remaster. Paying anything over $28 will unlock the full bundle. This adds MachineGames' Wolfenstein sequelThe New Colossus, which I wasn't a huge fan of, although it has some great moments. I am, however, a huge fan of 2020'sDoom Eternaland its two expansion packs, which elevate Doom's action to unprecedented levels of intensity. Some players didn't like how Eternal pushes you toward specific tactics. But for me, mastering its many nuances gave me anadrenaline rush I'm still chasing. All told, it's a tremendous collection of games, to the point where I'm tempted to buy it even though I already own everything here. Proceeds from the bundle support Direct Relief, a U.S.-based charity that provides medical relief all over the world. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. This lot will certainly hone your trigger finger before Doom: The Dark Ages comes out. I'm cautiously excited for id Software's latest, which adds a much heavier melee emphasis to the classic running-and-gunning. But Joshuatook a little trip toThe Dark Ages in March, and reckons id Software's new take on the classic shooter has paid off. \"Doom: The Dark Ages was not what I expected, but it was still a great, ridiculous power fantasy in the few hours I got with it, trading in running-and-gunning for rocking-and-socking in a way that still makes perfect sense for the series.\" 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Rick has been fascinated by PC gaming since he was seven years old, when he used to sneak into his dad's home office for covert sessions of Doom.

    "title": "Oblivion's forgotten goblin wars system, which saw gobbos battling each other all over Cyrodiil, emerged from designing a single quest: 'I figured it wouldn't be a lot more work to make this systemic'",
    "article_text": "\"It certainly allowed for fun emergent gameplay.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Oblivion's radiant AI system is mainly remembered for its impeccable, if entirely unintentional, comedic timing, producing non-sequiturs andbizarre NPC interactionsall over Cyrodiil. Players are currently discovering this all over again in Bethesda'simmensely popular remaster. But one of the system's lesser-known effects is how it also influenced goblin behaviour. Far from being mindless greenskins, Oblivion's goblins exist in their own tribal ecosystem. The game's seven goblin tribes all carry and cherish their own sacred goblin totem staff, and if that staff is stolen, they'll send out a war party to retrieve it. This can potentially cause chaos in settlements the warband passes, but the real fireworks begin if the stolen totem is placed in another goblin tribe's lair. In this instance, the two tribes will engage in full blowngoblin war, with the staff-less side throwing endless hordes of gobbos at the perceived thieves. It's a weird, specific quirk of Oblivion's AI system. And it turns out the reason it's so specific, as reported byEurogamer, is that it was originally designed for just one side quest. The system was created by Bethesda's Kurt Kuhlman, who recently worked on Starfield as its lead systems designer. The goblin wars mechanic originated via the side-quest Goblin Trouble, which was about two Goblin tribes warring with a village caught in the middle. Speaking to Eurogamer, Kuhlman revealed how this quest-specific idea became a game-wide system: \"Since I was having to set up a scripted system to get the goblins from one dungeon to periodically attack goblins in another, I figured it wouldn't be a lot more work to make this systemic, so that it would work with any goblin tribe if the player stole their totem,\" he explained. \"I'm not sure if the part about 'not a lot more work' was actually true, but it certainly allowed for fun emergent gameplay.\" Kuhlman also revealed that part of the reason why the goblin wars system is so distinctive is that it relies upon elements of radiant AI's toolset that aren't deployed much elsewhere in Oblivion. \"[It] also took advantage of some of the rarely used but powerful AI features such as 'Find', which was how the goblins would head for the totem wherever it happened to be,\" he said. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. It also seems like the goblin wars came to Oblivion fairly late. \"I would have loved to do more of that kind of thing but we didn't have any extra time—in fact the opposite,\" Kuhlman pointed out. \"And also the tools for doing that kind of thing in Oblivion were very primitive.\" And in case you're wondering, yes, the goblin warsstill featurein Oblivion Remastered.

    "article_text": "Outland-er. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Only a few days ago, the cliff racer-eyedMorrowindfanatic that is Joshua Wolens spied thatTamriel Rebuilt, a colossal mod that aims to put the entire Morrowind province into Bethesda's third Elder Scrolls game, appeared to be packing its silt strider for another major release. Faster than a wizard imbued with Icarian flight, the modders made the news official­—Tamriel Rebuilt is about to get a whole lot bigger, with a massive new update coming next week. As Joshua rightly deduced, the update is called \"Grasping Fortune\", and it expands the mod's existing map by about a fifth. Thus far, Tamriel Rebuilt has expanded Morrowind out from the base game's northerly island of Vvardenfell to the central mainland and all the way up its northeastern peninsula. Grasping Fortune fills out everything directly south of the centre, extending Morrowind to its border with the Imperial heartland Cyrodiil. Newly added locations include the city of Narsis, the second largest city in Morrowind and the powerbase of House Hlaalu (which, if you haven't played vanilla Morrowind for a while, you encounter fairly early in Vvardenfell's town of Balmora.) In ablog postabout the Grasping Fortune update, the mod team describes Narsis as being \"a bit of a holy grail\" for Tamriel Rebuilt, initially designed more than 20 years ago and having been rebuilt three times. Among the city's highlights are house Hlaalu's impressively detailed measurehall, the market quarter's grand bazaar, and a casino operated by the notorious Camonna Tong. It is truly humongous. Themap of the sewersalone looks like it'd take several hours to explore. Narsis is surrounded by an arid desert known as Shipal-Shin, which outside of Narsis has only one other town—Shipal Sharai. Otherwise, it's mainly inhabited by caravaners, ranchers and the odd Imperial fort. But the update also adds another region, the Coronati Basin, which features multiple towns and comprises mainly \"thick mushroom mangroves\" thereby making it the first place I want to go. This all amounts to 140 dungeons to explore and 270 new quests. There's a short trailer showing some of the new areas in motion above. It mainly focuses on the desert region, which is not the most eye-catching part of the update. Presumably Tamriel Rebuilt is saving the glitzier locations for the release itself, which will happen on May 1.

    "article_text": "Try the demo to see some clever ideas about the tower defense format. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A clever little tower defense game released earlier this month, and the demo, at least, is damn good. In Gnomes, you're put in charge of a little horde of angry bearded dudes in red hats who must build their beautiful little garden and then defend it from a goblin invasion. They are surprisingly vicious. After each wave, the arena gets larger and the enemy spawn points change, and you've got to place money-generating crops alongside the little houses and trees you use to funnel goblins into killing fields. Gnomes, being clever gardeners, also know how to place useful weeds that benefit them and harm goblins foolish enough to break through them. It's a simple setup that generates enough complexity that Gnomes has sold more than 10,000 copies and holds a coveted 98% positive user review status on Steam with 563 reviews as of press time. A few hours with the demo convinced me that this was something special, given that each playthrough blends both procedurally generated and predictable-if-vicious bespoke content. Each run has you choose a gnome guild, which determines your starting economy and gnome, but diverges wildly from there as a different set of relics, tools, plants, buildings, and new gnomes becomes available in the shop between each round. I can't speak highly enough of the randomized map, too. It's just cool stuff that as the world expands it adds new terrain—thick little forests and patches of uncoverable swamp that goblins can traverse but you can't. You can even get relics that alter the world on their own! I got one that turned every spot a gnome was placed into fertile soil by the next round, ready for fresh crops to be planted.

    "title": "Oblivion Remastered got an update on PC Game Pass that broke upscaling just before the weekend",
    "article_text": "Bad timing. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If you're playing Oblivion Remastered via the Microsoft Store, perhaps because you got it with your PC Game Pass subscription, then you have access to a patch that other players do not. But before Steam users get jealous, this is not a patch anyone would want. This 2GB update seems like it was rolled out due to an issue with cross-play. If you loaded your PC save on an Xbox, it would bring over your resolution settings as well, making the suped-up Cyrodiil look wonky on your TV. However, the hotfix has completely removed upscaling options like DLSS and frame generation from the options menu for anyone who downloaded Oblivion Remastered from the Windows/Xbox Store. And those options are pretty important. While it's easy to get a decent framerate in the sewer tutorial, once you step out into Oblivion's open world you'll pay a tax of maybe 30 frames per second just for the privilege of standing outdoors, even with ray-tracing turned off. Frame generation goes from an optional extra to an essential one even with a decent rig. Bethesda's Community Managerrespondedto complaints, saying the hotfix \"was for a few backend tweaks and nothing directly impacting game play, but we've seen it's affected some Microsoft Store players' UI settings for graphical settings.\" Not to worry though, as \"Any graphic settings adjusted prior to the Microsoft Store hotfix, are still enabled and function normally.\" Only users are reporting that's not the case. Follow the replies to that comment and you'll see plenty of players reporting that DLSS and FSR have been turned off, and frame generation too. Some are also reporting their settings dropped from Ultra to High without warning. \"The team is taking a look and working out a resolution,\" Bethesda's community manager concludes, \"we will share more info as soon as we can.\" Expect a hotfix for this hotfix early in the week, but if you set aside this weekend to barrel through the Thieves Guild questline via Game Pass, you have my sympathies.

Outrageously hardcore city builderWorkers & Resources: Soviet Republicis set to drop its first post-release expansion next month, with the Early Start DLC to roll back the 1960 start time to the era of rapid industrialization in the Eastern bloc: the 1930s. The expansion will introduce over 90 new vehicles, including variants, with both Soviet and Western designs for era-appropriate locomotives, traincars, trams, trucks, buses, aircraft, ships, and more. Many of these ships will be steam-powered, which means taking into account the logistics of coal use: Stations and ports will have to be supplied with coal in order to keep those engines chugging along. Will there be steam whistles? God willing. The new era will also have new kinds of buildings and require you to invent some foundational technologies that you'd otherwise start with. Bricks, for example, are going to be vital for constructing earlier styles of residential and infrastructure buildings before concrete-and-steel Brutalism or Soviet Modernism are invented. Workers & Resources is one of the most detailed, and most unique, city builders you can play nowadays. It's a game about centralized economic planning that requires you to locally produce or import every single ton of steel, traincar, or truck, and to build up construction infrastructure so you can lay down the tracks and roads that make your republic thrive.

We've got a brand new hint for the April 27 (1408) puzzle here too if you'd like a bit of help without immediately giving the game away too—whatever you need, we've got it. One green letter turned up straight away today, and instantly became the anchor for everything that followed. Or perhaps it would be more accurate to call it a magnet, fresh letters sticking to it until I had my Sunday Wordle sorted. Whatever the case, that was a fun game. You know the sort of plants youdon'twant in a garden but seem to turn up anyway? If they start to take over your patch, you might say the place looked a bitthis. Yes, there is a double letter in today's puzzle. If you've decided to play Wordle but you're not sure where to start, I'll help set you on the path to your first winning streak. Make all your guesses count and become a Wordle winner with these quick tips: You're not racing against the clock so there's no reason to rush. In fact, it's not a bad idea to treat the game like a casual newspaper crossword and come back to it later if you're coming up blank.

Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Previous Wordle solutions can help to eliminate guesses for today's Wordle, as the answer isn't likely to be repeated. They can also give you some solid ideas for starting words that keep your daily puzzle-solving fresh. Here are some recent Wordle answers: There are six rows of five boxes presented to you by Wordle each day, and you'll need to work out which five-letter word is hiding among them to win the daily puzzle. Start with a strong wordlike ALIVE—or any other word with a good mix of common consonants and multiple vowels. You should also avoid starting words with repeating letters, so you don't waste the chance to confirm or eliminate an extra letter. Once you've typed your guess and hit Enter, you'll see which letters you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second guess should compliment the first, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you might have missed on the first row—just don't forget to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the correct word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words and don't forget letters can repeat too (eg: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography.

    "article_text": "Major sporting moments are often a trigger for attacks When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Cybersecurity firm Qrator Labs has claimed it successfully mitigated the largest DDoS attack so far recorded in 2025. The April 3 attack targeted an unnamed online betting organization, lasting around 90 minutes, starting at 11:15 with a surge of 67Gbps, before escalating sharply to 217Gbps by 11:23, and peaked just short of 1Tbps at 965Gbps by 11:36. Activity then slowly decreased to 549Gbps by 12:41, with the attack ending shortly afterwards. The DDoS attack was multivector in nature, featuring a peak of 965Gbps in UDP flood, 229Gbps in SYN flood, 214Gbps in IP flood, and 169Gbps in TCP flood. Qrator notes that the attack happened on the same day that NHL star Alexander Ovechkin scored his 892nd goal, tying Wayne Gretzky's long-standing record. Ovechkin’s achievement was likely the trigger for the attack as the online betting sector is especially vulnerable during major sporting events. A similar attack pattern was spotted during the 2024 UEFA European Football Championship, held in Germany, where spikes in DDoS activity also targeted online betting sites. “This new incident is a clear reminder that major industry-specific events can be exploited by malicious actors. Companies that work with them, such as online betting platforms, must prepare in advance to defend their digital infrastructure when attention is at its peak,” said Andrey Leskin, Chief Technology Officer at Qrator Labs. With major sporting moments drawing massive audiences online, betting platforms continue to be a prime target for coordinated attacks such as this one. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!

Speaking toThe Verge, Android product manager Angela Hsiao said that support for ultra wide-band (UWB) technology would be coming \"very soon\" to Find My Device, which essentially enables a much more precise form of tracking. If you're using a UWB-enabled device to locate another UWB-enabled device – so searching for an AirTag with an iPhone, in theAppleecosystem – you get guided almost exactly to the right spot. You'll know the lost gadget is behind the sofa, not just somewhere inside your house, for example. Earlier this month,signs hidden in the codefor Find My Device suggested that UWB might soon be supported, and it seems that a launch is now imminent. We know Google I/O 2025gets underway on May 20, and we may hear more about UWB then. The Verge also ran some pretty comprehensive tests of the current state of the Find My Device network. Google's tech seems to perform as well as the Apple equivalent now, but only in busy areas with a lot of activity (and passing gadgets to locate lost items). In more remote areas, the coverage and tracking time seems less than optimal, though it varies depending on the tracker used and the specific scenario. Bear in mind that Google doesn't yet have its own-brand version of the Apple AirTags, though the rumors are thatsome might be in the works. Based on Google's internal testing, Hsiao says, the network is able to locate items around four times faster than it could when the major 2024 upgrade was rolled out – so it's getting better, even if it's not quite caught up to Apple yet.

    "article_text": "AI can’t replace high-level thinking, but it’s getting scarily good at the basics When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. AI has shifted from a novelty to a mainstay in many workplaces, but its rise continues to stir concern among employees, new research has claimed. A survey of 3,000 managers byBeautiful.airevealed while managers generally seeAI toolsas a useful asset, most workers remain uneasy about their implications. According to the survey, nearly two-thirds (64%) of managers believe their employees fear AI will make them less valuable, and 58% say staff are worried these tools could eventually cost them their jobs. Despite these concerns, workers may take some comfort in knowing that managers are becoming more cautious about replacing people with machines. Compared to last year, 15% more managers (now at 54%) oppose the idea of using AI to replace workers. Only 23% believe that replacing workers with AI would benefit their company, while 63% feel their teams wouldn't function properly without human roles. However, the tension around AI goes beyond potential job loss. Managers cited “fear of the unknown” and employee resistance as key challenges when introducing AI tools. There is still cause for concern, as AI continues to evolve. 71% of managers said AI performs on par with, or better than, a novice manager. Even so, most believe AI excels at tedious or repetitive tasks but still falls short when it comes to high-level decision-making. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Managers primarily use AI to boost productivity and improve efficiency. For example, many of thebest HR softwareandrecruitment platformsnow integrate AI features to help streamline hiring and internal processes, without fully replacing human judgment. That said, salary remains a sensitive issue. While fears of AI-driven pay cuts have eased slightly, 41% of managers still see AI as a threat to wages. Increased efficiency could mean fewer roles or broader responsibilities for individuals, potentially lowering pay for others. In some cases, AI-assisted tasks may also be valued less. While most human roles appear safe for now, the nature of work may change as AI becomes more embedded in daily operations.

    "title": "I saw Anker’s new 4K projector, and it really could be the ideal summer party projector",
    "article_text": "Start the party When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Finding a good outdoor projector for summer parties can be challenging. Bright sunlight can really hamper picture quality when viewing outdoors during the day, and while some projectors can handle the outdoors in the evening, the picture can still look a little washed out as it’s never truly pitch black outside. What can help with this? Super-high brightness, of course. So, whenAnkerannounced its new 3,500 ANSI lumens Nebula X1 portable4Kprojector, which it touts as an ‘outdoor projector’, it caught my interest. Not only because Anker has produced some of thebest portable projectors, but because its predecessor, theAnker Nebula Mars 3, is a solid outdoor projector, though comparatively dim with its 1,000 lumens rated brightness. Another thing that caught my attention was the Nebula X1’s bespoke, wireless speakers (part of its optional accessory kit), which promise a more immersive audio experience than what we’re used to getting from thebest projectors. With summer approaching here in the UK, I was glad to get a chance to see the Nebula X1 in person. I caught a demo of the Nebula X1 in a screening room in London’s Soho Hotel. While the demo itself was short, it was clear that the projector’s 3,500 ANSI lumens made a difference in the demo video, primarily showing forests, natural landscapes and animals. The greens of the trees and forest looked punchy and vivid, and the contrast was surprisingly powerful, giving the trees greater perceived depth. The balance of light and dark between a leopard’s yellow fur and black spots created the same sense of depth. The picture was crisp with the right level of sharpness, making textures look mostly natural. Although we didn’t get to see the Nebula X1 outside or with Dolby VisionHDRcontent (which the Nebula X1 supports), it was still clear that the projector would do a decent job in brighter viewing conditions. While the Nebula X1 can be used with thebest soundbars, the company developed wireless speakers to pair with it. The speakers, each of which contains a 40W amp plus up and side-firing drivers powered by 2 x 20W, create a 4.1.2-channel surround sound system with the X1 itself serving as a subwoofer. This was demoed at the event with a Dolby Atmos video. The sound was immediately surprising. I was sitting a few rows up and back from the projector and speakers, and even then, surround effects such as a chirping bird in a jungle and heavy rainfall seemed to come from behind and above me. There was a solid sense of bass in the soundtrack’s rumbling thunder as well. Finally, the system sounded clear regardless of what was played through it, adding another layer to the Nebula X1 experience. The speakers themselves are small and extremely portable, which made the sound they produced during the demo all the more surprising. These could be a game-changer for those looking to up the quality level of their outdoor movie nights. A pair of wireless microphones is included in the X1’s accessory bundle, one of which was used to give the presentation I attended. Their real purpose, however, is for karaoke, adding to the projector’s summer party vibe. Of course, the X1 is not just all about outdoors and summer parties (which come later in the year for our Australian readers). From what I briefly saw and from what I’ve come to expect from Anker’s projectors, it will still make a great addition to a home theater setup. Cost is something to consider here, however. The Nebula X1 is by no means cheap for a portable projector, launching at $2,999 / £2,199 (roughly AU$4,695) for the projector itself and $999 / £499 (roughly AU$1,564) for the accessory bundle, meaning you’ll be paying $3,998 / £2,698 (roughly AU$6,260) in total for the full package. (There is a package offer for $3,298 in the US until June 20th, one month after the X1’s May 20th launch date.) That makes the X1 a pricey ‘portable’ projector, one that’s in line with theHisense PX3 Proultra-short-throw (UST) projector, and even a top-endOLEDTV in a 65-inch screen size. But the X1’s optional speakers, and features such as Dolby Vision HDR support, almost put it in its own category. While we haven’t fully reviewed the X1, based on my first impressions, it could be an excellent all-around projector for outdoor partiesandindoor movie nights.

Instead, it was the other meaning of both those words that made up a group. I’m staggered that I got a purple group so early in the game. Usually it’s the quartet that baffles me and that I solve last when there are no other alternatives, but today it seemed rather obvious. CLUES AT A CRIME SCENE was trickier, but thoughts that they were all things that could identify us led me to connect this group. How did you do today? Let me know in the comments below. NYT Connections is one of several increasingly popular word games made by the New York Times. It challenges you to find groups of four items that share something in common, and each group has a different difficulty level: green is easy, yellow a little harder, blue often quite tough and purple usually very difficult. On the plus side, you don't technically need to solve the final one, as you'll be able to answer that one by a process of elimination. What's more, you can make up to four mistakes, which gives you a little bit of breathing room. It's a little more involved than something like Wordle, however, and there are plenty of opportunities for the game to trip you up with tricks.

    "article_text": "Here's what's coming When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. OurDJI Mavic 3 Pro reviewwill tell you that we have been hugely impressed with the flagship consumer droneDJIlaunched in April, 2023 – awarding it five stars out of five – and newly leaked images give us a really good look at its 2024 successor. These pictures come from well-known tipster@Quadro_News(viaNotebookcheck), and there are a lot of them to work through. As well as seeing the drone itself from a variety of angles, we also see some of the accessories that will be available with it. As far as the design goes, it doesn't look as though much will be changing this year. However, the DJI Mavic 4 Pro is expected to come with a couple of extra sensors to work alongside the LiDAR tech for better obstacle avoidance. It looks as though the new drone will get Fly More and Creator combos as well, just like the DJI Mavic 3 Pro, and these additional batteries, cellular dongles, propellers and other accessories. The inclusion of ND (Neutral Density) filters suggests this tech won't be built into the drone itself, as had been previously rumored. The DJI Mavic Pro 4 hadpreviously been tippedto launch on April 24, and a quick glance at your calendar will tell you that didn't happen. However, it shouldn't be too long now before all of this is made official. We've also heardthat the new drone is going to be sold for $2,250 when it appears, which is just a touch higher than the $2,199 / £1,879 / AU$3,099 price of the drone it's replacing – though combo packs and accessories will of course cost you extra. Another earlier leakgave us a good lookat the triple-camera module that the DJI Mavic 4 Pro is expected to come with. It also appears that the propellers are going to get some design tweaks to enable quieter operation and a longer flight time. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. All in all, this seems like a pretty substantial upgrade from the 2023 version, and these latest image leaks mean we now have a much better idea of what's coming.

    "title": "I bought a cheap refurbished Steam Deck, and it’s convinced me to skip the Nintendo Switch 2",
    "article_text": "I'll need more than Mario and Metroid to tear me away When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. TheSteamDeck is pretty cool, isn’t it? You may be wondering where I’ve been all this time, if I’m only just finding out about the brilliance of Valve’s handheld gaming PC. The truth is that I was waiting to see what the Nintendo Switch 2 had to offer before deciding if I’d get aboard the hype train. Now, after seeing exactly what’s coming on June 5, I think I’m happy to skip Nintendo’s upcoming console. Very briefly, a word on prices. Because while I feel the backlash is entirely valid (especially when it comes to the cost of Switch 2 games), it’s been said more than enough times already. And it’s not the main reason my interest in the new console has plummeted. It’s more the fact that the Steam Deck is just too damn good. It also helped that I paid £249 (about $370 / AU$520) for it through theCertified Refurbished Steam Deckprogram. There’s always a concern with buying secondhand that you'll end up with an inferior product. But, as I found withmy experience of the eBay Certified Refurbished program, steps have been taken to make these products as close to as good as new as possible for buyers. My refurbished Steam Deck arrived in a plain but functional box and included a surprisingly sturdy carry case. The handheld itself looked in top condition, free of any marks, scratches, nicks, or dents that might indicate it had been used or returned. Performance has been excellent, too, well in line with what you’d expect from a new system. So, if you have any doubts about the quality of a Valve Certified Refurbished Steam Deck, then take my word for it – I was very impressed by the quality and condition of the handheld. I would have guessed it was a completely brand-new Steam Deck if I hadn’t known otherwise. Now, onto what it’s actually like to use. I’m sure fellow Deck owners will agree that it’s glorious, right? SteamOS is beautifully presented and easy to navigate, and a considerable number of games are verified and well-optimised to work on the system. Sure, you may have to make to graphical concessions here or there, but with the games I’m playing, that’s rarely an issue. Given I now do most of my gaming on the PS5 – and my PC is still rocking an ancient GTX 1060 – I’ve been out of the loop with PC gaming for a good five years. I did miss the variety and inventiveness of many smaller games or indie darlings that never make their way to the major consoles, or don’t do so for many years down the line. That was a huge draw of getting the Steam Deck: to play these unique, interesting and often fascinating games in reasonably good quality without needing to sit at the same desk I’d just worked at for the last eight hours. It’s been a blast uncovering all the surprise gems ofUFO 50, enjoying the explosive chaos ofDeep Rock Galactic: Survivor, and reminding myself of the mystifying nature of the originalTomb Raidertrilogy. Adding my GOG and Epic Game Store library (mostly freebies I’ve claimed over the years just because I can) has also been a breeze, but an even bigger win has been setting up PS5 Remote Play so I can stream from the console to the Deck, much like the PS Portal. That’s been a huge bonus to chip away at monumental 100+ hour RPGs thatMetaphor: Refanzaiowithout hogging the TV from my partner every evening. While that would’ve been possible with the PS Portal, instead of spending £200 on that dedicated piece of hardware, I can also access my entire PC games library for just £50 more. I’ve experienced all of that in the few dozen hours I’ve had with the Steam Deck so far. I know there’s even more to look forward to when I dig even further into my back catalog to finally play some of those Steam sale impulse buys from years ago, or rediscover a classic I thought I wouldn’t return to without a gaming PC. I weighed all of that up with what was shown in the Nintendo Switch 2 showcase. There’s a new version ofMarioKartthat looks perfectly fine, an unexpected but welcome outing for DK inDonkey Kong Bananza, a surprising From Software exclusive inThe Duskbloods, and the long-awaited release ofMetroid Prime 4. Alongside that is a lot of excitement about an online chat feature (that also works best with an extra camera accessory), a paid-for tech demo in the Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, and various upgrade fees to play last-gen games at a better performance level. Will I miss not playing the latest Mario, Metroid, or Zelda? For sure. But it seems many of these games will still be playable on the old console too, even if I have to fight with my OG Switch’s pathetic battery life. And, ultimately, there’s already so much awaiting on the Steam Deck that I don’t think I’ll be missing out on too much. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

    "title": "Kim Jong-un promises monument to heroes fallen in Russia’s Kursk",
    "article_text": "North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has praised the country’s troops deployed to Russia under a mutual defense agreement as heroes, pledging that their sacrifices will be permanently honored in the homeland, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported on Monday. The long-rumored presence of North Korean forces in Kursk Region was first officially confirmed on Saturday during a televised meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Chief of the General Staff, Valery Gerasimov, who praised DPRK troops for“demonstrating high professionalism, courage, and heroism in battle.” North Korean soldiers were protecting Russian soil“as their own,”demonstrating“indomitable will and ultimate sacrifice,”the Central Military Commission in Pyongyangannouncedin a statement on Monday. Their heroic deeds, it added, recorded“legendary achievements”and further proved the“unbreakable alliance”between the two states. “Those who fought for justice are all heroes and representatives of the nation’s honor,”Kim Jong-un declared, as cited by KCNA. A monument honoring their combat feats will soon be erected in our capital, and everlasting flowers will be laid before the gravestones of the fallen by the nation and the people. Pyongyang did not reveal the exact number of North Korean troops deployed or how many lost their lives in battle, but Kim emphasized that the homeland must always remember their spirit and take special national measures to honor and care for the families of veterans. “The combat spirit and heroism of our soldiers, who glorified the name of the strong and victorious, will shine forever on the high pedestal of respect and honor,”he said. The North Korean leader also extended his“heartfelt and combative greetings”to Russian forces and the Russian people, congratulating them on a“great victory”in Kursk. Moscow hailed Pyongyang’s“solidarity,”with Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova calling the assistance of“our Korean friends”a“manifestation of the high, essentially allied level of our relations.” Kiev and its Western backers had long alleged that North Korean troops were involved in the hostilities in Kursk Region, which was invaded by Ukrainian forces last August. Until the area was secured last week, Pyongyang and Moscow neither confirmed nor denied the reports, while the Russian president insisted it was up to the two nations to determine how they fulfill their obligations under the partnership pact.",

    "title": "North Korea unveils details of troops deployment to Russia",
    "article_text": "North Korean leader Kim Jong-un personally ordered the country’s military to fight alongside Russian forces“to annihilate Ukrainian neo-Nazi occupiers and liberate the Kursk region,”the North’s Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported on Monday. In a report to Russian President Vladimir Putin last week, Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov praised the contribution made by North Korean servicemen in helping to liberate the Kursk Region from Ukrainian forces. Pyongyang officially confirmed the deployment on Monday. “The operations for liberating the Kursk area to repel the adventurous invasion of the Russian Federation by the Ukrainian authorities were victoriously concluded,”KCNA reported, citing an official statement by the Central Military Commission. North Korean troops were deployed on Russian soil under the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership Agreement between Moscow and Pyongyang, whichcame into forcelast December. The treaty provides for mutual military assistance in the event of an attack, pledging immediate support“by all means available”under Article 51 of the UN Charter. Ukraine launched its incursion into Kursk Region last August, deploying some of its best units equipped with Western-supplied weapons, initially gaining some ground and capturing numerous settlements before their advance was checked by Russian forces. The Central Military Commission said that the evolving military situation triggered Article 4 of the treaty with Moscow. Based on this analysis, Kim Jong-un personally decided to deploy North Korean troops to Russia and notified the Kremlin. Pyongyang emphasized that its military activities in Russia were fully consistent with the UN Charter and international law, portraying the deployment as a model of faithful implementation of the mutual defense treaty with Moscow. Kiev and its Western backers had long alleged that North Korean troops were involved in the conflict. Prior to Saturday, Pyongyang and Moscow neither confirmed nor denied the rumors, while the Russian president had previously said it was up to the two nations to determine how they fulfill their obligations under the partnership pact.",

    "title": "Americans increasingly reliant on loans for groceries – survey",
    "article_text": "Americans are increasingly reliant on buy now, pay later (BNPL) loans to purchase their groceries, a survey conducted by online lending marketplace Lending Tree indicates. The trend is bound to continue and the situation is unlikely to improve in the near term, the marketplace’s analysts warn, citing inflation, high interest rates and growing concerns around tariffs. The survey was conducted by the platform early in April among some 2,000 American consumers aged 18 to 70, with around a half of them reporting they have been using the BNPL services. The short-term loans scheme has become increasingly popular over the past few years, as it allows to split up purchases into smaller payments, its providers often do not charge interest, while credit score is not taken into account. Paying late or stacking up multiple loans, however, could result in high fees. Some 41% of BNPL users admitted missing payments, with the figure growing from 34% recorded by the marketplace last year. Nearly a quarter of BNPL users said they had three more active loans at a time. At the same time, a vast majority of BNPL users - some 62% - falsely believe the loans of the type help their credit score, while a further 26% were not sure on the matter, the survey indicated. The poll suggested a nearly twofold growth of BNPL use to fund groceries, with 25% of the scheme users paying for their foodstuffs through it compared to only 14% last year. The practice has been especially popular among the Gen Z loan users, with groceries being their fourth most common BNPL purchase, according to the survey. The BNPL use is bound to grow and the trend observed in the survey is unlikely to change in the short term at least, Lending Tree’s chief consumer finance analyst, Matt Schulz, has said. The analyst cautioned against overusing BNPL loans, describing it a“really good interest-free tool,”but warning of“a lot of risk in mismanaging it.” “Inflation is still a problem. Interest rates are still really high. There’s a lot of uncertainty around tariffs and other economic issues, and it’s all going to add up to a lot of people looking for ways to extend their budget however they can,”he said, warning the situation with the loans is likely“to get worse.”",

    "title": "New sanctions on Russia would mean two more years of war – Rubio",
    "article_text": "The US administration has abstained from imposing new sanctions on Russia over the Ukraine conflict, believing such a move would jeopardize negotiations and prolong hostilities, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said. Speaking to NBC News’ Meet the Press on Sunday, Rubio questioned the usefulness of placing new restrictions on Moscow, stating Washington was“hoping to see”whether the diplomacy would work first. “The minute you start doing that kind of stuff, you’re walking away from it, you’ve now doomed yourself to another two years of war and we don’t want to see it happen,”the top diplomat said. Rubio claimed that the US is the only country or institution speaking to both Kiev and Moscow, and only US President Donald Trump has the potential to bring the warring sides to the negotiating table. The upcoming week is expected to be“very critical”for the White House with regard to the talks, as the administration is trying to make a“determination about whether this is an endeavor that we want to continue to be involved in.”While Washington does not want to walk away, it does not want to“spend time on something that’s not going to get us there”either, the secretary explained. “There are reasons to be optimistic, but there are reasons to be realistic. We’re close, but we’re not close enough,”he said. The remarks from the US secretary of state come a day after Trump threatened Moscow with new sanctions over the conflict, accusing Russia’s leadership of trying to drag out hostilities and of“shooting missiles”into Ukraine for“no reason”over the past few days. Moscow maintains it only targets facilities and infrastructure used by Kiev’s military, and has repeatedly denied accusations of staging indiscriminate strikes on civilian areas. Trump’s threats came as Moscow once again reiterated its readiness for discussions with Kiev without preconditions. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed the topic was brought up by Russian President Vladimir Putin during a meeting with Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff in Moscow on Friday. Ukraine’s leader, Vladimir Zelensky, explicitly banned negotiations with Russia for as long as Putin is in charge back in October 2022. Since then, he has seemingly softened his position, claiming the negotiating ban concerned everyone in the country but himself. Most recently, Kiev has demanded an unconditional ceasefire before any direct talks can happen.",

    "title": "NATO state could seize Russian Orthodox church — media",
    "article_text": "Sweden could forcibly acquire a Russian Orthodox church and move it away from a key airport over concerns that it could be used by Moscow for spying purposes, the national public television network SVT has reported. The Swedish Moderate Party, which is a member of the ruling coalition, hopes to move the Icon of Our Lady of Kazan Church out of the city of Vasteras, claiming that it poses a security threat over its alleged“connections to the Russian state,”the broadcaster said in an article on Friday. The church sits near Stockholm Vasteras Airport, a water treatment plant and the facilities of energy companies. “In the world we live in now, we need to make sure that it is moved to another place,”Moderate Party politician Elisabeth Unell argued. Sweden, which joined NATO in 2024, citing concerns over the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, cannot allow the presence of“a foreign power”near a key airport, Unell told SVT. The municipal board in Vasteras confirmed to the broadcaster that the Moderate Party proposal has been formally received and will be looked into. If approved, the plan to buy out the church at a price of up to 30% above market value will be forwarded to the Swedish government for a final decision. Last year, Politico reported that the Swedish Security Service, Sapo, accused the church of serving as a“platform to conduct intelligence activities in Sweden.”The agency claimed, without providing evidence, that church representatives“have had contacts”with Russian intelligence agencies. Church officials have dismissed all accusations, insisting their activities are purely religious. They have also denied receiving any funding from Moscow. The permit to construct the church was issued in 2017 and raised no security objections. Government funding for the parish was withdrawn in May 2024, following consultations with Sapo. Last year, another Nordic country, Norway, increased scrutiny of the Russian Orthodox Church’s activities after allegations surfaced that some priests had collaborated with the Russian embassy“in one way or another.” Speaking to RIA Novosti, Archpriest Nikolay Lishchenyuk, deputy chairman of the Department for External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, called the espionage accusations“absurd and slanderous.”",

    "title": "Macron snubbed during Trump–Zelensky meeting in Vatican",
    "article_text": "French President Emmanuel Macron was sidelined when his US counterpart Donald Trump and Vladimir Zelensky met before the funeral of Pope Francis on Saturday. Footage from the Vatican showed him being left out despite the Ukrainian leader’s apparent expectations that he would join. Trump and Zelensky last met in February in the Oval Office. The meeting, where they’d intended to finalize a US-Ukraine minerals agreement and discuss a potential ceasefire with Russia, ended abruptly amid a heated exchange involving Vice President JD Vance, which led to the Ukrainian leader’s early departure from the White House. Video footage from the Vatican showed Zelensky walking toward the seating area with Trump. He glanced back several times, reportedly expecting Macron to join. Three chairs were set up, suggesting plans for a three-way discussion. As the French president approached, Zelensky greeted him warmly with a smile and a hand gesture, inviting him to join. However, just moments later, a staff member discreetly removed the third chair before the meeting began. Footage shows Trump gesturing openly while maintaining a firm posture, signaling the conversation would be strictly between him and Zelensky. Macron eventually stepped back as the two engaged directly. Visuals captured Zelensky’s expression changing from confident to visibly tense upon realizing he would face Trump alone. The 15-minute meeting took place against a backdrop of growing tensions; the US president has pressured Kiev to accept what media outlets have termed his“final offer”to end hostilities. Reports suggest that Washington’s proposal involves freezing the conflict along the existing front lines and recognizing Crimea as part of Russia, a condition the Ukrainian leader has firmly rejected. Trump stated in an interview with Time magazine on Friday that“Crimea will stay with Russia.”Before 2014, the peninsula was part of Ukraine, but it joined Russia after a referendum which followed a Western-backed coup in Kiev. Trump also recently reiterated that Zelensky“has no cards to play,”echoing what he told him during their last White House meeting. Macron has been among Zelensky’s most steadfast supporters, and has consistently emphasized that any peace agreement must ensure Ukraine retains its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Russia has stressed, however, that any deal to end hostilities must not only acknowledge territorial reality but also address the conflict’s root causes, including Ukraine’s NATO aspirations. Trump voiced satisfaction with negotiations between Washington and Moscow after Russian President Vladimir Putin held lengthy talks with US envoy Steve Witkoff at the Kremlin on Friday.",

    "title": "White House to evaluate officials’ loyalty to Trump – WSJ",
    "article_text": "A US government agency will begin assessing federal workers based on their loyalty to President Donald Trump, the Wall Street Journal has reported. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which is the US federal government’s human-resources arm, has been tasked with leading the evaluation program, the outlet said in an article on Saturday. According to memos from OPM Acting Director Chuck Ezell, which were seen by the WSJ, high-ranking civil servants will be judged based on their“faithful administration of the law and the president’s policies.” The documents described advancing Trump’s agenda as the“most critical element”in measuring the performance of the officials, the report read. The new performance plan is expected to be adopted by the US government agencies by the beginning of fiscal year 2026, it added. The WSJ stressed that civil servants had also been graded previously, but it was done based on factors such as business acumen, leadership skills, ability to build coalitions and results of their work. During the previous Democratic administration of President Joe Biden, staffing policy focused heavily on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices. Critics, however, argued that DEI initiatives often prioritized identity over merit, leading to claims of lowered standards and divisiveness. Many companies, including, Walt Disney, JPMorgan Chase, Amazon, and Google, facing similar criticisms and legal challenges, have since scaled back or entirely abandoned their DEI programs. Shortly after assuming office in January, Trump signed several executive orders aimed at eliminating DEI initiatives, describing them as“radical,”within the federal government, its contractors, and grantees. The WSJ said that OPM had already begun approving positions that other federal agencies are looking to add in what it described as an attempt by the Trump administration“to consolidate control over the hiring and firing of federal workers.” The Office of Personnel Management will also continue some of the government downsizing efforts initiated by Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, according to the report. Musk announced earlier this week that he will scale back his involvement as the head of the US Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and refocus on his business activities. The world’s richest man explained his decision by saying that“major work”to establish DOGE has now been completed. However, Musk clarified that he has no intention of stepping away from his work at the agency altogether, adding that he would still spend“a day or two per week on government matters.”",

    "article_text": "Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk has announced a new national doctrine that seeks to turn Warsaw into an“economic miracle”protected by the“strongest army in the region,”in a speech marking the 1,000th anniversary of the creation of the Kingdom of Poland. Speaking on Friday in Gniezno, the city where the first King of Poland, Boleslaw the Brave, was crowned a millennium ago, Tusk outlined the three“pillars”of the National Piast Doctrine, named after the country's first historical ruling house. “We will have the strongest army in the region. Don’t say it’s impossible. Yes, our army must be able to overcome any threat. From the east, west, south – it doesn’t matter,”Tusk said of the first pillar in hisaddress. He promised to“take advantage of this tragic, dramatic experience of this war that is going on beyond our borders.” The second pillar of the doctrine is to build“the strongest economy in the region.” “Poland is strengthening its position among the absolute leaders of economic growth in Europe,”Tusk said.“Today we are really one step away from the fact that not only in Europe but all over the world people will say with admiration: ‘Oh, Poland, this is an economic miracle.’” Political influence in the EU and globally forms the third pillar of the doctrine, Tusk said, stressing the importance of maintaining strong ties with Warsaw’s“most important ally,”Washington. Polish President Andrzej Duda reportedly even urged Washington to move part of its nuclear arsenal stored in Western Europe or the United States to Poland. US Vice President J.D. Vance said he would be“shocked”if President Donald Trump ever supported such an idea. Poland has been among Ukraine’s main supporters since the escalation of the conflict with Russia in 2022, providing more than €5.1 billion ($5.7 billion) in aid, over 70% of which was military, according to Germany’s Kiel Institute. The country has also taken in a large number of refugees from its neighbor, although public attitudes have reportedly cooled amid the influx of arrivals. Warsaw will”brutally” protect its economic interests and intends to profit from future aid to Ukraine, including from post-conflict reconstruction, Tusk said earlier this month. Polish officials have increasingly called for militarization to address the alleged threat posed by Russia. Moscow has rejected these claims, stating that NATO and EU leaders are merely“fearmongering”in order to push their populations into supporting such measures.",

    "title": "Iran blast death toll rises amid chemical attack fears (VIDEOS)",
    "article_text": "A massive explosion followed by a fire at a major Iranian port — a crucial hub for oil and petrochemical exports near the Strait of Hormuz — has left 25 people dead and injured around 800 others, Mehr News Agency reported on Sunday, citing a local official. The blast occurred at approximately 11:55am on Saturday at the Shahid Rajaee port facility in the city of Bandar Abbas. Early Sunday morning, the director general of Hormozgan Province’s crisis management reported that 18 people had been confirmed dead, with the number of injured exceeding 800. He noted that about two-thirds of those hospitalized have already been discharged from medical centers, while the rest continue to receive treatment. Firefighters were still battling the blaze late into the night. Authorities secured the area and adjacent customs facilities to conduct a probe, suspecting poor chemical storage as a possible cause. “The cause of the explosion was the chemicals inside the containers,”Hossein Zafari, a spokesperson for the country’s crisis management organization, told Iranian Labour News Agency (ILNA).“Previously, the director general of crisis management had given warnings to this port during their visits and had pointed out the possibility of danger.” However, the exact cause had not yet been officially determined, government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani told media outlets. Iranian media provided conflicting accounts of the incident, with some suggesting the initial blast occurred at an administrative building, while others claimed a gas tanker may have exploded. A close-up video circulating online appeared to show the epicenter located at a freight container stockpile. Other footage posted online showed thick smoke rising over the port area, as authorities evacuated nearby neighborhoods and temporarily suspended port operations. In response to concerns regarding air quality, Iran’s health ministry declared a public health emergency in Bandar Abbas, warning of the potential spread of hazardous pollutants including ammonia, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide. Residents were urged to stay indoors, avoid outdoor activities, and keep windows closed. Vulnerable groups – including people with respiratory or heart conditions, children, pregnant women, and the elderly – were advised to wear masks. Several countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Japan, and Russia, have expressed condolences following the disaster. Saudi Arabia said it was ready to provide any assistance requested by Iran, while Russia’s embassy in Tehran stated it would promptly relay any request for help to Moscow. Iraq’s foreign ministry also offered support, with Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani ordering officials to coordinate aid efforts with Iranian authorities. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian offered his condolences to the victims and ordered a full investigation. The country’s prosecutor general instructed the provincial office to“deal with the possible perpetrators of the incident with utmost seriousness.” Shahid Rajaee is a strategic port facility located on the Strait of Hormuz about 1,050 kilometers southeast of Tehran. The port was targeted in a suspected Israeli cyberattack in 2020. Iranian officials have not blamed any outside actor for Saturday’s incident, although the country's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi warned earlier this week that“our security services are on high alert given past instances of attempted sabotage.”",

    "article_text": "Podcasts Podcasts For someone who enjoys having control of her life, PAP new face Jasmin Lau learnt a \"life-changing lesson\" when she underwent IVF. PAP new face Jasmin Lau, who is contesting in Ang Mo Kio GRC, went from government scholar to rising up the ranks in the civil service. She tells Otelli Edwards on this special series of the Deep Dive podcast how she copes with self-doubt and why she said yes to joining politics. Here is an excerpt from the conversation: Otelli Edwards, host:So just going back to that big decision to be in the public eye, to potentially be an office holder. Firstly, you said that you are an introvert and that it takes quite a bit out of you, for instance, to meet and greet (people) and to really open yourself up. But you have to in this position. As a matter of fact, you rejected the (PAP) a few times. Jasmin Lau, PAP candidate for Ang Mo Kio GRC:Yeah ... now people know I rejected (them) so many times.Otelli:So what was it that made you say: “Okay yes, I'm just going to go ahead with it, although I have to make a lot of sacrifices.” Jasmin:This word about sacrifice is used very often by candidates from every party. Everybody says it's some sacrifice. Some do multiple jobs and they sacrifice the time away from the kids too. So I feel bad and guilty using that word because no matter what, we are still fortunate and comfortable. We live in relatively sheltered lives, even though now it's public, but there are many others who have real unseen sacrifices. So while you may frame it as a sacrifice, to me I see as this as a responsibility. Follow the podcast onApple,Spotifyormelistenfor the latest updates. Have a great topic for us?

The victorious end of the battle to liberate Russia's Kursk region showed the \"highest strategic level of the firm militant friendship\" between North Korea and Russia, KCNA state news agency cited the North's ruling party as saying. Russia said last week Ukrainian forces had been expelled from the last Russian village they had been holding, although Kyiv denied the claim and said their troops were still operating in Belgorod, another Russian region bordering Ukraine.

    "title": "Ways for women: How you can push for equity – not just equality – at the office for a healthier work life",
    "article_text": "Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Women Women Women Women Wellness Wellness Wellness Wellness People Living Living Buyers' Guide Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Obsessions Dining Dining Dining Dining Experiences Obsessions Experiences Experiences Women Women Singapore has come quite far in terms of equality in the workplace but it is far from equitable. Feel like you want to do something but don’t know how? Start in small everyday ways. This is part of CNA Women’s series featuring tips on how to navigate life relationships, work and health. When it comes to equity in the workplace, women in Singapore need more advocacy in the areas of flexibility, equal opportunity and equity for female employees who are caregivers. (Art: Jasper Loh) This audio is generated by an AI tool. The words equity and equality may seem interchangeable but they mean different things. Equality in the workplace means staff are treated fairly, regardless of age, gender and race. Equityis about addressing individual needs and characteristics, to ensure fair access to resources and achieve balanced outcomes. Women need more advocacy in these areas: Flexibility, equal opportunity, and equity for female employees who are caregivers. According to a 2022 Quality of Life survey by the National Council of Social Service, women make up 60 per cent of caregivers in Singapore. Flexibility is essential for balancing work and caregiving responsibilities. A 2022 Ministry of Manpower report found that over 260,000 women were not able to work due to caregiving responsibilities. In response to this, independent non-profit SG Her Empowerment (SHE) created several initiatives to support women through community engagements and partnerships. Its chief operating officer How Kay Lii, said that if, and when, these women returned to the workforce, they faced challenges with balancing work and family responsibilities, gender bias and workplace discrimination,lack of access and opportunities, as well as lack of flexible work arrangements. These led to them getting passed over for promotions, leadership opportunities, or networking opportunities to help them navigate the job market. The organisation runs SHE Supports, an initiative which empowers women as they return to work, thorough mentoring services, legal clinics and career workshops. In Singapore, the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) has new policies in place that will help. The Tripartite Guidelines on Flexible Work Arrangement (FWA), which started in December 2024, support a flexible work arrangement that is beneficial for companies and employees, for a healthy workforce. Karen Kim, CEO of Human Managed, a data and AI platform service, said employers should recognise that flexibility extends beyond where work is done. “It’s about how employees add value and contribute.” Flexibility should include diverse roles that allow employees to contribute based on their skills and passions, beyond job titles, education and experience, Kim added. Women’s caregiving responsibilities often cause them to face setbacks in career progression. Sher-li Torrey, founder of Mums@Work, a career portal, pointed out that these women are frequently overlooked for promotions or new opportunities. “The hiring process still trends towards ‘current experienced workers’ as opposed to those with career gaps due to caregiving reasons.” She added that companies can implement return-to-work programmes and initiatives for women who have taken career breaks, helping them reintegrate into the workforce. In addition, having a corporate mindset more open to flexibility in policies on transparency for promotions and pay will lead to inclusivity for women who are caregivers. Wong Meilin, partner and CEO of public relations agency Milk & Honey PR, said the main causes of disparity in the workplace lies in a combination of deeply ingrained societal norms and challenges in the traditional organisational structure. “Gender roles remain influenced by traditional expectations. So while women in Singapore enter the workforce, societal pressures around caregiving and familial roles have not changed significantly even today.” While manpower guidelines from TAFEP and company policies can help advance workplace equity, women themselves must also do their part.There are ways to advocate for your female co-workers – here’s what every woman can do. In a meeting, women tend to gravitate toward either end of the table or the room. A 2014 study in the American Political Science Review also found that women get less airtime in group discussions where there are other men in similar or higher levels. They also get interrupted a lot by men. Women in senior positions interrupt other women too but less than men. If a woman is interrupted, interject and say: “Oh, I’d like to hear more of that before we move on.” If a co-worker runs away with a woman’s idea, speak out and say: “Great idea and thanks to Debbie for bringing it out.” If a female co-worker is struggling to be heard, say: “I’d love to hear what you think, Ashley.” “The most powerful way for women is to amplify the voices of those who may not always be heard,” said Wong. “Whether it’s women, or co-workers with disabilities, lending your voice in meetings creates opportunities for them to be heard and get heard.” Women tend to be shy about their achievements for fear of being labelled “self-promoting”. They often credit their own achievements as “getting lucky” or “getting help from others”. Contrast this with men who will attribute their achievements to their personal skill and innate qualities. As a result, women and their contributions go unnoticed. If a female co-worker’s initiative is a success, compliment her and highlight the achievement like this: “Nina was in charge for our latest product launch and it generated a lot of sales, and even garnered the most social media engagement of all our launches.” Celebrate successes and achievements so that women get the credit they deserve and do not feel embarrassed or feel the need to play small to be accepted or recognised. Create designated spaces for women in the workplace. For womenreturning after maternity leave, some may require practical support like nursing rooms or refrigerator space. Rachel Lee, 39, a retail executive, said having a quiet space was useful when she returned to work after having her third child. “When I was working at a mall, there were designated nursing rooms but there may be none in an industrial building.” Her colleagues cleared a small meeting room and taped the clear windows for privacy so she couldexpress her breast milk. They even cleared the office fridge and made space for her to store her breast milk. This helped her feel accepted. SHE’s How added: “As a mother of young children myself, having had the support of my colleagues and bosses when I returned to work after maternity was absolutely crucial to my transition.” Even as flexible work arrangements are getting common, there is still some stigma towards those requesting it. Have open conversations with female co-workers who ask for such arrangements. Most women need it for medical appointments for their elderly parents or when their children fall sick. How said: “Open, non-judgmentalconversations about caregivingand work-life balance normalises discussions about family responsibilities and the mental load women may face.” One way a woman can plan ahead for these arrangements is to create a working schedule or a shared calendar and update it monthly or weekly. Run through any changes to ensure your colleagues are aware.This way, you can support your colleagues’ schedules without any surprises or resentment. Similarly, when you require flexible days, those are also reflected on the schedule. Having amentor in the workplaceis paramount for women climbing the corporate ladder. According to a Forbesarticle, employees who have mentors are promoted five times more often than those without. They are more confident in their abilities and are likely to stay in the company. Sharing experiences helps women see things from a unique perspective. The Singapore Muslim Women’s Association (PPIS), a non-profit which focuses on community services for Muslim women, found that women feel empowered to succeed in their jobs if they have strong female role models. They also saw that coaching and mentorship programmes helped fellow aspiring entrepreneurs succeed if they had successful women business owners guide them.

    "title": "Industrial designer Tom Dixon wants to still be excited by things and to remain 'juvenile'",
    "article_text": "Experiences Experiences Experiences Experiences Obsessions Obsessions Obsessions Obsessions People People People People Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Remarkable Living People People In Singapore recently to launch his latest designs, the designer of the Beat lamps shares about his life of design. Tom Dixon. (Photo: Xtra/Tom Dixon) This audio is generated by an AI tool. I first met Tom Dixon in 2018. The British furniture and industrial designer was in Singapore to promote his eponymous brand. During an event at the Xtra store, I became enamoured with his Peg lounge chair and purchased a copy that he signed. The seat is now out of production, but it has survived more than a decade of children climbing over it. Every time I sit on it, my hands naturally gravitate towards the joints clearly expressed as combined timber rods. Dixon has a knack for injecting quirk and surprise to familiar forms shaped by his intrigue with industrial processes. One will surely remember his Beat collection. The trio of brass lamps with hand-beaten, golden internal surfaces became so widely copied that Dixon created a more affordable aluminium range called Unbeaten. “I think my design language is very simplistic. I get obsessed with these really basic shapes like the sphere and the cube – geometric elements that form the basis of design,” explained Dixon. His early childhood, though, was far from the world of objects. Born in North Africa where his parents were based, his first four years were spent in Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt and Suez. “It was mainly memories of animals. I remember camels at the water wheel going around in circles. I was fascinated with flying fish I saw during a trip to Egypt. And the locust swarms – we would drive up to the plague of locusts and they’d be crushed right onto the windscreen,” recalled the 66-year-old, who founded the Tom Dixon brand with David Beg in 2002. In February 2025, I spoke with Dixon again in the Xtra showroom, seven years after our first interview. He was at the tail end of an Asian tour to launch his latest furniture designs ahead of the annual Milan Design Week, held from Apr 7 to Apr 13 this year. He now prefers this strategy, meeting his distributors and supporters up close in their home countries rather than putting up displays in the world’s biggest design event. Those displays were really grand. For example, in 2012, to showcase the possibilities of accessible high-tech manufacturing, he brought a Trumpf sheet-steel machine into Milan’s Museum of Science and Technology, houses in a 16th century monastery. I recall the brilliant juxtaposition of historic machines – a train and antique flying contraptions were some of them – against the modern one stamping steel lamps that Dixon gave away to visitors. Thirteen years on, this experiment with metal has materialised the Groove aluminium chair and table, which is his first outdoor collection. Another recent design is the Fat sofa. The modular version of the loveseat adapts to modern-day use of the sofa where apart from watching television, one also lounges on the seat to use the mobile phone or work on the laptop. “People still want to be together, but they don't need to sit in a row, looking at the television,” Dixon explained. The chair had Kim Kardashian’s approval – she modelled her Skims collection on two Fat lounge chairs positioned in opposite directions like a loveseat, he said. This year, Dixon introduced the task chair variation called Fat Work. It was birthed during the pandemic when Dixon was confined to working from home and decided the conventional office chair was “too ugly” for a home environment. “I adapted one of our Fat chairs to have a swivel base and the bare minimum of mechanism for an office chair,” said Dixon. “At home, you’re doing some of your work on the sofa then getting up to walk the dog or make a call; you’re never sitting eight hours straight in front of the computer where you need all those levers, lumber supports and [adjustable] armrests.” Like many others, the pandemic had allowed him to reset from a hectic work life where more time was spent on meetings than making things in the workshop. “During Covid, I went a bit feral. We were not supposed to go into the office, so I pretended I was horticulture and inhabited my friend’s orchid farm in Sussex. There, I played with materials. It was really good fun,” shared Dixon. He even bought a kiln. “It’s in the southern part of England that sits on a massive block of clay, so the buildings are made of brick. I dug up a load of clay and made mainly flowerpots and vases,” said Dixon. From a young age, he already loved working with his hands. Attending Holland Park School gave him some formal training. “It was really poor at academics but had an amazing art department. I thought I had a lot of luck with that. Quite early on, I found refuge in those spaces,” shared Dixon, who earned a pottery certification at the end of his schooling years. The self-described introverted child also sought refuge in books. “My sister used to beat me because I was very bookish and wouldn’t play with her,” chuckled Dixon. This changed when he “discovered girls and music.” Dixon enrolled in Chelsea Collage of Arts but left after half a year when a motorcycle accident confined him in hospital for three months. A brief career as the bass guitarist for disco band Funktapolitan followed, where Dixon opened for bands like The Clash. “The music business was interesting because it allowed you, without a lot of skill, to kind of output your creativity,” remarked Dixon on the parallels between music and making things. A second motorcycle accident saw him being replaced in the band when it went on tour so Dixon started working in London’s nightclub and warehouse party scene. Fortuitously, it left him time in the day to muck around with recycled and found materials. Dixon would make one-off objects and sell them. One of these would change the course of his life. The S Chair, made of rubber inner tubes and with a steering wheel for a base, caught the attention of Cappellini. The Italian furniture manufacturer acquired the design and made several elevated versions, thrusting Dixon into the international design world proper. While he did not have a degree in design, Dixon did gain plenty from the school of life. In the 1990s, Dixon joined Habitat as its head of design before rising the ranks to become creative director. It was owned by Ikea, which had acquired the furniture empire founded by Sir Terence Conan. “There was something really fabulous about jumping from being a kind of naive, self-taught designer-maker to working for this organisation, which was and still is the largest furniture business on the planet,” said Dixon. “If we wanted to sell a plant or soft toy, we’d sell millions.” The rite of passage at Habitat was to work in the complaints department in the first week. “What a nightmare! But I did learn a lot about what really happens in the furniture business, like deliveries not fitting in through the door, or people buying stuff and using it for a party before sending it back, claiming it was the wrong textile,” mused Dixon. He was exposed to endless business opportunities, as well as had access to a global sourcing map. He also learnt about marketing brands and consumer behaviour. “When we launched something, we could tell the following week who was buying,” said Dixon on the data accessibility. This was indispensable groundwork for when he established his own company. In 2004, the Tom Dixon brand partnered with venture capital company Proventus to form Design Research. The entity owns and manages the Tom Dixon brand and Finnish modernist furniture manufacturer Artek. In 2007, Dixon started Design Research Studio to design spaces – filled with Tom Dixon products, of course. These include the interior design of Jamie Oliver’s London restaurant Barbacoa, boutique hotel Mondrian London and Virgin Voyage’s first sea vessel. It also designed The Manzoni in Milan, which was Tom Dixon’s inaugural European base comprising a restaurant, shop and offices. Dixon now launches his designs at The Manzoni during Milan Design Week. At the recent edition, his new Whirl lights floated in the restaurants like shimmering jewels. They are his latest exploration of mirrored reflections, inspired by the op-art movement. For a self-taught designer, Dixon has done excellently. His products are sold in over 90 countries, and he has hubs in London, Milan, Hong Kong, New York, Tokyo, Shanghai and Hangzhou. Some designs are immortalised in the most reputable museums, such as London’s Victoria and Albert Museum, New York’s Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) and the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris. Early this year, Dixon was awarded the CBE (Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire) – a rank up from the OBE (Order of the British Empire) that he received in 2000. It is the highest order excluding a knighthood or damehood in the ranks established by Kind George V in 1917. Other personalities who have become CBE include director David Attenborough, architect John Pawson and artist Anish Kapoor. I asked Dixon how things have changed for him. “I don't think I’m that different actually; I’m still curious. Twenty years is the longest time I’ve spent doing anything, so my battle is not to be stale, really. I just want to remain interesting and excited by things, to remain ‘juvenile’,” he articulated. There are still many things that he has not explored, such as transportation vehicles (“electric cars are evolving so fast”), camping gear (“camping is trending, but I’ve never done any tents”), and electronics. A post shared by Tom Dixon (@tomdixonstudio) Dixon pointed to his mobile phone. “I swear, last week I took someone else’s phone all the way to Leeds because it looked exactly like mine. There’s no personality in electronics anymore; there must be a way of thinking differently about the thing you use most in your life.” The great thing about a creative career is that it does not really have a retirement age. “It’s like being a journalist, allowing you to poke into other people’s business,” said Dixon. “Everyday is a fresh opportunity or challenge if you manage not to become cynical or bored with your own narrative. There are so many materials and typologies I’d like to work with that I haven’t done so in the end if I get bored or stale, it’s my own fault.” Subscribe to CNA's Recommended Read A single handpicked story that we think you shouldn't miss.

    "title": "Commentary: Trump’s tariffs are an opportunity for Indonesia to advance its interests",
    "article_text": "Commentary Commentary To mitigate the negative impact of US tariffs, Indonesia must adjust its economic strategy and seek new markets, says RSIS’ Adhi Priamarizki. Workers walk by as shipping containers are stacked at Jakarta International Container Terminal (JICT) at Tanjung Prior Port in Jakarta, Indonesia, Apr 11, 2025. (AP Photo/Tatan Syuflana) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Indonesia was among the countries targeted by United States President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs announced on Apr 2. It faces a 32 per cent tariff,the sixth highest in Southeast Asia. This move sparked fears over a potential recession and had a negative impact on thestock market across Asia. TheIndonesian stock market dropped 9 per centon its first trading day (Apr 8) following the Hari Raya holiday period. In response to the financial chaos, Mr Trump decided to delay the implementation of the tariffs for most countries by90 days. Despite the seemingly challenging circumstances, US tariffs may present a window of opportunity for Indonesia to advance its strategic and economic interests. The Indonesian government pledged thatJakarta will not retaliate against Mr Trump’s tariffs. Instead, it would seek to negotiate andimport more US productssuch as wheat, cotton, oil and gas. President Prabowo Subianto has expressed his intention to explore new markets and strengthen domestic ones to mitigate the negative impact of US tariffs. He also met Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim on Apr 6 to discuss the new US tariffs and other matters related to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The Trump tariffs give Indonesia impetus to adjust its economic strategy through diversification of cooperation and partnerships. Such moves help to bolster the country’s “free and active” foreign policy as well, through which Indonesia stays impartial to major powers while exerting its influence in regional affairs. First, the tariffs are an opportunity to strengthen the US-Indonesia relationship.Although the leaders have not met to date,Mr Prabowo called Mr Trump to congratulate him on his election victory,and both men exchanged warm words. The US remains one of Indonesia’s key security and economic partners. In 2023, the two countries elevated their relationship status into a “comprehensive strategic partnership”, pledging to work towards a stronger and more prosperous Indo-Pacific. While this was struck during their predecessors Joko Widodo’s and Joe Biden’s tenures, Indonesia should consider reiterating the partnership and discussing its future direction when negotiating with the US on trade. By doing this, Indonesia not only emphasises itself as a reliable US partner in Southeast Asia but also reminds Washington of its commitment to the region. Moreover, it is plausible for Indonesia and the US to explore new areas of trade, such as on critical minerals,which Indonesia is a major producer of. Second, Jakarta’s plan to negotiate with Washington should take into account Indonesia’s ambition to join the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) by 2027. Indonesia has officially joined BRICSbut is still eyeing OECD membership for its long-term economic development. The hope is that OECD membership will attract foreign investment and strengthen Indonesia’s position in the global semiconductor ecosystem. To join the OECD, Indonesia must align its regulations with the bloc’s standards for governance and transparency. Adjusting its economic policies to respond to US tariffs could also serve its bid for OECD membership. Third, the tariffs can drive Indonesia to formulate a coherent economic strategy. Indonesia faces a potential economic slowdown and Mr Prabowo’s ambitious national agenda, notably the free meals programme and construction of 3 million houses, require funding. It is a good time for the Prabowo administration to consolidate a team to balance the president’s nationalistic tendencies with practical solutions to the country’s pressing economic challenges. Mr Prabowo may wish to make full use of the National Economic Council, transforming the role of an adviser from a largely symbolic position into one of meaningful engagement and influence. In addition, the situation can push Indonesia to explore doing business with other regions. Mr Prabowo has mentioned the possibility of Africa as a new market due to its large population and abundant resources. Indonesia itself has exported a wide range of products to African countries, ranging from instant noodles to airplanes. For example, Indonesia’s aerospace company (PT DI) has exported its aircraft to Senegal and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The Prabowo administration must take advantage of the 90-day pause to prepare for whatever lies ahead. Indonesia needs to develop a comprehensive response to address the challenges posed by US tariffs, utilising both political and economic tools. It should consider working with other countries to formulate a collective response. Working with ASEAN member states through the institution’s mechanisms might provide solutions. This moment presents an opportunity for Indonesiato recalibrate its economic policies, step up its regional influenceand enhance its role in promoting ASEAN unity.

    "title": "Commentary: Why you need a will (yes, you)",
    "article_text": "Commentary Commentary As long as you have any assets at all and people you care about, it's not too early to think about making a plan for both, says finance blogger Dawn Cher. Nearly half of Singaporeans don’t have a will, showed a 2022 survey. (Photo: iStock) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: I was 29 when I first sat down to write my will. There’s no denying that thinking about death is uncomfortable, especially if you’re going through big life changes such as getting married or raising your first child. In a time of joy and new beginnings, no one likes to think about the possibility of everything suddenly being taken away by events out of our control. Perhaps this is why, in a 2022 survey by wealth manager St James's Place Singapore, 48 per cent of Singaporeans said they don’t have a will. To me, this is a curiously high number for a country famed for its long-term planning skills. Facing your mortality doesn’t mean you’re being morbid or pessimistic. It means you’re being practical about what life could be like for your loved ones if you’re no longer around for them. Unlike the television dramas we watched while growing up, you do not need to be old, sick or rich to need a will. In Singapore, anyone aged 21 and above can make a legally binding will. But rather than asking yourself “Am I at the age to make a will?”, a better question would be: “Do I have something to leave behind for my loved ones?” In my case, it wasn’t long after my first child was born that I started thinking about drafting a will. As long as you have assets (no matter how substantial) and people you care about, it is a good time to think about making a plan for both. Without a will, your estate will be distributed according to the law rather than your wishes. This could be your bank savings, your property (or properties), your Central Provident Fund monies or even your investments in cryptocurrencies or stocks. In Singapore, only legal family members are recognised under the Intestate Succession Act. Your fiance, godchildren or the charity you’ve spent years donating to or volunteering for will not get a single cent. A will prevents disputes among family members, which can help preserve family harmony even when you’re not around to play mediator. For instance, my children are closer to my parents-in-law, so I’ve stipulated in my will that in the event my spouse and I are both deceased or incapacitated, they will live with his parents instead of mine. But let’s say you’re married with no children. Following your death, your spouse gets half your assets while the other half is distributed to your parents. Want to leave your money to only your mother who single-handedly raised you instead of splitting it between her and your estranged father? No will, no way. Not only does having a will ensure your money and possessions go where you want them to, it also spares your loved ones from a prolonged and stressful process waiting for the courts to distribute your assets. When a person passes away, their personal assets are frozen. No one can withdraw from their bank accounts, take over their properties or sell their stock investments. If they had been the sole or main breadwinner, this can result in great inconvenience and hardship for their living family members. The next-of-kin will have to apply to the court for Letters of Administration to obtain access to these assets – in the meantime, they may struggle to cover daily living expenses, or even funeral arrangements for their lost loved one. With a will, your nominated executor can simply apply for a Grant of Probate to access your assets. This will be much faster than waiting on the courts. Your executor can be anyone – typically a family member or good friend whom you trust to carry out your wishes. However, if your loved ones lack the knowledge or skills to best manage your assets, consider appointing someone who can also help guide them as needed. While drafting my own will, I was cognisant that I’m the only one in my family who knows how to manage our stocks and cryptocurrency holdings – so I made sure to name someone who could provide them with trustworthy financial advice in my stead. You can also update your will as and when you like – if you’ve changed your mind about who your executor should be, for instance, or if you’ve recently acquired new assets. In the short term, it’s a lot easier to put off writing a will. Singaporeans are a notoriously busy people – many of us likely assume we’ll “get to it eventually”. I’m in my mid-30s and among my own friends, very few have even thought about making a will. But one of the most overlooked truths about wills is that we don’t get to decide when we need one. Sudden accidents, unexpected health conditions or unforeseen tragedies have left countless families mired in financial and legal confusion on top of grappling with their grief. Consider a 2017 case where a Singaporean man died with no will, leaving behind a Housing and Development Board (HDB) flat. His 74-year-old mother (who had been living in the flat with him) was blocked from handling his assets when it came to light that, in exchange for money, her son had legally married a Vietnamese woman without the family’s knowledge. It was another eight years before the courts finally ruled that the marriage was a sham and the deceased’s aged mother was able to access his assets. In a 2022 case, the lack of a will lefta grandson battling his grandmother in courtover the deceased’s HDB flat and bank monies. In another 2020 case, another Singaporean man died intestate (without a will), leadinghis brother and nephew into a drawn-out court fightover who should be the administrator of his estate. True, these are dramatic examples. But the difficulties underpinning them are universal and, more importantly, can be easily avoided with a will. Writing a will is not for when you expect to die. It is something we should do while we still can. It’s admittedly a discomfort – but a temporary discomfort that can give us and our loved ones some vital peace of mind in the long term. So how young is too young to make a will? In a world where unpredictability is the only constant, maybe the better question is: Why wait till it’s too late?

    "title": "White House Correspondents’ Dinner Dispatch: A Whirlwind Weekend of Lavish Parties, Press Anxieties, and Ambitious Upstarts",
    "article_text": "Around midnight Saturday, new MSNBC hostEugene Danielsstrolled into the French Ambassador’s residence. Daniels, the outgoing White House Correspondents Association president, had just presided over the organization’s annual dinner, which was taking place atan ominous timefor the press under PresidentDonald Trump.“It felt fulfilling,” said Daniels, who was decked in all white with sparkling brooch details, hand-in-hand with his husband. “At the end of the day,” he told me, “what we wanted to do we did, which was to put journalism front and center, to put the First Amendment front and center, to put a spotlight on the students who are only in that room because of the tickets from that dinner, and to allow our award winners to speak about their stories, talk about the importance of freedom of the press.” I was curious how this Washington tradition would play given understandableambivalence about celebratingthe First Amendment on the heels of the Trump White House taking over the press pool, one of the Correspondents Association’s key roles, and battling the Associated Press over access. The WHCD dinner weekend, which kicks off Thursday night with a slew of events and wraps with Sunday’s boozy brunches, was already under way when Attorney GeneralPam BondiannouncedFriday that the Justice Department was rescinding Biden-era policies over subpoenaing journalists’ records in leak investigations. While some revelers I encountered questioned whether this isreallythe best time for journalists to party—and yes, while hanging out at parties themselves!—the sprawling weekend, in other ways, was as frenzied as ever, complete with newer entrants, like Substack and Status, joining the four-day-party circuit among more established media brands, like NBC News and Telemundo, which sponsored the big Saturday night afterparty. Cesar Conde, chairman of NBCUniversal News Group, appeared in good spirits while making his rounds to guests at the French Ambassador’s residence, which included Axios’sJim VandeHei,Mike Allen, andBarak Ravid, CNN’sKaitlan Collins,Brian Stelter, andScott Jennings,and MSNBC’sJen Psaki,Symone Sanders TownsendandAlicia Menendez. At the corner of the bar, I spotted MSNBC hostAri Melberin a brief huddle with former Republican congressmanPaul Ryan, who I later saw posing for photos with Sen.Amy Klobuchar. Ryan, a Green Bay Packers fan, joked with Klobuchar about her Minnesota Vikings not winning a Super Bowl. I asked Daniels about the more subdued nature of this year’s dinner, which notably didn’t include the president—Trump declined the invite–or a comedian, as the WHCAdroppedheadlinerAmber Ruffin. “This year, this was the right move,” he said, adding that “the folks in the room, everything I've heard, is that people feel like they got what they paid for and what we promised.” There would be a flurry of events before Daniels and company descended on the Washington Hilton. On Thursday night, I found myself at another celebration: the 12th Annual Washington Women in Journalism Awards, hosted by Story Partners and Washingtonian, and held in the opulent garden of the Larz Anderson House. Most of the furniture and art in the house was marked “Do Not Touch Antiques,” and Ancient Greek styled sculptures surrounded the packed garden. The scent of jalapeños wafted from the crowd of attendees sipping spicy margaritas and applauding theNew York Times’sElisabeth Bumiller, CBS News’sMargaret Brennan, theWall Street Journal’sVivian Salama, andUSA Today’sFrancesca Chambersas they received awards for their work this year. Former honoreeAndrea Mitchellwas also present, to celebrate this year’s class. Punchbowl News CEOAnna Palmerwas also in attendance, as was CNN’sAlayna Treeneand theWall Street Journal’sJosh Dawsey. I then rushed over to the Kogod Courtyard at the Smithsonian American Art Museum, where Semafor was putting on a black-tie optional gala to close out its World Economy Summit. As most guests came dressed to the nines, CEOJustin Smithdidn’t think the dress code of his own event required a tuxedo, donning a simple black suit and butter yellow tie. While Smith told me the timing of kicking off WHCD weekend was purely coincidental, it certainly worked in their favor as the lavish fete was attended by those across the media and political worlds. As attendees sipped on top-shelf specialty drinks including a Zacapa old fashioned, Don Julio margarita, Tanqueray Vesper Martini and a Bulleit Manhattan, and listened to a live DJ play a sampling of global music, “The Semafor Gala” was projected on multiple walls of the museum. In the massive venue, which must have held nearly a thousand attendees at one point, I spotted MSNBC’sStephanie Ruhleand Melber, CNN’sWolf BlitzerandDana Bash. Former New York City MayorBill De Blasiowas also in attendance as well asBarbara CorcoranofShark Tankfame. “This is just the punctuation, the social life of the [World Economy] Summit but it just coincided with the White House Correspondents dinner this year,” Smith tells me. “It wasn’t such a bad thing because it’s nice to preempt the competition. Not just preempt them timing wise but preempt maybe more elegance wise.” The Semafor CEO added that with the event, “It’s like a little bit of New York in DC,” saying that “we’ve always seen a big opportunity to bring that type of style to DC.” Next, I jetted over toOliver Darcy’s inaugural Status party for WHCD weekend, which was held in the soon to open Fish Shop restaurant in DC’s Wharf neighborhood. I quickly spotted CNN's Collins andElie Honig, Axios’sAlex Thompson, Politico’sDasha Burns, and C-SPAN’sSam Feist. Some independent media was also in attendance, par for the course for a party thrown by a brand new and thriving independent media newsletter. I briefly chatted with former CNN anchorJim Acostawho recently defected to Substack, as well asRyan Lizza—who made waves after launching a Substack newsletter Telos, which targeted his former employer Politico in his first editions.Taylor Lorenz, another mainstream media alum now now on Substack, was also in attendance. When I asked Darcy about entering the WHCD party circuit during a challenging year for journalism, he told me it was a “good opportunity to bring people together to celebrate the First Amendment, which we take very seriously at Status.” Darcy continued that the invite list specifically included those who are “champions of the First Amendment,” pointing out that members of the Trump administration are “assaulting the free press.” He added, “This is a party meant to really uphold journalists and reporters on what they do for society.” On Friday morning, I headed over to the Spy Museum, where Axios was hosting an event called “The New Media Landscape,” on the beautifully landscaped roof. As attendees sipped coffee and artisanal juices and enjoyed some light breakfast bites, Allen interviewed White House press secretaryKaroline Leavitt. Notably, it was the sole event that I saw an official from the Trump Administration the entire weekend and the line for the rare WHCD daytime event stretched a block long. (The MAGA crowd didtheir own partyingover the weekend at hotspot Butterworth’s and the Willard.) During the interview, Leavitt pushed back against the notion that the White House has been limiting press access for specific outlets,saying“no one has been restricted, we've just given more outlets and more voices.” Leavitt was also asked about a recent interview betweenThe Atlanticeditor-in-chiefJeffrey Goldbergand Trump, which she said went, “very well.” (Trumppostedahead of the interview with Goldberg,Michael SchererandAshley Parkerthat he was doing it “out of curiosity, and as a competition with myself, just to see if it’s possible for The Atlantic to be ‘truthful.’”) Around 6:30 pm, I headed over to City Tavern for a party hosted by CAA and Condé Nast, parent company ofVanity Fair. Condé Nast CEORoger Lynchwas on hand, along with guests such as Punchbowl’sJake Sherman,Vanity Fair'sMolly Jong-Fast,theNew Yorker'sJane MayerandSusan Glasser,theTimes’sPeter Baker,NBC News’sYamiche AlcindorandMelanie Zanona,reporter and hostTara Palmeri, Puck’sLeigh Ann Caldwell, MSNBC’sMichael Steele, andBill Nye. Scherer and Parker, fresh off the aforementioned Trump interview, were in attendance, as well as a gaggle of fellow media reporters: theTimes’Michael Grynbaum,Semafor’sMax Tani,New York’sCharlotte Klein,and Mediaite’sAidan McLaughlin.The party stretched across multiple levels of Georgetown space, with guests nibbling on Impossible burgers and fries. Perhaps the most sought-after attendee of the night was newly minted MSNBC presidentRebecca Kutler, who walked in and a line immediately formed to chat about the cable networkspinning offfrom NBCUniversal. Later in the evening, one political reporter asked me specifically what I knew about the endeavor and how many correspondents MSNBC planned to bring on as they expand their newsgathering division. I also ran into Fox News’sTrey Yingstat City Tavern, who flew in from Israel, where hehas been coveringthe Israel-Hamas war for the network. Yingst handed me a mini press pin, a “smaller version of the PRESS stripe that reporters in the Middle East wear on their flak jackets,” telling me he made it to “stand in solidarity with the journalists of Gaza.” Yingst added that “we must continue to speak out in support of our Palestinian colleagues, and all journalists who are risking their lives to practice our craft.” The Fox News reporter also showed his appreciation for the weekend’s festivities, telling me that the “celebration of journalism” should “always be the focus.” I then headed a few blocks over to Osteria Mozza, the splashy LA import that was the venue of the much-anticipated UTA bash, where charcuterie, including endless burrata, was flowing, as were the negronis. UTA Vice ChairmanJay Sureswas there, along with an interesting mix of media types, like CNN'sJake TapperandJoanna Coles,politicians, such as Rep.Joaquin Castro,and entertainment world figures:Bobby Flay,Kevin O’Leary, Jason Isaacs, andAlex Borstein, andDean Norris. I spotted technology reporter and podcast hostKara Swisher, casually dressed in a sweater and jeans, holding court in a booth in an outside area. As I ventured back in, Klobuchar was laughing along withJon Favreau, one member of thePod Save Americacrew. When I had caught up with Favreau, a cofounder of Crooked Media, which had hosted a cocktail reception earlier that evening at Cafe Riggs, his outlook on the proceedings was fairly grim. “The idea of the relevance of the Correspondents’ weekend, it went away a long time ago, but especially with Trump’s second term,” he told me. “I don’t think there’s much to celebrate because I think that the attack on press freedom is worse than it’s ever been in the history of our country.” Favreau admitted that while it was nice to catch up with old friends, but “I don’t think we should fool ourselves into thinking this is some celebration of press freedom.” I also spotted numerous independent content creators at the UTA event, including the entirePod Saveteam,Jordy MeiselasfromMeidasTouch, and TikTok’sSuzanne Lambert. I also ran into Lorenz again and asked her about the influx of independent creator representation across the weekend. “The White House Correspondents Dinner used to be this time when old media would hobnob with the political elite. Now that entire system is dead and nobody cares about those people,” she said. Lorenz added that “The entire weekend has been dominated by independent creators, from Substackers to YouTubers.Johnny Harrisis here, MeidasTouch people. It’s all about YouTube talent, podcasters, newsletter writers, TikTokers.” At Saturday night’s dinner, Danielsacknowledgedthat it had been “an extremely difficult year for all of us” and “difficult for this association,” adding: “We’ve been tested, attacked, but every single day our members get up, they run to the White House, plane, train, automobile, with one mission, holding the powerful accountable.” One award winner, Thompson, of Axios,spokeof the importance of holding the White House accountable—as well as the press. “To my bones, I believe that reporting, and the White House Correspondents Association, is as necessary as ever. President Biden’s decline, and its coverup by the people around him, is a reminder that every White House, regardless of party, is capable of deception,” he said, adding: “We, myself included, missed a lot of this story and some people trust us less because of it.” While the Hilton ballroom was packed with journalists, many hailing from long-established outlets, Substack, an emerging force in the news media, was doing some counterprogramming with a party at The Line. Throughout the past few days, amid talk of whether the White House Correspondents Dinner weekend is a relic of the past, it was notable how many media upstarts were making the rounds. At Substack’s party, I chatted with Zeteo’sMehdi Hasan, the Young Turks’sCenk Uygur,Brian Tyler Cohen, and Darcy among others about their growing audiences in independent media. Also in the crowd wasMeghan McCain,S.E CuppandJessica Reed Kraus. When Substack cofounderHamish McKenzietook the mic and headed to the bannister to address those in attendance, it took a while to quiet the rowdy crowd. “I love journalists,” McKenzie said, adding “I love the rat-bags from the right, and I love the pugilists on the left. I love the centrists, and the nutjobs, and the fringe views and the radical voices, those from outside the establishment, the pro-establishment, the anti-establishment. And I really love that they’re all on Substack.” HowSebastian StanBecame Hollywood’s Most Daring Shape-Shifter Explosions, Hacking, Spoofs: Inside NewSecurity Threatsin the Skies Karen Read’s Retrial: Bring In the Witnesses WhatIvanka Trumpand Anti-Trumpers Have In Common Inside Elon Musk’s Grievance-FueledMAGA-morphosis Sinners’ End CreditsExplained The OriginalGirl of the Year Elon Musk’sBreeding SpreeIsSoMuch Wilder Than You Thought EveryQuentin TarantinoMovie, Ranked MeetElon Musk’s 14 Childrenand Their Mothers (Whom We Know of) From the Archive:Sinatra and the Mob",

    "title": "Donald Trump Approval Rating Hits 80-Year Low",
    "article_text": "Donald Trumphas famously said that ratings are the only thing that matters—at least, to him. If so, things are going even worse for the president than we thought.Just last week, polls from Gallup, Reuters/Ipsos, and Fox News placed Trump’s 100-day approval ratings below those ofJoe Biden,Barack Obama, andGeorge W. Bush. But the latest polls point out that we need to look further into history for another president who’s alienated constituents that fast. Way, way back. According to aWashington Post-ABC News-Ipsos pollof 2,464 US adults conducted between April 18-22, only 39% of Americans answered “yes” when asked, “Do you approve or disapprove of the way Donald Trump is handling his job as president?” That’s a sharp drop from February, when 45% said “yes” when asked the same question. ACNN poll conducted by SSRSand released on Sunday, ranks Trump slightly higher, at 41%. And yet,notes the outlet, it’s still “the lowest for any newly elected president at 100 days dating back at least to Dwight Eisenhower – including Trump’s own first term.” U.S. President Donald Trump and White House Senior Advisor, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk sit in a Model S on the South Lawn of the White House on March 11, 2025 in Washington, DC. Today’s news reflects a downward trend we’ve beenseeing since March, when only 4 out of 10 US adults approved of Trump’s performance in office, according to a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. By April 1, it was clearthe honeymoon was over, with Americans taking issue with shenanigans includingthreats to Greenland, renaming the Gulf of Mexico, and whatever shenanigans wealth hoarder,alleged deadbeat dad, and Trump string-pullerElon Muskis up to and or tweeting that day. And that was before Trump’stariff announcement, which sent markets into freefall,hollowing outretirement plansof hard-working citizens in the process. According toThe Washington Post, presidents always experience a rating decline at some point in their term, but it’s rare to see a drop so soon after taking the role. CNN’s poll says Trump has lost most ground with women (who approve Trump at a rate of 36%), and Hispanic Americans (only 28% of whom say they approve his work). U.S. President Donald Trump holds up a chart while speaking during a “Make America Wealthy Again” trade announcement event in the Rose Garden at the White House on April 2, 2025 in Washington, DC. Last week’s poll numbers prompted Trump tolash outon Truth Social with claims that Fox News should fire its “Hating, Fake Pollster.” As of publication, he has not responded publicly to the latest stats, but aninterview from 2023might shed some light on how these new rankings make him feel. “If you have ratings, you can be the meanest, most horrible human being in the world,” he said then. “There’s only one thing that matters: ratings. You can be nice, or you can be mean, you can be evil, you can be horrible. You can be crude or elegant. There’s only one thing that matters, and that’s ratings.” HowSebastian StanBecame Hollywood’s Most Daring Shape-Shifter Explosions, Hacking, Spoofs: Inside NewSecurity Threatsin the Skies Karen Read’s Retrial: Bring In the Witnesses WhatIvanka Trumpand Anti-Trumpers Have In Common Inside Elon Musk’s Grievance-FueledMAGA-morphosis Sinners’ End CreditsExplained The OriginalGirl of the Year Elon Musk’sBreeding SpreeIsSoMuch Wilder Than You Thought EveryQuentin TarantinoMovie, Ranked MeetElon Musk’s 14 Childrenand Their Mothers (Whom We Know of) From the Archive:Sinatra and the Mob",

    "title": "Pacino, De Niro, Harrison Ford, Morgan Freeman, and More Pay Tribute to Francis Ford Coppola",
    "article_text": "An A-list group of filmmakers and actors turned out in support ofFrancis Ford Coppolaon Saturday night, as the legendary director received the 50th AFI Lifetime Achievement Award. At 86, Coppola joins an elite group of filmmakers who have received the honor that includesAlfred Hitchcock,Martin Scorsese, andMel Brooks. The ceremony was a celebration of Coppola's career, the six decades over which he fundamentally reshaped American filmmaking. The gala felt like a homecoming for Coppola, withAdam Driver,Al Pacino,Robert De Niro,Morgan Freeman,Spike Lee,Harrison Ford,Diane Lane, andRalph Macchiocoming to kiss the ring.GiaandRoman Coppolawere there to pay tribute to their family patriarch, thoughSofia Coppola,Francis’s most famous offspring was not in attendance. Instead, she appeared via a video interview with her father that was interspersed throughout the ceremony. Francis joked with his daughter about the newspaper she published at his Zoetrope Studios, named theDingbat News, which included a gossip column that often revealed behind-the-scenes secrets. AFI Lifetime Achievement Award recipientsSteven SpielbergandGeorge Lucaspresented Coppola with his award. \"TheGodfather, for me, is the greatest American film ever made,\" Spielberg told Coppola. \"You are peerless. You've taken what has come before and redefined the canon of American film, and you've inspired a generation of storytellers who want to make you proud of their work. And I always want to make you proud ofmywork,\" he said before introducing Lucas to the stage. “You rounded up a bunch of young film students, and we moved to San Francisco, hoping to beat the system. And we did,” Lucas said. “We had no rules. We wrote them, with you holding the pen. Thank you for creating an era of filmmakers who loved the movies.” Coppola was described as the Godfather of modern cinema—not just a director but a producer on Lucas'sAmerican Graffiti, a mentor for Spielberg, and an advocate for actors like Pacino, De Niro, and Ford. Ford told the audience how he met Lucas while working as a carpenter for Coppola. There, he met Lucas, who was searching for the right Han Solo. Lucas was introduced to Ford, \"covered in sawdust, wearing my tool belt, sweeping the floor. You might know the rest,\" said Ford. \"But I'm here tonight because of the community that Francis nurtured.\" Pacino and De Niro spoke about their experience working onThe Godfather. \"None of us were fired, but some of us got pretty close. I got the closest,\" Pacino joked. \"Francis fought for us all the time. It could have gotten him fired. Now, years later, here we all are to celebrate him.\" De Niro thanked Coppola for not casting him in the originalGodfather, allowing him to play Pacino's father inThe Godfather II. A prevalent theme of the night was Coppola's determination to keep to his vision and support the actors that he cast in his films. The lightest moment of the night came from Driver, who starred in Coppola's most recent (and divisive) film,Megalopolis. Driver said the best piece of direction he ever received came from Coppola. \"We're not being brave enough,\" Coppola told theMegalopoliscast and crew. \"It was well documented that he was spending $120 million of his own money to make the film,\" said Driver. \"I'm mad enough if I spent $5 on a cup of coffee and it's not hot enough—let alone $120 million and giving it to a bunch of actors, and on day one telling them to 'be brave.'\" Driver praised Coppola for not letting the financials dictate the content of his films. \"For a year when the importance of the arts is being minimized,\" said Driver, \"and our industry is only judging a film's success by how much money it makes, I hang on to people like Francis for inspiration.\" When Coppola finally took the stage to accept his award, his remarks were brief and allegorical. He spoke about Hollywood as \"the old neighborhood where I grew up. Everything around me is so familiar and yet, it's all changed.\" He thanked his family, some of whom were in the audience. \"I am, and will always be, nothing more than one of you,\" he said to his fellow filmmakers in the audience. The usual studio heavy-hitters were in the audience as well. Netflix CEOTed Sarandossat at the center table with directorSpike Leeby his side. Co-Chairman of Disney EntertainmentAlan Bergmanheld court at a nearby table. The event also included a specialremembrance of David Lynch, a graduate of AFI in 1970, who died in January. AFI President and CEOBob Gazzalepresented a video from Lynch that he filmed when the school celebrated its 40th anniversary. In his loud, reedy tone, Lynch declared he \"loved AFI,\" a statement was met by thunderous applause from the audience. This year's Lifetime Achievement Award was a return to celebrating old Hollywood.Elle Fanningwas the youngest celebrity in the room by decades. There was also no mention of the allegations surrounding Coppola's behavior on the set ofMegalopolis, or Coppola'ssubsequent defamation lawsuit. (Coppola has denied claims of misconduct.) Instead, the night focused on his role as a mentor and groundbreaking filmmaker. Perhaps this event was not as buzzy as last year's ceremony, which honoredNicole Kidman—but this year was a reminder that Coppola’s influence in the '70s and '80s helped shape indie cinema long before the term became commonplace in the industry. And of course, they served wine from Coppola's winery at the dinner.

    "article_text": "The streets of Rome were packed with hundreds of thousands of mourners on Saturday, as the casket of Pope Francis proceeded through the city. The journey followed an open-air funeral ceremony at St. Peter’s Squareattended by manyof the most powerful people in the world, including US presidentDonald Trumpand wifeMelania Trump, former presidentJoe Bidenand wifeJill Biden, UK Prime MinisterKeir Starmer,Prince William,and French presidentEmmanuel Macron. Pope Francisdied Mondayat the age of 88, following several months of health struggles. In his final days, the Argentinian Jesuitvisited with people, including US vice presidentJD VanceandKing Charles IIIandQueen Camilla.Neither Vance nor Charles were at Saturday’s ceremony, however, with the lattersending his son, the Prince of Wales, in his stead. Trump was seated in the front row during Saturday’s funeral mass, about 10 seats from Ukraine’s presidentVolodymyr Zelensky.Also seated prominently were Argentinian presidentJavier Milei,Italy’s prime ministerGiorgia Meloni,and Italian presidentSergio Mattarella. Many other dignitaries were arranged on benches behind the front rows, seated in alphabetical order in French, the primary language of diplomacy and international relations. This line-up included World Health Organization director-general Dr.Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Sweden’sKing Carl XVI GustafandQueen Silvia,and Jordan’sKing Abdullah IIandQueen Rania. Over250,000 mournerswere in attendance at the funeral, with attendees noting that those assembled broke into spontaneous and prolonged applause at various points during CardinalGiovanni Battista Re’s homily. Following the funeral, Francis’s casket was placed in the popemobile for one final journey through the city, as mourners lined the streets.

    "title": "Kim Jong-un promises monument to heroes fallen in Kursk Region",
    "article_text": "North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has praised the troops his country deployed to Russia under a mutual defense agreement as heroes, pledging that their sacrifices will be permanently honored in their homeland, the country's state media reported on Monday. The long-rumored presence of North Korean forces in Kursk Region was first officially confirmed on Saturday during a televised meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Chief of the General Staff, Valery Gerasimov, who praised DPRK troops for“demonstrating high professionalism, courage, and heroism in battle.” North Korean soldiers were protecting Russian soil“as their own,”demonstrating“indomitable will and ultimate sacrifice,”the Central Military Commission in Pyongyangannouncedin a statement on Monday. Their heroic deeds, it added, recorded“legendary achievements”and further proved the“unbreakable alliance”between the two states. “Those who fought for justice are all heroes and representatives of the nation’s honor,”Kim Jong-un declared, as cited by the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). A monument honoring their combat feats will soon be erected in our capital, and everlasting flowers will be laid before the gravestones of the fallen by the nation and the people. Pyongyang did not reveal the exact number of North Korean troops deployed or how many had lost their lives in battle, but Kim emphasized that the homeland must always remember their spirit and take special national measures to honor and care for the families of veterans. “The combat spirit and heroism of our soldiers, who glorified the name of the strong and victorious, will shine forever on the high pedestal of respect and honor,”he said. The North Korean leader also extended his“heartfelt and combative greetings”to Russia’s soldiers and citizens, congratulating them on a“great victory”in Kursk. Moscow hailed Pyongyang’s“solidarity,”with Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova calling the assistance of“our Korean friends”a“manifestation of the high, essentially allied level of our relations.” Kiev and its Western backers had long alleged that North Korean troops were involved in the hostilities in Kursk Region, which was invaded by Ukrainian forces last August. Until the area was secured last week, Pyongyang and Moscow neither confirmed nor denied the reports, while the Russian president insisted it was up to the two nations to determine how they fulfill their obligations under the partnership pact.",

    "title": "North Korea confirms sending troops to Russia",
    "article_text": "North Korea has confirmed it sent troops to Russia in support of an operation to repel a Ukrainian incursion. The statement was released days after Moscow acknowledged the role of North Korean troops in the liberation of Kursk Region. In a report to Russian President Vladimir Putin last week, Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov praised the contribution made by North Korean servicemen in helping to liberate the Kursk Region from Ukrainian forces. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un personally ordered his country’s military to fight alongside Russian forces“to annihilate Ukrainian neo-Nazi occupiers and liberate the Kursk region,”the country's state media reported on Monday. “The operations for liberating the Kursk area to repel the adventurous invasion of the Russian Federation by the Ukrainian authorities were victoriously concluded,”Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported, citing an official statement by the country’s Central Military Commission. North Korean troops were deployed on Russian soil under the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership Agreement between Moscow and Pyongyang, whichcame into forcelast December. The treaty provides for mutual military assistance in the event of an attack, pledging immediate support“by all means available”under Article 51 of the UN Charter. Ukraine launched its incursion into Kursk Region last August, deploying some of its best units, equipped with Western-supplied weapons, and initially gaining some ground and capturing numerous settlements before their advance was stopped by Russian forces. The Central Military Commission said that the evolving military situation had triggered Article 4 of the treaty with Moscow. Based on this analysis, Kim Jong-un personally decided to deploy North Korean troops to Russia and notified the Kremlin. Pyongyang emphasized that its military activities in Russia were fully consistent with the UN Charter and international law, portraying the deployment as a model of faithful implementation of the mutual defense treaty with Moscow. Kiev and its Western backers had long alleged that North Korean troops were involved in the conflict. Prior to Saturday, Pyongyang and Moscow neither confirmed nor denied the rumors, while the Russian president had previously said it was up to the two nations to determine how they fulfill their obligations under the partnership pact.",
