    "article_text": "'The Big Weekend Show' co-hosts discuss a Los Angeles judge allowing the Menendez brothers' resentencing hearing to move forward. An elderly aunt of Lyle and Erik Menendez is in intensive care after prosecutors showedgraphic crime scene imagesduring the brothers' hearing on Friday, according to a spokesperson for the family. The Justice for Erik and Lyle Coalition, a family-led initiative advocating for the release of the brothers, is calling for immediate accountability and oversight following a \"disturbing and reckless decision\" by the Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office during Friday’s court hearing that sent Terry Baralt, 85, to the hospital. \"We are devastated to share that Terry Baralt has been hospitalized and is in critical condition following the Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office’s cruel and careless conduct in court,\" a statement from the family read. \"No physical pain has ever kept her from being there for her nephews. But the display put on by the DA’s office pushed her past the brink.\" Baralt, who is Jose Menendez's sister, is battling colon cancer, but traveled from her home in New Jersey to Los Angeles to support her nephews at their hearing, where the family said she was forced to witness graphic images, including her brother's body.

(AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes)(Associated Press) \"Without notice, prosecutors chose to show a graphic, unredacted image of José’s dead body directly in front of us, his surviving family. No one prepared us. There was no warning, no humanity – just shock and pain inflicted on people who have already endured decades of grief,\" the statement continued. The family spokesperson shared with Fox News Digital that Baralt remains in critical condition at a Los Angeles hospital. The Menendez family has also called for the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office to be removed from the case after showing the graphic images, saying their use of the photo violated California’s Marsy’s Law, which they noted \"guarantees victims the right to be treated with fairness and respect for their privacy and dignity, and free from intimidation, harassment, and abuse throughout the criminal justice process.\" \"This wasn’t just cruel. It was a clear violation of our rights,\" the family wrote. \"The display was retraumatizing, completely avoidable, and we believe it was intentional. The District Attorney’s Office knew what the law required and deliberately chose to ignore it. We are holding them fully responsible for the profound pain we are suffering right now. The shock and heartbreak we feel cannot be put into words.\" IF MENENDEZ BROTHERS ADMIT TO 'LIES,' LOS ANGELES DA MAY RECONSIDER RESENTENCING MOTION TO FREE THEM: REPORT Erik and Lyle Menendez's aunt Joan VanderMolen arrives to attend a hearing at the Van Nuys courthouse in Los Angeles, Monday, Nov. 25, 2024.(AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes) Los Angeles District Attorney Nathan Hochman's office shared a statement with Fox News Digital saying that prosecutors did not intend to \"cause distress or pain\" to those in attendance at the hearing. \"To the extent that the photographic depiction of this conduct upset any of the Menendez family members present in court, we apologize for not giving prior warning that the conduct would be described in detail not only in words but also through a crime scene photo,\" Hochman's office wrote. Hochman's office also explained that the Menendez brothers’ decision to file a habeas petition in 2023 and a request for clemency and resentencing in 2024 was \"certainly going to trigger emotions for all those concerned in a case after staying dormant for over 18 years.\" \"We never intend to cause distress or pain to individuals who attend a court hearing,\" Hochman's office said. \"We understand the nature of the evidence of these heinous double murders was deeply emotional. However, by design, these hearings are intended to be a place where the truth, no matter how painful, is brought to light. That truth starts with the abject brutality and premeditation of the murders themselves.\" CALIFORNIA GOV NEWSOM SETS MENENDEZ BROTHERS PAROLE BOARD HEARING DATE IN BID FOR CLEMENCY Lyle, left, and Erik Menendez sit with defense attorney Leslie Abramson, right, in Beverly Hills Municipal Court during a hearing, Nov. 26, 1990.(AP Photo/Nick Ut) LA County Superior Court Judge Michael Jesic handed down a win to the Menendez brothers during Friday's hearing, deciding against withdrawing their petition for a new trial.

    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. New York Yankeestwo-time MVP slugger Aaron Judge will be Team USA’s captain for the 2026 World Baseball Classic, and he couldn’t be happier to lead the Stars and Stripes against the world’s best talent on the diamond. Speaking at Yankee Stadium after the announcement, Team USA manager Mark DeRosa said that he asked former captain Mike Trout for permission to nameJudgein the role. DeRosa said the Los Angeles Angels superstar responded, \"He’s the one.\" Judge remembered Trout leading out Team USA in the most recent World Baseball Classic finals, where he waved the American flag while walking out onto the field.

It’s a pretty humbling experience. \"Happy to represent the U.S. and happy to be your captain.\" WHAT ARE THE 10 BIGGEST CONTRACTS IN MLB HISTORY? Judge was vocal about his wish to play for Team USA one day, but when the tournament came around in 2023, it was a tough time as he was searching for a free agent contract. Considering what happened toNew York Metscloser Edwin Diaz during a celebration with Team Puerto Rico — he tore his Achilles in a freak accident — Judge wasn’t risking any injury. Judge received a nine-year, $360 million extension with the Yankees, and the captaincy for the franchise to boot. But with the new deal, Judge thought it smart to sit out. New York Yankees outfielder Aaron Judge (99) hits a single against the San Francisco Giants during the fifth inning at Yankee Stadium.(Tom Horak-Imagn Images) But Judge, who won his second MVP this past season, knew the tournament would come around again in 2026. And DeRose immediately thought of Judge when he was named manager. \"I wanted him to be the captain,\" DeRosa told reporters. \"I felt like he’s deserving of it. I watched Mike Trout walk out against Japan holding the flag; I want [Judge] to be that guy.\" Yankees manager Aaron Boone added: \"In a lot of ways, he’s certainly one of the face of baseball. Such a magnetic personality that people gravitate to, that people around the game love and respect. I think he’ll be great.\" New York Yankees outfielder Aaron Judge (99) reacts after catching a pop fly against the San Francisco Giants during the eighth inning at Yankee Stadium.(Tom Horak-Imagn Images) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP While Judge is aboard as Team USA’s captain, the surrounding roster won’t be finalized until next year. In 2023, it came out in early February. However, Judge’s presence should lead other great players from the U.S. to voice their wish to be considered by DeRosa to make the team.

    "title": "White House reportedly bars Associated Press from Oval Office event despite court order",
    "article_text": "President Trump's press secretary Karoline Leavitt touted him as \"the most transparent and accessible president in American history,\" particularly compared to former President Biden. The Associated Press accused the White House ofviolating a court orderafter it was once again banned from an Oval Office event. On Monday, AP writer David Bauderreportedthat a reporter and photographer were barred from attending a news conference with President Donald Trump and El Salvador President Nayib Bukele. This decision came despite U.S. District Judge Trevor N. McFadden ruling last week that the White House had violated the Constitution by blocking the longtime publication’s access to press events. A judge ruled last week that the White House violated the Associated Press' constitutional rights by banning it from some events.(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images | Photo by Chan Long Hei/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) \"The Government offers no other plausible explanation for its treatment of the AP. The Constitution forbids viewpoint discrimination, even in a nonpublic forum like the Oval Office,\" McFadden wrote in his order. ASSOCIATED PRESS SAYS IT WAS BARRED FROM OVAL OFFICE OVER USE OF 'GULF OF MEXICO' McFadden ruled the White House must restore AP’s press access but delayed the order for one week to allow the White House a chance to appeal. According to Bauder’s article, the order was set to take effect on Monday. The AP also reported that McFadden rejected the White House’s request to delay the order on Friday. The White House quickly filed an appeal and set up a hearing with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. circuit for Thursday over whether AP’s access can still be restricted while the case is reviewed. The Associated Press lost access to Oval Office and Air Force One press events in February.(Getty Images) In the meantime, AP spokeswoman Lauren Easton said in a statement that she expects access to be restored. \"Our journalists were blocked from the Oval Office today. We expect the White House to restore AP’s participation in the (White House press) pool as of today, as provided in the injunction order,\" she said. Fox News Digitalreached out to the White House and AP for further comment. The controversy began after Trump signed an executive order renaming the \"Gulf of Mexico\" to the \"Gulf of America\" on his first day in office. The AP later issued style guidance for how the news outlet would refer to the body of water. NYT COLUMNIST 'SYMPATHETIC' TO TRUMP ADMIN BARRING AP FROM OVAL OFFICE, AIR FORCE ONE \"The Gulf of Mexico has carried that name for more than 400 years. The Associated Press will refer to it by its original name while acknowledging the new name Trump has chosen.

PresidentDonald Trumpon Monday once again reiterated that Iran must abandon any hope of obtaining a nuclear weapon as the U.S. prepares for more talks in less than a week. \"Iran has to get rid of the concept of a nuclear weapon.

Details of the discussion remain nil, though they were seen as a launching point as Washington tries to negotiate with Tehran to end its nuclear program. Iranian state media reported that Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi \"briefly spoke\" together during the two-hour meeting, which suggests Tehran viewed the discussions positively given their initial refusal to hold \"direct\" talks. The White House similarly described the talks as \"very positive and constructive,\" though it also conceded that \"very complicated\" issues remain unresolved.

Gavin Newsomsigned a $2.8 billion bailout Monday to close the state's bloated deficit in California's Medicaid program, which surpassed projections due to the program's expansion last year to include illegal immigrants. The move, confirmed by Newsom's office to Fox News Digital Monday afternoon, comes after theDemocratic governorasked lawmakers last month for a $3.4 billion loan from the state's general fund to cover some $6.2 billion in outstanding costs for Medi-Cal, one of the state's primary healthcare programs that takes both federal and state taxpayer dollars. The additional funds will help keep the program running through June for some 15 million Californians, including noncitizens.

Harvard University’s top official told members of the community that theMassachusetts-basedschool will not comply with the Trump administration’s demands, despite risking the loss of grants and contracts to conduct research on \"groundbreaking innovations.\" Harvard President Alan M. Garber sent a defiant letter to members of the university community on Monday, saying \"no government… should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and areas of study and inquiry they can pursue.\" \"For three-quarters of a century, the federal government has awarded grants and contracts to Harvard and other universities to help pay for work that, along with investments by the universities themselves, has led to groundbreaking innovations across a wide range of medical, engineering, and scientific fields,\" Garber wrote. \"These innovations have made countless people in our country and throughout the world healthier and safer. \"Over the last several weeks, the federal government has threatened its partnerships withseveral universities, including Harvard, over accusations of antisemitism on our campuses. These partnerships are among the most productive and beneficial in American history,\" he continued.

The university president said the federal government was risking not just thehealth and well-beingof millions of individuals by retreating from partnerships with Harvard and other universities, but also the economic security and vitality of the country. \"Late Friday night, the administration issued an updated and expanded list of demands, warning that Harvard must comply if we intend to ‘maintain [our] financial relationship with the federal government,’\" Garber wrote. \"It makes clear that the intention is not to work with us to address antisemitism in a cooperative and constructive manner.

The administration’s prescription goes beyond the power of the federal government. It violates Harvard’s First Amendment rights and exceeds the statutory limits of the government’s authority under Title VI. And it threatens our values as a private institution devoted to the pursuit, production, and dissemination of knowledge. \"No government—regardless of which party is in power—should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue,\" he added.

Over the past 15 months, he said, the university has taken many steps to address antisemitism at Harvard, and it plans to do more. For instance, he said the university will continue to nurture a thriving culture of open inquiry on campus and broaden the intellectual and viewpoint diversity within the community. He also said the university will respect free speech and dissent while also ensuring protest occurs in a time, place and manner that does not interfere with teaching, learning and research. And finally, he said Harvard will work together to find ways, consistent withthe law, to foster and support a vibrant community that exemplifies, respects and embraces differences.

The work of addressing our shortcomings, fulfilling our commitments, and embodying our values is ours to define and undertake as a community,\" Garber wrote. \"Freedom of thought and inquiry, along with the government’s longstanding commitment to respect and protect it, has enabled universities to contribute in vital ways to a free society and to healthier, more prosperous lives for people everywhere. All of us share a stake in safeguarding that freedom. We proceed now, as always, with the conviction that the fearless and unfettered pursuit of truth liberates humanity—and with faith in the enduring promise that America’s colleges and universities hold for our country and our world.\" PresidentDonald Trumphas suspended federal funding to every Ivy League, besides Penn and Dartmouth, over investigations into anti-Israel protests that have taken place on their campuses since October 2023. Funding for dozens of other universities has also been impacted by investigations for the same reason.

In a statement to Fox News Digital, a university spokesperson said they are complying with the law. \"The University of South Florida follows all state and federal guidance, policies, and laws related to DEI. USF does not operate a DEI office,\" the spokesperson said. \"As soon as USF was provided the hidden camera video of Heather Klišanin, we began a review of the matter, which is ongoing. Upon initial review of the edited video, it appears that she is referencing Florida law and Florida Board of Governors regulation on DEI that includes an exemption for student-led programs funded by student fees. However, after seeing the video and to ensure USF continues to comply with state and federal laws, USF will require her to complete additional training.\" The Florida lawdoes provide a carveoutfor student-funded activities, but in a press release, AIM suggests that the \"loophole\" talked about in the video might not be legal either. \"However, this ‘loophole’ employed by USF is still likely in violation of state law, because not all student fees are paid through private sources,\" the press release states. \"As of fall 2022, over 74% of Florida residents enrolled at USF received a taxpayer-funded scholarship through the Bright Futures program.\" Florida’s new attorney general, James Uthmeier, says he is working to make his state a place where \"woke\" ideologies like Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), are unwelcome.(Zoom screenshot | George Rose/Getty Images) \"'Federal funds' are those funds provided to the university or direct support organization for a university directly or indirectly by an appropriation by Congress,\" the Florida regulation states on theuniversity system's website. \"This includes financial aid provided to the university by or on behalf of a student attending the university if that financial aid is provided to the student via a governmental aid or grant program. State and federal funds do not include student fees to support student-led organizations notwithstanding any speech or expressive activity by such organizations which would otherwise violate this section, provided that the student fees must be allocated to student-led organizations pursuant to written policies or regulations of each state university, as applicable.\" Later in the video, Klišanin says, \"We're not going to stop supporting the students that we've been supporting in that space and right now it's student-funded, so even if a name changes, they won't have to take away the support.\" The video also shows AIM President Adam Guillette confronting Klišanin, who denies she has been pushing to skirt the DEI laws. \"You're going to need to talk to Carrie O'Brion,\" Klišanin says, pointing Guillette to the school's communications director. Later in the video, Guillette speaks to O'Brion, who seemingly acknowledges that something improper had taken place. \"That's not the policy,\" O'Brion said when confronted about the idea of switching DEI programs to student-funded efforts or changing the names of certain programs. \"DEI is a poisonous ideology that leads to division, hate and antisemitism,\" Guillette told Fox News Digital in a statement. \"It has no place in our education system, and bothGov. DeSantisand the Trump administration must ensure these programs are rooted out of public universities and K-12 schools.\" In a statement to Fox News Digital, DeSantis communications director Bryan Griffin told Fox News Digital, \"Circumventing state laws & rules prohibiting DEI in public universities is unacceptable.

Taxpayer-funded gender transition surgeries remain a vulnerable issue for the Democratic Party that most voters oppose, according to a recent survey by the American Principles Project (APP) targeting likely midterm voters. \"We wanted to help educate Americans, but mostly legislators, about where Americans or how Americans feel about funding for gender identity programs, specifically in healthcare services, especially in lightof Congressdeliberating on spending and doing the reconciliation bills and all of that,\" Terry Schilling, APP executive director, told Fox News Digital in an interview. \"We want to make sure that they knew just how unpopular these programs are to fund by tax dollars.\" The survey, conducted in early April with 1,500 respondents, found that 43% of people who voted for formerVice President Kamala Harrisin the last election are against using taxpayer money to fund gender transition procedures, including surgeries and hormone treatments.

APP is a socially conservative nonprofit advocacy group. During the last few months ofPresident Donald Trump'spresidential campaign, his administration released high-budget ads targeting transgender women in women's sports that may have helped move the needle with swing voters, with one ad famously proclaiming \"Kamala is for they/them, President Trump is for you.\" The ad focused on Harris'track record of ushering in sex change procedures for incarcerated people in California. The survey found that nearly 66% of Americans don't think the federal government should be funding gender transition procedures, including puberty blockers, hormones and surgeries. The survey did not differentiate between minors and adults.

They have to choose between 20 to 30% of the base, which supports paying for gender transitions and surgeries with tax dollars, or the swing voters, which swing voters do not want at all.\" In 2021, formerPresident Joe Bidensigned an executive order directing federal agencies to expand anti-discrimination protections to include sexual orientation and gender identity, including in healthcare. He also reinterpreted Title IX to ensure those same protections applied within educational settings. The administration supported state-level initiatives, suchas Colorado'sinclusion of transgender treatments in its essential health benefits, under the Affordable Care Act. \"I think that the more Donald Trump's been talking about it and bringing attention to it, the more people are going to the Republican side on the issue,\" Schilling said.

During remarks in Vice PresidentJD Vance'shome state, Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., contrasted his vision for America's \"new economic patriotism\" with the future of the Republican Party with Vance at the helm. Considered a 2028 presidential contender in an already crowded field, Khanna's remarks at the City Club of Cleveland seemed to frame an early rivalry between the rising political leaders from opposite ends of the ideological spectrum. While Democratic leaders, who are likely mulling their own presidential runs, have seized opportunities to contrast PresidentDonald Trump'sagenda, Khanna took aim at Trump's likely successor during remarks on Monday. \"Vance and Musk want to completely get government out of the way to usher in a new Gilded Age, so that corporate elites, particularly tech titans, can take the wheel,\" Khanna said. \"I say it's time to turn the tables. It's time to put Silicon Valley in the service of America, not America in the service of Silicon Valley. That's why today I'm calling for a new economic patriotism.

Khanna said Trump and Vance campaigned on restoring economic prosperity to industrial American cities but have presented \"no hopeful vision, no real solutions\" for manufacturing cities in the Rust Belt like Johnstown, Pennsylvania, and Warren, Ohio. Now representing California's Silicon Valley, Khanna called for \"fusing Silicon Valley's ingenuity with Ohio's industrial might.\" CONGRESSMAN CALLS FOR ZUCKERBERG TO ANSWER ON CHINA DEALINGS Ohio GOP Chairman Alex Triantafilou responded to Khanna's remarks in a statement to Fox News Digital: \"Ro Khanna is a far-left socialist from one of the wealthiest and wokest congressional districts in America. He served as an official surrogate for both Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. This speech is nothing but another desperate plea for attention from another elitist politician wholly out-of-touch with Middle Class voters like those in Ohio.\" \"His remarks remind Americans that California extremist liberals like Ro Khanna are responsible for enabling open borders, mass illegal immigration, and the out-of-control government spending of the Biden regime. He should’ve stayed in California.\" While Khanna did attack Trump's tariffs and \"propaganda,\" Khanna was careful to target the joint \"Trump and Vance\" agenda, critique Vance individually and increasingly connect Vance toElon Muskand the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

    "article_text": "Bluestack Strategies founder Maura Gillespie weighs in on the Trump administration excluding some products from tariffs on 'Fox News Live.' President Donald Trump told reporters Monday afternoon that he was \"looking\" into potential part-specific tariff exemptions for carmakers, underscoring Trump's stance that it is important to be \"flexible\" amid the current trade negotiations. Trump's signal about a potential reprieve forauto manufacturerscomes after the administration moved to exempt electronic devices — such as smartphones, iPhones and laptops — from the president's reciprocal tariffs on Friday. Trump's decision to provide certain exemptions falls in line with his stance that it is crucial to be \"flexible\" amid the ongoing trade negotiations, but Democrats have criticized the recent exemptions for adding more uncertainty to the situation. \"I'm looking at something to help some of the car companies, where they are switching to parts that were made in Canada, Mexico and other places,\" the president told reporters from the Oval Office Monday afternoon, during a meeting with El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele. \"They're going to make them here, but they need a little bit of time — so I'm talking about things like that.\" TRUMP, BUKELE FIND COMMON CAUSE ON TRANS SPORTS BAN AND BORDER CRACKDOWN President Donald Trump, right, shakes the hand of El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele during a meeting in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, Monday, April 14, 2025.(Pool via AP) While talking to reporters, Trump alsoreiterated comments he made last weekabout the need to be flexible amid the ongoing tariff negotiations with various countries. \"Look, I'm a very flexible person. I don't change my mind, but I'm flexible, and you have to be. You just can't have a wall, and you'll only — sometimes you have to go around it, under it or above it,\" Trump told reporters. \"There will be maybe things coming… I don't want to hurt anybody, but the end result is we're going to get to the position of greatness for our country.\" A notice published by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol on Friday indicated that smartphones, computers and other electronics would be spared from Trump's 145% import tariffs on Chinese goods. However, the electronics will still be subject to semiconductor tariffs and tariffs related to fentanyl, per the administration and the president. TRUMP'S TARIFF BLITZ NOW EXEMPTING ELECTRICAL GOODS LIKE PHONES, LAPTOPS Trump signaled last week after he paused reciprocal tariff increases on 75 countries that showed a good-faith effort to negotiate new trade deals that he was open to providing exemptions for certain U.S. companies inordinately impacted by the tariffs. The president's signal that more relief could be on the way for carmakers comes after he already provided the industry witha one-month reprievefrom the 25% tariffs imposed on all goods imported from Canada and Mexico, implemented March 4, after speaking with executives with three of the country's largest auto dealers. Trump signaled Monday that he was \"looking\" at potential targeted tariff relief for the auto industry. While Trump has characterized his willingness to provide tariff relief as a sign he is willing to be flexible, Democrats have described the moves to provide relief for certain industries as chaotic and corrupt.(GETTY IMAGES/FOX NEWS) While Trump has characterized his willingness to provide tariff relief as a sign he is willing to be flexible, Democrats have described the moves to provide relief for certain industries as chaotic and corrupt. \"I told Fareed Zakaria this morning: When you start giving an exemption here and an exemption there on tariffs, it's introducing all kinds of corruption into the system,\" Lawrence Summers, former Clinton and Obama administration economic advisor, said Sunday. \"It's introducing what economists call rent seeking, where it's hugely advantageous for people to be friends of the first family and hugely advantageous for people to hire lobbyists. So, the big boom that's being created with tariffs is in a crony capitalism.\" TRUMP VOWS NOBODY GETTING ‘OFF THE HOOK’ FOR ‘UNFAIR’ TRADE BALANCES, SAYS THERE WAS NO TARIFF ‘EXCEPTION’ \"Look, there is no tariff policy. It's just all chaos and corruption,\"Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.,added in an interview with ABC News over the weekend. \"These guys are into chaos and into corruption, and this is the reason that it is time for Congress to step up and to say, under the authority that the president is currently using by declaring these national emergencies — no — the law says specifically Congress can just say, 'There's no national emergency across the board here,' and revoke that authority from the president. That will mean we can go back to having actually a real tariff policy. Congress will have its position in place, and then we can negotiate where we need to negotiate, but we got to stop this craziness.\" Senators Elizabeth Warren and Michael Bennet are asking tech companies for answers following their contributions to President-elect Trump's inaugural fund.(Win McNamee/Oleg Nikishin/Getty Images) Meanwhile, in a weekend Truth Social post following criticism from the likes of people like Warren and Summers, the president sought to defend the move to provide some relief to the electronics industry. \"NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook’ for the unfair trade balances, and Non Monetary Tariff Barriers, that other countries have used against us, especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst!\" said Trump. \"There was no tariff ‘exception’ announced on Friday,\" Trump declared in the post, noting that electronics will still be subject to a 20% tariff related to fentanyl. \"They are just moving to a different Tariff ‘bucket.’ The Fake News knows this, but refuses to report it. We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.\" Fox News Digital reached out to theWhite Housefor comment, and to inquire about further details regarding the potential temporary tariff relief for automakers, but did not receive a response in time for publication.",

Former New York Gov.Andrew Cuomois showcasing the backing of two powerful labor unions as he runs for mayor of the nation's most populous city. The former three-term Democratic governor, who resigned amid multiple scandals in 2021, was endorsed on Monday by the labor groups 32BJ SEIU and Hotel and Gaming Trades Council, which represent building service workers and hotel and casino employees. The endorsements, which are highly coveted in heavily unionizedNew York City,will likely further cement Cuomo's frontrunner status in June's Democratic Party mayoral primary, as he runs to oust embattled Mayor Eric Adams from City Hall. \"The members of @32BJSEIU and @NYHTC are the backbone of NY. They clean our buildings, run our hotels, care for our communities, and keep this city moving. Without a strong middle class, no city can survive – let alone thrive – and right now, we are dangerously close to losing them,\" Cuomo warned in a statement on social media. CUOMO SHOWCASES EYE-POPPING HAUL IN NYC MAYORAL RACE And he highlighted that \"I have fought for and alongside the men and women of 32BJ and HTC for years – their faith in me is a tremendous boost for our campaign and I am proud to have their endorsement.\" The two unions, which combined have over 120,000 workers in their ranks, are the latest organized labor groups to back Cuomo. WHO'S THE FRONT-RUNNER IN NEW YORK CITY'S MAYORAL RACE Cuomo's March 1 campaign launch, into an already crowded field of contenders, rocked the race. With over two months to go until the June 24 primary, Cuomo is the clear polling and fundraising frontrunner in the race for the Democratic mayoral nomination. And the winner of the Democratic primary will be considered the overwhelming frontrunner in November's mayoral election in solidly blue New York City. But now that the 2025 mayoral race is Cuomo's to lose, his rivals are zeroing in on the former governor's immense political baggage. Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo speaks at the New York City District Council of Carpenters while campaigning for mayor of New York City, Sunday, March 2, 2025.(AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson) Cuomo has spent the past four years fighting to clear his name after 11 sexual harassment accusations – which he has repeatedly denied – forced his resignation as governor in August 2021. He was also under investigation for his handling of the COVID pandemic amid allegations his administration vastly understated COVID-related deaths at state nursing homes. The former governor has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.

New York City Mayor Eric Adams speaks during a press conference at City Hall in Manhattan, March 24, 2025.(Reuters/Jeenah Moon) The mayor made repeated overtures to now-PresidentDonald Trump, and in February the Justice Department moved to dismiss the corruption charges, so he could seemingly work with the Trump administration on its illegal immigration crackdown.

STATE DEPT UPGRADES TRAVEL ADVISORY FOR EL SALVADOR, CONSIDERED SAFER THAN FRANCE, OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES Attorney General Pam Bondi and Secretary of State Marco Rubio in the Oval Office as President Donald Trump meets with President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador at the White House, April 14, 2025.(Win McNamee/Getty Images) Bukele then said that despite previous efforts to advance women’s rights and prevent abuse, new efforts would \"backtrack\" on these initiatives and perpetuate violence against women instead. \"I think those laws were great because there were a lot of men abusing women, but now some of the same people are trying to backtrack and actually trying to make new laws allowing men to abuse women, as in sports,\" Bukele said. \"So actually, that doesn't make sense.\" Trump signed an executive order in February barring those assigned male at birth from competing in women’s sports, titled, \"No Men in Women's Sports.\" The order bans those assigned male at birth from using women’s restrooms and orders the Department of Education to spearhead investigations into cases of possible violations.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"The NCAA is an organization made up of 1,100 colleges and universities in all 50 states that collectively enroll more than 530,000 student-athletes. We strongly believe that clear, consistent, and uniform eligibility standards would best serve today's student-athletes instead of a patchwork of conflicting state laws and court decisions. To that end, President Trump's order provides a clear, national standard,\" NCAA President Charlie Baker said in a statement in February. The exchange is one of several emphasizing common ground between Trump and Bukele. The two are partnering to address illegal immigration in the U.S. after the two countries agreed on a $6 million deal to deport hundreds of U.S. deportees to a detention facility in El Salvador this year. Both Trump administration officials and Bukele agreed that they didn't have the authority to return a Maryland resident, Abrego Garcia, to the U.S. who was deported to El Salvador in an \"administrative error\" by the Trump administration. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court upheld last week a lower court's order that \"requires the government to 'facilitate' Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.\" While Attorney General Pam Bondi told reporters that El Salvador would call the final shots on whether it would return the Maryland resident, Bukele said it was \"preposterous\" for El Salvador to do so. \"How can I smuggle a terrorist into the U.S.? I don't have the power to return him to the United States,\" Bukele said. Fox News' Breanne Deppisch contributed to this report.

Peggy Flanagan threw her hat in the ring,while Omarand other top potential candidates remained silent. One of Omar’s fellow\"Squad\" members, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., has been rumored as a potential 2028 primary opponent to Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer. In February, Smith – who was originally appointed by then-Gov. Mark Dayton to succeed Sen. Al Franken after his resignation over sexual misconduct allegations – said in February that she was ready to spend more time with her family. \"This decision is not political, it is entirely personal, but it's not lost on me that our country is in need of strong progressive leadership right now, maybe more than ever,\" Smith said.

We’ve got good folks,\" said Walz, who may insteadconsider a third termin St. Paul.

Thirteen years after herAlzheimer’s diagnosis, a California woman is more vibrant than ever — and she has just embarked on a walk across America to showcase the power of action in healthy aging. Judy Benjamin, PhD, now 80 years old, set off on Saturday, April 5, on a 3,000-mile journey across the country. Over five months, she will walk from San Diego, California, to St. Augustine, Florida. STROKE, DEMENTIA AND DEPRESSION SHARE THESE 17 PREVENTABLE RISK FACTORS \"People wonder why would I put myself through this,\" Benjamin said during an on-camera interview with Fox News Digital the evening before her walk began. \"I really want to share with others not to be discouraged.\"(See the video at the top of this piece.) \"Life is here to enjoy, and age is a number, but you don't have to be identified and characterized by that number.\" Thirteen years after her Alzheimer’s diagnosis, Judy Benjamin (pictured) has  embarked on a walk across America to showcase the power of action in healthy aging.(Judy Benjamin) Benjamin was 67 when she first learned of her early-onsetAlzheimer’s disease. It wasn’t a surprise, as she comes from a long line of relatives who were affected by that form of dementia. Her mother, one of 13 children, was 63 when she was diagnosed, and nine of her uncles also got it. \"So obviously it was very scary for me,\" Benjamin said during an on-camera interview with Fox News Digital the evening before her walk began. NEW BLOOD TEST DIAGNOSES ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE AND MEASURES HOW FAR IT'S PROGRESSED After her mother passed away, Benjamin — who had a high-pressure job at the time — started getting symptoms. \"I was working overseas and started to get really worried because I couldn't remember things — even my own phone number or locker combination,\" she recalled. \"I got lost driving, when I'm always really good about direction.\" Benjamin was 67 when she first learned of her early-onset Alzheimer’s disease.

A close friend recommended a doctor in California, Dr. Dale Bredesen, who was doing someinnovative researchon treating Alzheimer's. \"He explained his theory that Alzheimer's is not caused by one thing — it’s a number of different assaults on the brain, which causes it to become inflamed,\" she said. \"And he said it was different for everybody. Some people are more affected by some things than others.\" ALCOHOL LINKED TO BRAIN DAMAGE FOR HEAVY DRINKERS, STUDY FINDS Bredesen worked with Benjamin to help her reduce the inflammation through a number of steps. \"So I wrote down what he recommended, and I flew back home and I started implementing it to the letter — Ichanged my whole lifestyle,\" she shared. Some of those lifestyle changes involved optimizing her sleep, ensuring healthy indoor air, incorporating meditation to reduce stress and starting anexercise routine. \"It’s super important to follow all of the instructions to do what you need to do, and not be casual about it,\" Benjamin said about her new healthy living guidance.(Judy Benjamin) \"I also totally changed my diet,\" Benjamin shared. \"I stopped drinking diet soda, stopped eating sugar, and started eating more whole foods andnatural foods— like vegetables and fruit.\" \"It’s super important to follow all of the instructions to do what you need to do, and not be casual about it.\" Gradually, she said, things started to change.

That’s not easy. You’re the first ones.\" It certainly wasn't easy for the Buckeyes, especially after suffering some tough losses during the regular season, which Trump brought up. They fell to Oregon, a College Football Playoff team, and Michigan, a team they were expected to beat on their home turf, but couldn't get its offense going. \"I shouldn’t say this. I actually said, ‘Should I leave this line out?’ And they said, ‘Sir, they want to hear the whole thing,'\" Trump said. \"The bad and the good, right?

You represented the state of Ohio well. You represented the whole country well.\" Trump commended the Buckeyes for battling through the 12-man playoff, especially after tough losses to the Oregon Ducks and Michigan Wolverines, the latter of which being Ohio State's most bitter rival.

    "article_text": "Colin Cowherd reacts to Rory McIlroy winning the Masters in a playoff thriller and completing the career Grand Slam. One formerPGA Tourpro wanted CBS broadcaster Jim Nantz to jab into Rory McIlroy more after missing his par putt on the 18th green that would’ve won him The Masters without needing a playoff. As McIlroy made his way out of the bunker, he had a few feet to save par and his green jacket atAugusta National Golf Clubon Sunday. But his putt stayed left and he missed on his 72nd hole of the tournament, forcing a sudden-death playoff with Justin Rose, who sunk a birdie on the same green earlier to finish 11-under. Of course, McIlroy went on to birdie the 18th in that playoff, and he was pure emotion on the green while patrons roared around him as he completed the career Grand Slam.

JUSTIN ROSE REACTS TO RESULTS OF LAST 2 MAJOR TOURNAMENTS: ‘IT DOES HURT’ Elkington, the 62-year-old Australian, felt Nantz and the rest of the broadcasters had to be more critical of McIlroy in that moment. It could’ve been an epic collapse for the man who not only hadn’t won The Masters, but also missed out on a major victory over the last 11 years, including a putting meltdown in the 2024 U.S. Open. Elkington continued to critique McIlroy, saying his approach on No. 18 from 125 yards out is about as easy as it comes for pros. \"That was a wedge into the right bunker on 18… A wedge,\" he said. Rory McIlroy holds the Masters championship trophy at Augusta National Golf Club.(Kyle Terada-Imagn Images) While Elkington was critical, there were many who loved what Nantz and CBS were doing in these high-stress moments, allowing the suspense to carry the broadcast as McIlroy worked his way through his tumultuous final round. When McIlroy buried his birdie putt in the playoff, and dropped to his knees, Nantz simply said, \"Rory has his masterpiece.\" From there, almost seven minutes went by without a word from Nantz or anyone else, as McIlroy made his way off the green and met his family and team for an emotional celebration.

    "article_text": "WWE champion Cody Rhodes talks to Fox News Digital about the upcoming title match against John Cena at WrestleMania 41. WWEChief Content Officer Paul Levesque pulled back the curtain on the idea that John Cena would become the bad guy for at least the beginning of his farewell tour from the company. Cena sided with Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson at Elimination Chamber and participated in a beatdown of Cody Rhodes after winning his match to punch his ticket toWrestleMania 41. It was a shocking moment that left pro wrestling fans, and sports fans in general, stunned. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM John Cena, right, in action against Cody Rhodes during WWE Elimination Chamber at Rogers Centre on March 1, 2025 in Toronto.(Rich Freeda/WWE via Getty Images) Levesque, who was better known as Triple H during his in-ring career at WWE, appeared on\"High Performance\"and talked about the decision to turn Cena heel. Levesque recalled wrestling Cena in the late 2000s and the fans growing bored with his \"hustle, loyalty, respect\" good-guy gimmick. As Cena announced his final run, Levesque noted that he could have done the easy thing but decided to toy with the idea of fully turning Cena’s character. \"In my mind … the safe thing to do is a yearlong tour where you goes town to town, and he does his greatest hits, and it’s safe, and it’s easy, and it’s fun. But, as a performer, you’re sort of going through the motions,\" he said. \"You’re playing the same concert you’ve played a million times. People love it, but I’ve seen it. It’s nice, it’s all those things, safe, easy, fun all that stuff. \"But I went to John and said what if, what if we pulled the lever that no one ever wanted to pull and what if we turn you heel because to me it sort of felt like, if you never do it, boy, you just kinda let that dangling there. … Then, to me, we get to write for this guy that’s been the ultimate good guy for 20-plus years. We get to turn him bad and how does that look?\" John Cena, right, hugs Cody Rhodes during WWE Elimination Chamber at Rogers Centre on March 1, 2025 in Toronto.(Georgiana Dallas/WWE via Getty Images) TOM BRADY TEASES WRESTLEMANIA 41 APPEARANCE Levesque said he went over what exactly happened at Elimination Chamber, which took place in March. Rhodes is asked to sell his soul to The Rock, sides with the fans, gets seemingly congratulated by Cena, and then, Cena kicks him in the groin. \"Bad guys have to be justified in the ‘why.’ It has to make sense and it can be skewed to like, ‘Well that makes sense. I don’t agree with that. I think he’s wrong. I don’t agree with it. But I see how he could think that.,’\" Levesque said. \"So, in John’s mind, for 20-plus years, ‘I’ve done everything the right way, yet you’ve told me I suck, you’ve booed me and you’ve said I’m Super Cena, I can’t wrestle, I only have five moves, I this, I that,’ like all the things he’s overcome for 25 years, you can now flip that on them and be bitter. In your last run, in your desire to have one last big, successful run, ‘I know my time is running out and if I’m going to do this, I might not be as good as I used to be. I might not be as fast, I might not be as strong, I might not be as good of a performer, so I have to sell myself out. I have to cheat. I have to do things that I wouldn’t have done the rest of my career because of hustle, loyalty respect, I wouldn’t have done those things but now I will be because I’m desperate in my last hours.’ It makes sense for the character. Levesque said Cena told him he did not think that was where he would have gone for the last hurrah, but he said, \"I f---ing love it.\" He added that Cena was up for the challenge of making the crowd hate him. Cena received a tremendous amount of boos as he appeared on \"Monday Night Raw\" a few times while the company was in Europe. He blamed the fans for creating the person who he is now, vowedto \"ruin wrestling\"and win his record-breaking 17th championship.

Bueckers leads the 2025 class that is set to embark on a journey to the pros.

Rory McIlroy admitted in his post-final round interview with reporters that dropping to his knees after watching his playoff birdie putt sink to win the 89thMasters tournamentwas pure relief. \"That was all relief, there wasn’t much joy in that reaction,\" he said when one reporter asked what emotions he was feeling when he defeated Justin Rose in the first Masters playoff since 2017. \"It was all relief. Then, the joy came pretty soon after that. I’ve been coming here 17 years, and it was a good decade-plus of emotion that came out of me there.\" McIlroy waited 11 years to not only break his major-win drought, but, more importantly, etch his name alongside thefive golfgreats who collected the career Grand Slam with every major victory on their resume. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Rory McIlroy holds the Masters championship trophy during the final round of the Masters Tournament at Augusta National Golf Club.(Kyle Terada-Imagn Images) McIlroy has been hearing it from the likes of Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus andTiger Woods, all of whom have the Grand Slam, for years. They believed he would win at Augusta National Golf Club one day, and after coming so close in the past, McIlroy admitted feeling slightly skeptical about ever getting the green jacket fitted for himself. However, as he stood up on the podium, the green jacket already placed on his back by the 2024 champion Scottie Scheffler, he looked over at his daughter, Poppy, and delivered quite the heartfelt message after living it out on Sunday. \"Over to my left, my family, my team,\" McIlroy said while holding back some tears. \"They’ve been on this journey with my the whole way through. They know the burden I’ve carried to come here every year and try and try and try again. MASTERS OFFICIALS PENALIZE GOLFER OVER BALL MOVE \"The one thing I would say to my daughter, Poppy, who’s sitting over there: never give up on your dreams. Never, ever give up on your dreams. Keep coming back, keep working hard, and if you put your mind to it, you can do anything. Love you.\" McIlroy entered his 17th Masters appearance carrying the same weight on his shoulders of not having won a major since the 2014 Open Championship, and he posted back-to-back rounds of 66 on Friday and Saturday to enter Sunday with a two-stroke lead over Bryson DeChambeau. DeChambeau was just one of the golfers who has hoisted a major during the 11-year drought McIlroy has had to endure, coming at the 2024 U.S. Open in what was a brutal meltdown for the latter. Rory McIlroy holds the Masters championship trophy while posing for photographs with his wife, Erica Stoll, and daughter, Poppy, at the green jacket ceremony during the final round of the Masters Tournament at Augusta National Golf Club.(Kyle Terada-Imagn Images) \"The U.S. Open last year was just awful,\" McIlroy mentioned when asked the low point of his major drought, while also adding the 2022 Open Championship loss to Cam Smith at St. Andrews. \"The losses are hard, and again, so proud of myself that I keep coming back and put myself in these positions to win championships.\" It was an emotional and physical roller coaster for McIlroy, who did not make it easy on himself throughout the round. It was up and down throughout, and just when it appeared he was in full control on the second nine, he faltered at the 13th with an approach that landed in the water. From there, McIlroy would get his lead back heading into the 18th tee, needing only par to let all the weight on his shoulder go. However, he missed the short par putt, which led to a sudden-death playoff with Rose, who was also searching for his first green jacket in 20 appearances at The Masters. However, McIlroy never lost faith, and he said his longtime caddy, Harry Diamond, helped him on the golf cart ride back to the 18th tee box. \"After scoring, Harry and I were walking to the golf cart to bring us back. He said, ‘Well, pal, we would’ve taken this on Monday morning.’ Absolutely we would’ve. That was a nice reset. ‘You would’ve given your right arm to be in a playoff at the start of the week.’ That reframed it for me.\" McIlroy hit the same exact tee shot he did on his 72nd hole of the tournament, and his approach was much better this time, sloping back down to a two-foot birdie putt. After Rose's miss, McIlroy had the chance to turn dreams into reality, and he did not waste it this time. As one would expect, McIlroy could not contain his emotions, and the tears continued to flow as he hugged his wife and daughter, as well as many others on his team, as he made his way to Butler Cabin.

    "title": "What is quantum internet? Why it could change the internet forever",
    "article_text": "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson discusses tips on how to protect your data amid AI privacy concerns and Ford filing a patent to bring the stick shift to electric vehicles. Imagine an internet where your data can’t be stolen, your messages are completely private and online security is unbreakable. That’s the promise of quantum internet: a futuristic technology that could completely change how we connect online. Here’s a look at what quantum internet is, how it works and why it might be the future of online security. STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS – SIGN UP FOR KURT’S ‘THE CYBERGUY REPORT’ NOW Illustration of future tech(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) Quantum internet is a next-generation network that uses the power of physics to send data in a way that’s ultra-secure and computationally infeasible to hack. Quantum internet, quantum networks and quantum communication are all connected but have different roles. Quantum internet refers to the entire system that allows ultra-secure communication. Quantum networks are the infrastructure that connect quantum devices. Quantum communication is the actual exchange of information over these networks. Unlike today’s internet, which sends data as either a 0 or a 1, quantum internet relies on quantum bits, or qubits, which can exist as both 0 and 1 at the same time. This results in an encryption method that is nearly impossible to break, making it one of the most secure ways to communicate. What makes quantum internet even safer is a phenomenon called entanglement. When qubits become entangled, they stay connected no matter how far apart they are. If one qubit is changed, the other changes instantly. Any attempt to disrupt the entanglement, such as hacking, would immediately alert both people communicating. Man surfing the internet on his laptop(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) SELLING ON THE INTERNET? BEWARE OF SNEAKY TACTICS SCAMMERS USE TO TRICK YOU One of the biggest breakthroughs of quantum internet is its potential to eliminate hacking and data breaches. Here’s how. Quantum internet could completely redefine online privacy, making it harder for hackers, corporations or even governments to access personal data. Here’s how it could transform your online experience. Tablet showing a username and password screen(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) HOW TO SPEED UP YOUR WI-FI AND INTERNET CONNECTION While the potential of quantum internet is exciting, there are still hurdles to overcome. The technology is still in early development, with most experiments confined to research labs. Unlike the traditional internet, quantum networks need specialized equipment to keep signals strong across cities or even countries. Developing this technology requires massive investments and breakthroughs before quantum internet can become widely available. Another key challenge is the transition from today’s internet to quantum internet. Since most existing technology is built for current networks, the shift won’t happen overnight. Instead, hybrid systems that combine elements of both traditional and quantum communication can serve as a bridge, helping businesses, governments and everyday users to adapt without disrupting the current digital infrastructure. Despite these challenges, progress is happening. Major countries, including the U.S., are investing heavily in quantum research, and scientists have successfully demonstrated that the technology works. While it may take years before quantum internet reaches everyday users, these breakthroughs are laying the foundation for a safer, more private digital future. While quantum internet is a ways away, it's important to stay safe on the internet we use today. Until that new technology arrives, here are a few ways to protect yourself online. 1) Have strong antivirus software:Until a more secure internet becomes available, it's important to use tools that help protect against everyday threats like unsafe links and malware. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. 2) Be careful when using public Wi-Fi:Public Wi-Fi remains one of the easiest ways for hackers to access your data.The temptations and risks of free Wi-Fimake it important to think twice before connecting to an unsecured network. Avoid logging into sensitive accounts or entering personal details unless you're using a VPN or other form of encryption. 3) Use a VPN:Consider using a VPN to protect against hackers snooping on your device as well. VPNs will protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location and the websites that you visit. A reliable VPN is essential for protecting your online privacy and ensuring a secure, high-speed connection.For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on yourWindows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. 4) Invest in personal data removal services:While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.Check out my top picks for data removal services here. 5) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):Until more advanced security becomes mainstream,2FAis a simple way to protect your accounts. It adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second step to log in, like a code sent to your phone. For even stronger protection, consider using asecurity keythat plugs into your device. Quantum internet represents a large shift in how we think about communication, privacy and security. By harnessing the power of physics, it promises to create a network that’s faster, more secure and more private than anything we’ve seen before. While the technology is still emerging, it has the potential to change the internet forever. What are your initial reactions to the concept of quantum internet?

    "article_text": "Kawasaki's CORLEO is a hydrogen-powered, AI-driven rideable robot. Tech expert Kurt Knutsson reports on this new way of thinking about off-road transportation. What if your next off-road ride wasn’t on a motorcycle or ATV but on a robot that moves like a wolf? Kawasaki Heavy Industries has introduced something that feels straight out of a video game: CORLEO, a hydrogen-powered, four-legged robot prototype designed to be ridden by humans. Unveiled at the Osaka-Kansai Expo 2025, this futuristic machine is built to handle rugged terrain with ease, combining cutting-edge robotics and sustainable energy. Let’s take a closer look at what makes CORLEO so cutting-edge. STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS – SIGN UP FOR KURT’S ‘THE CYBERGUY REPORT’ NOW Hydrogen-powered, four-legged robot concept (Kawasaki Heavy Industries)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) CORLEOisn’t your typical off-road vehicle. Instead of wheels, it has four robotic legs that move independently, allowing it to handle uneven ground like rocks, grass and steep inclines. Kawasaki says the design was inspired by the skeletal structure of lions. The name CORLEO is derived from Cor Leonis, the brightest star in the constellation Leo. Riders mount it like they would a horse, but instead of gripping handlebars or using pedals, you control CORLEO with your body. Lean forward, and it moves ahead. Shift your weight to the side, and it adjusts its steps accordingly. CORLEO is also environmentally friendly. It uses a battery paired with a 150cc hydrogen engine. The hydrogen engine generates electricity, which is stored in the battery. Kawasaki has been pushing hydrogen-powered vehicles for years, and CORLEO is their latest effort to combine sustainability with innovation. Hydrogen-powered, four-legged robot concept (Kawasaki Heavy Industries)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) HUMANOID ROBOT BREAKDANCES ITS WAY INTO HISTORY CORLEO isn’t just about getting from point A to point B. It’s packed with advanced features that make it feel like something out of the future. Hydrogen-powered, four-legged robot concept (Kawasaki Heavy Industries)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) WORLD'S FIRST AI-POWERED INDUSTRIAL SUPER-HUMANOID ROBOT CORLEO's sleek design is as impressive as its tech. Built with durable materials like metal and carbon fiber, it’s tough enough for outdoor adventures while still looking futuristic. Fans of video games might notice some similarities to designs from Horizon Zero Dawn, which reportedly inspired some of its aesthetics. Hydrogen-powered, four-legged robot concept (Kawasaki Heavy Industries)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) HUMANOID ROBOT STUNS WITH PERFECT SIDE FLIP ACROBATICS Right now, CORLEO is still in the prototype phase, so there are some unanswered questions, like how fast it can go or how far it can travel on a full tank of hydrogen. And while the idea of riding a robotic wolf sounds amazing, we’ll have to wait a while before it becomes available. Kawasaki estimates it could take up to 25 years before something like CORLEO hits the market. Still, this concept shows where off-road vehicles could be headed in the future. Kawasaki sees CORLEO as an alternative to traditional motorcycles or ATVs, something that could make exploring tough terrains safer, easier and more sustainable. Hydrogen-powered, four-legged robot concept (Kawasaki Heavy Industries)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) CORLEO is part of Kawasaki’s growing focus on robotics. The company has been making industrial robots for decades and recently expanded into new areas like collaborative robots (designed for manufacturing) and educational robots for classrooms. For example: With CORLEO, Kawasaki is showing how its expertise in robotics can go beyond factories and classrooms into outdoor adventures. SUBSCRIBE TO KURT'S YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR QUICK VIDEO TIPS ON HOW TO WORK ALL OF YOUR TECH DEVICES Hydrogen-powered, four-legged robot concept (Kawasaki Heavy Industries)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) Kawasaki’s CORLEO is an entirely new way of thinking about off-road transportation. By combining robotics, AI and clean energy, Kawasaki is imagining a future where adventure meets sustainability. While we might not see robots like CORLEO on trails anytime soon, it’s worth thinking about how this technology could change outdoor adventures forever. Who wouldn’t want to ride a robot inspired by nature’s most agile creatures? Would you feel safe riding a robot like Kawasaki's CORLEO across rugged terrain? Why or why not?

    "title": "VICTOR DAVIS HANSON: 10 tough Trump tariff questions critics don't want to answer",
    "article_text": "'Hannity' panelists Victor Davis Hanson and Brian Brenberg discuss President Donald Trump ramping up pressure on China on 'Hannity.' Here are ten tariff questions that aren’t being asked — but should be. Many call the American effort to obtain either tariff parity or a reduction in the roughly $1 trillion trade deficit and 50 years of consecutive trade deficits a \"trade war.\" But then what do they call the policies of the past half-century by Europe, Asia,Chinaand others to ensure asymmetrical tariffs, pseudo-health and security trade restrictions, and large surpluses? A trade peace? Trade fairness? Why do most nations prefer trade surpluses and protective tariffs? Are Europe, Asia, China and others stupid? Are they suicidal in continuing their trade surpluses and protective or asymmetrical tariffs? Is the United States uniquely brilliant in maintaining a half-century of cumulative trade deficits? Do Americans alone discover the advantages of a $1 trillion annualtrade deficitand small or nonexistent tariffs? Why don’t America’s trading partners prefer deficits like ours — given we supposedly believe they are either advantageous or perhaps irrelevant? Would our trade partners prefer to have America’s supposed benefits of a $1 trillion trade deficit? Would the United States then \"suffer\" like they do by running up $200 billion annual surpluses? What would now be the reaction of the stock market if over the last decade, wages had increased at the rate of stocks — and stocks at the rate of wages? Is Wall Street’s meltdown a fear of what might happen in the future? Or is it reacting to March’s latest jobs report that there were 93,000 more jobs created than predicted? Was the Wall Street panic predicated on reports of much lower oil prices? Did the furor arise over theMarch inflation reportthat the annualized inflation rate dipped to 2.6% per year? Is Wall Street’s worry thatDonald Trump’simpending tax cuts, more deregulation, greater budget cuts and continued efforts to eliminate budget deficits and reduce national debt will stall economic growth? If the US were running a $63 billion-plus trade surplus with Canada, refusing to meet its NATO requirements to spend 2% of GDP on defense, and instead spent only 1.37%, would Canada become concerned? If Mexico were running a $171 billion trade deficit with the U.S., if Americans in Mexico were sending over $60 billion per year out ofMexicoto the US, and if American drug dealers were making $20 billion by selling fentanyl and opioids to Mexico, would Mexico be angry? Is the current panic over tariffs amplified by Trump’s other policies? Is the sudden end of 10,000 illegal entries a day bothering Wall Street? Are the media furious that the Red Sea is suddenly navigable again, the Houthis in Yemen curtailing their attacks? Is the outrage due to the targeting of approximately $200 billion in budget cuts or plans to shave off $500 billion from the annual budget? Does the conundrum arise because Trump is sanctioning Iran, unapologetically supporting Israel and seeking an end to theUkraine war? Should Trump try to match former President Joe Biden’s $7 trillion addition to the national debt? Should he return to allowing 12 million illegal aliens into the country? Was the 2021Afghanistanpullout a good model? Is Wall Street worried that Trump may copy theBiden New Green Deal, his electric vehicle mandates and more green regulations? Why are 70 countries now wishing to negotiate tariffs with America, either down to zero or reciprocally to the same rate as ours? Is that a good thing? If so, why did our trade partners not wish to lower their trade barriers far earlier? Did they suddenly and spontaneously decide they were acting unfairly and, on their own prompt, now want to make amends? What’s next? If there soon is a rush of nations to cut a deal with the United States so as not to be left out of theAmerican market, will there follow another hysterical Wall Street spasm — not to sell, but instead to buy stocks at bargain prices? Victor Davis Hanson is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and the author most recently of \"The Dying Citizen.\"",

    "title": "Democrats still haven't learned one important lesson from the 2024 election",
    "article_text": "Secretary of Education Linda McMahon joined 'Fox & Friends' to discuss President Donald Trump's push to abolish the department, the administration's stance on anti-Israel college protests and DOGE's role within the Cabinet. The 2024 election was a wake-up call for Democrats, but five months later, they’re still asleep. Donald Trump’s win over Kamala Harris—fueled by a 9-point lead among parents—made the GOP the Parents’ Party. Trump campaigned hard on school choice, ousting transgender ideology from classrooms, and banning critical race theory (CRT) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) nonsense. Harris barely mentionededucation. Two polls from AtlasIntel, a top-tier pollster, showed Trump beating her on this issue. Yet, Democrats aren’t learning—they’re doubling down on policies that repel families and defy reason. In Colorado, House Democrats passed House Bill 25-1312 on Sunday, by a vote of 36 to 20, which could strip custody from parents who don’t affirm their child’s \"chosen gender,\" and House Bill 25-1309, mandating health benefit plans cover \"gender-affirming care\"—including surgeries and hormones—while rejecting a Republican amendment to exclude kids. Ironically, they rammed these transgender insanity bills through during a special Sunday session, a move dripping with symbolism as they trampled parental rights on a day many families reserve for faith and rest. Colorado Democrats even voted to invoke Rule 16 to shut down debate on these bills, bulldozing opposition to rush their agenda. Colorado Democrat Rep. Yara Zokaie compared parent groups opposing House Bill 25-1312 to the KKK, smearing them as hate groups during an April 2025 committee hearing, showing how far Democrats will go to demonize dissent. Colorado Republican Rep. Jarvis Caldwell blasted this bill, saying, \"If they confuse your children and you don’t affirm that confusion, they will take your child from you.\" TRUMP'S WRITTEN A DEI GOVERNMENT DEATH SENTENCE. SCHOOL POLICIES SHOULD BE NEXT In Illinois, Democrats are pushing to regulatehomeschoolingin 2025, with House Bill 2827 passing committee last month on an 8-to-4 party-line vote. Over 42,000 people signed witness slips opposing it—a deafening roar—but every Democrat ignored them, defying the public’s will. If it passes, homeschool parents could face fines and up to 30 days in jail for noncompliance, a draconian attack on families fleeing failing schools. In Washington state, House Democrats in January, voted down an amendment to House Bill 1296 requiring immediate parental notification if a student is a victim of sexual misconduct by a school employee. Senate Majority Leader Jamie Pedersen, D-Seattle, doubled down in a Fox News interview in February, saying: \"Kids over 13 have the complete right to make their own decisions about their mental health care. Parents don’t have the right to have notice. They don’t have the right to have consent about that.\" Meanwhile, in West Virginia, every House Democrat voted against a Parents’ Bill of Rights in March, rejecting basic transparency and control for families. Nationally, every Senate Democrat blocked the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act, ensuring it couldn’t overcome a filibuster. Even Rahm Emanuel, Obama’s ex-chief of staff, sees the mess. In an April interview with Chris Cillizza, he urged Democrats to apologize for school closures during COVID, admitting they cratered kids academically and mentally. A 2023 American Economic Review study showed closures slashed math and reading scores, with low-income kids hit hardest, while a 2022 JAMA Pediatrics study linked them to soaring anxiety and depression. Teachers’ unions, like the NEA and AFT, pushed these closures, and they give 99% of their campaign cash to Democrats. Emanuel’s call is ironic—he’s famous for saying, \"Never let a crisis go to waste\"—yet his party keeps wasting this one, fighting school choice at every turn. Trumpread the room. Parents are fed up with unions and bureaucrats turning schools into woke labs. His school choice pitch empowers families. His pledge to end transgender policies—like boys in girls’ sports—matches public sentiment. His CRT-DEI ban taps disgust with divisive curricula. AtlasIntel’s polls didn’t just show Trump winningeducation; they signaled a realignment. Democrats once dominated this turf. Now, they’re losing parents fast. A January New York Times/Ipsos poll found 79% oppose men in women’s sports—67% of Democrats, 94% of Republicans. A 2024 Center Square poll showed 59% support a federal ban on procedures such as puberty blockers and gender reassignment surgeries for minors. A 2023 Washington Post/KFF poll found 68% of adults oppose puberty blockers for kids ages 10 to 14. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION On school choice, a 2023 RealClear Opinion Research poll found 71% support nationwide—66% of Democrats, 80% of Republicans—crossing party lines. Trump hammered these; Harris dodged. Post-November,Democratsaren’t reflecting—they’re plowing ahead. Illinois’s House Bill 2827 targets parents fleeing public schools. Colorado’s bills prioritize ideology over evidence: no studies justify blockers or surgeries for kids. Washington’s secrecy and Pedersen’s stance clash with their base’s views, as does West Virginia’s rejection of parental rights. Democrats keep strangling school choice, ignoring 71% public backing. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP A glimmer of hope exists. Rep. La Shawn Ford, D-Ill., slammed House Bill 2827 as overreach, hinting dissent. But party leaders stay tied to unions, blind to voters screaming for change. Trump’s 9-point parent-vote win was a mandate: families want choice, not coercion; math, not Marxism; safety, not secrecy. Democrats could pivot—apologize, embrace options, respect biology. Instead, they’re betting parents won’t care. They’re wrong. November 2024 was a warning. The Parents’ Party is rising, and unless Democrats wake up, they’ll keep losing the people they claim to fight for.

    "title": "SEN MAGGIE HASSAN: Trump could be surrendering one of our strongest weapons in the fight against fentanyl",
    "article_text": "Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., told ABC \"This Week\" in an interview that aired Sunday that \"nobody thinks that illegal immigration is appropriate.\" (ABC) PROGRAMMING ALERT:Watch Sen. Maggie Hassan discuss this topic and more on \"America's Newsroom\" on Monday, April 14. The Trump administration recently released an intelligence report declaring thatillicit fentanylranks among the top threats to our security. I agree. And that’s why I’m alarmed that the Trump administration is poised to ignore its own report and surrender one of our strongest weapons in the fight against fentanyl: Medicaid. My home state of New Hampshire and communities all across our country have been hit hard by thefentanyl crisis. Despite my many strong disagreements with President Trump, we were able to come together during his first term on a bipartisan basis to go after fentanyl traffickers. We developed a multipronged strategy which included strengthening border security to choke off the flow of drugs, giving local law enforcement the tools that they need to protect our communities, and making it easier for more people who struggle with addiction to get treatment. That last part is especially important because the more people who get into and stay in recovery, the lower the demand is for fentanyl. What many people may not realize is that every day people nationwide get access toaddiction treatmentthanks to Medicaid coverage, especially coverage offered under what is known as Medicaid Expansion. Prior to Medicaid Expansion, many people who suffered from addiction couldn’t get health insurance, let alone coverage for addiction treatment.  But today they can.  Yet President Trump and congressional Republicans plan to slash Medicaid – and gut Medicaid Expansion – in order to pay for tax giveaways to billionaires and corporate special interests. This will make it harder for people to get treatment and move into treatment and will only strengthen the power of the drug cartels. SENATE PASSES HALT FENTANYL ACT TO PERMANENTLY CLASSIFY ALL FENTANYL-RELATED DRUGS AS SCHEDULE I SUBSTANCES When I served as governor of New Hampshire, law enforcement officers were key supporters in our effort to strengthen Medicaid, because they knew first-hand that getting people into recovery – often thanks to medication-assisted treatment for addiction, the gold standard of care – was a key way to cut off the demand for deadly drugs. One of my roles in the Senate is serving as the ranking member of the Joint Economic Committee, whichrecently published a new reportdetailing the importance of Medicaid in the fight against addiction and fentanyl. Our analysis finds that roughly one million people nationwide receive medication-assisted treatment for addiction through Medicaid. And this treatment is working: the most recent data available shows an approximately 25 percent drop in overdose deaths nationwide in 2024 compared to 2023, the largest drop in years. We are finally identifying the most effective tactics in the fight against fentanyl and, at long last, seeing a glimmer of light in this dreadfully dark tunnel. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION But President Trump and his allies in Congress are poised to undo that progress by passing a budget that would pay for more tax giveaways for billionaires by gutting Medicaid. This plan would effectively end Medicaid as we know it and make health care unaffordable for millions of Americans. And it would leave many people who struggle with addiction unable to get the help that they need. In the end, the loss of this indispensable tool in the fight against fentanyl will makelaw enforcement’s jobeven harder, turn back the bipartisan progress that we have made, and cause more of our fellow Americans to fall into a spiral of addiction and despair. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fighting fentanyl shouldn’t be a partisan issue. The fentanyl crisis has hit red and blue states alike and devastated families of every political stripe. The most important job of government is keeping people safe – that’s why I’m always willing to work across party lines and stand up to anyone, no matter their party, in order to keep Granite Staters and Americans safe. I have taken on extreme voices in both parties to strengthen law enforcement, and as governor I helped hire more police officers to keep our communities safe. I also have supported bipartisan efforts to secure our border, efforts informed by my travels to our northern and southern borders and my conversations with border patrol and law enforcement officers on the ground. Some of my Republican colleagues have expressed concerns about the efforts by the President and Republican Congressional Leadership to decimate Medicaid, and I know that many Americans who support the President, including those in New Hampshire, share these concerns and want the President to reverse course. There can be no surrender in the fight against fentanyl – not when tens of thousands of our fellow Americans are still dying from overdoses each year, not in a country as great as ours, not ever. Now is the time to put politics aside, listen to law enforcement officers and the administration’s own intelligence report, and come together to defend Medicaid so that we can protect our kids, prevent fentanyl trafficking, and get more Americans with addiction on the road to recovery.

In 2020, when theCOVID panichit the U.S., it was a bad era for freedom, property rights, Main Street and the American Dream. The mantra driven heavily by the left was thatsmall businessesneeded to be closed and personal freedoms needed to be limited to meet their narrative. The left screamed \"do something\" with no regard if that something would produce better or worse outcomes. States across the country took what makes America great and threw it in the toilet, opting for heavy-handed central planning instead of allowing people to make decisions on what was best for them. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick holds a chart as President Donald Trump speaks on tariffs in the Rose Garden at the White House, Wednesday, April 2, 2025.(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) This was based on faulty information, bad strategy and tactics, and a large-scale willingness to forgopersonal freedoms. GLOBAL SYSTEM TOOK ADVANTAGE OF AMERICA ON TRADE AND DEFENSE. THAT FREE RIDE IS OVER Many of us who warned about this were met with resistance for quite some time. Eventually, more people came around to the mistakes and promised this would not happen again. Today, embedded in the discourse around tariffs, we are seeing many of the same behaviors and language. But staggeringly, it is many on the right that are standing on the wrong side of freedom. There are, no doubt, myriad fiscal issues plaguing the U.S. today. AN AMBITIOUS TRADE DEAL WITH INDIA IS IN OUR GRASP TheBiden administrationleft the Trump administration a giant fiscal mess. After Biden propped up growth with massive deficit spending, our U.S. debt/GDP grew to north of 120%. Our deficit/GDP in the 6-7% range is now that of a country at war. Our spending on interest to service our debt exceeds U.S. defense spending, which is a massive warning sign. Biden’s historic inflation remains difficult to combat. The Trump administration’s options are limited given all the above, current interest rates, massive financing and refinancing of debt that needs to happen this year and other factors. However, tariffs are unlikely to work as a tactic to solve the above. TRUMP RISKS IT ALL, TAKES ON THE WORLD WITH TARIFFS AND PUTS AMERICA FIRST In the panic of \"do something,\" many Trump supporters are sacrificing principles, sounding more like the left then purveyors of conservative values. Small businesses who bore the brunt of theCOVID mandates, their after-effects and inflation, are now at risk again. Those who have part or all of their supply chain abroad are going to have a hard time surviving if this goes on much longer and they are not exempted from tariffs. I have heard over and over again on social media that those businesses don’t deserve to exist, basically the same thing that I wrote about in \"The War on Small Business\" after COVID, when the left told small businesses they needed to close for \"the greater good\" as they defined it. THE TRUTH ABOUT TARIFFS AND THE HISTORY LESSON MANY CRITICS ARE MISSING That’s not freedom or America first – that’s central planning garbage. Moreover, most of those spewing rhetoric don’t realize that small businesses that have part of their business abroad is stillAmerica first. Small businesses in the U.S. exploit comparative advantages in the supply chain. The same businesses often have personnel in design, marketing, sales, administration and other functions in the U.S. that create American jobs. They may sell all over the globe, getting desired products not just to Americans, but to citizens of other countries as well. When those foreign citizens buy the products, they are supporting American jobs and sending their capital to the U.S. Those profits are invested and spent, often in America. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Telling these businesses not to exist in support of \"the greater good\" is communist-type thinking. Moreover, if millions of thesesmall businessesgo under, not only will those jobs, profits and capital be removed from America, it is likely a foreign company or a massive corporation will pick up the opportunity and benefit. That is not America first. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP We have many issues to solve economically, but most of those have been caused by moving away from freedom and capitalism. Going further in that direction leaves us without principles and will likely make matters worse. Hopefully, theTrump administrationwill help Main Street thrive, but that needs to be done with incentives, not anti-freedom barriers.

    "title": "RANDI WEINGARTEN: Trump's decision to gut the Education Department is not only illegal, it's wrong",
    "article_text": "America First Policy Institute's Erika Donalds calls on educators to embrace the A.I. revolution and discusses her husband Rep. Byron Donalds' gubernatorial campaign in Florida. PresidentDonald Trumpis correct that states and local school boards should control students’ education. They do, and they have since the earliest days of our republic. But his decision to gut the Department of Education—the only federal department dedicated to educational opportunity for all students in America—isn’t about control, efficiency or even test scores. It’s about redistributing money and opportunity from the many to the few. From curriculum to graduation requirements, states and local school districts already control education. The federal government provides about$1 in every $7 spenton public schools, which 90% of American kids attend. That funding is crucial to helping create opportunity for all, ensuring poor kids, kids with disabilities and first-generation college students get the same shot at success as everyone else. And which states depend on that funding most?Red states,because they have more kids who qualify for the funds appropriated by Congress and distributed by the Education Department. Federal funding is not used to impose any curriculum or ideology—that’s actually not allowed by law—and those laws and norms shouldn’t be broken, regardless of who is president. By the same token, the funding should also not be used as a cudgel to force educators to kowtow to anyone’s political ideology or personal beliefs. SENATORS FORMALLY INTRODUCE BILL TO ELIMINATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION While the Education Department was established by Congress on a bipartisan basis in 1979, support for public schools has deeper roots. Lyndon B. Johnson taught in a ruralTexasschool where students were showing up without shoes, and when he became president, he acted to support kids who grew up in poverty. Every president except for the current one has built on that foundation. Trump can’t abolish the Education Department. Only Congress can do that. So he andElon Muskare taking a wrecking ball to it,first by firing nearly half its staffand then byplanning to parcel off its piecesto otherunderstaffed departmentsthat have little or no relevant expertise or necessary resources, a move that someRepublicans are now questioning. It is impossible to imagine how 7.5 million kids with disabilities, 26 million kids from low-income families or the 13 million young people who get financial aid for college won’t be disserved if no one is around to make sure the funding gets where it’s needed—or even to answer the phone. Teachers will be laid off. Class sizes will grow. And students with the fewest resources and greatest needs will pay the highest price. LINDA MCMAHON: MY VISION FOR ELIMINATING THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION Mississippi,which saw a recent rebound in reading scores, gets nearly a quarter of its funding for local K-12 schools from federal sources, followed by South Dakota, Montana, Arkansas, North Carolina, Kentucky, Arizona, Oklahoma and Tennessee—all of which get about 20 percent of school funding from the federal government. New York state, by contrast, gets just 7.2 percent. Regardless of whether these funds are used to pay for tax cuts for billionaires or for school vouchers, it means kids will suffer. We worry about the struggling readers, the kids who need speech or occupational therapy and the families that benefit from before- and after-school programs. Who will get them the tutoring or the specialists they need if their families can’t afford the bill? Who will investigate parents’ complaints about their children’s civil rights being violated at school when most of the Office for Civil Rights staff was eliminated? I think about an 11th-grade student at Widener Memorial School inPhiladelphia, the only Pennsylvania school exclusively serving special education students. That student is in a wheelchair. How will she get the physical and occupational therapy she needs to thrive if that money is taken away from her? EducationSecretary Linda McMahon has suggestedmaking Title I funding, currently designated for schools in high-poverty communities, a no-strings-attached block grant that would not guarantee services get to the students and schools that desperately need it and get it now. States, for example, could then use the federal money for private school vouchers, so those who currently get those services in public schools lose. And who would win? The data shows that it’s really a redistribution of wealth. Money no longer goes to poor kids; instead,70 percent of public dollarsfor vouchers goes to wealthy families with children already in private schools.In the last election, voters rejected private school voucherswherever they were on the ballot because they support public schools. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION If money didn’t make a difference in student success, there wouldn’t be such a fight over it. Newer research says what anyone with common sense knows: Money matters.Research overwhelmingly showsthat increases in K-12 fundingimprove student academic achievement,particularly for children living in poverty. Yet this administration is putting us on a trajectory to achieve less with less. Trump’s end-run around Congress is not only illegal but overwhelminglyunpopular. Regardless of whether people know what the Education Department does, they don’t like the message that shuttering it sends. Americans don’t want their president stripping opportunity from children and young people. Finally, closing theEducation Departmentsets up a Hobson’s choice because, just to maintain current services, families will end up paying more state and local taxes. So we end up with tax cuts for the wealthy, and tax increases for everyone else. States are already reeling from the chaos the funding cuts have sowed. The administration’sabrupt halt of billions in federal pandemic aid payoutslast month shocked state officials,leaving them scrambling – and suing. Grants to learn what reading and math programs are effective, to address the teacher shortage in rural communities, to help young people with disabilities navigatelife after high schooland for acivics education programthat I once taught have all been halted. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP TheAFT is fighting Trump’s actions, including in the courts.That’s not because the department is a perfect agency. It isn’t. Testing should be de-emphasized, and paperwork should be reduced. Like any entity, it could undoubtedly be more efficient. We should also be doing much more to elevate career and technical education, making it, along with college prep, a viable pathway for students—something that Secretary McMahon and I both believe. But to eviscerate thefederal role in education—which is to equalize opportunity—is not just illegal, it’s wrong, especially to fund vouchers that voters don’t want or to give a tax cut to people who don’t need it. We must protect our kids and communities. Randi Weingarten is president of the 1.8-million-member American Federation of Teachers.",

    "title": "I own a Corvette dealership and I’ve already seen the benefit of Trump’s tariffs",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump signs executive orders aimed to deregulate a range of industries and takes questions from reporters after a tariff pause on countries other than China. PresidentDonald Trumphas launched one of the most courageous andaudacious economic policies in American history.Anyone reacting to it at the moment – worrying over market sell-offs, panicking over international reaction – isn’t seeing the big picture. I’m the owner of Corvette Warehouse, the largest Corvette dealership in the southwest. We’ve been in business for more than 30 years. I witnessed firsthand the near collapse of my business during the tumultuous years of 2021-24. Crippled by COVID-19, supply chain disruptions, and unfair trade practices the previous administration neglected or even encouraged, my story mirrors the broader struggle of American industry. However, the Trump administration's 2025 tariff strategy, a \"stratified gambit,\" triggered a dramatic and unexpected turnaround. TRUMP'S TARIFF PAUSE THE LATEST EXAMPLE OF HIS PRAGMATISM ON THE POLITICAL STAGE In the game of bridge, a \"stratified gambit\" is a strategic play where players are grouped at different levels, or \"strata,\" competing against those in their tier yet still part of a larger tournament. It's a layered competition that allows different skill levels to coexist, compete and win in their own way based on the player's strategy. Retired autoworker Brian Pannebecker, from Detroit, speaks alongside President Donald Trump as he delivers remarks on reciprocal tariffs during an event in the Rose Garden entitled \"Make America Wealthy Again\" at the White House in Washington, D.C., on April 2, 2025.(Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images) Today, this is precisely what's happening with the American economy under theTrump administration's strategic use of tariffs. It’s a multi-tiered economic gambit aimed at restoring trade balance, boosting national production and providing the forgotten American businesses and workers with a fighting chance. And that’s all we ask for: For our own government to give us that fighting chance. Unlike conventional trade policies, Trump's tariff rollout was meticulously planned and layered, providing American industries vital time to adjust and reshore without facing immediate retaliatory shocks. This strategy signaled a decisive shift away from \"America last\" policies, prioritizing fair trade and bolstering domestic production. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Against the backdrop of dire media predictions, Corvette Warehouse has experienced a remarkable surge in sales and renewed customer confidence. Consumers, driven by both financial and patriotic motivations, began \"buying American again.\" The tariffs effectively corrected longstanding trade imbalances, addressing years of outsourcing and currency manipulation that had eroded American industry. We’ve seen our best week in nearly 36 months. Alongside advocacy for strategic, temporary trade protections, the tariffs serve to rectify market failures and unfair global competition. Coupled with potential interest rate reductions by theFederal Reserve, this strategy aims to stimulate domestic growth and alleviate the national debt. Yes, the Trump administration has \"paused\" the customized reciprocal tariffs, but the message is already coming through loud and clear. The shift is palpable in the used-car market, with a notable increase in demand for American-made vehicles and trade-ins of foreign brands. This reflects a growing wave of economic patriotism, where consumers actively prioritize American-made goods. This is exactly what we need to bring jobs back home and rebuild American industry. Now, America needs further fiscal prudence, includingreduced government spendingand enhanced efficiency, to maximize the benefits of the tariff strategy. This is not isolationism but a strategic move toward balanced trade that supports American workers and businesses. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP What’s coming next isa tangible revival of American industry. We must have strategic thinking and real-world experience in navigating the complex economic challenges ahead. Trump’s \"stratified gambit\" is unfolding, and it’s the right approach, reshaping the economic landscape and empowering American producers and consumers. President Trump is giving America the fighting chance we need. He knows – and we know – that given that chance, we will win. Capt. Douglas Ernest (U.S. Army Ret), author of\"The Spirit of a True Patriot: The Inspiring Story of Ret. Captain Douglas J. Ernest.\"",

Last week, apost on Xwent viral, claiming that Google’s latest Gemini model surpassed Anthropic’s flagship Claude model in the original Pokémon video game trilogy. Reportedly, Gemini had reached Lavender Town in a developer’s Twitch stream; Claude wasstuck at Mount Moonas of late February. Gemini is literally ahead of Claude atm in pokemon after reaching Lavender Town 119 live views only btw, incredibly underrated streampic.twitter.com/8AvSovAI4x — Jush (@Jush21e8)April 10, 2025 But what the post failed to mention is that Gemini had an advantage. Asusers on Redditpointed out, the developer who maintains the Gemini stream built a custom minimap that helps the model identify “tiles” in the game like cuttable trees. This reduces the need for Gemini to analyze screenshots before it makes gameplay decisions. Now, Pokémon is a semi-serious AI benchmark at best — few would argue it’s a very informative test of a model’s capabilities. But itisan instructive example of how different implementations of a benchmark can influence the results. For example, Anthropicreportedtwo scores for its recent Anthropic 3.7 Sonnet model on the benchmark SWE-bench Verified, which is designed to evaluate a model’s coding abilities. Claude 3.7 Sonnet achieved 62.3% accuracy on SWE-bench Verified, but 70.3% with a “custom scaffold” that Anthropic developed. More recently, Metafine-tuneda version of one of its newer models, Llama 4 Maverick, to perform well on a particular benchmark, LM Arena. Thevanilla versionof the model scores significantly worse on the same evaluation. Given that AI benchmarks — Pokémon included — areimperfect measuresto begin with, custom and non-standard implementations threaten to muddy the waters even further. That is to say, it doesn’t seem likely that it’ll get any easier to compare models as they’re released.

The agreement announced Monday makesRedwood Materialsthe exclusive battery recycling partner for Lime’s shared scooters and e-bikes located in cities throughout the United States, Germany, and the Netherlands. The agreement doesn’t cover every region in which Limeoperates, a list that includes cities throughout Europe, Asia, and Australia. Lime has had other recycling partnerships in the past, notably with Sprout via its downstream vendors. However, this is the first time the shared micromobility company has had a direct relationship with a battery recycler in North America that will directly process material for recovery and return it to the supply chain. Redwood Materials, the Carson City, Nevada-based startup founded by former Tesla CFO JB Straubel, will recover materials from the batteries once they can no longer be used. Once recovered and recycled, the materials will be reintroduced in the battery manufacturing process. This closed-loop manufacturing system — which can reduce demand for mining and refining minerals — is at the heart of Redwood Materials’ business model. The effort also aligns with Lime’s own sustainability goals. Lime has a goal to decarbonize its business by 2030. The company has made progress in reducing Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions by 59.5% in five years from its 2019 baseline years. Lime plans to report its 2024 Carbon Emissions results in May. “This collaboration marks significant progress towards establishing a more circular supply chain, helping ensure our batteries are not only responsibly recycled once they reach their end of life, but that their materials are returned into the battery supply chain,” Andrew Savage, VP for Sustainability at Lime, said in a statement. Lime also has partnerships with Gomi in the U.K. and VoltR in France and other European countries to harvest these viable battery cells for “second life” applications, including for consumer electronics, such as portable speakers and battery packs, among other uses.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The Trump trade war has gone viral on TikTok, pushing a Chinese e-commerce app, DHgate, to the top of the U.S. App Store. After Trump increased U.S. tariffs on Chinese importsby 145%, numerous Chinese suppliers and manufacturersbegan makingTikTokvideos explaining to consumers how the global luxury goods market actually works. The clothing, handbags, and other accessories that many people assumed were made in Europe originate from factories in China, the videos explain. As a result of the trend, the Chinese wholesale marketplace appDHgatesurged to become the No. 3 top free iPhone app in the U.S. App Store as of Monday morning. For comparison, the app was ranked No. 352 in the top non-game free iPhone apps category in the U.S. as of Friday, April 11, before jumping to No. 6 on Sunday and No. 3 on Monday, according to data from app intelligence providerAppfigures. On Monday, DHgate also climbed to No. 3 on the Top Overall chart for free iPhone apps, including games. The firm tells TechCrunch that on Saturday, April 12, the DHgate app was downloaded 35,400 times across the App Store and Google Play, a 56% increase from its 30-day average. The U.S. accounted for 17,300 of those installs, a jump of 98% over the 30-day average. On Sunday, April 13, those installs increased to 117,500 on iOS, up 732% from the 30-day average. The U.S. accounted for 65,100 of those downloads, up 940%. (Android download data for Sunday isn’t available yet.) DHgateis a cross-border e-commerce company connecting both businesses and consumers to suppliers and manufacturers in China and other markets. Today, it offers an inventory of over 30 million products across categories like electronics, home and toys, shoes and apparel, jewelry, health and beauty, and more, its website states. The demand for the app grew out of the TikTok viral trend where Chinese manufacturers began revealing their secrets to the American public. Following this trend, other online creators began telling their viewers that the DHgate app is a source for buying luxury goods before a brand has added its label to the product. In reality, it can be difficult for consumers to tell which factories are the originals contracted by the luxury brands and which are just making copies, also known as dupes. However, online communities liker/DHgate on Redditcan sometimes offer help on that front. #duetwith @senbags2 the DHgate girlies been trying to tell us! 😩#chinafashion#dhgate#desingerbags#luxurybag#chinatiktok#fyp#china In one popular TikTok video, a Chinese manufacturer claims that the majority of the world’s luxury bags are made in China, but the bags are then sent to the brands’ factories in Europe, where the label is added and the bag is repackaged. That way, the bags appear as though they’re “made in Italy” or “made in France,” the video’s creator claims. In another video, that same creator, @senbags2, explains that a $38,000 Birkin bag is made for just around $1,400 and that consumers are just paying for the logo and fancy packaging. (The creator’s TikTok account has since been taken down, but numerous stitches and reuploads remain.) Name one thing that China CANNOT make!#chinasourcing#sourcingtips#sourcingagent#yiwuagent#yiwuminigoods#yiwumarkets#Lunasourcingchina#chinasource#brooksbrothers#shirt#shirtmanufacturer#premiumshirt#tommyhilfiger#hugoboss#lacoste🐊#factory#chinashipping#wholesale#luxury#jewelryaccessories#alibaba#directfactory#chinasupplier Videos from other creators focused on luxury categories like clothing and jewelry. Brands like Hermès, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Chanel, and others were mentioned in the videos, as were midrange brands like Lululemon, Tommy Hilfiger, Lacoste, and Hugo Boss. The point of the videos is to stress that the U.S. is more dependent on China than it may realize, as even brands U.S. consumers thought were high-end European products are being manufactured in the country. It’s not all fast fashion and cheap electronics like those found on Shein or TikTok Shop. Of course, this isnot newsto anyone who understands the global supply chain, but the videos prompted TikTok users to seek out a way to buy directly from the manufacturers in China, leading them to DHgate and other apps that connect to the Chinese market. A similar app, Taobao, became the No. 10 overall free iPhone app on Monday. Using DHgate is not really a solution for avoiding Trump’s tariffs, as any Chinese imports to the U.S. would still be impacted by tariffs outside ofsome exceptions in electronics — for now. But the backlash from the Chinese manufacturers who made these videos was triggered by the tariff increases. As one TikTok commenterquipped, these trends are the result of the U.S. claiming to hold all the cards in the trade war, leading China to respond, “We make all the cards.” Topics Consumer News Editor Sarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "title": "Meet Neptune, a TikTok alternative where creators can hide likes and follower counts",
    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Neptuneis one of the newest short-form video apps on the block seeking to compete with major players like TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts. The app, currently in beta, has attracted attention from hundreds of thousands of users, with 970 testers participating and 400,000 people on the waitlist, per the company. Neptune announced Monday that it’s preparing to launch the app on the App Store next week, with plans to roll out on the Google Play Store in about six months. The startup was founded by Ashley Darling, who has a background as a talent director at the OPTYX agency, where she worked with “underestimated” influencers. She set out to develop a platform that emphasizes creativity instead of the number of followers a creator has. “I spent years working with independent creators, both as an influencer myself and later helping brands,” Darling shared with TechCrunch. “​​I kept hearing the same thing from creators and users, ‘I miss when social media was fun. When it was about creativity, not competition.’ So, instead of waiting for a platform to listen, I built one.” With TikTok’s future still uncertain, Neptune hopes to attract creators looking for an alternative way to earn revenue while fostering an environment that prioritizes the quality of videos and connections instead of follower counts. The app plans to offer various revenue streams, including tips, livestreams, and subscriptions. Like its competitors, Neptune features a discovery tool and a vertical feed for users to swipe through short videos and engage through comments. Additionally, users can add a cover photo to their profiles, imitating what X and other networking apps offer. A key distinguishing feature of Neptune is that it lets creators hide their total followers and likes. This “ghost metrics” feature is optional, however, and is designed to help users avoid the pressures associated with follower count, yet still caters to creators who may want to showcase their metrics. According to the company, Neptune’s algorithm emphasizes user interests and content quality rather than creator popularity. Typically, social media algorithms prioritize content with the highest engagement, often leaving lesser-known creators, or “micro-influencers,” at a disadvantage. “We put the power back in the hands of [the creators] who actually built the internet. Not the corporations, not the algorithms. Neptune is for connection, not clout,” chief marketing officer Timur Tugberk said. Another notable feature is “Hop Back,” which allows users to resume watching a video right where they left off, preventing them from losing their place when the app refreshes. Neptune is in beta and doesn’t offer all of its intended features yet. It’s currently on the simple side, providing only a video feed and a search function.

The rental company, which also owns the Dollar and Thrifty brands, saidin notices on its websitethat the breach relates to a cyberattack on one of its vendors between October 2024 and December 2024. The stolen data varies by region, but largely includes Hertz customer names, dates of birth, contact information, driver’s licenses, payment card information, and workers’ compensation claims. Hertz said a smaller number of customers had their Social Security numbers taken in the breach, along with other government-issued identification numbers. Notices on Hertz’s websites disclosed the breach to customers inAustralia,Canada, theEuropean Union,New Zealand, and theUnited Kingdom. Hertz also disclosed the breach with several U.S. states, including California and Maine. Hertz said at least 3,400 customers in Maine were affected but did not list the total number of affected individuals, which is likely to be significantly higher. Emily Spencer, a spokesperson for Hertz, would not provide TechCrunch with a specific number of individuals affected by the breach but said it would be “inaccurate to say millions” of customers are affected. The company attributed the breach to a vendor, software maker Cleo, which last year wasat the center of a mass-hacking campaignby a prolific Russia-linked ransomware gang. Hertz is one of dozens of companies that used Cleo’s software at the time of their data thefts. The Clop ransomware gang claimed last year to have exploited azero-day vulnerabilityin Cleo’s widely used enterprise file transfer products, which allow companies to share large sets of sensitive data over the internet. By breaching these systems, the hackers stole reams of data from Cleo’s corporate customers. Soon after, the Clop ransomware gang claimed on its dark web leak site that itstole data from close to 60 companiesby exploiting the bug in their Cleo systems. In a later post, Clop claimed dozens more alleged corporate victims. The data extortion campaign became one ofthe most notable mass-hacks of 2024. At the time, Hertz, which was named on Clop’s site, said it had “no evidence” that Hertz data or Hertz systems were affected. On Monday, Hertz’s spokesperson told TechCrunch it found no evidence that Hertz’s own network was affected by the breach, but confirmed that Hertz data “was acquired by an unauthorized third party that we understand exploited zero-day vulnerabilities within Cleo’s platform in October 2024 and December 2024.” A Cleo executive did not respond to TechCrunch’s inquiry on Monday.

Yes, “4.1” — as if the company’s nomenclature wasn’t confusing enough already. There’s GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and GPT-4.1 nano, all of which OpenAI says “excel” at coding and instruction following. Available through OpenAI’s API but notChatGPT, the multimodal models have a 1-million-token context window, meaning they can take in roughly 750,000 words in one go (longer than “War and Peace”). GPT-4.1 arrives as OpenAI rivals like Google and Anthropic ratchet up efforts to build sophisticated programming models. Google’s recently releasedGemini 2.5 Pro, which also has a 1-million-token context window, ranks highly on popular coding benchmarks. So do Anthropic’sClaude 3.7 Sonnetand Chinese AI startupDeepSeek’s upgraded V3. It’s the goal of many tech giants, including OpenAI, to train AI coding models capable of performing complex software engineering tasks. OpenAI’s grand ambition is to create an “agentic software engineer,” asCFO Sarah Friar put itduring a tech summit in London last month. The company asserts its future models will be able to program entire apps end-to-end, handling aspects such as quality assurance, bug testing, and documentation writing. GPT-4.1 is a step in this direction. “We’ve optimized GPT-4.1 for real-world use based on direct feedback to improve in areas that developers care most about: frontend coding, making fewer extraneous edits, following formats reliably, adhering to response structure and ordering, consistent tool usage, and more,” an OpenAI spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. “These improvements enable developers to build agents that are considerably better at real-world software engineering tasks.” OpenAI claims the full GPT-4.1 model outperforms itsGPT-4o and GPT-4o minimodels on coding benchmarks, including SWE-bench. GPT-4.1 mini and nano are said to be more efficient and faster at the cost of some accuracy, with OpenAI saying GPT-4.1 nano is its speediest — and cheapest — model ever. GPT-4.1 costs $2 per million input tokens and $8 per million output tokens. GPT-4.1 mini is $0.40/million input tokens and $1.60/million output tokens, and GPT-4.1 nano is $0.10/million input tokens and $0.40/million output tokens. According to OpenAI’s internal testing, GPT-4.1, which can generate more tokens at once than GPT-4o (32,768 versus 16,384), scored between 52% and 54.6% on SWE-bench Verified, a human-validated subset of SWE-bench. (OpenAI noted in a blog post that some solutions to SWE-bench Verified problems couldn’t run on its infrastructure, hence the range of scores.) Those figures are slightly under the scores reported by Google and Anthropic for Gemini 2.5 Pro (63.8%) and Claude 3.7 Sonnet (62.3%), respectively, on the same benchmark. In a separate evaluation, OpenAI probed GPT-4.1 using Video-MME, which is designed to measure the ability of a model to “understand” content in videos. GPT-4.1 reached a chart-topping 72% accuracy on the “long, no subtitles” video category, claims OpenAI. While GPT-4.1 scores reasonably well on benchmarks and has a more recent “knowledge cutoff,” giving it a better frame of reference for current events (up to June 2024), it’s important to keep in mind that even some of the best models today struggle with tasks that wouldn’t trip up experts. For example,manystudieshaveshownthat code-generating models often fail to fix, and even introduce, security vulnerabilities and bugs. OpenAI acknowledges, too, that GPT-4.1 becomes less reliable (i.e., likelier to make mistakes) the more input tokens it has to deal with. On one of the company’s own tests, OpenAI-MRCR, the model’s accuracy decreased from around 84% with 8,000 tokens to 50% with 1 million tokens. GPT-4.1 also tended to be more “literal” than GPT-4o, says the company, sometimes necessitating more specific, explicit prompts.

GPT-4.5 was released only in late February. Developers will have access to GPT-4.5 via OpenAI’s API until July 14, after which they’ll have to transition to another model in OpenAI’s catalog, the company says. OpenAI is positioningGPT-4.1, which launched Monday, as the preferred replacement. “[GPT-4.1] offers similar or improved performance than GPT-4.5 in key areas at a much lower cost,” an OpenAI spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. “[W]e will [be] deprecating GPT-4.5 to prioritize building future models.” To be clear, GPT-4.5 isn’t leaving ChatGPT, where it’s available in research preview for paying customers. OpenAI is only phasing it out of the API. GPT-4.5,code-named Orion, was trained using more computing power and data than any of OpenAI’s previous releases. It improves upon its predecessor,GPT-4o, in areas such as writing andpersuasiveness, but despite its scale, GPT-4.5 falls short of “frontier level” on a number of industry benchmarks. GPT-4.5 is also very expensive to run, OpenAI admits — so expensive that the company warned in February that it was evaluating whether to serve GPT-4.5 via its API in the long term. The model’s pricing reflects this: GPT-4.5 costs $75 for every million input tokens (roughly 750,000 words) and $150 per million output tokens, making it one of OpenAI’s costliest offerings.

Now, instead of offering models that only work with either Apple or Google’s lost-item finding technology, the new Chipolo POP devices work with both companies’ finding networks out of the box. By combining these different functionalities into one device, Chipolo believes it will be easier for consumers to choose the right device for their needs. Plus, this would make Chipolo products better for gifting because buyers won’t need to know whether the recipient uses Android or an iPhone, the company said. The Chipolo devices are among a handful of companies, including Tile, Pebblebee, and Samsung, that make their own AirTag-like trackers. Unlike Tile, which designed a finding network that leveraged the people who had its mobile app installed, Chipolo chose to work with the existing finding networks offered by platform makers Apple and Google. (Though Tile arrived before the AirTag, the competition from Apple ultimately led to its finding an exit by selling in 2021 to family locator service Life360 for$205 million.)

The company will start training its AI on users’ content in the EU this week, it said. Users’ interactions with Meta AI will also be used to train its models. The announcement comes after a limited version ofMeta AI launched in the EUlast month, well after its debut in the U.S. and other global markets. While Meta has beentraining its AIon user-generated content in the U.S. for years, it has faced resistance in the EU due to the bloc’s strict privacy laws, particularly the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which requires a clear legal basis for processing personal data to train AI models. Meta saidback in June 2024that it would pause plans to start training its AI systems using user data in the EU and U.K. following pushback from the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC). The DPC regulates Meta in the EU and was acting on behalf of several data protection authorities across the bloc. InSeptember 2024, Meta said it was restarting efforts to train its AI systems using public posts from its U.K. user base. Fast-forward to today; Meta has announced that it will do so with public posts from its EU user base as well. “Last year, we delayed training our large language models using public content while regulators clarified legal requirements,” Meta said in its blog post. “We welcome the opinion provided by the EDPB in December, which affirmed that our original approach met our legal obligations. Since then, we have engaged constructively with the IDPC and look forward to continuing to bring the full benefits of generative AI to people in Europe.” Starting this week, users in the EU will start receiving in-app and email notifications to explain that Meta will start using public data and interactions with Meta AI to train its models. These notifications will include a link to a form that will allow users to opt out of their data being used. Meta says it will honor all objection forms it has already received, as well as newly submitted ones. Meta notes that it doesn’t use private messages, nor public data from users under the age of 18 in the EU, to train its models. “We believe we have a responsibility to build AI that’s not just available to Europeans, but is actually built for them,” Meta says. “That’s why it’s so important for our generative AI models to be trained on a variety of data so they can understand the incredible and diverse nuances and complexities that make up European communities. That means everything from dialects and colloquialisms, to hyper-local knowledge and the distinct ways different countries use humor and sarcasm on our products.” Meta says it’s following the example set by companies like Google and OpenAI, both of which have already used data from European users to train their AI models. Meanwhile, the DPC is not moving on entirely from scrutinizing how large language model creators are training their AI services. Last week, the regulatorannouncedit was investigating xAI’s training of Grok. Topics Consumer News Reporter Aisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

The transaction values Kodiak, which has raised around $243 million to date, at about $2.5 billion pre-money. New and existing Kodiak institutional investors, like Soros Fund Management, ARK Investments, and Ares, have funded or committed over $110 million in financing to support the transaction, as well as about $551 million of cash held in trust. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2025. Going public via SPAC is an interesting move at a time when the self-driving truck space has experienced some major hits, including high-profile players likeEmbarkandTuSimpleshutting down. SPACs have also lost much of their luster from theheyday of 2021, especially for capital-intensive companies like AV and EV startups. Kodiak does have something going for it, at least. It is revenue-generating, albeit that revenue is likely minimal. Kodiak, which says it has driven 2.6 million miles autonomously, eventually wants to commercialize long-haul trucking operations. In the short-term, the company has pursued off-road autonomy as a quicker path to market. In January, Kodiak delivered itsfirst two autonomous trucksto customer Atlas Energy Solutions, marking its first commercial launch. Atlas has committed to buying an initial order of 100 trucks to aid its operations delivering frac sand in West Texas’ remote Permian Basin. That bit of revenue validates Kodiak’s technology more than pre-revenue startups, which have made up the bulk of SPAC mergers over the past few years, and it could open the door to PIPE investments. That said, the path to profitability is a long one, and the capital needs of autonomy are massive. TechCrunch reached out to Kodiak to learn more about how long their current runway is but did not receive an immediate response. Kodiak’s public market debut comes during a turbulent period in the public markets, in large part due to President Trump’s tariffs and the ensuing trade war. It also comes as one of Kodiak’s main competitors, Aurora Innovation, is slated to begin fully driverless commercial trucking operationsthis month. Kodiak CEODon Burnetteco-founded the company in 2018 after years of experience in autonomous driving. He previously worked on self-driving tech at Google before leaving in early 2016 to help launch Otto, an AV startup founded alongsideAnthony Levandowski, Lior Ron, and Claire Delaunay. Otto was acquired by Uber, but things unraveled quickly as Waymo sued Uber, accusing Levandowski of trade secret theft. Uber eventually settled with Waymo, and Levandowski was later criminally charged and pleaded guilty. He was sentenced to 18 months in prison but pardoned by President Trump before serving time.

In Arizona, Nvidia is partnering with Amkor and SPIL for packaging and testing operations, the company added. Mass production at the Houston and Dallas plants is expected to ramp up in the next 12-15 months, and within the next four years, the company aims to produce up to half-a-trillion dollars of AI infrastructure in the U.S. “The engines of the world’s AI infrastructure are being built in the United States for the first time,” said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in a statement. “Adding American manufacturing helps us better meet the incredible and growing demand for AI chips and supercomputers, strengthens our supply chain, and boosts our resiliency.” The announcement comes days afterNvidia reportedly narrowly avoided export controlson its H20 chip after striking a domestic manufacturing deal with the Trump administration.According to NPR, the H20, Nvidia’s most advanced chip that can still be exported to China, was spared thanks to a promise from Huang to pour capital into components for U.S.-based AI data centers. Many other AI companies have leaned into Trump’s“America-first” approach to AIin bids to curry favor with the administration. OpenAI teamed up with SoftBank and Oracle for a $500 billion U.S. data center initiative dubbedthe Stargate Projectin January, whileMicrosoft pledged $80 billionto build AI data centers in its 2025 fiscal year, with 50% of that earmarked for the U.S. Trump has strong-armed certain partners to get his desired outcome in recent months.

But programs to ramp up the domestic chipmaking industry face formidable — and growing — challenges. Retaliatory tariffs and trade restrictions from Chinathreaten the supply of necessary raw materials to build chips in the U.S., and there’s asevere shortage of skilled frontline workersfor assembling chips.

    "title": "Conifer locks down $20M seed round for its ‘drop-in’ electric hub motor",
    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us A handful of engineers who worked at Lucid Motors and on Apple’s electric car project have launched a new startup that puts a fresh spin on electric hub motors.The new startup, calledConifer, has developed its motor to be free of rare earth elements by using more abundant ferrite magnets, which the company says not only reduces cost but limits supply chain risk. Conifer also says its proprietary stator offers higher efficiency and power than comparable options while being half the size.The company’s timing — a new volatile era of tariffs and a trade war with China — is auspicious. And its tech has attracted some serious financial attention. The motor, and Conifer’s approach to building it, helped it build out a $20 million seed round from a host of deep tech investors, includingTrue Ventures,MaC Ventures,MFV Partners, and others. True Ventures’ Rohit Sharma has joined Conifer’s board. Conifer arrives on the scene as progress in electric motor development seems to be advancing rapidly. Companies like Germany’sDeepDriveand Finland’sDonut Labare taking novel approaches to making electric motors more efficient, powerful, and affordable. This all comes at a time when batteries — which typically account for a bulk of the cost in an electric vehicle — are still getting cheaper, but are not seeing thedramatic price decreases that were evident a decade ago. Conifer’s initially targeting the small mobility space with its hub motor, which it touts as “drop-in,” meaning customers can replace existing hub motors without any major design changes. It’s going after on- and off-road vehicles with two, three, or four wheels. The company says it has also found interest from lawnmower and tractor makers, and even HVAC companies. It already has a handful of global customers and plans to start shipping production motors later this year. Ankit Somani, one of Conifer’s co-founders, told TechCrunch in an interview that he was frustrated by the lack of investment and innovation in electric motors. While he doesn’t have the same background of working at electric vehicle companies as many of his colleagues, he said he’s followed the space closely as an EV enthusiast. “There was a lot of investment in the battery technology segment, all the way from cathodes, anodes, electrolytes — every piece of it. But not enough on the powertrain front,” Somani said. “So we saw that as an opportunity from a market standpoint that, hey, there’s not enough people who have thought enough about this from the ground up.” That approach led to Conifer’s novel motor design and its manufacturing strategy. By using magnets that are more common, Conifer aims to localize its supply chain around its manufacturing facilities. It also wants to highly automate the manufacturing lines and make them adaptable, so different size motors can be built on the same line. This highly automated, localized “microfactory” idea has been bandied about a lot by companies like Arrival, which went out of business before it could ever really put it to the test. Somani said Conifer’s motors are “one to two orders of magnitude” less complex than a car, which should reduce the risk of this approach. And he said the company will deliberately introduce automation to the manufacturing of certain subsystems, like the stator, instead of trying to automate everything from the start. “That’s the thesis we are moving forward with,” he said. “We’ll start with one country where we’ll make this happen, and then we can take it in different places, depending on how local demands get.” When it comes to selling the motors, though, Somani said he’s found success in setting aside a lot of these specifics about what Conifer is up to. The company is, after all, a startup. And larger, more established companies don’t like the risk that startups present, he said. So instead, he comes back to the drop-in nature of Conifer’s motor. “You had a wheel before, which had a hub motor, now you get a new wheel, and just with the drop-in replacement, you get 10% range improvement. That’s it. And so all the cost and all the other conversations come afterwards,” he said.

The deal, which values Altera at $8.75 billion, will make the division “operationally independent,” Intel said in a press release. The chipmaker will retain a 49% stake in Altera, which will be led by Raghib Hussain, who’s set to succeed Sandra Rivera as CEO on May 5. “Today’s announcement reflects our commitment to sharpening our focus, lowering our expense structure, and strengthening our balance sheet,” said Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan in a statement. “Altera continues to make progress repositioning its product portfolio to participate in the fastest growing and most profitable segments of the FPGA market.” Altera was founded in 1983 by semiconductor veterans Rodney Smith, Robert Hartmann, James Sansbury, and Paul Newhagen. The company develops a range of programmable chips known as field-programmable gate arrays, or FPGAs, and the software to support them. Its chips are used in industries like communications, robotics, and AI. Intel acquired Altera in 2015 for $16.7 billion, and formed a business unit around it called Programmable Solutions Group (PSG). In 2023, Intel said it would spin off PSG into a separate company while maintaining majority ownership, and intended to seek an IPO within three years. The decision to spin out PSG came at a time of rapid growth in the FPGA sector.According to one analysis, the market for FPGAs could grow from $12.1 billion last year to $25.8 billion by 2029. In fiscal year 2024, Altera generated revenue of $1.54 billion. The transaction with Silver Lake is expected to close in the second half of 2025.

    "title": "Birmingham bin strike to continue as workers 'overwhelmingly' reject deal",
    "article_text": "A strike by bin workers in Birmingham is set to continue after the latest pay offer by the city council was \"overwhelmingly\" rejected. It follows a month-long stand-off between members of the Unite union and the Labour-run authority as bin bags and fly-tipped rubbish have piled high on streets. Unite said the city council's \"partial\" offer was \"totally inadequate\" and did not address the potential pay cuts for 200 drivers. The council has previously said the offer on the table was a fair one. Unite's national lead officer Onay Kasab said 97% of those who voted rejected the council's deal, on a 60% turnout. \"They could see through what this so called proposal meant, it simply failed to deal with all of the issues and it also nailed the lie,\" he said. The union's general secretary Sharon Graham said the rejection was \"no surprise as these workers simply cannot afford to take pay cuts of this magnitude to pay the price for bad decision after bad decision\". The dispute centres around the council's decision to remove Waste Recycling and Collection Officer (WRCO) roles. The union argued that it was an important  health and safety role and about 170 affected workers faced losing up to £8,000 annually due to the decision, with hundreds more losing out on the prospect of pay progression. A spokesperson for Birmingham City Council said the vote was \"incredibly disappointing\" but the authority's \"door remains open\". They claimed Unite's proposals focused on retaining a role that did not exist at other councils and could open up the council to more equal pay claims as refuse collection is a job overwhelmingly performed by men. The statement said a \"fair and reasonable offer\" was made while suggesting \"every employee affected by the removal of the WRCO role could take an equivalent graded role in the council, LGV Driver training or voluntary redundancy packages.\" Speaking last week, councillors said with those deals in place no worker \"need lose a penny\". However, on Monday, Mr Kasab said the result of the ballot was proof that the dispute was more than \"simply about 17 workers\" - a number previously quoted by the council. He said: \"This is about huge pay cuts and hundreds of people, it's time now for us all to sit down, no more negative briefing, and let's reach a negotiated resolution and solution.\" One refuse collector told the BBC on Monday that the mood among their colleagues was \"powerful\", while another said their sentiments remained unchanged. \"As much as we want a resolution, none of us are willing to lose money,\" they added. Minister of State for Local Government Jim McMahon said the \"deeply disappointing\" result of the ballot would further add to the weeks of disruption. \"The huge effort to clear the backlog has already seen over 11,000 tonnes of waste collected, and will now continue at pace to protect public health while the dispute remains ongoing,\" he said. At the end of March, the council declared a major incident, saying that some 17,000 tonnes of rubbish was lining the city's streets. Some residents have also reported an increase in rats and other vermin. Adam Yasin said his Mercedes had been \"completely written off\" just weeks ago because rats had chewed through electrical wires. The 33-year-old, from Balsall Heath, said: \"Because of that certain wiring, the car wouldn't start. \"They said they need to rewire the whole car but the insurance company said it was too expensive. \"It has been really bad, especially where I live, there are a lot of restaurants there.\" In recent days, military planners have been called in to help deal with the situation. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said that was not about \"boots on the ground\" but it would help get waste cleared. Other neighbouring authorities have also stepped in to help clear rubbish. \"We've got over two-thirds of the rubbish cleared off the streets now, this week we'll start to see cleaning up the pavements and streets as well as the clearance of all of that rubbish, I'm very pleased about that,\" Rayner said. \"The kids are off school - obviously it's Easter holidays, we want that rubbish cleared.\" Sadia Khan, the chairperson of Friends of Spark Green Park, said while she sympathised with those on strike, \"rejecting another offer is just going to make the whole population a lot sicker\". She said dead cats had been found in parks and that she suspected it was due to them eating rat poison left out to reduce the growing problem of vermin. \"I know it's a financial crisis people are struggling to manage, and everyone deserves a better wage, but there's a limit to how long this can go on,\" she said. \"How much can you can risk the health of a population? Over a million people will be very, very impacted by things if it carries on.\" Last week, Health Secretary Wes Streeting said he wasvery concerned by the public health situationin Birmingham. The local authority is facing criticism, meanwhile, for pressing ahead with plans to switch from weekly to fortnightly collections while the strike remains unresolved. Leaflets about the change have appeared in residents' letter boxes, but Martin Mullaney, a former councillor for the city's Moseley and Kings Heath ward, said the timing was \"politically insensitive\". The leaflets state residents will have a new green recycling bin to be collected fortnightly, a food bin to be collected weekly, and a black bin to be collected fortnightly on alternate weeks to recycling collections. Although an all-out strike began on 11 March, there have been a series of on-off walkouts since January and some residents have told the BBC they have not had recycling collected in 2025. Follow BBC Birmingham onBBC Sounds,Facebook,XandInstagram. Councils offer support as the bin strike drags on and mountains of rubbish appear on pavements. A strike by hundreds of Birmingham refuse workers has seen rubbish piled high on streets. Councillor Sam Forsyth declared her exit at the council's full council meeting on Tuesday. The health secretary says he is concerned about the \"poor conditions\" on the streets of Birmingham. Before the changes the teenager was able to go to school by minibus with a chaperone",

    "title": "Supplies to be sent to Scunthorpe to keep British Steel blast furnaces going",
    "article_text": "British Steel's blast furnaces are set to continue running with a delivery of enough raw materials to keep them alight for the \"coming weeks\" due on Tuesday, the government has said. Coking coal and iron ore from the US will be unloaded at Immingham docks and transported to the Scunthorpe site after a scramble for supplies. A separate shipment of materials is back on its way to the UK from Australia after a legal dispute over who owned the cargo was resolved between the government and British Steel's owner Jingye. The government seized control of the business over the weekend following a breakdown in talks with its Chinese owner amid accusations it was planning to switch the furnaces off. If the furnaces were starved of fuel and went out, the UK would no longer have the capability to produce so-called virgin steel, due to the process of restarting them being extremely difficult and costly. Virgin steel-making involves iron being extracted from its original source to be purified and treated to make all types of steel used in major construction projects, such as new buildings and railways. Scunthorpe's furnaces produce molten iron by splitting rocks containing iron ore in a chemical reaction that requires intense heat. Even if the temperature of the furnaces drops too low, it can lead to permanent damage. The government said the materials from the US would be enough to keep the steel-producing furnaces running for the coming weeks and added officials were working to \"get a steady pipeline of materials to keep the fire burning\". The materials have been paid for by the government, but the cost has not been revealed. The plant, which employs 2,700 people, is said to be in a \"far better position\" as a result of the government's intervention, according to union officials. On Tuesday, the Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds will travel to Immingham in north east Lincolnshire where the raw materials will be unloaded and transported to British Steel. He said the government had moved \"decisively\" to secure the raw materials needed to \"help save British Steel\", adding that UK industries depended on the company. Beijing has accused the British government of \"politicising trade co-operation\", and said its move to take control of British Steel had raised doubts about investment in the UK. On Saturday, an emergency law was rushed through Parliament, giving the government control of the  site to prevent Jingye from closing the furnaces against ministers' wishes. The government has appointed two long-standing British Steel employees to run the plant on an interim basis. The situation at the site has raised questions about Chinese investment in industries the government has deemed strategically critical. The government has so far stopped short of taking British Steel back into full public ownership, but has not ruled out nationalisation, while also looking for potential private investors to fund operations. China's embassy in the UK has urged ministers to negotiate with Jingye to \"find a solution acceptable to all parties\". In March, Jingye said its Scunthorpe site was losing £700,000 a day, which it said was \"no longer financially sustainable\", and the company began a consultation on job cuts. Government talks with Jingye last week failed to produce a breakthrough. The government said the company had rejected an offer of £500m in public money to help keep the furnaces operating, and had demanded more than twice as much with few guarantees it would keep the plant open. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it \"became clear\" to the government that Jingye was intent on closing down the blast furnaces no matter the financial support offered, prompting it to secure control of the site from its owner. Tai Woffinden is continuing to recover after a serious crash in Poland last month. Workers are optimistic the Scunthorpe plant can be saved but warn they have been \"let down before\". Sir Nic Dakin says there is still work to be done but he believes the plant's future can be secured. Tai Woffinden, from Scunthorpe, was involved in a serious collision during a race last month. An election to decide the first Greater Lincolnshire Mayor is taking place on 1 May.",

    "title": "Manchester Arena families in 'disbelief' bomber was able to attack officers",
    "article_text": "The families of five people murdered by Hashem Abedi in the Manchester Arena bombing have told the justice secretary of their \"absolute disbelief\" that he was allowed to attack prison officers in HMP Frankland. Despite being held in a high-security unit, Abedi, 28,attacked three prison officers on Saturdaywith improvised blades and hot cooking oil. In a letter seen by the BBC, the families say Abedi \"should not have access to anything that he can weaponise\" and urged the government to ensure he \"cannot be allowed to hurt anyone else\". Abedi wasjailed for life with a minimum 55 years in prisonafter being convicted of murdering 22 people in the 2017 attack carried out by his brother, Salman. Separately, Russell Hayward, the boyfriend of Martyn Hett who was also killed in the attack, told BBC Newsnight the latest incident was \"sickening and outrageous\". Since the letter was sent to Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood on Monday, inmates of separation centreshave been barred from using kitchens. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's spokesman said it was \"clear that something went terribly wrong\" with how Abedi had been handled. Abedi had been held in a separation centre - which holds a small number of inmates deemed to be dangerous and extremist - at Frankland. He moved to Frankland after carrying out an earlier attack on prison officers in London's Belmarsh prison in 2020, for which three years and 10 months was added to his sentence. Two prison officers remain in hospital with serious injuries from the latest attack, while a third had been discharged. One suffered a severed artery after being stabbed in the neck and the other received severe stab wounds to the back, the chairman of the prison officers' association said. Abedi is suspected of fashioning the blades from a baking tray, Mark Fairhurst added. The letter says \"we are writing in absolute disbelief\" that, once again, the \"evil Hashem Abedi has been allowed to cause danger to life\". They go on: \"As the families of Megan Hurley, Eilidh Macleod, Chloe Rutherford, Liam Curry, and Kelly Brewster, our beautiful, beloved children who were so tragically murdered along with 16 others in the Manchester Arena terror attack in May 2017, we find this situation beyond comprehension.\" The families say they understood prison to mean \"confinement in a cell for 23 hours a day, meals served through a hatch, and a single hour outside the cell, accompanied by a prison officer\" - which they described as \"the very minimum measure of justice for the devastation he caused\". They write: \"In our view, he should not be allowed any privileges whatsoever while serving a sentence for the deaths of 22 innocent lives and the injuring of many more. \"He should not have access to anything that he can weaponise, such as hot oil or items he can turn into blades.\" The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) has said there would be a full, independent review into the incident, which saw the three prison officers suffer stab wounds and burns. The families asked Mahmood to \"consider the full gravity of Abedi's actions when determining any further punishment\". They wrote \"His continuing violence in prison, attacking prison officers in Belmarsh and now attempting to murder three more, shows he feels no remorse and has no respect for human life. \"We send our heartfelt sympathies to the three prison officers who were injured on Saturday, as well as their families. Hashem Abedi cannot be allowed to hurt anyone else. \"As broken families, we firmly believe the appropriate punishment for this individual should be permanent solitary confinement. In truth, anything harsher would be more fitting.\" The MoJ said in a statement responding to the letter: \"Our thoughts remain with the victims of the Manchester Arena bombing and their families who are understandably concerned by the shocking attack at HMP Frankland this weekend. \"We've already taken immediate action to suspend access to kitchens in separation and close supervision centres.\" It added that it would be setting out the terms and scope of the review into the incident in the coming days. Mahmood has said separately that she will be pushing for the \"strongest possible punishment\" for Abedi. Speaking on Newsnight, Mr Hayward said Abedi needs to be \"watched all the time\". \"I didn't expect someone of his status to be so freely near a kitchen, let alone there long enough to construct this weapon and then traumatise more people,\" he said. \"This person has caused more pain and inflicted more trauma on people. \"I think he should be in solitary confinement, 24/7. \"I think his life inside should be so horrific, there should be no treats. He should be in a straightjacket.\" With his brother, the suicide bomber Salman Abedi, Hashem Abedi planned and prepared the attack on the Ariana Grande concert in 2017. He was in Libya when the blast took place and was later extradited to the UK to face trial. Hashem Abedi was found guilty in 2020 of 22 counts of murder, attempted murder and conspiracy to cause an explosion likely to endanger life, and sentenced to a minimum term of at least 55 years before he could be considered for parole. The sentence was a record for a fixed-length prison term. It is understood that Hashem Abedi has been moved to the separation centre at HMP Full Sutton following the kitchen attack. John Mansfield, who was jailed in 2007 for killing a woman, was found dead at HMP Whitemoor. The former striker was \"desperately unwell\" when admitted to hospital in Manchester, an inquest hears.

But the uninhabited, fogbound rock is significant for its location in an area known as the \"Grey Zone\" – the site of a rare international dispute between Canada and the United States. The two neighbours and long-time allies have each long laid claim to the island and surrounding water, where the US state of Maine meets Canada's New Brunswick province – and with that claim, the right to catch and sell the prized local lobsters. John Drouin, a US lobsterman who has fished in the Grey Zone for 30 years, tells of the mad dash by Canadian and American fishermen to place lobster traps at the start of the summer catching season each year. \"People have literally lost parts of their bodies, have had concussions, [their] head smashed and everything,\" he says. The injuries have been caused when lobstermen have been caught up in each other's lines. He says one friend lost his thumb after it became caught up in a Canadian line, what Mr Drouin calls his battle scar from the Grey Zone. The 277 square miles of sea around Machias Seal Island has been under dispute since the late 1700s – and in 1984, an international court ruling gave both the US and Canada the right to fish in the waterway. It has stood as a quirk – an isolated area of tension in what had been, until now, an otherwise close relationship between the two countries. But that could all be about to change. US President Donald Trump's return to the White House, steep tariffs on Canadian imports and rhetoric about making the country the 51st state has sparked a series of fresh flashpoints, with the possibility that he may ultimately wish to subsume Canada into the US hanging over everything. Amid the biggest shift in the relationship between the two countries in decades, the question is, what does he really want from Canada? Cutler, Maine, is the closest US town to the Grey Zone. It has a collection of scattered houses, one supply store and, for good reason, a lobster wholesaler. Aside from a few big-city retirees and holiday-goers, Cutler owes its existence to the bountiful crustaceans that inhabit the offshore waters. And for the lobstermen of Cutler, the international limbo of the Grey Zone is their everyday reality, as they scatter their traps along the bottom of the Gulf of Maine to catch the prized lobsters and bring them to market. During lobster season, the Grey Zone is packed with boats and buoys marking the location of their traps. When the waters get crowded and livelihoods are at stake, things can get ugly. \"Do we like it? Not in the least,\" says Mr Drouin. He has caught lobsters in the Grey Zone for 30 years. \"I will continue to complain about it until I can't breathe anymore.\" Another Maine lobsterman, Nick Lemieux, said he and his sons have had nearly 200 traps stolen in recent years – and he blames their rivals to the north. \"This is our area, and it's all we have to work with,\" he said. \"Things like that don't sit very well with us.\" Americans accuse the Canadians of operating under a different, more accommodating set of rules that allow them to catch larger lobsters. Canadians counter that the Americans have higher catch limits and are surreptitiously fishing in their territorial waters. The union representing Canada's border officials recently complained that Americans have responded to their enforcement efforts with threats of violence – and some of its officers have refused to work in the Grey Zone. Canada regularly dispatches maintenance workers to Machias Seal Island to check on an automated lighthouse – evidence, they say, of their control. The Americans point to US Marines who occupied the island during World War One as their proof of sovereignty. The dispute appears to be going nowhere, but during Trump's first presidency, events in the Grey Zone did not appear to be intruding greatly on the overall warmth between the US and Canada. When Trump hosted Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the White House in 2017, he spoke about the US-Canada relationship in glowing terms, remarking on the \"special bonds\" between the two nations that \"share much more than a border\". Yet his rhetoric has since changed sharply. In recent months, Trump has repeatedly called Canada the \"51st state\" of the US – and the White House has expressed a willingness to open up new areas of dispute all along the US-Canada border. In September, the president voiced designs on Canadian water in British Columbia in the west of the country, for instance, suggesting it could be piped to drought-parched California: \"You have millions of gallons of water pouring down from the north… they have essentially a very large faucet\". Approximately 1,500 miles further east, the Great Lakes could become another site of potential conflict, as US officials told their Canadian counterparts they are considering withdrawing from treaties over their coordinated environmental regulation. And even further east, a library has become the unlikely setting for a flashpoint: built deliberately to straddle the Vermont-Quebec border as a symbol of cooperation between Canada and the US, the Haskell Free Library and Opera House used to be open to residents from both nations. However in March, America changed the rules so that Canadians are required to pass through immigration control before they access the building, with the US Department of Homeland Security claiming it was in response to drug trafficking. Natural resources are another source of dispute. Canada has vast supplies of rare earth metals, gold, oil, coal and lumber – the kind of natural wealth that Trump has long prized. While Trump has disavowed any desire for Canada's lumber, energy stockpiles or manufactured products, in February Trudeau reportedly told a closed-door meeting of Canadian business and labour leaders that he saw it differently. \"I suggest that not only does the Trump administration know how many critical minerals we have but that may even be why they keep talking about absorbing us and making us the 51st state. They're very aware of our resources, of what we have, and they very much want to be able to benefit from those,\" the CBC quoted Trudeau as saying. Jordan Heath-Rawlings, a Canadian journalist and host of The Big Story podcast, believes Trump wants Canadian resources, and that the president's annexation comments should be taken seriously. \"He likes the idea of being the guy to bring in a huge land mass,\" says Mr Heath-Rawlings. \"He probably wants the Arctic, which is obviously going to become much more valuable in the years to come.\" For Trump, even the US-Canadian border itself is suspect. \"If you look at a map, they drew an artificial line right through it between Canada and the US,\" he said in March. \"Somebody did it a long time ago, and it makes no sense.\" Needless to say, Trump's comments have rankled Canadian leaders, who warn of the president's ultimate designs on their homeland. In March, Trudeau accused the US president of planning \"a total collapse of the Canadian economy because that will make it easier to annex us\". The previous month, after Trump first announced new tariffs on Canada, Trudeau had said: \"Trump has it in mind that one of the easiest ways of doing that [annexing Canada] is absorbing our country. And it is a real thing.\" If US territorial ambitions for Canada are, in fact, a \"real thing\", it presents a simple, vexing question. Why? Why would the US, which has had the closest of diplomatic, military, economic and cultural ties with its northern neighbour for more than a century, put all of that at risk? Some see a pattern in Trump's designs on Canada, Greenland and the Panama Canal – one that reflects a dramatic change in how the US sees itself in the world. It has been most clearly articulated by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who said in January that the post-World War Two dominance of the US was more the exception than the norm. \"Eventually you were going to reach back to a point where you had a multi-polar world, multiple great powers in different parts of the planet,\" he said. \"We face that now with China and to some extent Russia, and … rogue states like Iran and North Korea.\" According to Michael Williams, professor of international affairs at the University of Ottawa, if the current Trump administration thinks that American world dominance is no longer possible or even desired, the US might pull back from far-flung conflicts and European commitments. Instead, says Prof Williams, the US would prioritise its \"territorial core\", creating a continental fortress of sorts, insulated on both sides by the vastness of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. \"If this is your plan, you seek to control key geographic choke points,\" he says. \"You maximise access to natural resources, of which Canada has plenty, and you reshore industry whenever possible.\" Such a geopolitical outlook is hardly new. In the 1820s, US President James Monroe articulated a new global order in which America and Europe confined themselves to their own hemispheres. But it does represent a remarkable shift in US foreign policy since the end of World War Two. Prof Williams acknowledges that it's difficult to figure out exactly what the US president is thinking – a view wholeheartedly endorsed by John Bolton, who served as Trump's national security adviser for more than a year of his first presidential term. \"Trump has no philosophy,\" he says. \"He gets ideas, but does not follow a coherent pattern. There is no underlying strategy.\" The president is currently fixated on minerals and natural resources, he said, but Mr Bolton argues the best way to go about doing that is through the private sector, not by floating the idea of annexing an ally. Canada, for its part, has offered to work with US companies on joint mining partnerships. Prof Williams and Mr Bolton agree that whatever the motivations behind Trump's designs on Canada, the diplomatic damage that's being done will be difficult to undo – and the possibility of unanticipated consequences is high. \"Trump likes to say in a lot of contexts that other people don't have any cards,\" says Prof Williams. \"But the further you push people to the wall, the more you may find that they have cards that you didn't know they had – and they might be willing to play them. And even if you have more cards, the consequences of doing so can easily spiral out of control in some really bad ways.\" Canadians have already been boycotting US products and cancelling winter trips south, which has had an impact on tourist communities in Florida. \"We're not looking for a fight, but Canada's ready for one,\" says Mr Heath-Rawlings. The idea that the trust between the US and Canada has been broken is one that's been embraced by the country's new prime minister, Mark Carney, as a general election looms. \"The old relationship we had with the United States based on deepening integration of our economies and tight security and military cooperation is over,\" he said recently. \"I reject any attempts to weaken Canada, to wear us down, to break us so that America can own us.\" Back in the 19th Century, territorial conflicts and flare-ups along the US-Canada border were a more frequent occurrence. Americans made multiple unsuccessful attempts to capture Canadian territory during the 1812 War. In 1844, some Americans called for military force if the UK wouldn't agree to its claims in the Pacific Northwest. The 1859 \"pig dispute\" involved contested islands near Vancouver and the unfortunate shooting of a British hog that had intruded on an American's garden. All that seemed the stuff of dusty history books, where the Grey Zone was a diplomatic oddity – an exception to a peaceful norm in the modern world of developed and integrated democracies. But that calm is now broken, and no one is sure where these stormy waters will lead either country.

    "article_text": "The owner of Pontins holiday parks has been charged with corporate manslaughter after an air conditioning duct fell on guests at a resort. Eighteen people were injured at Pontins Brean Sands, Somerset. when a section of the ceiling and ducting inside its entertainment centre, called The Fun Factory, collapsed in February 2019. Among them was grandmother Wendy Jones, 68. She spent the final six months of her life in hospital before she died on 4 August 2019. Pontins' parent company, Britannia Jinky Jersey, will appear in court next month. Pontins is part of the Britannia Hotels group. The BBC has contacted Britannia for  comment. In addition, contractor Stephen Bennison, 58, from Faringdon in Lancashire, has been charged with an offence under Section 3 of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. A BBC News special report into the incident last year highlighted the concerns from a former employee about the installation of insulation on top of the ceiling and ducting in 2015. Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue said in 2019 that the incident involved the collapse of approximately 40m (131ft) of structural ducting and ceiling sections, exposing live damaged electrics. About 100 people were in the entertainment hall about to play bingo when the collapse happened. The charges follow a joint investigation by Avon and Somerset Police and Somerset Council. Ch Supt Roger Doxsey, senior investigating officer, said: \"First and foremost our thoughts are with the family of Wendy Jones. \"This has been a complex investigation and we're grateful for the support of Somerset Council and other partners to reach this stage.\" The defendants are due to appear at Bristol Magistrates' Court on 6 May.

    "title": "Biggest choice of low-deposit mortgages for 17 years",
    "article_text": "More low-deposit mortgages are available to choose from than at any time since the financial crisis of 2008, according to new figures. The number of deals that need a deposit of 5% or 10% have risen to their highest level since then, data from financial information service Moneyfacts suggests. The extra choice is a boost for first time buyers, although house prices and mortgage rates are higher than they were for much of the last 17 years. And competition is tough, with homes typically listed for just over a month before a sale is agreed, according to separate figures from property website Zoopla show The UK housing market has been relatively settled in recent times, although buyers still need to navigate uncertainty over interest rates andchanges to stamp dutyin England and Northern Ireland. For buyers able to offer a deposit of 5% of the home loan, there are 442 mortgages to choose from, according to Moneyfacts. Two years ago, the choice was from fewer than half of that total, at 204. Borrowers able to pay a 10% deposit now have 845 products to choose from, up from 684 in April 2023. However, they still have to pay a mortgage rate of well over 5% on average, while a borrower who pays a 40% deposit typically pays a rate of under 5%. It has been hard for many prospective first-time buyers to save due to the rising cost of renting in recent years. But Rachel Springall, from Moneyfacts, said there was a flourishing choice of mortgages for those whose ability to pay a deposit is stretched. \"A rise in product availability for aspiring homeowners is a healthy step in the right direction,\" she said. However she said only 6% of all deals available to borrowers across fixed and variable mortgages had a deposit requirement of 5%, so there was still \"room for improvement\". Mortgage rates remain difficult to predict owing touncertainty created by US tariff policyon the wider economy. While securing a mortgage is one thing, buyers also need to act relatively quickly when it comes to finding a new home, data suggests. Homes in England and Wales spend an average of 36 days on the market before a sale is agreed, according to news figures from the property portal Zoopla. Sales were agreed on half of homes within two months of being listed, it said. To complete a sale, sellers and buyers will typically need another four to six months, depending on the complexity of the transaction. The fastest sales were agreed for two-bedroom homes, at an average of 23 days, while homes with four bedrooms or more typically took an extra 15 days. Homes in northern regions of England tended to sell faster than homes in the south, where prices are higher, it said. Even so, the fastest selling, with an agreed sale taking an average of 19 days, had a north-south mix, with Manchester and the London borough of Waltham Forest hitting that mark. \"Households that are thinking about listing their home and moving in 2025 need to set their asking price at the right level and take the advice of local agents,\" said Richard Donnell, executive director at Zoopla. \"Buyers have a lot more choice of homes for sale than a year ago. Aiming too high on the asking price is likely to impact saleability and how long you may have to wait to agree a sale.\" Zoopla uses a median average figure (the mid-point) for its data. It also discards homes that have been listed for more than six months, as it considers them to be unlikely to sell. Analysts warn the unexpected growth could prove short-lived due to the threat of US tariffs and business tax rises. How the health of the UK economy is measured, and why the GDP calculation matters. Farmers have urged Keir Starmer to protect British agriculture in any trade deal he signs with Donald Trump. Residents say they are facing rent increases of more than £300 a month. It is the biggest lender so far to offer cheaper deals as the Bank of England is forecast to make more interest rate cuts this year.",

    "title": "How much vital UK infrastructure does China own?",
    "article_text": "The fate of the Scunthorpe steel works has shone a fresh spotlight on Chinese investment in the UK economy with critics raising questions over potential security risks. The British Steel plant had been owned by China's Jingye Steel. But the UK government has now taken control of the Scunthorpe site, amid claims the Chinese owners were planning to permanently decommission its two blast furnaces and use its rolling mills to process imported Chinese-made metal instead. BBC Verify looks at what we know about the extent of Chinese investment in the UK economy - and how much of a concern it should be. Data from the Office for National Statisticssuggests total Chinese investment in the UK in 2023 amounted to about £4.3bn - a small fraction of the total £2 trillion  of overseas investment in the British economy in that year. However, this is likely to be a considerable underrepresentation of the true scale of Chinese investment in the UK because the official data only includes the immediate investing country, not the ultimate source of the money - and because of a lack of transparency from Beijing when it comes to overseas ownership stakes. Independentestimates from the American Enterprise Institute think tank, using corporate reports, suggest total public and private Chinese investment in the UK between 2005 and 2024 added up to $105bn, or £82bn. This would have made Britain the third largest national destination of Chinese investment over this period, after only the US and Australia. There is a wide range of Chinese investment in the UK, ranging from critical energy and transport infrastructure, to stakes in private companies and football clubs. Significant Chinese investments in UK infrastructure includea 10% stake in London's Heathrow airportby the China Investment Corporation, a sovereign wealth fund wholly owned by the Chinese state. The Hong Kong-based industrialist Li Ka-shing's investment groupowns UK Power Networks, which operates electricity distribution infrastructure across London, the South East of England and the East of England. The billionaire's group alsoowns a 76% stake in Northumbrian Water Group, which provides water supply and sewerage in the north east of England. There is also a large Chinese investment in the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in Somerset. China General Nuclear Power Group originally had a 33.5% stake, with the rest owned by the French company EDF. But EDF reports that the Chinese company has stopped contributing additional financing to the joint project - which has been running over budget - and, as a resultthe Chinese stake at the end of last year had declined to 27.4%. The same Chinese company has an even larger stake - 66.5% - in the proposed Bradwell B nuclear site in Essex,according to the project website. EDF owns the rest. There is also Chinese investment in other sectors of the UK economy, such as transport. The Hangzhou-based Chinese car company, Geely Auto,owns the Coventry-headquartered London EV Company, which manufactures electric black taxis. Chinese firms have some investment in consumer brands too. Li Ka-shing's groupowns the Suffolk-headquartered pub chain and brewery Greene King. Wolverhampton Wanderers Football Club isowned by the Shanghai-based conglomerate Fosun. While Jingye steel had total control of the Scunthorpe steel plant, it's important to bear in mind that Chinese investors do not always have majority stakes in UK businesses, which would interfere with their ability to determine those companies' operational decisions. Some of these organisations such as airports and water utilities are also tightly regulated, potentially limiting the freedom of manoeuvre of their Chinese owners in controlling the assets. Chinese investors are also estimated to have considerable holdings of UK land and buildings. The Leadenhall Building, known as the \"cheesegrater\", in the City of London wasacquired by a Chinese property investor for £1.15bn in 2017. The potential danger posed by Chinese investment in UK infrastructure has been extensively debated in recent years - and a particular flashpoint was the involvement of the Shenzhen-based Chinese technology company Huawei in building the UK's 5G communications infrastructure. Huawei wasfounded by Ren Zhengfei, a former Chinese army officer, in 1987. The UK's National Cyber Security Centreinitially judged in 2019that any risk posed by Huawei was manageable. But the UK, nevertheless, required the Chinese company tobegin pulling out of the UK's telecoms infrastructure in 2020, after coming under pressure from the US government during Donald Trump's first term as President. The involvement of Huawei in UK networks was alsoopposed by a number of MPs. Grace Theodoulou, policy fellow on China at the Council on Geostrategy, says there are two main potential threats to consider for Chinese investment in UK critical infrastructure. \"The first is the potential for espionage – for example, having Chinese-made audiovisual equipment installed in government buildings or devices. \"The second is the infrastructure can be controlled by the manufacturer and, as such, could be disrupted for geopolitical leverage,\" she said. Some analysts argue thatChinese law- which mandates all Chinese companies to align closely with Chinese Communist Party directives and toassist with national intelligence efforts- represents an inherent security risk in all Chinese investments in Western infrastructure. \"A likely scenario where it might be in China's interests [to harm UK infrastructure] would be to impede Britain's ability to impose sanctions against Beijing in the event of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. \"If China were to invade Taiwan, and should they have control over parts of our critical infrastructure, it would highly impact the potential to enforce sanctions or similar measures,\" Ms Theodoulou said. However,other analysts are scepticalover whether it would be in the financial interest of Chinese investors to sabotage UK infrastructure or firms, as such actions would collapse the value of their investments and likely lead to their appropriation by the UK government. \"This threat is asserted and not proven, and these companies are profit-driven so it is not in their interests to sabotage our infrastructure,\" said Prof Giles Mohan of the Open University. And they argue that a distinction should be drawn between Chinese investments in vital infrastructure and investments into UK firms which own consumer brands where the potential for public harm is considerably lower.

    "title": "Good cops, bad cops - how Trump's shifting tariff team kept world guessing",
    "article_text": "In the chaotic minutes after US President Donald Trump's administrationabruptly reversed courseand paused dozens of sweeping \"reciprocal\" tariffs, one man quickly became the public face of the decision: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. \"It took great courage,\" the bespectacled 62-year-old former hedge fund manager told the dozens of reporters gathered around him on 9 April. \"Great courage to stay the course until this moment.\" Notably absent during the press briefing - after which markets rocketed - were the other two men tasked with delivering Trump's tariff message to the American people: Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and trade adviser Pete Navarro. Bessent's centre-stage role in the tariffs announcement, some trade policy veterans have suggested, starkly highlights how shifting power dynamics within the White House brought the US back from the brink of an all-out global trade war, even if all the players are broadly supportive of Trump's economic agenda. \"He's playing the good cop,\" William Alan Reinsch, the former head of the National Foreign Trade Council, told the BBC. \"And Lutnick and Navarro are playing the bad cop.\" Publicly, the White House has been largely quiet on the chain of events that led to Trump's market-shaking decision to pause reciprocal tariffs for most countries while raising levies on China, with the president saying only that he had been \"thinking about it\" for a \"few days\" before it \"came together\" early on the morning of 9 April. But according to US media reports, it was Bessent, inundated with calls from business leaders, that played a key part in swaying Trump, including with conversations on Air Force One the weekend beforehand and in the Oval Office on the morning of the decision. Earlier in his career, Bessent expressed reservations about tariffs. Some observers believe these views, together with long experience in the bond market, ultimately made it possible for him to gain the president's ear over Navarro and Lutnick, both of whom represented a harder-line stance on the tariffs. \"I think what happened was that Trump wasn't paying attention to the bond market,\" added Mr Reinsch, now an economics expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"And Bessent got him to pay attention.\" Mr Reinsch, who was also undersecretary of commerce for export administration in the 1990s during President Bill Clinton's administration, said that Bessent's approach, so far, has been \"a classic way to deal with Trump\". \"Don't tell him he's wrong or made a mistake,\" he added. \"Tell him there's a better way forward to achieve his objectives, and that the market is not reacting the way we want it to react.\" On the morning of the announcement on 9 April, Trump met in the Oval Office with Bessent as well as National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett and Lutnick, the 63-year-old former chief executive of Cantor Fitzgerald and a noted China hawk. Two other key players in tariffs policy were notably absent, prompting one source close to the White House to tell Reuters news agency there had been a \"pecking order change\". One, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, was just a short drive away on Capitol Hill, testifying about tariffs before a House of Representative committee. He would later that day learn of the tariffs announcement in real-time along with the lawmakers, prompting a tense exchange in which he was accused of having the \"rug pulled out\" from underneath him. The other, Peter Navarro, was similarly absent despite being one of the most visible figures in the media on tariffs, prompting speculation his stance had fallen out of favour with the president. At times, the various figures involved in tariffs gave contradictory statements on the policy, which experts say contributed to confusion and market volatility. \"They are not singing on the same page,\" said Mark Sobel, who spent nearly 40 years at the Treasury Department, including as deputy assistant secretary for international monetary and financial policy. \"You hear Navarro, you hear Bessent, you hear the president and you feel you're getting whiplash,\" he added. \"This is not a disciplined group.\" Terry Haines, the founder of Washington DC-based consultancy Pangaea Policy, told the BBC he believes that it was \"deliberate\" that the administration put forward various people to become the public faces of tariffs. \"[They wanted to] throw as many spokespeople out there, say different things, and flood the zone with opinion,\" he said. \"It may have efficacy in politics, but it confuses the hell out of markets.\" As an example, Mr Haines pointed to Navarro, who he said gets \"more leeway than you'd expect\" owing to thefour-month jail term he servedfor contempt of Congress after ignoring a subpoena from a House committee investigating the 2021 US Capitol riot. \"They appeal to different audiences. Bessent would be interested in the financial press, while Navarro has a different message,\" he said. Haines, however, cautioned against assuming that any one person contributed the most to Trump's decision. \"Markets want winners and losers, like People magazine-style stuff,\" he said. \"But we need to know who to listen to, and that became, pretty much by default, Bessent.\" Several experts contacted by the BBC said they expect Bessent to now take a much more prominent public role in tariff policy, with Lutnick taking charge of the negotiations, while Navarro, Hassett and Greer play supporting roles. Haines, for example, said he believes Bessent will become, in real terms, \"the spokesman for economic policy\". Ultimately, a more structured approach could contribute to market stability, according to Andrew Hale, an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation. \"I imagine it will get more certain as we go forward,\" he said. \"It's what businesses and investors want.\" Nayib Bukele has won praise from Donald Trump for imprisoning some \"very bad people\" deported from the US. Authorities are still investigating a possible motive as the suspect's mother says he suffered from mental health issues. The White House sent a sweeping list of requirements to the university last week, which it said were aimed at fighting antisemitism. The US government is seeking to break up Meta by forcing a spinoff of Instagram or WhatsApp. Donald Trump's return to the White House has created flashpoints between the North American neighbours.",

That, however, is not all the world number two will receive for his dramatic play-off victory over Justin Rose. Here's what else he takes home from Augusta National. This video can not be played Watch McIlroy claim his Masters green jacket After breaking away from celebrations with friends who had gathered on the other side of the ropes, McIlroy was heard to remark \"I've got to go and get a Green Jacket\". While not the only tournament to reward its victor with a blazer - the winner of the RBC Heritage this weekend will receive a snazzy plaid number, for example - the Masters' Green Jacket is without a doubt the most iconic item of clothing in sport. \"It's very nice,\" was McIlroy's reflection after the garment was slipped on to his shoulders by last year's champion Scottie Scheffler. He will have to make the most of it while he can, though. While McIlroy is free to wear his jacket wherever he pleases for the next 12 months, thereafter it must stay on club grounds. Winners also receive a gold medal - a tradition which dates back to the tournament's first staging in 1934 - and a replica of the trophy which is modelled on the Augusta National clubhouse. Rory McIlroy was presented his Green Jacket by 2024 champion Scottie Scheffler At $21m (Â£15.9m), this year's Masters prize pot was the biggest in the tournament's history. While hardly motivated by money at this stage of his stellar career, McIlroy's share as winner comes in at $4.2m (Â£3.2m). The five-time major winner was quick to credit his caddie and childhood friend Harry Diamond after sinking the winning putt. Set to bank 10% of the winnings, Diamond had a more than productive weekend's work too. Past champions at Augusta gather for dinner on the Tuesday of Masters week each year The Masters tournament delights in its use of the phrase \"a tradition unlike any other\" and the annual Champions Dinner certainly falls into that category. Starting in 1952 at the urging of Ben Hogan, the exclusive meal is an invite-only affair with admittance strictly limited to past champions. Upon arrival in Georgia each year, three-time winner Phil Mickelson has reportedly often enjoyed asking those without a Green Jacket if they have any dinner plans on Tuesday evening. As reigning champion, it will be McIlroy's responsibility to plan next year's menu too - Ulster fry anyone? This video can not be played 'A long time coming' - BBC Sport NI's interview with Rory McIlroy While McIlroy must leave his jacket on site, at least he can be a regular visitor. Victory brings with it membership at Augusta National, meaning he can tee it up there any time - or at least any time outside of May to October, when the club is closed. When he does choose to return, the Holywood golfer will see parts of the fabled grounds he has yet to experience in his past 17 years of visiting. There is a champions' locker room, complete with champions' lockers and champions' parking spaces. During Masters week, there is even a champions' practice range. Fred Couples and Bernhard Langer have won three Masters titles between them As the world number two, it has been quite some time since McIlroy has had to worry about his place in the field at golf's biggest events. When it comes to the Masters, now he never will again. While other majors offer limited exemptions to their past champions, winners at Augusta National can return for as long as they like. Just this year, Bernhard Langer, 67, and Fred Couples, 65, were in the field and finished only one and two shots respectively away from the cut. Could McIlroy see himself making as many return visits? \"They are going to have to wheel me out of here when I am 90 years old,\" he said.",

    "title": "HBO confirms more cast members for Harry Potter series - including Snape and Hagrid",
    "article_text": "Nick Frost, Paapa Essiedu, Janet McTeer and Paul Whitehouse will appear in the forthcoming Harry Potter TV series, US network HBO has confirmed. Frost has been cast as Hagrid, McTeer will play Minerva McGonagall, and Essiedu will portray Severus Snape. All three were reported to be in talks with the network in recent weeks. HBO have now formally confirmed their casting, and announced that Whitehouse, well known for the Fast Show and Harry & Paul, will play Argus Filch. The network alsoconfirmed John Lithgow's announcement in Februarythat he will play Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore. The show is due to begin filming this summer, with the first series airing potentially as early as next year. The actors playing Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger have not yet been cast. HBO launched an open casting call for the three lead roles, which reportedly attracted more than 30,000 submissions. Showrunner Francesca Gardiner and executive producer Mark Mylod said they were \"delighted to have such extraordinary talent onboard, and we can't wait to see them bring these beloved characters to new life\". JK Rowling's phenomenally successful series of novels has previously been adapted into a film franchise starring Daniel Radcliffe as Potter. The TV series, however, will have more breathing space to explore the plot lines from the books without the time constraints of the film. Rowling will serve as an executive producer on the TV series, which HBO has said will be a \"faithful adaptation\" of her books. Further casting announcements are expected to follow soon, with rumours swirling about other actors reportedly in discussions about joining, includingCillian Murphy as a possible Voldermort. Higson worked on a number of renowned Scottish productions including Gregory's Girl. Millions of pounds are being spent to develop Hartlepool as a hub for the TV and film industry. The actress stayed behind the camera to make a documentary about Young's 2023 solo tour. A new cinema solely dedicated to screening LGBTQ+ films opens in south London.

    "title": "Katy Perry among all-female space crew back on Earth after historic flight",
    "article_text": "Pop star Katy Perry and five other women safely returned to Earth after reaching space aboard Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin rocket. The singer was joined by Bezos's fiancée Lauren Sánchez and CBS presenter Gayle King, who said a highlight of the flight was hearing Perry sing Louis Armstrong's \"What a Wonderful World\". After landing back on Earth, Perry said she felt \"super connected to life\" and \"so connected to love\". The flight lasted around 11 minutes and took the six women more than 100km (62 miles) above Earth, crossing the internationally recognised boundary of space and giving them a few moments of weightlessness. Also on board were former Nasa rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen, and film producer Kerianne Flynn. The New Shepard rocket lifted off from its West Texas launch site just after 08:30 local time (14:30 BST). The capsule returned to Earth with a parachute-assisted soft landing, while the rocket booster also landed back in Texas. Cheering could be heard from inside the capsule as the recovery crew went to collect them. Jeff Bezos opened the capsule door to welcome back Lauren Sánchez, the first to disembark. \"I'm so proud of this crew,\" she said tearfully. \"I can't put it into words.\" She paused, before adding: \"I looked out of the window and we got to see the moon.\" \"Earth looked so quiet,\" she said, adding that it was not what she expected. \"It was quiet, but really alive.\" Next out was Katy Perry, who kissed the ground and lifted a daisy to the sky - her daughter is called Daisy. Gayle King also got on her knees and kissed the ground. \"I just want to have a moment with the ground, just appreciate the ground for just a second,\" she said. The last to get out, Kerianne Flynn, pointed at the sky and shouted: \"I went to space.\" A celebrity cast had watched the launch from the ground. Speaking from the viewing platform, Khloé Kardashian said: \"I didn't realise how emotional it would be, it's hard to explain. I have all this adrenaline and I'm just standing here.\" \"Whatever you dream of is in our reach, especially in today's day and age. Dream big, wish for the stars—and one day, you could maybe be amongst them,\"​ she added. Oprah Winfrey spoke about her friend Gayle King, and revealed she was a nervous flier. \"I mean, for her—whew—anytime we're on a flight, she's in somebody's lap at the slightest bit of turbulence. She has real, real-world anxiety when it comes to flying. And this... this is her overcoming a wall of fear,\" she said. The spacecraft was fully autonomous, requiring no pilots, and the crew did not manually operate the vehicle. The last all-female spaceflight was over 60 years ago when Soviet Cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova became the first woman to travel into space on a solo mission aboard the spacecraft Vostok 6. Since then, there have been no other all-female spaceflights but women have made numerous significant contributions. The space tourism  industry is still in its infancy, so every successful launch is significant and demonstrates that these short, commercial flights can be carried out safely. But some critics stress it is tourism, not space science, and professional astronauts undertake missions, including scientific research, for the benefit of humankind. \"A celebrity isn't an envoy of humankind - they go into space for their own reasons,\" Dr Kai-Uwe Schrogl, special advisor for political affairs at the European Space Agency, told BBC News. \"These flights are significant and exciting, but I think maybe they can also be a source of frustration for space scientists,\" he added. \"We see space flight as being for science, knowledge and the interests of humanity. \"Celebrities do it for amusement but get a lot more attention than the regular astronauts.\" The space flight also generated a range of response on social media, from enthusiasm to hostility. Dr Tanya Harrison, from the Outer Space Institute experts network said: \"A lot of the comments that I saw on social media were things about, 'Oh, it's like the Real Housewives go to Mars' or 'It's the oligarchy in space, read the room, the timing is terrible.'\" But: \"There were a lot of positive takes as well. People were like, 'Oh, this is so cool. Katy Perry is going to space.'\" Dr Harrison, who had previously worked on Nasa missions to Mars said: \"The cynical part of me wants to call it a marketing stunt. This is a company promoting the fact they can launch tourists into space.\" However she noted the all-women team might \"change the demographics a little bit of who might want to do something like this.\" \"Socially, they might have had some impact\", she said. In a news conference after the flight, two of the women took issue with some of the criticism the mission had received, related for example to its cost. \"I feel that anybody who is criticising doesn't really understand what's happening here,\" said Gayle King. She said that the astronauts had had a huge, positive response from young women and young girls. Lauren Sánchez said she had got \"fired up\" about the criticism and would love to have the naysayers come to Blue Origin and see the thousands of employees who \"put their heart and soul into\" the missions. Blue Origin is a private space company founded in 2000 by Bezos, the billionaire entrepreneur who also started Amazon. Although Blue Origin has not released full ticket prices, a $150,000 (£114,575.85) deposit is required to reserve a seat—underlining the exclusivity of these early flights. Alongside its suborbital tourism business, the company is also developing long-term space infrastructure, including reusable rockets and lunar landing systems. The New Shepard rocket is designed to be fully reusable and its booster returns to the launch pad for vertical landings after each flight, reducing overall costs. According to US law, astronauts must complete comprehensive training for their specific roles. Blue Origin says its New Shepard passengers are trained over two days with a focus on physical fitness, emergency protocols, details about the safety measures and procedures for zero gravity. Additionally, there are two support members referred to as Crew Member Seven: one provides continuous guidance to astronauts, while the other maintains communication from the control room during the mission. The rise of space tourism has prompted criticism that it is too exclusive and environmentally damaging. Supporters argue that private companies are accelerating innovation and making space more accessible. Professor Brian Cox told the BBC in 2024: \"Our civilisation needs to expand beyond our planet for so many reasons,\" and believes that collaboration between NASA and commercial firms is a positive step. Rocket engine exhaust contains gases and particles that can affect Earth's climate and ozone layer. On its web page under the title\"Protecting our Planet\"Blue Origin claims: \"During flight, the only byproduct of New Shepard's engine combustion is water vapor with no carbon emissions.\" However, Eloise Marais, a professor of Atmospheric Chemistry and Air Quality at University College London points out that water vapour too is a greenhouse gas and is a chemical that is not supposed to be in the upper layers of the atmosphere. \"It alters the chemistry of the stratosphere, depleting the ozone layer, and also forms clouds that affect climate,\" she says. Experts say that as more rockets are launched, the risks of harming the ozone layer increases. The high cost of space tourism makes it inaccessible to most people, with these expensive missions out of reach for the majority. Critics, including actress Olivia Munn, questioned the optics of this particular venture, remarking \"there's a lot of people who can't even afford eggs,\" during an appearance on Today with Jenna & Friends. Additonal reporting by Kate Stephens, BBC Climate and Science. The mission is going to launch in 2028 and is hoping to land in 2030. MARIO's development will make space-based projects such as solar powered panels. Tim Peake said investing in the space economy would \"inspire future generations\". Steve Rotheram says Tim Peake was impressed by the bio-engineering expertise in the North West. The billionaire says an unmanned mission by his SpaceX \"Starship\" vehicle will be followed by human landings as early as 2029.",

    "title": "Conditions at Gaza hospitals 'beyond description' after Israeli attacks, WHO says",
    "article_text": "The World Health Organization has said conditions at hospitals in Gaza are \"beyond description\", after a major facility was put out of service by an Israeli air strike. Spokeswoman Dr Margaret Harris told the BBC it was seeing \"attack after attack\" on hospitals and healthcare workers, and medical supplies were critically low due to Israel's blockade of the territory. On Sunday, staff at al-Ahli hospital in Gaza City said an Israeli strike had destroyed its laboratory and damaged its emergency room. They did not report any direct casualties, but said a child died due to disruption of care. The Israeli military said it hit a \"command-and-control centre\" used by Hamas to plan attacks. The hospital is run by the Church of England, whose bishops said they shared \"grief, sorrow and outrage\" with Palestinians over the attack and called on Israel to provide evidence to support its claim. A ceasefire in Gaza ended when Israel resumed its air and ground campaign four weeks ago, saying that military pressure would force Hamas to release the hostages it is still holding. Al-Ahli hospital was struck by two missiles around midnight on Sunday- the fifth time it has been hit since the beginning of the war. According to the Anglican Diocese of Jerusalem, the two-storey genetic laboratory was demolished and the pharmacy and emergency department buildings were damaged. Surrounding buildings were also damaged, including St Philip's Church. The diocese said the Israel military gave a 20-minute warning to hospital staff and patients to evacuate before the attack. There were no casualties as a result of the strike, but one child who had previously suffered a head injury died as a result of the rushed evacuation process, it added. Later, WHO Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the UN agency had been told by al-Ahli's director that the emergency room, laboratory, emergency room X-ray machines, and the pharmacy were \"destroyed\". The hospital was forced to move 50 patients to other hospitals, but 40 patients in a critical condition could not be moved, he added. \"Hospitals are protected under international humanitarian law. Attacks on health care must stop. Once again we repeat: patients, health workers and hospitals must be protected.\" The Israeli foreign ministry said it was a \"precise strike on a single building that was used by Hamas as a terror command and control centre\" and where there was \"no medical activity take place\". It also stressed that an \"early warning\" was issued, and that the strike was \"carried out while avoiding further damage to the hospital compound, which remained operational for continued medical treatment\". Hamas condemned the attack as a \"savage crime\" and rejected the claim that it was using the facility for military purposes. On Monday, the Church of England's House of Bishops said in a statement they were \"dismayed that hospitals have become battlegrounds in Gaza\" and that Israel had \"yet to provide clear and compelling evidence to substantiate its claim\" that the hospital was being used by Hamas. \"Against that backdrop, we call for an independent, thorough and transparent investigation into this attack as well as the alleged misuse of the hospital.\" The bishops also said that \"the extremely limited time given to staff and patients to evacuate the hospital was a further assault on fundamental human rights and basic human dignity\". WHO representative Dr Rik Peeperkorn meanwhile told the BBC that al-Ahli was now unable to receive new patients pending repairs, and that this would \"heavily impact trauma patients\". \"Al-Ahli was a key trauma hospital north of Wadi Gaza. It is the hospital with the only functional CT scanner north of Wadi Gaza,\" he said, referring to the valley that effectively divides the territory in two because it is an Israeli-designated \"no-go\" area. The charity Medical Aid for Palestinians also quoted an orthopaedic surgeon at al-Ahli as saying that the level of care the hospital could provide to the 40 remaining patients was \"quite similar to that of a hostel\". \"We are unable to perform any surgical procedures, as these patients require laboratory diagnostics, pharmacy support, and emergency referrals in case of complications - all of which have ceased entirely due to the recent attack,\" Dr Ahmed al-Shurafa said. Dr Harris warned: \"We're seeing attack after attack on hospitals, healthcare workers, ambulance workers... the very people that are relied on, who give their all to save lives. But they don't give their all to lose their lives.\" On 23 March, the Israeli military struck the surgical department of Nasser hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis, killing Hamas finance chief Ismail Barhoum and one other person. Hamas said Barhoum was being treated for injuries that he suffered in an earlier Israeli attack. The military denied this, saying he was in the hospital \"in order to commit acts of terrorism\". That same day, 15 emergency workers, including eight Palestinian Red Crescent paramedics, were shot and killed by Israeli troops in nearby Rafah as they responded to a report of wounded people. The Israeli military said the troops \"opened fire due to a perceived threat\" and that six of those killed were \"Hamas terrorists\", without giving evidence. The Red Crescent denied the allegation and accused Israel of a \"full-fledged war crime\". On Monday, the International Committee of the Red Cross said it had received information that a ninth paramedic who had been missing since the attack was being held \"in an Israeli place of detention\". The ICRC's head of sub-delegation in Gaza, Adrian Zimmermann, also warned that the wider shortage of medical supplies \"puts the life and the wellbeing of Gazans who require healthcare services at risk\". Dr Peeperkorn said they were running critically low because Israel had not allowed in any deliveries of humanitarian aid for more than six weeks. He added that the WHO had stockpiled some supplies in its warehouses during the recent ceasefire, but that the Israeli military was not facilitating transfers between northern and southern Gaza. \"Last week, we had a discussion with one of the medical specialists at al-Ahli. He was telling us that they had to use the same surgical gowns and the same surgical gloves for various operations, while we have surgical gloves and gowns in our warehouse in Deir al-Balah [south of Wadi Gaza],\" he recalled. \"We want to bring them, but we are not facilitated.\" The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 50,980 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. A ceasefire deal that began in January and lasted two months saw Hamas release 33 Israeli hostages – eight of them dead – and five Thai hostages in exchange for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and a surge in humanitarian aid entering Gaza. Israel resumed its offensive on 18 March, blaming Hamas's refusal to accept a proposal for an extension of the agreement's first phase and the release of more of the 59 hostages it is still holding, up to 24 of whom are believed to be alive. Hamas accused Israel of violating the original deal, according to which there would be a second phase where all the remaining living hostages would be handed over and the war brought to a permanent end. On Monday, a Hamas delegation led by the group's chief negotiator left Cairo without making any progress in talks with Egyptian mediators aimed at reaching a new ceasefire agreement, a senior Palestinian official familiar with the talks told the BBC. \"No breakthrough was achieved due to Israel's refusal to commit to ending the war and withdrawing from the Gaza Strip,\" the official said. \"Hamas showed flexibility, regarding the number of hostages to be released in order to make progress. But Israel wants the hostages back without ending the war,\" he claimed. Israel has said it is waiting for a response to its latest proposal, sent at the end of last week. It is understood to have reduced slightly the number of hostages it is demanding should be released in exchange for an extension of the truce and the entry of humanitarian aid. A group of hostages' families, known as the Tikvah Forum, said on Monday that the parents of Eitan Mor had been told by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the government was working on a deal that would see 10 hostages freed - down from 11 or 12. Donald Trump has suggested Iran could face military action if it does not agree to a new nuclear deal. Israel's defence minister also said it had taken over a \"security zone\", which separates the southern cities of Rafah and Khan Younis. Eighteen months since Omri Miran was taken hostage by Hamas, his wife Lishay still sends family updates, which she hopes he will read one day. \"No state... can be exempt from the obligation not to commit war crimes, not to commit genocide, not to commit ethnic cleansing,\" Mirjana Spoljaric tells the BBC. The mother of a Palestinian killed in an IDF attack on emergency vehicles tells the BBC of her loss.",

    "article_text": "Labour MP and former minister Tulip Siddiq has accused the Bangladeshi authorities of a \"politically motivated smear campaign\" after they issued an arrest warrant against her. The country's Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) has been investigating allegations Siddiq illegally received land as part of its wider probe of the regime of her aunt, Sheikh Hasina, who was deposed as prime minister in August. The Hampstead and Highgate MP, who quit as economic secretary to the Treasury in January, was named in the arrest warrant alongside more than 50 others over the weekend. Responding to the arrest warrant, Siddiq told reporters the Bangladeshi authorities were conducting a \"trial by media\". She said: \"My lawyers proactively wrote to the Bangladeshi authorities, they never responded. \"I'm sure you'll understand I can't dignify this politically motivated smear campaign with any context or any comments. \"It's a completely politically motivated smear campaign trying to harass me. There is no evidence that I've done anything wrong.\" Extradition allows one country to ask another to hand over a suspect to face trial, once an arrest warrant has been issued. The UK lists Bangladesh as a 2B extradition country - meaning clear evidence must be presented before ministers and judges make a decision. A spokesman for Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he would not comment on individual cases. On Sunday, Siddiq's lawyers said the ACC had made \"various allegations\" against the MP \"through the media in the last few months\". \"The allegations are completely false and have been dealt with in writing by Ms Siddiq's lawyers,\" Siddiq's lawyers Stephenson Harwood said, in a statement seen by the BBC. Bangladesh's ACC is examining allegations Hasina and her family embezzled up to £3.9bn from infrastructure spending in Bangladesh. The investigation is based on a series of allegations made by Bobby Hajjaj, a political opponent of Hasina. Court documents seen by the BBC show Hajjaj has accused Siddiq of helping to broker a deal with Russia in 2013 that overinflated the price of a new nuclear power plant in Bangladesh. ACC chairman Mohammad Abdul Momenhas previously told the BBCthe allegations \"are by no means targeted and baseless\" and its investigation was \"based on documentary evidence of corruption\". \"Tulip Siddiq must not shy away from the court proceedings in Bangladesh. \"I would welcome Siddiq come and defend her case and with the best possible legal support accompanying her,\" he added. Siddiq quit her ministerial post earlier this year, following an investigation into the allegations by the prime minister's ethics adviser, Sir Laurie Magnus. In his report, Sir Laurie said he had \"not identified evidence of improprieties\". But he added it was \"regrettable\" that Siddiq had not been more alert to the \"potential reputational risks\" of her ties to her aunt, who is leader of Awami League party in Bangladesh. The ex-Labour minister's lawyers say investigators in Bangladesh have yet to formally question her. Tulip Siddiq has resigned as anti-corruption minister, but questions remain for the Prime Minister. Reynolds - who took over from Tulip Siddiq - has faced questions about potential conflicts of interest. Emma Reynolds - who replaces Tulip Siddiq - lobbied against restrictions on Chinese businesses in a previous job. The Tory leader flagged recent market turbulence and asked whether tax rises are planned in March.",

    "title": "Ex-MP Craig Williams among 15 charged with betting offences",
    "article_text": "Fifteen people including former Conservative MP Craig Williams have been charged with betting offences by the Gambling Commission. The investigation was launched last year following bets placed on the timing of the 2024 general election. The commission said the investigation focused on individuals \"suspected of using confidential information - specifically advance knowledge of the proposed election date - to gain an unfair advantage in betting markets\". Before the election was called, Williams was the MP for Montgomeryshire and an aide to then-Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. The group of those charged includes Russell George, a Member of the Senedd, who has since been suspended from the Welsh Conservative group. Others charged include Laura Saunders, the former Conservative parliamentary candidate in Bristol North West, and her partner Anthony Lee, a former director of campaigning for the Conservatives. Responding to the charges announced on Monday, a Conservative spokesman said the party \"believes that those working in politics must act with integrity\". \"Current members of staff who have been charged are being suspended with immediate effect,\" he said. \"These incidents took place in May last year. Our party is now under new leadership and we are cooperating fully with the Gambling Commission to ensure that their investigation can conclude swiftly and transparently.\" Welsh Conservatives leader Darren Millar said the suspension of George was \"a neutral act pending the outcome of the justice process\". Bernard Gentry, chairman of the Welsh Conservatives, told BBC Wales: \"It's disappointing that these individuals have been charged. But we need to wait for the result of the court case before passing judgement.\" The other individuals charged are: Following the commission's announcement, a Met Police spokesperson said Mr Hunt was \"attached to the Royalty and Specialist Protection Command at the time of his alleged offending\". \"A further nine officers will face no further action in relation to any criminal investigation,\" a statement added. The Gambling Commission said the 15 people have been charged under section 42 of the Gambling Act and are due to appear at Westminster Magistrates Court on 13 June. Those found guilty of an offence under section 42 could face a fine or a jail term of up to two years. Labour Party chairwoman Ellie Reeves said: \"This is a very serious development. The British people will expect that anyone found guilty of wrongdoing faces the full force of the law. \"[Conservative leader] Kemi Badenoch must make crystal clear that anyone found guilty of using insider information to cheat the system to try to enrich themselves has no place in the Conservative Party. No ifs, no buts.\" On 22 May 2024, Rishi Sunak announced the general election would be held on 4 July that year - a decision that overturned expectations of an autumn poll. In early June 2024, it was reported that Williams had placed a bet on the date of the general election. Approached by the BBC at the time, Williams said he had \"clearly made a huge error of judgement that's for sure and I apologise\". He refused to comment on whether he knew about the election date when he placed the wager saying it would not be \"appropriate\" while the Gambling Commission was investigating. Following the commission's decision to launch an investigation, the Conservative Party pulled its support for Williams and Saunders. Mr Lee and Mason both took leaves of absence from their party roles after the allegations first emerged during the general election campaign. Mason, who is currently a councillor in Herefordshire, has been suspended from the Conservative group on the council and now sits as an independent.

    "title": "PSG's Doue, the teenager who is the talk of Europe",
    "article_text": "Paris St-Germain teenager Desire Doue has made a stunning impact in the Champions League and for France When Desire Doue walked off slowly and disconsolately after only 64 minutes at Arsenal in October, the teenager touted as French football's next golden boy looked alone and out of his depth. Fast forward six months - with a potential Champions League semi-final reunion a growing possibility - and Paris St-Germain's brilliant young forward has captured the imagination of Europe. For someone whose name translates to 'desire gifted' in English, the 19-year-old has shown vast quantities of both since putting that false start behind him in spectacular fashion. Doue's day of disappointment came in a2-0 loss at Emirates Stadiumin the tournament's new league table format. Since then, he has matured into a central piece in the new PSG assembled by coach Luis Enrique, performing superbly when Manchester City were beaten 4-2 at Parc des Princes in January, then delivering a brilliant cameo as a substitute before scoring the decisive penalty in the shootout win at Anfield in the last 16. And, in his most mesmerising display yet, he scored a stunning curling equaliser while running Aston Villa ragged in PSG'scaptivating 3-1 winin the quarter-final first leg. All eyes will be on Doue at Villa Park on Wednesday, one of the poster boys - along with young Georgian genius Khvicha Kvaratskhelia - for the new PSG model as they move away from the so-called 'Bling Bling' era of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and Lionel Messi to a structured team ethic. It has been a meteoric rise for Angers-born Doue, who was not even a guaranteed starter at Rennes last season before making a Â£43m move to PSG in the summer as they tried to fill Mbappe-sized holes in their attack. 'Free spirit Doue epitomises PSG - this could be their time' 'We believe in Villa Park' - can Emery's men rescue tie? Champions League quarter-finals - how it stands & route to final Doue comes from strong footballing stock, with his 22-year-old brother Guela playing right-back for Strasbourg after leaving Rennes, while cousin Yann Gboho is a talented attacking midfield player at Toulouse. He is of French-Ivorian descent, making his full France debut in the 2-0 win against Croatia in the Uefa Nations League quarter-final in March, again scoring a penalty as they went through after a shootout. Brother Guela has other international allegiances, winning international caps for Ivory Coast. The brothers developed under the watchful guidance of father Maho, who worked with them every day - organising training sessions outside the work they were doing at Rennes, and still exerts a wise and steadying influence on their careers. Some eyebrows were raised when PSG paid such a large fee for Doue in the summer, but Rennes are as good at driving a hard bargain as they are producing young gems. They have history, selling Doue's current team-mate Ousmane Dembele to Borussia Dortmund, Eduardo Camavinga to Real Madrid and Mathys Tel, now on loan at Tottenham Hotspur, to Bayern Munich. Arsenal, Chelsea, Spurs, Manchester United and Newcastle United all showed serious interest in Doue - but it came down to PSG or Bayern. French football expert Julien Laurens told BBC Sport: \"PSG probably would have liked to pay about Â£34m and tried to get it down, while Bayern were happy to pay more than Â£50m - but he wanted to go to PSG. \"It might have felt a little high, as it was when PSG paid Â£34m for Bradley Barcola after six good months as Lyon, but there is a premium, as there is in England, when you sell from French club to French club. \"The key was that Luis Enrique and sporting director Luis Campos were both convinced they were getting a superstar in the making. \"Doue is so talented, strong mentally and physically. At PSG, they say he's got rugby players' legs because the bottom half of his body is so strong. \"They knew in Paris it would take time but they were ready. Luis Enrique was so happy to sign him. He was the player he wanted. They were aware he may need half-a-season, a season, but were happy to wait if needed.\" PSG coach Luis Enrique has been praised for his careful handling of Doue Despite these new burdens, PSG insiders have been hugely delighted with Doue's dedication and professionalism. \"The club have been very impressed with his fitness work, gym work,\" said Laurens. It was the same at Rennes, former coach Bruno Genesio saying: \"Away from the pitch he's a dream: easy, calm, with a streak of leadership while still asking for advice. He's both care-free and conscientious in his work. He's already a pro in his head.\" Doue first hit the radar when France won the European Under-17 Championships in Israel in 2022, then he was on the bench for the Olympic final in Paris two years later, coming on after 77 minutes when France lost 5-3 to Spain after extra time. The Olympics arguably contributed to his slow start at PSG, lacking a proper pre-season, but he has been the beneficiary of careful management by Luis Enrique - who has worked individually with Doue, encouraging him through his quiet start. He has only made five starts in the Champions League this season, with seven appearances as a substitute, scoring three goals and adding two assists. It was at Anfield where he made his mark, coming on after 67 minutes to deliver a performance of remarkable maturity, capping it by being entrusted with the spot-kick that sent PSG through. Doue has been kept out of the limelight by PSG, while the calming, grounded influence of his family is a huge factor. Laurens explained: \"The dad, Maho, is very influential in everything they do. Some families think their son is the next Cristiano Ronaldo, oblivious to everything going on on the pitch, but they were realistic. \"After the Arsenal game, where he did look out of his depth, they said he wasn't ready for the big step up another level. They understood he had to work a lot, he had to mature. They were very realistic about what he had to do. It was very impressive, very refreshing. They understood.\" Doue has also had to adjust to life in the Paris goldfish bowl, away from quieter Rennes. He lives in the fashionable Boulogne-Billancourt area and Pierre-Etienne Minonzio, based in Paris with influential sports paper L'Equipe, told BBC Sport: \"Recently he was in a very popular shop. He was there just looking for a book when somebody spotted him. \"It was totally normal because he is so young, but maybe he did not understand it is going to be hard for him to be in crowded places in Paris. \"It is good that he thought he was not a star, but he probably hasn't been back. He's very into performance, wanting to be the best. If you tell him one of the next steps in his evolution is not to be seen so much in public, he will understand no problem.\" France coach Didier Deschamps was at Parc des Princes to watch Doue's brilliant performance against Aston Villa It took until December for Doue to score his first PSG goal, in the 3-0 win away to Red Bull Salzburg in the Champions League, but since then it has been lift-off. \"He was born in 2005 and in France's football world, everybody said the big thing in France born in 2005 was Mathys Tel, now at Spurs,\" Minonzio said. \"For his generation Doue was not the one because he was less talented than Tel, but when you get older the psychological attributes make a lot of difference and Doue has shown incredible mental strength. \"Everybody thought for this generation of players Tel would be the main guy, but now the talk is Doue.\" And to crown his development, Doue was called up by France coach Didier Deschamps, overtaking two other players regarded as potential members of the new generation, Lyon forward Rayan Cherki and Maghnes Akliouche from Monaco. Laurens said: \"It all changed from a wider perspective after his debut for France. He was outstanding against Croatia. He was not scared, demanded the ball, scored a penalty. This guy had arrived.\" In France, the general view is that Doue's form left Deschamps with no option. Minonzio says: \"Deschamps is obsessed with the Champions League. He wants his players to show him their ability in high-level games. He is always a little hesitant to take players who are very good in French league games but don't play in Champions League. \"It was obvious in March that Deschamps had no choice other than to select him.\" Villa Park is the next step on his development. And while the sky seems the limit, there is still caution. \"A few months ago I would have told you the face of the new PSG would be Warren Zaire-Emery. Just 19, Parisian, lots of talent.\" says Minonzio. \"Everything he did was so impressive but you always have to wait to see how they react when there are problems. \"This is the fascination with Doue in France. We still don't know how good he will be but at the moment he is free, does not ask any questions and life is good. He has been incredible.\" Listen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

Newcastlesaid on Saturday he would be absentfor their Premier League match against Manchester United at St James' Park on Sunday. TheMagpies won the match 4-1and assistant manager Jason Tindall said Howe had watched the game from his hospital bed. \"A huge thank you to everyone connected with Newcastle United and the wider football community for your messages and warm wishes. They have meant a lot to me and my family,\" Howe said in a statement issued by the club. \"I also want to pay tribute to our incredible NHS and the hospital staff who have treated me. \"I'm immensely grateful for the specialist care I'm receiving and, after a period of recovery, I look forward to being back as soon as possible.\" Tindall and fellow coach Graeme Jones will lead Newcastle for their Premier League matches against Crystal Palace and Aston Villa on 16 and 19 April respectively.

Newcastle have finished 11th, fourth and seventh in the past three seasons. Howe has taken charge of 165 matches in all competitions for Newcastle, winning 84, drawing 36 and losing 45 of them. Under Howe, the Magpies memorably beat Paris St-Germain in the Champions League group stage in the 2023-24 campaign but failed to make it to the knockout stage. He previously had two spells in charge of Bournemouth either side of a brief stint at Burnley, and has been talked of as a future England manager. However, he said he was not interviewed by the Football Association to replace Gareth Southgate, with Thomas Tuchel appointed Three Lions boss last October.

    "title": "Marko has 'great concern' over Verstappen future",
    "article_text": "Verstappen has been at Red Bull since 2016 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix Venue:JeddahDates:18-20 AprilRace start:18:00 BST on Sunday Coverage:Live radio commentary of practice, qualifying and race online and BBC 5 Sports Extra; live text updates on the BBC Sport website and app Red Bull motorsport adviser Helmut Marko says he has \"great concern\" about Max Verstappen's future with the team in the context of their current struggles. The four-time champion finished sixthin the Bahrain Grand Prixon Sunday, while Oscar Piastri scored McLaren's third win in four races so far this year. Dutchman Verstappen is third in the drivers' championship, eight points behind leader Lando Norris of McLaren. Marko told Sky Germany: \"The concern is great. Improvements have to come in the near future so that he has a car with which he can win again. \"We have to create a basis with a car so that he can fight for the world championship.\" Verstappen has a contract with Red Bull until 2028. But Marko told BBC Sport this month thatit contains a performance clausethat could allow him to leave the team. The wording of this clause is not known publicly but it effectively says that Red Bull have to provide Verstappen with a winning car. Verstappen won the Japanese Grand Prix a week before Bahrain but that victory was founded on a pole position lap that many F1 observers regarded asone of the greatest of all time. Because overtaking was next to impossible at Suzuka, Verstappen was able to hold back the McLarens of Norris and Piastri and take his first win of the year. Verstappen has qualified third, fourth and seventh for the other three races in Australia, China and Bahrain. The Red Bull is on average over all qualifying sessions this year the second fastest car but 0.214 seconds a lap slower than the McLaren. Verstappen has complained all year about balance problems with the Red Bull, which is unpredictable on corner entry and has mid-corner understeer. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner admitted after the race in Bahrain that the car's balance problems were fundamentally similar to the ones that made the second half of last year a struggle for Verstappen. He won just twice in the final 13 races of last season, but managed to win his fourth world title because of the huge lead he built up when Red Bull were in dominant form in the first five races of the season. Horner also said the team were having difficulties with correlation between their wind tunnel and on-track performance. Essentially, the car performs differently on track than the team's simulation tools say it should. Verstappen has won 64 grands prix across 11 seasons Verstappen had a difficult race in Bahrain including delays at both pit stops, one with the pit-lane traffic light system and one with fitting a front wheel. At one stage he was running last, and he managed to snatch sixth place from Alpine's Pierre Gasly only on the last lap. Verstappen said that the hot weather and rough track surface had accentuated Red Bull's problems. He said: \"Here you just get punished a bit harder when you have big balance issues because the Tarmac is so aggressive. \"The wind is also quite high and the track has quite low grip, so everything is highlighted more. \"Just the whole weekend struggling a bit with brake feeling and stopping power, and besides that also very poor grip. We tried a lot on the set-up and basically all of it didn't work, didn't give us a clear direction to work in.\" Verstappen has said this year that he is \"relaxed\" about his future. Any decision about moving teams for 2026 is complicated by the fact that F1 is introducing new chassis and engine rules that amount to the biggest regulation change in the sport's history, and it is impossible to know which team will be in the best shape. But it is widely accepted in the paddock that Mercedes are looking the best in terms of engine performance for 2026. Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff has made no secret of his desire to sign Verstappen. The two parties had talks last season but have yet to have any discussions this season about the future.

    "article_text": "Jackson Page turned professional in 2019 Jackson Page has become the first player to make a maximum 147 break twice in one match. Page's achievement also secured him the Â£147,000 Triple Crown bonus. The 23-year-old Welshmanhad made his first 147 on Sunday,during the eighth frame of his third-round World Snooker Championship qualifying match against England's Allan Taylor. Resuming the match on Monday, leading 8-1 and needing only two frames to complete victory, Page racked up another maximum to clinch a 10-2 win. \"I'm over the moon,\" Page told BBC 5 Live Drive. \"It's a bizarre sort of feeling really.\" \"I knew the bonus was up for grabs [for the second 147], so I went for it from the first ball and managed to make it happen. \"I felt the same way as I did winning matches and in the deep end of tournaments, the same sort of pressure. As soon as the 15th black went in and I was on the yellow, I knew it was going to happen.\" The world number 35, who turned professional in 2019, had never previously made a single maximum break in his career. Monday's win has earned him a place in the final round of qualifiers. Page reached the tournament proper for the first time in 2022 and caused an upset by beating former finallist Barry Hawkins 10-7 in round one. He also qualified for the final tournament last year, but was well beaten 10-1 in the opening round by Ronnie O'Sullivan. Page told 5 Live that the money would help as he has a three-month-old son and has recently bought a house. But he said there would not be too much celebration, with a steak dinner on Monday night before practice on Tuesday. Page will meet England's world number 30 Joe O'Connor in the final qualifying round for a place in round one at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield. While Page progressed, there were upsets elsewhere in qualifying as 2015 winner Stuart Bingham and former UK champion Stephen Maguire both lost.",

    "article_text": "Unai Emery has been in charge of Aston Villa since October 2022 Aston Villa boss Unai Emery says his players should view the second leg of their Champions League showdown with Paris St-Germain as a chance to write themselves into the club's history books. Villa, who won the European Cup in 1982,suffered a 3-1 defeat away to the Ligue 1 championslast week in the first leg of their quarter-final tie. Emery acknowledged his side will have to \"manage\" the match at Villa Park on Tuesday \"emotionally and tactically\". But the Spaniard also said his players have to \"believe\" they can overturn a two-goal deficit and progress to the semi-finals. \"I have experiences coming back, results positively and negatively, in two ways. But now is something different,\" Emery said. \"We want to write here the history with Aston Villa. Last year, in Conference League[when they lost in the last four],and this year in Champions League, and hopefully for a long time in Europe.\" Emery, 53, has only lost one of his 13 home matches in major European competitions as Villa boss, winning 11 of those. Villa are also on a 17-match unbeaten run on home turf in all competitions stretching back to November 2024. Emery is hoping to pair Marcus Rashford and Ollie Watkins in attack in the future, but said the game against PSG might not be the right time to deploy them together. Rashford and Watkins have played in seven games together with the most time the pair have spent on the pitch with each other the 82 minutes during Villa's 2-0 win over Cardiff City in the fifth round of the FA Cup. \"The next step - if I have time - is to play them together,\" Emery added. \"We did with Rashford playing left side but now we are choosing more with both playing as strikers. That's the next step. I want to practise, I want to test but not now, with enough time.\" Villa attacking midfielder Morgan Rogers said the club's fans have a vital role to play in generating an atmosphere to inspire the club to the semi-finals of Europe's elite competition for the first time in over four decades. When asked how important the home support at Villa Park will be, Morgan said: \"Massive. Two-legged ties, that's the whole purpose of it. \"You get your advantage at home, especially in the position we're in, the second leg being at home. I think that's massive for us. \"We can create a real atmosphere, we've done it this season in the big games, not just Champions League but in the big league games as well.\" Emery added: \"If we are connecting with our supporters, if we are transmitting positive energy, if we are playing more or less getting tactically and individually good things on the field, the supporters, they are going to help us a lot with their energy. \"They are going to transmit to us their energy, and always for our players playing at home, with the energy they can receive from our supporters, it's something adding positively.

    "title": "Leaked UN experts report raises fresh concerns over UAE’s role in Sudan war",
    "article_text": "Pressure is mounting on the United Arab Emirates over its presence at acrucial conferencein London aimed at stopping the war in Sudan after a leaked confidential UN report raised fresh questions over the UAE’s role in the devastating conflict. The UAE has been accused ofsecretly supplying weaponsto Sudanese paramilitaries via neighbouring Chad, a charge it has steadfastly denied. However an internal report – marked highly confidential and seen by the Guardian – detected “multiple” flights from the UAE in which transport planes made apparently deliberate attempts to avoid detection as they flew into bases in Chad where arms smuggling across the border intoSudanhas been monitored. The allegations raise complications for the British foreign secretary, David Lammy, who controversially invited the UAE alongside 19 other states forSudan peace talks at Lancaster Houseon 15 April. The date marks the second anniversary of a civil war that has caused theworld’s biggest humanitarian crisis, displacingmore than 12 million people. A senior diplomat, who is familiar with the leaked report but requested anonymity, said: “The UK needs to explain how it is responding tomassacres of childrenand aid workers while hosting the UAE at its London conference.” The 14-page report – completed last November and sent to the Sudan sanctions committee of the UN Security Council – was written by a panel of five UN experts who “documented a consistent pattern of Ilyushin Il-76TD cargo flights originating from the United Arab Emirates” into Chad, from where they identified at least three overland routes potentially used for transporting weapons into neighbouring Sudan. They found that the cargo flights from airports in the UAE to Chad were so regular that, in effect, they had created a “new regional air bridge”. They noted that flights demonstrated peculiarities, with planes often disappearing for “crucial segments” of their journey, a pattern that the experts said “raised questions of possible covert operations”. However, the experts added that they could not identify what the planes were carrying or locate any evidence that the planes were transporting weapons. The findings of numerous cargo flights from the UAE to Chad are not mentioned in the final report of the UN expert panel on Sudan, due to be published in a few days. No reference is made to the Emirates in the expert’s final 39-page report except in relation to peace talks. Questions over the UAE’s alleged role in backing the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) arrive after a weekend that saw its fighterskill more than 200 civiliansin a wave of violence against vulnerable ethnic groups in displacement camps and around the city ofEl Fasher, the last major city still held by the Sudanese army in Darfur, the vast western region of Sudan. “It will be shameful if the conference does not deliver concrete civilian protection in the context of ongoing genocide,” said the diplomat. In January the US formally declared that theRSF had committed genocidein Sudan. The UAE states that it is committed to bringing “lasting peace“ to Sudan. In their November update, the UN experts, investigating the possible smuggling of weapons from Chad into Darfur in possible violation of an arms embargo, identified at least 24 Ilyushin Il-76TD cargo flights landed at Amdjarass airport in Chad last year. The flights, they noted, coincided with an escalation of fighting in El Fasher, in particular a “surge in drone activity primarily by the RSF for combat and intelligence” whose arrival in Sudan, said the experts, marked “a new technological phase in the conduct of hostilities”. Some of the flights identified in the report were linked to operators previously connected to “military logistics and illicit arms transfers”. Two of them, said the experts, had previously been flagged for violations of the arms embargo. Experts also examined “regular departures” into Chad from two UAE airports – in Ras Al-Khaimah emirate and Al Ain in Abu Dhabi emirate – and found that the flights frequently disappeared from radars during crucial moments. On one occasion, the report describes how a flight “left Ras Al-Khaimah, vanished mid-flight, and later surfaced in N’Djamena [capital of Chad] before returning to Abu Dhabi”. Crucially, however, the UN experts said they could not prove that the planes were carrying weapons because the “flights lacked evidence regarding the specific content being transported”. Four of the five UN experts said that although the flights “marked an important new trend”, what they managed to uncover “failed to meet evidentiary standards regarding evidence of arms transfers”. For instance, although residents of the South Darfur city of Nyala reported “cargo plane activity and informants attributed it to RSF logistical operations, further triangulated evidence to confirm the nature of the cargo transported was absent”. Therefore, the experts said, it was “premature to infer that these flights were part of an arms transfer network”. They also added that the fact that several of the flights and cargo operators were linked to military logistics and past arms violations “did not provide proof of current arms transfers”. It added: “Additionally, patterns and anomalies in flight paths, such as mid-flight radar disappearances and unrecorded take-offs, raised concerns but did not offer verified evidence directly linking these flights to arms shipments.” It said “closing these investigative gaps was crucial”. The revelations come days after the international court of justice (ICJ) in The Hague heard a case brought by Sudanaccusing the UAE of being “complicit in the genocide”during the war. The ICJ has heard claims that the RSF is responsible for serious human rights violations including mass killings, rape and forced displacement in West Darfur. The UAE has said the case is a cynical publicity stunt and a “platform to launch false attacks against the UAE”. A UAE source pointed out that the confidential UN expert report contained the disclaimer that four of the five panel members felt that “allegations of an airbridge from the UAE to Sudan via Chad failed to meet the evidentiary standards required to establish a clear link between the documented flights and the alleged transfer of arms”. A UAE statement added that the imminent final report from the Sudan expert panel did not reference the Emirates in relation to any flights “because the allegations against us failed to meet the panel’s evidentiary threshold. The record speaks for itself.” It added that they had been told by the UN security council’s Sudan sanctions committee that the final report “did not make any negative findings” against them. “The latest UN panel of experts report makes clear that there is not substantiated evidence that the UAE has provided any support to RSF, or has any involvement in the conflict,” said the statement.",

    "title": "Sudan’s news blackout stokes fear and confusion after refugee camp attacks",
    "article_text": "Sudan’s information blackout has left relatives of those in Sudan’s Zamzam refugee camp struggling for news of their safety after it was overrun by militiamen at the weekend. As leaders across the globe prepared to meet forpeace talks in Londonto pressure the backers of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and the Sudanese army to agree a ceasefire, the RSF launched a deadly assault, seizing Zamzam after weeks of tightening its siege. The UN’s migration agency, the IOM, said between 60,000 and 80,000 households had been displaced from Zamzam following the attacks. The medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières said its team at Tawila, another displacement camp near El Fasher inDarfur, had seen about 10,000 people arrive in 48 hours suffering from dehydration and exhaustion. Campaigners said the dearth of information on the violence, which hasreportedly killed hundreds of civilians,highlighted the need for the London talks to prioritise restoring communications to allow communities under attack to warn each other, to give better access to healthcare and to facilitate human rights documentation. Altahir Hashim, whose family was living in Zamzam, said: “Zamzam as an IDP [internally displaced persons] camp no longer exists. The RSF has completely overrun the camp – killing, raping, burning and committing all kinds of atrocities. The communications are really bad and I haven’t been able to speak to my family.” On Friday,nine medical workersfrom the aid organisation Relief International were killed when the RSF raided Zamzam, while the Sudanese American Physicians Association (Sapa), said the manager of a children’s health centrewas also killed. For two decades Zamzam has hosted people displaced during the 2000s in attacks by the army and the Janjaweed militias – who were later formalised into the RSF – but its population has grown to about 700,000 during the current civil war as people have fled other parts of the Darfur region. Hashim is part of a group of Darfuris abroad who have raised funds to buy and airdrop satellite phones into Darfur as well as walkie-talkies to allow local communication during emergencies. He said the communications blackout also made it difficult for people to receive money sent from relatives abroad through mobile banking systems. The limited information that has emerged from Zamzam has often relied on satellite communications – whether through imagery, phones or the Starlink service, which uses satellites rather than land-based communication towers to provide internet. But these services can be unreliable and are costly, meaning that while they are used by some activists in Darfur, others remain unable to be contacted. One video shared by the group North Darfur Observatory for Human Rights showed people fleeing Zamzam with theirbelongings strapped to camels and donkeys. Often the main source of information from Darfur has come from videosrecorded by RSF fighters themselvesof the atrocities and some have emerged showing their fightersentering Zamzam on pickup trucks mounted with heavy machine gunswith burning buildings in the background. Shayna Lewis, from the US-based organisationPreventing & Ending Mass Atrocities(Paema).“We have reports of civilians being hunted and executed in the streets of Zamzam, but we are unable to consistently communicate with people as the networks are off and the internet can only be accessed through Starlink access points. Starlink access is sporadic, expensive and can be turned off by the belligerents at will.” Paema said the talks in London should prioritise restoring communications as a way to quickly relieve suffering in Sudan. Sapa, which operates medical facilities in El Fasher, said the last message it received from its teams in Zamzam on Sunday afternoon was: “Zamzam under the control of the RSF.” Khalid Mishain, of the Sudanese human rights group Youth Citizens Observers Network, said they had lost contact with their observers in the area since the attack. He said the communications blackout had been a impediment to human rights documentation throughout the conflict. “People have to write the information down, keep it with them and then secretly move to areas where there is communications and send it to us,” said Mishain. “We have civilians suffering and no one knows about it, and those who report on it have to risk their life because of the communications blackout.”",

    "article_text": "France is considering its response afterAlgeriaordered the expulsion of 12 embassy staff over the arrest of an Algerian consulate official in Paris over alleged involvement in the kidnap of a TikTok influencer. Algiers has given the French representatives 48 hours to leave the country in a move that has stretched already strained relations between the two countries to breaking point. The French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, has warned that if the expulsions go ahead Paris would be forced to respond immediately. The influencer, Amir Boukhors, 41, is acritic of the Algerian president, Abdelmadjid Tebboune, and has more than a million subscribers on TikTok where he posts as Amir DZ. He has lived in France since 2016 and was granted political asylum in 2023. Algeria has issued nine international arrest warrants against him on accusations of fraud and terrorism but France refuses to extradite him. In April 2024, Boukhors was snatched outside his home in the Val-de-Marne, south of Paris, tellingFrance2 television in a later interview that he was handcuffed and bundled into a car by four men wearing police armbands. He claimed he was drugged and held in a “container” for more than 24 hours before being released at 3am. “I fell into a trap,” he said. Three men were arrested and put under investigation on Friday for the “kidnap, holding and arbitrary detention” of Boukhors. France’s national anti-terrorist prosecutor confirmed that one of the men arrested works for the Algerian consulate at Créteil, south-east of Paris. Algeria’s ordering of the expulsion of French embassy staff came a week after Barrot concluded an official visit to Algeria where he met Tebboune. “I ask the Algerian authorities to stop these expulsion measures that have no link to an ongoing legal case,” he said on Monday. “If the decision to expel our staff is maintained we will have no other choice than to respond immediately.” AFP reported that among the embassy staff ordered to leave the country were a number of members attached to France’s interior ministry whose minister, Bruno Retailleau, has taken a hard line against the former French colony. Bilateral relations between Paris and Algiers have been tense since last July when France supported a Moroccan plan to grant autonomy to the western Sahara against Algerian-backed insurgents who want full independence for the disputed territory. Paris has accused Algeria of refusing to take back its nationals ordered to leave France and considered a security threat. In retaliation, France has threatened to slash the number of visas given to Algerians. Emmanuel Macron has also called on Algeria to release writerBoualem Sansal, 75, sentenced to five years in prison for “undermining the integrity” of the country. Sign up toThis is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion Algeria has denied the official’s involvement in Boukhors’ kidnapping and after his arrest summoned France’s ambassador, Stéphane Romatet, to express its displeasure at the consular official being arrested “in the public street … without any notification via diplomatic channels”. The Algerian foreign ministry said in a statement: “This new development is unacceptable and unspeakable and will cause great damage to Algerian-French relations.” It warned Algeria would not “let this situation go without consequences”.",

In a report published on Monday, Unctad identifies 28 nations the US president singled out for a higher tariff rate than the 10% baseline – despite each accounting for less than 0.1% of the US trade deficit. These include Laos, which is expected to face a 48% tariff;Mauritius, on 40%; and Myanmar, to be hit with 45%, despite trying to recover from a devastating earthquake. The White House shocked many developing countries with the punitive tariff rates announced this month. Trump claimed rival economies had “looted, pillaged, raped, plundered” the US with unfair trade practices, and he wanted to create a level playing field. Unctad said many of the countries targeted with high tariff rates were unlikely to be a threat to the world’s largest economy, given their small size and modest levels of exports. The White House last week put the higher tariff rateson pause for 90 days, after unleashing chaos on world financial markets, leaving a 10% levy in place across the board. But the administration’s formal position remains that the “reciprocal” tariff rates will come into force, subject to negotiations. “The current 90-day pause presents an opportunity to reassess how small and vulnerable economies – including the least developed countries – are treated,” Unctad said. “This is a critical moment to consider exempting them from tariffs that offer little to no advantage for US trade policy but risk causing serious economic harm.” Unctad’s analysis said many of these economies were so small that they were likely to generate little demand for US exports, even if they lowered tariffs, as the White House appears to be demanding. Malawi, facing 18% tariffs, bought just $27m of US exports last year; Mozambique, which faces 16% tariffs, $150m; Cambodia, set for 49% tariffs, $322m. Unctad’s experts added that 36 of these small and poor countries were likely to generate less than 1% of total US tariff revenue, even if the US did not cut imports from them as the tariffs took effect. Part of the logic of the tariff policy is meant to be to bring manufacturing jobs back to the US. But for several tiny countries, their key exports are agricultural commodities, for which the US is unlikely to be able to find substitutes elsewhere – let alone develop a domestic industry. Sign up toBusiness Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion Unctad highlighted the $150m in vanilla imported from Madagascar, close to $800m in cocoa from Ivory Coast and $200m in cocoa from Ghana. With Madagascar set to face 47% tariffs, for example, the report said the main impact on the US was likely to be higher prices for consumers. Some of the countries hit by the 10% tariffs – and due to face higher rates when the pause is over – were previously beneficiaries of a US policy called the African Growth and Opportunity Act. The scheme had been in place since 2000 and gave sub-Saharan African countries tariff-free access to US markets in order to encourage economic development. As many as 32 countries were eligible, before Trump’s announcement appeared to tear up the scheme. Financial markets and manufacturers in developing countries are continuing to wrestle with the changeable nature of US trade policy. Trump sowed fresh confusion over the weekend byappearing to revisit an announcement made on Friday, that some hi-tech goods, including laptops, would be exempt from tariffs. In a post on his social media site Truth Social on Sunday, the president said no one was getting “off the hook”, and the administration would be investigating the “whole electronics supply chain”.",

    "title": "Trump officials step up defiance over man wrongly deported to El Salvador",
    "article_text": "TheTrump administrationon Monday misrepresented a US supreme court decision that compelled it to return a man wrongly deported to El Salvador, using tortured readings of the order to justify taking no actions to secure his release. The supreme court last weekunanimously ordered the administrationto “facilitate” the release of Kilmar Abrego García, who was supposed to have been protected from deportation to El Salvador regardless of whether he was a member of the MS-13 gang. But at an Oval Office meeting between Trump and El Salvador’s president Nayib Bukele, Trump deferred to officials who gave extraordinary readings of the supreme court order and claimed the US was powerless to return Abrego García to US soil. “The ruling solely stated that if this individual at El Salvador’s sole discretion was sent back to our country, we could deport him a second time,” said Trump’s policy chief Stephen Miller, about an order that, in fact, upheld a lower court’s directive to return Abrego García. Miller’s remarks went beyond the tortured reading offered by the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, who also characterized the supreme court order as only requiring the administration to provide transportation to Abrego García if released by El Salvador. “That’s up to El Salvador if they want to return him. That’s up to them,” Bondi said. “The supreme court ruled that if El Salvador wants to return him, we would ‘facilitate’ it, meaning provide a plane.” The remarks at the Oval Office meeting marked an escalation in the Trump administration’s attempts to claim uncertainty with court orders to avoid having to take actions it dislikes. In Abrego García’s case, officials appeared to manufacture uncertainty in particularly blatant fashion. And the fact that the US is paying El Salvador to detain deportees it sends to the notorious Cecot prison undercut the notion that the administration lacked the power to return Abrego García into US custody. The case started when Abrego García was detained by police in 2019 in Maryland, outside a Home Depot, with several other men, and asked about a murder. He denied knowledge of a crime and repeatedly denied that he was part of a gang. Abrego García was subsequently put in immigration proceedings, where officials argued they believed he was part of the MS-13 gang in New York based on his Chicago Bulls gear and on the word of a confidential informant. The case went before aUS immigrationjudge, who suggested that Abrego García could be a member of MS-13 and agreed to a deportation order but shielded him from being sent to El Salvador because he was likely to face persecution there by a local gang. The Trump administration did not appeal against that decision, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement has since said in a court filing that Abrego García’sdeportation to El Salvador was an “administrative error”. The supreme court also called his removal illegal. In earlier remarks to reporters on Monday morning, Miller expressly demonstrated he knew the administration had made a mistake because the immigration judge had issued a so-called withholding order, which meant he could not be deported to El Salvador. “When you have a withholding order, to be clear, that is not ‘pause your deportation’. In other words, in the worst-case scenario, it means you get deported to another country,” Miller said. That concession evaporated hours later when he joined Trump, Bukele and a dozen senior officials in the Oval Office and suggested that bringing back Abrego García to the US would be tantamount to kidnapping a citizen of El Salvador. Miller appeared to be suggesting that the US could not force the actions of El Salvador, a sovereign nation. But he then said the supreme court said neither the president nor the secretary of state could forcibly retrieve a citizen of El Salvador from El Salvador - which the order did not say.",

    "title": "The Trump administration trapped a wrongly deported man in a catch-22",
    "article_text": "It is difficult to find a term more fitting for the fate of theMarylandfather Kilmar Abrego García than Kafkaesque. Abrego García is one of hundreds of foreign-born men deported under theTrump administrationto the Cecot mega-prison in El Salvador as part of a macabre partnership with the self-declared “world’s coolest dictator”, Nayib Bukele. The US government hasadmitted it deported Abrego García by mistake. But instead of “facilitating” his return as ordered by the supreme court, the administration has trapped Abrego García in a catch-22 by offshoring his fate to a jurisdiction beyond the reach of legality – or, it would seem, basic logic or common decency. The paradox is this: the Trump administration says it cannot facilitate the return of Abrego García because he is in a prison in El Salvador. El Salvador says it cannot return him because that would betantamount to “smuggling” him into the US. The absurdity of the position played out on Monday during an Oval Office meeting between Donald Trump and Bukele where the two men appeared to enjoy mocking the powerlessness of the US courts to intervene in the fate of anyone caught in the maws of the Trump administration’s deportation machine. “How can I smuggle a terrorist into the United States? I’m not going to do it,” Bukele said when asked about whether he would help to return Abrego García. There is no evidence that Abrego García is a terrorist or a member of the gang MS-13 as the Trump administration has claimed. But that is not really important here. “I don’t have the power to return him to the United States,” Bukele said during a meeting with the US president on Monday. “They’d love to have a criminal released into our country,” Trump added. Trump’s lieutenants also jumped in on Monday, arguing that they could not intervene in the case because Bukele is a foreign citizen and outside of their control. Sign up toFirst Thing Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion “He is a citizen ofEl Salvador,” said Stephen Miller, a top Trump aide who regularly advises the president on immigration issues. “It’s very arrogant even for American media to suggest that we would even tell El Salvador how to handle their own citizens.” A district court injunction to halt the deportation was in effect, he added, an order to “kidnap a citizen of El Salvador and fly him back here”. Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, repeated one of the Trump administration’s mantras: that US courts cannot determine Trump’s foreign policy. Increasingly, the administration is including questions of immigration in that foreign policy in order to defy the courts. Monday’s presentation was in effect a pantomime. Both sides could quickly intervene if they wanted to. But this was a means to an end. Miller said this case would not end with Abrego García living in the US. More broadly, it indicates the Trump administration’s modus operandi: to move quickly before the courts can react to its transgressions and, when they do, to deflect and defy until the damage done cannot be reversed.",

    "title": "El Salvador president refuses to order return of wrongly deported US man",
    "article_text": "The president of El Salvador said in a meeting withDonald Trumpin the White House on Monday that he would not order the return of a Maryland man who was deported in error to a Salvadorian mega-prison. “The question is preposterous,” Nayib Bukele said in the Oval Office on Monday, where he was welcomed by Trump and spoke with the president and members of his cabinet. “How can I smuggle a terrorist into the United States? I’m not going to do it.” He added: “I don’t have the power to return him to the United States,” and said he would not release the man, Kilmar Abrego García, intoEl Salvadoreither. “I’m not very fond of releasing terrorists into the country.” The comments came a day after theTrump administrationclaimed it was not legally obligated to secure the return of Abrego García, despite the US supreme court ruling that the administration should “facilitate” bringing him back. Lawyers for the justice department argued in courtfilings onSunday that asking El Salvador to returnAbrego García from a notorious mega-prison should be considered “foreign relations”, and was therefore outside the scope of the courts. The filing said “the federal courts have no authority to direct the Executive Branch to conduct foreign relations in a particular way, or engage with a foreign sovereign in a given manner,” adding: “That is the exclusive power of the president as the sole organ of the federal government in the field of international relations.” Earlier this month, the Trump administrationacknowledgedthat Abrego García, an immigrant from El Salvador who was living in Maryland with protected status, was deported to a prison in El Salvador on 15 March as a result of an “administrative error”. In 2019 an immigration judge had prohibited the federal government from deporting him. When he was deported anyway, swept up in Trump’s effort to send hundreds of supposed gang members to El Salvador without due process, Abrego García’s wife and relatives filed a lawsuit against theTrump administration. On 4 April a district judge, Paula Xinis,directed the administration to “facilitate and effectuate”his return. The supreme courtupheldthe directive on Thursday, and also instructed Xinis to clarify the order “with due regard for the deference owed to the executive branch in the conduct of foreign affairs”. On Friday, Xinissaid in a hearing that it was“extremely troubling” that theadministrationhad failed to comply with a court order to provide details about Abrego García’s whereabouts and status. She ordered that itprovide daily updateson efforts to facilitate his return. On Saturday,the Trump administration confirmed Abrego Garcíawas alive and confined in El Salvador’s mega-prison, Cecot. Then, on Sunday, the justice department said it interpreted the court’s order to “facilitate” Albrego García’s return as only requiring them to “remove any domestic obstacles that would otherwise impede the alien’s ability to return here”. It added: “No other reading of ‘facilitate’ is tenable – or constitutional – here.” In aseparate court filingon Sunday, an official from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) said that the 2019 order preventing Abrego García’s removal to El Salvador was no longer valid, as a result of the administration’s allegation that he was a member of the MS-13 gang, “which is now a designated foreign terrorist organization”, the court filing states. On Monday, during the Oval Office meeting between Trump and Bukele, Stephen Miller, White House homeland security adviser, repeated the claim that the 2019 order was no longer valid when Abrego García was deported, and said that bringing him back to the US would be “to kidnap a citizen of El Salvador and fly him back here”. The attorney general, Pam Bondi, echoed that it was up to El Salvador “whether they want to return him”, not the US. Bondi also claimed the supreme court ruling meant that “if El Salvador wants to return him, we would ‘facilitate’ it, meaning provide a plane”. But Miller also said: “No version of this ends with him living here.”",

    "title": "Liberal staffers plant ‘stop the steal’ pins at Canadian conservative conference",
    "article_text": "Campaigners withCanada’s Liberal party had some very American-esque politicking over the weekend, when Liberal operatives were found to have planted “stop the steal” buttons at a conservative conference to link the Conservative party toDonald Trump. Two Liberal party staffers infiltrated last week’sCanadaStrong and Free Network Conference (CSFN) in Ottawa at which they strategically placed provocative buttons designed to create the false impression that Conservative supporters of party leader Pierre Poilievrewere embracing Trump-style rhetoric, highlighting internal party divisions. The operation was exposed when a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)politics reporter overheard staffersboasting about their actions at an Ottawa pub, where they were drinking with other Liberal war room colleagues on Friday night. One button featured the phrase “stop the steal” – directly echoing Trump’s baseless claims about the 2020 election results being stolen from him. Another displayed the name of Conservative national campaign director, Jenni Byrne, crossed out, with “Kory Teneycke” written underneath – referring to a leading Conservative strategist who has been publicly bashing Poilievre. The CSFN conference, Canada’s less idealistic version of the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), serves as a key gathering for conservative-minded Canadians to discuss policy proposals and network. The incident comes in the final stretch of a heated campaign only weeks away from elections, in which the Liberals who hold a polling lead have consistently sought to characterize Poilievre as Canada’s version of Trump. Poilievre’s confrontational style with mainstream media, his “Canada First” campaign slogan, and his frequent attacks on the CBC specifically as “government-funded media” have fueled these comparisons, despite his insistence on fundamental differences between himself and the US president. Just this Sunday on Radio-Canada’s popular talkshow Tout le monde en parle, whenasked if he wasa “mini-Trump, medium Trump or large Trump”, Poilievre quipped about his lighter weight before emphasizing his “completely different story” as the child of middle-class teachers compared with the US president’s inherited wealth. The Liberal party confirmed the incident on Sunday evening, saying some campaigners had “regrettably got carried away” with buttons “poking fun” at reported Conservative infighting. A party spokesperson, Kevin Lemkay, added that the Liberal leader, Mark Carney, had made it clear “this does not fit his commitment to serious and positive discourse”. Over the years, Poilievre has proudly associated himself as a culture warrior for Canada’s right, saying he wants thecountry to move away from“woke” to “warrior” and appearing on rightwing media like the Canadian influencer Jordan Peterson’s show. The Liberal party has been able to take advantage of linking Poilievre to Trump after near country-wide disappointment and disapproval that followed the US president’s targeting of Canada as the supposed “51st state” and choosing to include its previously friendly neighbor in mass tariffs. As a result, there has been anear-total plungein Canadian tourism to the United States, and the Liberalshold a tight leadin the polls under new leader Carney. “Despite their public claims, it’s clear that it’s the Liberals who are attempting to bring American-style politics to our country,” the Conservative party spokesperson, Sam Lilly, said in a statement to CBC.",

    "title": "Ecuador’s President Noboa re-elected in vote seen as test of his ‘war on drugs’",
    "article_text": "In an election seen as a referendum on his “war on drugs”,Ecuador’s rightwing president, Daniel Noboa, won Sunday’s presidential runoff, defeating the leftist candidate Luisa González. With 97% of ballots counted, the incumbent had secured 55.65% of the vote, compared with 44.35% for the former congresswoman. The National Electoral Council (CNE) stated that the margin “marks an irreversible trend”,in effect recognising Noboa’s victory. In a speech shortly after the announcement, Noboa, called it a “historic victory”. “A victory by more than 10 points, a victory by over a million votes, leaving no doubt about who the winner is,” he told his supporters. Donald Trumpcongratulated Noboa on his Truth Social platform, calling him a “great leader” and saying “he will not let you down!” González, meanwhile,said she would not accept the results, which she called “grotesque” fraud. “We will request a recount and for the ballot boxes to be opened,” she told her supporters, while the crowd shouted “fraud”. Citizens’ Revolution (RC), the party of the former leftist president Rafael Correa, repeated the fraud allegations in a statement on Monday, but influential party members recognised Noboa’s victory. “If the people elected him, we must respect it. Whether we like it or not, the people voted democratically and we must be honest and recognise it,” Aquiles Álvarez, the RC mayor of Ecuador‘s largest city, Guayaquil, said on X. “The worst is to be a bad loser.” International observers from the European Union (EU) and the Organization of American States (OAS) monitored the vote. They have not yet published their reports, but on Monday the OAS expressed its confidence in the official results. According to the statement, the OAS observer mission “conducted a comparison of tally sheets at the observed polling stations and was able to verify consistency between the transmitted sheets, those received by the parties, and those returned in the electoral package”. The margin of victory – more than 1.1m votes – was significantly larger than suggested by opinion polls, which had indicated a technical tie, as well as the result of thefirst round in February, when Noboa had beaten González by just 16,746 votes (0.17%). Noboa’s term has been defined by an“internal armed conflict”he declared in January 2024 against drug trafficking gangs. He placed the armed forces at the centre of hismano dura(iron fist) offensive, which initially led to a drop in crime – soon followed by a surge in reports ofhuman rights violationsand a return to previous levels of violence. Once one of the safest countries in Latin America, Ecuador registered thehighest homicide rate in the region in 2024. The populationalso facedan energy crisis that led to scheduled blackouts of up to 14 hours, a shrinking GDP, andrising poverty levels– yet the incumbent emerged victorious. The heir to a banana fortune will now serve a full term in office – until 2029 – as his current 17 months in power were to complete the term of former president Guillermo Lasso, who dissolved Congress and stepped down to avoid impeachment. In the2023 snap election, Noboa also defeated González in the runoff but by a much narrower margin: 51.83% to 48.17%. Voting is compulsory in Ecuador, and, according to the National Electoral Council, 83.76% of eligible voters turned out. One move by Noboa on the eve of the election sparked controversy. Less than 24 hours before polls opened, the president signed a decree declaring a 60-daystate of emergency– something that has been a frequent feature of his presidency – suspending the right to freedom of assembly and authorising warrantless searches. The president claimed there was a “serious internal disturbance” in light of rising violence levels, but the decision was sharply criticised by the opposition, Indigenous movements and even Congress. Despite once again coming close to becoming the first female president in Ecuador’s history, González’s competitiveness had more to do with her political patron Correa, who governed Ecuador from 2007 to 2017. A split betweenCorreístas– the former president’s supporters, such as González – and anti-Correístashas since polarised Ecuador. Correa has lived in Belgium since leaving office and was convicted by an Ecuadorian court in 2020 for corruption during his presidency. In the speech in which she said she would not recognise the election result, González claimed that none of the opinion polls showed such a large margin and that Noboa had abused his power by not stepping down from office to run, as required by law. “This is a dictatorship, and this is the biggest electoral fraud that we, the Ecuadorians, are witnessing,” she said. To the Ecuadorian outletPrimicias, Noboa said it was regrettable that González would not accept defeat. “I find it regrettable that, with an 11- or 12-point difference, she’s still trying to somehow question the will of the Ecuadorian people. The Ecuadorians have already spoken, and now it’s time to get to work starting tomorrow,” he said.",

    "article_text": "Chinahas played down the risk of damage to its exports fromDonald Trump’stariffs, with an official saying the “sky won’t fall”, as stock markets rose amid signs of a retreat on electronics restrictions. The US president claimed his strategy was working on Monday, with record levels of investment. Addressing reporters at the White House, he continued to threaten new tariffs on pharmaceutical goods. As fears of a potential downturncontinue to mount, Kevin Hassett, the director of the US national economic council, pushed back against warnings that a recession could take hold this year. “100% not,” he told Fox Business. Leading tech stocks struggled for direction amid confusion over theTrump administration’s stance on key US imports including smartphones and semiconductors. While it emerged that such electronic goods and components were exempt from the sweeping tariffs imposed this month, Trump and his officials have signaled they may not be spared for long. “THE BEST DEFINITION OF INTELLIGENCE IS THE ABILITY TO PREDICT THE FUTURE!!!” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Monday, as firms around the world struggled to keep up with the latest developments, let alone judge what might happen next. Consumers are starting to feel the impact of the trade tensions. Sonyincreased the price of its PlayStation 5by 25% in some markets in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Oceania, citing “a challenging economic environment” as the video game industry reels from the impact of Trump’s tariffs. China, meanwhile, has vowed to stand firm in the face of Trump’s tariffs.The world’s second-largest economy has diversified its trade away from the US in recent years, according to Lyu Daliang, a customs administration spokesperson, in commentsreported by state-owned agency Xinhua. Beijing has retaliated forcefully to Washington’s tariffs, with125% levieson US imports against the US’s total of 145% border taxes on goods moving the other way. The trade war has prompted turmoil on financial markets since Trump first revealed tariffs on every country in the world on 2 April. Since then he has partly retreated on the highest levies on most trading partners for at least 90 days, but has doubled down in his spat with China. The White House offered further relief over the weekend with an exemption from the steepest tariffs forelectronics including smartphones, laptops and semiconductors. But Trump officials later appeared to walk that back with the commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, saying such devices would be “included in the semiconductor tariffs which are coming in probably a month or two”. Trump said on Sunday night on Truth Social that “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook’,” highlighting that smartphones were still subject to 20% levies and suggesting they could still rise higher. However, investors on Monday appeared unconvinced by Trump’s attempts to play down the retreat. Japan’s Nikkei gained 1.2% while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose by 2.2% and the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges climbed by 0.8% and 1.2%, respectively.

On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 closed up close to 0.8% and the Dow Jones industrial average also gained 0.8%. The technology-focused Nasdaq Composite was 0.6% higher. “The sky won’t fall” for Chinese exports, China’s Lyu said. “These efforts have not only supported our partners’ development but also enhanced our own resilience.” The customs report also played up China’s “vast domestic market”, and said “the country will turn domestic certainty into a buffer against global volatility”. China has increasingly tried to stimulate private consumption. China’s president, Xi Jinping, on Mondaycriticised the US tariffs, during a visit to Vietnam. Vietnam has in recent decades grown to become the eighth largest source of goods for US consumers, but it is facing the threat of 46% tariffs when Trump’s 90-day pause expires. In an article in a Vietnamese newspaper, Xi said that a “trade war and tariff war will produce no winner, and protectionism will lead nowhere”.",

    "title": "Sky-high US-China tariffs are a mutual trade embargo that will hurt both sides",
    "article_text": "Sky-high tariffs that now hang heavily over US-China trade mean, effectively, that they have declared a trade embargo on each other, normally an act of war. The economic consequences for both will hurt. The US’s $150bn (£113bn) or so of exports to China will fall away quickly, while China’s $440bn worth of exports to the US may drop by up to 75% over the next 18 months, unless some sort of negotiation happens. No one will be spared the effects. The consequences could tip the US into a mild recession this summer, and are undermining one of the country’s principal weapons, namely the power, leverage and reach of its financial system. The leading indicators of consumer confidence, inflation, and capital spending are all flashing warning signs. It is also an ill wind that last week brought both rising bond yields in the US Treasury market and a falling dollar. This trade war is distinctly unwelcome for the Chinese Communist party, which only last month revealed its alarm at the underlying fragility of China’s economy. Chinese exports were on fire last year, accounting for half of its growth and expanding three times as fast as world trade. The country ran a $2tn trade surplus in manufactured goods. The government can ill-afford a trade torpedo as it tries to stabilise its beleaguered property sector, along with debt and asset deflation in local governments, and finance. Donald Trump and Xi Jinping boast resilience and determination, but have reasons to pull back, if not call off, the trade dogs of war. The chances of immediate rapprochement look poor, but not hopeless. China’s ministry of commerce said over the weekend it would ignore future US escalation. The US announced tariff exemptions for smartphones, chips, and electronic equipment, though only temporarily. Some sort of eventual transactional “deal” – some rollback of high tariffs, maybeTikTok, other issues – still seems probable. The US wants to contain and decouple from China, but has not as yet exercised some of its more potent financial and export control weapons.China has been pursuing decoupling under the slogan of self-reliance for a long time, and if Xi wanted to, he could shut down any chance of talks by devaluing the yuan much more aggressively, and targeting a swathe of US firms. Trade negotiations would not be a panacea for the fundamental issues that divide these two powers, but they might buy some time and at least keep dialogue going. Implications for the rest of the world were hinted at, curiously, by the crisis surrounding British Steel and its Chinese owner, Jingye Group. Seemingly a world away, there is though an important connection. In the firm’s UK and French plants, Jingye has been able to make, finish and export steel, branding it “Made in UK” and so avoid steel tariffs and other trade restrictions when selling to the EU and US. Sign up toBusiness Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion In addition to using investment in this way, China has also had growing recourse to “trans-shipment”, or the practice of using third countries, especially in Asia, such as Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand and India, and also Mexico, to bypass sanctions and trade barriers, and obfuscate country of origin. About a quarter of all China’s exports are now trans-shipped. US so-called “reciprocal tariffs” on more than 100 countries, with the top tariffs applying in Asia, were designed partly to stop this from happening. The recently announced 90-day pause in these tariffs (ex-China) were both a reaction to stabilise the US’s battered financial markets, but also a window in which the US hopes that several important countries will negotiate new trade arrangements with Washington, possibly including restrictions on trade and investment with China. The EU and the UK appear now in “pause” mode with respect to retaliation, formal channels have opened with Japan and South Korea, and the US reports encouraging signals from Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand and India, for example. It is a complicated picture. Many countries are highly integrated into China’s trading system, but many have also implemented trade measures against China to protect their own manufacturing, jobs and communities. No one wants to lose access to the US consumer market, which is 30% of the world total. China’s mercantilist character means it will not and cannot fill the gap, and wants only to expand its exports. The manner in which the Trump administration is prosecuting this trade war is chaotic and often barely thought out. Yet, it is important not to lose sight of the reason that trade conflict has erupted in the first place, and that is as reaction to China’s surging trade surplus. This comes from a political system that gives exceptionally large support to its companies, distorts competition, restricts market access and imposes real economic costs on other nations.

    "title": "‘No winners’ in a trade war, says China’s Xi as he heads to Vietnam on charm offensive",
    "article_text": "The Chinese president,Xi Jinping, warned there would be “no winners” in a trade war and that protectionism “leads nowhere”, as he began a three-nation trip to south-east Asia, starting in Vietnam on Monday. Xi’s tour, which started in Hanoi, also includes rare visits to Malaysia and Cambodia and will seek to strengthen ties with China’s closest neighbours amid a trade war that hassent shock waves through global markets. Writing in an article published in Vietnam’s Nhân Dân newspaper on Monday, Xi urgedVietnamto “resolutely safeguard the multilateral trading system, stable global industrial and supply chains, and open and cooperative international environment”, Beijing’s Xinhua news agency said. He added that a “trade war and tariff war will produce no winner, and protectionism will lead nowhere”. It is expected Xi’s visit will seek to present China as a reliable partner, in contrast to Washington, which imposed – then suspended –tariffs of more than 40% on some countries in south-east Asia, an export-reliant region. Officials in Vietnam, a manufacturing powerhouse, were shocked when the country was hit with a tariff of 46%, even after various efforts to appease the Trump administration. The tariff, which has been paused, threatens to devastate the country’s ambitious economic growth plan. Xi’s visit was reportedly planned prior to Trump’s tariff announcement. During meetings Vietnam andChinawill sign about 40 agreements across different sectors, Vietnam’s deputy prime minister, Bùi Thanh Sơn, said on Saturday. It is expected this will include cooperation to develop Vietnam’s railway network. Vietnam’s leader, Tô Lâm, wrote in an article published in state media on Monday that Hanoi wanted to boost cooperation in defence, security and infrastructure, especially on rail links. Xi’s visit willprobably form part of an effort to prevent economic encirclement by the US and in the region, said Dr Nguyen Khac Giang, a visiting fellow at the Vietnam studies programme of the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, who cited reports that Washington would prioritise trade negotiations with countries such as Vietnam, Japan, South Korea and India. For Vietnam, Giang added, Xi’s visit presented “a risk and an opportunity”. Vietnam, and many other south-east Asian countries, are trying to maintain a delicate balancing act between the US and China. The US is Vietnam’s main export market, with US exports accounting for 30% of Vietnam’s GDP. However, China is Vietnam’s top import source, which it relies on for raw materials and other supplies that will be used to produce exports destined for the US. Vietnam has traditionally sought to avoid taking sides between the US and China and will want to avoid antagonising either party, especially as it tries to persuade Washington to lower tariffs. Vietnam is vulnerable to Washington’s tariffs because its trade surplus with the US has grown rapidly over recent years to more than $123bn (£94bn), fuelled in part by companies relocating production to Vietnam to avoid tariffs imposed on China by the last Trump administration. Hanoi is preparing to crack down on Chinese goods being shipped from its territory to the US, in an effort to appease Washington, according to a Reuters report, and to tighten controls on sensitive exports to China. It has also made other concessions, including offering to remove all tariffs on US imports and promising to buy more US goods. Cambodia and Malaysia, which face tariffs of 49% and 24% respectively, are also seeking to negotiate with Donald Trump, whileChina has previously vowedto “fight until the end” if the US continued to escalate the trade war. Hanoi will want to avoid being seen as moving too close to Beijing during Xi’s visit, given the tension between China and Washington, said Giang, but he added that China may be able to offer a “life-saving opportunity for Vietnamese economy … at least in the short run”. This could include a commitment from China not to export its excess capacity to Vietnam. Across many south-east Asian countries there is concern that tariffs imposed on China by the US will worsen a problem of cheap Chinese goods overwhelming domestic industries. China could also increase its imports from south-east Asia, including in areas such as agriculture. A willingness to pursue peaceful solutions to the dispute in the South China Sea, where Beijing and several south-east Asian countries have overlapping claims, would also improve perceptions of China in the region, added Giang. “Now we are viewing the US as a global disruptor – that presents China a golden opportunity to be a responsible stakeholder in the region. And if they can do so, I think more and more south-east Asian countries will eventually move closer to China,” Giang said.",

    "title": "UK MP refused entry to Hong Kong accuses China of ‘hidden blacklist’",
    "article_text": "A Liberal Democrat MPrefused entry to Hong Kongto see her young grandson has said her experience should be “a wake-up call for any parliamentarian”, given that it seems to show China holds a secret list of banned politicians. Wera Hobhouse, who was turned back by officials on Thursday, said she was given no explanation as to why this happened, and could only assume that it was because she had spoken out about rights abuses byChina. Speaking earlier on Monday, the Treasury minister James Murray said Douglas Alexander, the trade minister who is currently in China on a visit, had raised the matter with Chinese authorities. Hobhouse told Sky News that after she and her husband arrived, he was quickly given permission to stay but that she was asked to step aside. The couple’s son, a university academic, lives inHong Kong, and they were visiting to see their three-month-old grandson. “And at the end of about three hours, my husband was told he was free to go but I was denied entry, and I was going to go back on the next plane home,” Hobhouse said. The Bath MP said that while she tried to be “cooperative and friendly” in the expectation she would eventually be allowed in, on being told she could not, she “slightly lost it” and demanded an explanation, but was told only: “We are so sorry, Madam, we understand.” She said: “No explanation was given to me, ever. And this is what is so chilling, and should really be a wake-up call for any parliamentarian, because I had no warning that I was on the blacklist.” China has in the past publiclybanned several British MPsfrom entering the country, including Iain Duncan Smith and Nusrat Ghani who, like Hobhouse, are members of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (Ipac). Ipac is an international group of politicians that scrutinises Beijing’s approach to human rights and has criticised the crackdown on free speech in Hong Kong. Hobhouse said her apparent presence on “a sort of hidden blacklist” appeared likely to be connected to her membership of Ipac. “I’m a member of Ipac,” she said. “Ipac is watching the human rights adherence, or not, of the Chinese Communist party, but I’m not more outspoken than other MPs about criticising the Chinese Communist party. “Therefore anybody who ultimately is seen as standing up for freedom, democracy and human rights should feel that they are going to be targeted by the Chinese authorities. And that is really, really chilling.” Asked how she felt personally about not being able to see her grandchild, Hobhouse said it was “depressing”. She said: “There are many, many more tragedies that are far, far worse, but I am sad.” Asked about Hobhouse’s case by Sky, Murray said: “We are very concerned about this. We need to find out exactly what happened. And I know that the trade minister, Douglas Alexander, who is in China at the moment, has raised this with authorities there. “Clearly, it would not be right to prevent a British MP from entering another country purely on the basis of what they had said as a parliamentarian.”",

    "title": "‘Invasion’ barges, subsea cable cutters and surprise naval drills: how China is testing Donald Trump",
    "article_text": "In the space of just five weeks, China held live-fire drills on the doorsteps of Australia, Taiwan and Vietnam. It testednew landing bargeson ships that could facilitate an amphibious assault on Taiwan. And it unveiled deep-sea cable cutters with the ability to switch off another country’s internet access – a tool no other nation admits to having. China has been flexing its maritime muscle in the Indo-Pacific to send a message of supremacy to its regional neighbours, experts say. But it’s also testing the thinking of a bigger rival further afield:Donald Trump. Since Trump took office in January, he and his cabinet members have focused their China strategy on tariffs and havelaunched an escalating trade war with Beijing. They had been largely silent on China’s growing acts of aggression in the Indo-Pacific’s seas. That’s starting to change. On April 1, theUS state department condemned Beijing’s“aggressive military activities and rhetoric” in relation to unannounced military drills in the Taiwan Strait, which have become bigger in scale in recent months and are increasingly resembling actual invasion. That came on the heels of a visit to the region byUS defence secretary Pete Hegseth, where he assured Japan and the Philippines that America would continue to defend them against China. He clarified the US had not changed its status quo stance on Taiwan, and the Pentagon reiterated China remained theUS’ biggest threat. But the US’s Indo-Pacific allies will want to hear those assurances from Trump, who has not shown his cards on issues like Taiwan. When asked by a journalist in February for his stance,Trump refused to be drawnand has said nothing on Taiwan since. He’s not afraid to diverge from his senior advisers, and hishaphazard approach to Ukraine ceasefire talks– and tariffs – gives little confidence the president has a consistent, long-term strategy on any given global affair. “The Chinese are watching what’s happening with the Trump administration and seeing how far they can push things,” said Malcolm Davis, a senior analyst with the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. And in their testing of Trump, the seas around China are likely to become more restive, Davis said, adding that China will keep ratcheting up its drills in theTaiwanStrait and target countries with which it has territorial disputes, including the Philippines and Japan. “China will be more willing to impose the risk of casualties on the Philippines through ramming ships and so forth. It might go fromusing water cannonto something a bit more aggressive,” Davis said. “The goal is to intimidate Manila into accepting China’s interests.” How heavily involved the US military should get in the Indo-Pacific and how far the US should go to protect Taiwan fromChinaare issues that have divided Trump’s most senior officials, according to a former state department staffer who worked in Trump’s initial weeks in office. “There are definitely different competing camps that you could liken to a royal court, all competing for the last word and influence with Trump,” the former staffer said. “There is definitely a split over Taiwan policy between traditional NatSec folks like (Marco) Rubio and (Mike) Waltz versus Maga folks.” But which side Trump is on isn’t clear. Sam Roggeveen, director of the Lowy Institute’s international security program, said it was known that a faction of the Trump administration wanted to turn away from Europe. “But it’s not at all clear that he agrees with the second part of it – doing more in Asia,” he said. What is clear from Trump’s posture in Ukraine talks is that he is open to putting deals on trade and major geopolitical issues on the same table. He also has a tendency to change his stance on a subject in a matter of days. Beijing will be watching to see how Trump sways. If Russia’s Vladimir Putin can strike a grand bargain with Trump by using economic incentives in exchange for Ukrainian land, Beijing may look to do the same with Taiwan. And that’s causing anxiety among the US’s closest allies in the Indo-Pacific, said Jenny Schuch-Page, managing principal in energy and sustainability with the Washington-based Asia Group. “Even the prospect for a ‘grand bargain’ with China will make countries in South-east Asia wary about how they will fare,” she said. A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington, Liu Pengyu, did not comment on whether Beijing was looking for such a deal, but he said China “deplores” the US’ criticisms of its drills near Taiwan, calling them “a mischaracterisation of the facts and truth and an interference in China’s internal affairs.” What Trump is likely to focus on is staying competitive with China, which is ahead in areas including artificial intelligence, robotics, electric vehicles and 6G internet. The lack of a long-term China strategy is problematic, according to Danny Russel, a former US diplomat and vice-president of international security and diplomacy with the Asia Society Policy Institute in Washington. He points to mass firings in the country’s intelligence services, which included laying off dedicated China researchers from the CIA, as a dangerous move in terms of security and the US’s bargaining position in trade talks. China will probably try to recruit those laid off for its own intelligence gathering on the US, he said. AReuters reportsuggests it already is. “We’re blinding ourselves at a moment when the national security and economic interests of the United States and our allies call for clarity,” Russel said. Thedefunding of Radio Free Asia– a sister organisation of Voice of America – is another own-goal, Russel said, cutting off a valuable source of information from China and other countries that are difficult to report from, like North Korea. “It’s a kind of unilateral disarmament in the information space at a time when China, Russia, and North Korea are ramping up,” Russel said of the cuts. “Why are we voluntarily giving up our best tools of competition? There’s a big difference between belt-tightening and self-sabotage.” That may become a security concern for countries like Australia, which has a long tradition of sharing intelligence back and forth with the US. China is likely to ramp up its missions in international waters near Australia, Davis and Roggenveen said, so a reliable flow of information on China is crucial. A Chinese research vessel making a loop around Australia is a case in point. The Tan Suo Yi Hao has been cruising international waters off Australia’s southern and western coasts for two weeks surveying subsea communication cables – critical infrastructure thatallows Australians to send everything from emails to military secrets. “I’d prefer it wasn’t there,” is about as much as Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese could say when asked by journalists for his thoughts. Without a strong signal on the region from Trump, there could be more Chinese ships to come.",

    "article_text": "A drive-by shooting has killed a woman in her 60s and left a suburbanSydneyhome peppered with bullet holes. The killer remained on the run on Tuesday with authorities hunting for those responsible for the overnight attack in Ambarvale on Sydney’s south-west outskirts. Shots were fired from an unknown vehicle at a house on Dickens Road on Monday night when the 65-year-old woman was hit. Emergency services were called to the property about 11pm and treated the woman, but she died at the scene. Two other people in the home were not injured – a 21-year-old woman and a 34-year-old man. Nearby resident Louise Hosar said she heard gunshots after 10.30pm. “Within 20 minutes I went to bed and my bedroom just lit up with the police lights ... they didn’t have the sirens going but there was a lot of police presence and ambulances up there,” she said. “I woke my house up to alert them that something was happening ... it was very distressing to hear the family and shocking to find out she was an elderly lady.” Local officers and the homicide squad were investigating with a number of police vehicles outside the property as authorities began their probe. Officers inspected bullet holes on the stairs leading to the property’s front door and on the front wall of the house. At least three bullet holes could be seen on the house, while about 10 yellow evidence markers were spotted at the taped-off area outside the home. Investigators also crawled to look underneath a car parked in the property’s driveway.

They asked witnesses to contact Crimestoppers. Hosar, who has lived in the area for 18 years but did not know the dead woman, said the violence was “part of living on Dickens Road”. “Every few weeks there’s a lot of police presence,” she said. “Dickens Road always gets the negative [attention] but we do have some really nice people that live on Dickens Road and in Campbelltown in general.”",

    "title": "US sees biggest drop in Australian visitors since Covid as travellers avoid Trump’s America",
    "article_text": "Australians are increasingly avoiding travel to the US under Donald Trump’s second presidency, fresh data shows, with forecasters expectingtourist numbers to plummet further throughout the year. Official statistics from the US International Trade Administration reveal the number of visitors from Australia in March 2025 was down by 7% compared with March 2024 – a reduction of 4,559 people. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter This is the largest decline since March 2021, when the Covid-19 pandemic was disrupting international travel. The figures – which count any visit of one or more nights – also show sharp drops invisitors from Europe and other areas, as countries updated their travel advice for the US. Overseas arrivals to the US from all origins dropped 11.6% in March, the government data showed. The downturn in travel following Trump’s inauguration exceeded even the global tourism industry’s worst case predictions,according to travel analytics group Tourism Economics. Aside from the long-term weakness in the Australian dollar meaning more expensive holidays, a string of incidents with US border protocols since January may have left some reconsidering their destination. Guardian Australia last week reported the case ofan Australian man with a working visa who was detained and deportedon returning to the US. The man alleged border officials called him “retarded” and boasted “Trump is back in town”. Meanwhile, an award-winning Australian comediancancelled a planned trip to the US after receiving legal advicethat she could be stopped at the border due to her previous jokes about the Trump administration. The incidents haveprompted unease among Australian academics, many of whom are now refusing to attend US conferences for fear of being detained. Gender-diverseAustralians have also been warnedthey may face visa delays following Trump’s executive order on gender. James Kavanagh, Flight Centre’s chief executive of leisure travel, said that while the US has long been a firm favourite for Australian travellers, “we must acknowledge the political environment in the US and the fact that it may influence Australians’ decisions on where they choose to travel”. “For example, looking at the first quarter of 2024 [compared with 2025], while we’ve seen a slight decline in bookings to the USA, we’ve seen a significant uplift in bookings to east Asia and northern Europe,” he said. Melissa Elf, global chief operating officer of Flight Centre’s corporate wing, said that while bookings from Australian business travellers had so far remained “resilient”, the introduction of tariffs could see businesses look away from the US and to places such as “Asia and the Middle East”. “It’s a very different landscape today compared to what it was at the beginning of the year, and we are conscious that major changes that have occurred in the US, and tariffs that are being applied to Australian companies may see corporates prioritise business and trade with other nations,” she said. Sign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025 Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion “We’re also seeing an interesting change in the businesses travelling to the US out of Australia. Last year, [the] mining, IT and education sectors led corporate travel to the USA, but this year, it’s being led by education, government and mining. Again, this just shows how different sectors will prioritise different nations for business, based on where the opportunity lies.” Tourism Economics also named Trump’s influenceas damaging the US as a destination.“Policies and pronouncements from the Trump administration have contributed to a growing wave of negative sentiment toward the US among potential international travellers,” it said in a briefing issued on Friday. “Heightened border security measures and visible immigration enforcement actions are amplifying concerns.” While the decline in tourist arrivals in March was strongest from Canada, at more than 20%, and western Europe, with countries such as Germany recording an almost 30% drop – Oceania (of which Australia is the largest market) is part of the trend, the agency said. It predicts a 9.4% drop in all inbound international tourism over the course of 2025, but noted this could grow with further volatility from the Trump administration. “These sentiment shifts represent a backlash to trade policies and other pronouncements that target individual countries – including country leaders, national industries, and citizens – in ways that elicit strong responses,” an earlier April briefing said. “Trump administration shifts on Ukraine and longstanding alliances, and domestic issues – such as the treatment of certain categories of individuals – are also contributing to the sentiment shift, casting the US in a new, less favourable light for many potential travellers. Leisure travelers, as well as business event organizers and participants, are expected to shift away from the US in response.” But there may be one silver lining to the traveller reticence – Kavanagh says airline capacity between the US and Australia has increased in recent months, which likely means lower airfares. Air France and KLM are among European carriers to cut air fares to the USto fill seats on their planned capacities this year.",

    "title": "Australia does not have enough tradies to fulfill Labor’s housing promise, experts say",
    "article_text": "Australia does not have enough construction workers and other tradies to meet election pitches to boost housing supply, experts say, casting doubt over the major parties’ pledges to address housing affordability. Anthony Albanese and Peter Duttonannounced their competing housing plansthis week, with both major parties seeking to increase the number of new home builds above the current annual rate of about 170,000. The Labor government nominated a target of 250,000 completed homes a year for the next four years, while the Coalition was yet to commit to a target. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter But Labor’s goal cannot be reached given the low number of skilled tradespeople in the construction workforce, according to Tim Reardon, the chief economist at theHousingIndustry Association. “We don’t have enough people,” he said. “We can build 200,000 to 220,000 with the labour force we have at the moment, [but] getting to 250,000 is the point at which we need more skilled labour.” The association estimatedthere were close to 280,000 workers in key skilled occupations but a shortage of 80,000 tradespeople remained. Industry bodies have consistentlycalled for greater government supportto increase the workforce. Reardon said tradespeople were turning to other careers, school leavers were shunning building and skilled migrants were entering the workforce too slowly. The number of construction trades apprentices in training fell 3.7% in the year to September, a report from the National Centre for Vocational Education Research found. There were 10,000 fewer new starters annuallycompared to 2021, while a greater number of trainees were withdrawing from their courses. “The building industry still has an acute shortage of labour because we’re losing labour to the mining industry and other construction projects,” Reardon said. Almost a tenth (9.5%) of Australia’s workforce have their main job in the construction industry, but the median weekly earnings for construction workers are $1,598 – about $100 less than the median weekly earnings across all industries,according to the government. Sign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025 Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Both parties had committed to increase subsidies and financial incentives for apprentices but neither program would be enough to close the skill shortage, according to Michael Fotheringham, the managing director at the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute. “We haven’t seen enough from either party on it,” he said. “A modest workforce strategy from Labor and no workforce strategy from the Liberals are not going to get us there.” The Labor party committed to building 100,000 homes reserved for first home buyers, working with state governments and industry, while the Coalition would also allow first home buyers to tax deduct their mortgage payments if they buy a new build. Both parties on Sundaysaid they would expandthe first home buyerguarantee scheme. The cost of building materials has fallen but experts and builders said new builds remained limited due to slow approvals processes, high building company failures and limits on the arrivals of migrants with construction skills. Dutton had committedto reducing migrationoverall but on Monday committed to increasing the number of tradespeople entering the country, without providing details or figures. “We’ll have more tradies coming in under our scheme,” he said. A specialist streamlined visa for skills in demand, open to a limited set of occupations, excludes construction tradespeople. That exclusion means construction companies face months-long delays to get workers to Australia on skills visas, which has been discouraging employers, according to Sonia Le-Heggart, migration strategist at Absolute Immigration. Whereas immigration applications by nurses move through the system quickly, tradespeople are slow to get in, Le-Heggart said. “I’ve had so many complaints where employers have been like, ‘I’ve invested all this money and applications are taking so long to bring a worker, and I need the guy to come and work because I don’t have enough workers, and I can’t meet demand,’” she said. “They’re just not able to get that overseas workforce.”",

    "article_text": "Two American college students traveling for spring break were arrested in Copenhagen, charged with assault, and held in aDanishprison for two weeks following an alleged dispute with anUberdriver, Danish police said. The family of Owen Ray, a 19-year-old studying at Miami University inOhio, said he and an unnamed friend have been forced to forfeit their passports and remain in the country. Ray and his friend were visitingDenmarkin March when they entered the wrong address for their destination on the Uber app, his family and attorney said. An altercation allegedly occurred when the driver refused to take them to the alternate destination, and the two students exited the car, they said. They said the driver threatened the boys and assaulted Ray. “A scuffle ensued, culminating in the boys fleeing due to fear. This is all captured via the Uber’s dash cam video, which is now part of the legal proceedings in Denmark,” according to Erin Pelton, a PR manager representing Ray’s family. The two students were detained at Copenhagen airport the next day while trying to return home to the US, she said. Danish police confirmed that two US citizens were charged with common assault. A Copenhagen police spokesperson told multiple outlets: “The Copenhagen Police can confirm, that on March 31, two American citizens were arrested in Copenhagen, and on March 31 they were brought before the court charged with common assault. “They were sentenced to 10 days pre-trial detention. This verdict has since extended until April 24.” Ray has been released from a Danish prison but authorities will not allow him to return to the US, his family said on Monday. The status of the other student is unclear. “We are relieved that Owen has been released from a Danish prison following the unprovoked assault he and his friend suffered at the hands of an Uber driver on March 31,” a statement by Ray’s parents, Andy Ray and Sara Buchen-Ray, said. “However, we remain deeply concerned that Danish authorities have confiscated his passport and will not allow him to return to the United States – something we understand is unusual in Danish court proceedings. “The facts make clear that Owen is the victim in this case, and we urge Danish officials to allow him to return home to the United States without delay.” The US state department said it is aware of the situation and is providing the citizens with consular assistance. “The Department has no higher priority than the safety and security of US citizens abroad,” it said. A spokesperson for Uber told outlets that the company “take reports of violence very seriously”. “Any additional questions about the investigation should be directed to the Danish police,” the statement added. The arrests took place amid heightenedpolitical tensionsbetween Denmark and the US over ownership of Greenland. Relations between the two traditionally close Nato allies have soured sinceDonald Trump’srepeatedthreatsto acquire Greenland, a resource-rich, semi-autonomous Danish territory.",

    "article_text": "He’s long been nicknamed “God’s architect” by those who point to his piety and the religious imagery woven through his soaring spires, colourful ceramics and undulating lines. Now it seems the Vatican may be ready to make it official. It said on Monday thatAntoni Gaudí, the Catalan architect behind Barcelona’s Sagrada Família basilica, had been put on the path to sainthood. The Vatican said ina statementthat Pope Francis had recognised Gaudí’s “heroic virtues” during the 88-year-old’s first official appointment afterweeks of illnesswith life-threatening pneumonia. Nearly a century after Gaudí’s death, the declaration is one of the initial steps in the long and complex process towards sainthood. The architect behind several of Barcelona’s biggest tourist attractions will have to be beatified before he can pass to the last step of canonisation. Gaudí devoteeshave calledfor him to be named a saint for more than three decades, pointing to how the fantasy spires and intricate stonework of the Sagrada Família had convinced some to convert to Catholicism. “There areno serious obstacles,” the architect and then-president of the Gaudí Beatification Society, José Manuel Almuzara said in 2003. He described the society as a movement of 80,000 people worldwide who prayed to Gaudí, beseeching him to perform miracles. The church began considering the request in the early 2000s.

    "article_text": "Police in Sicily have arrested a former gravedigger and are investigating 18 others accused of illegally removing bodies from tombs to make way for new corpses. The former gravedigger’s assistant was also arrested on Monday in the investigation dating from 2023 for alleged corruption and bribery in Trapani, on the west coast of the Italian island. Police said they banned three funeral parlours from operating in the city, whose cemetery has been plagued in recent years with delays and complaints from local people. Police searched the home of a forensic pathologist who is alleged to have aided the gravedigger by falsely certifying the decomposition of corpses – thereby making room for new bodies to be interred in their place. When the gravedigger could not count on the forensic pathologist, investigators said he made decisions “on extraordinary exhumation procedures”, in which municipal burial niches were cleared of bodies so they could be resold. Police believe the ex-worker took valuables, such as gold jewellery, from the bodies of those to be buried. Relatives of the deceased were allegedly forced to pay the gravedigger in cash for expedited burials. The fee was colloquially referred to as “the coffee for the gravedigger”, implying that in exchange for the favour, an extra sum had to be paid. “People were forced to pay in cash for faster burials,” said the police. “During the course of the investigation, no fewer than 25 cases of illicit burials were documented.” Police found that the municipal gravedigger hindered an outside company brought in to manage the services, instead directing three mortuaries with whom he conspired to carry out burials, exhumations and the transfers of remains, in exchange for a percentage of the profit. Police are still investigating what became of the removed corpses. Cemeteries and funeral parlours are often controlled by the mafia in areas of Italy where those criminal organisations are entrenched. Two weeks ago, the former custodian of the cemetery of Tropea, in the southern Italian region of Calabria, was sentenced to five years in prison, with three years and six months handed to his son, for operating what reports called a “cemetery of horrors”. The pair, caught in the act by hidden cameras set up by police in the cemetery, were charged with conspiracy, grave violation, desecration of a corpse, illicit disposal of special cemetery waste, and embezzlement. The coffins were smashed with a pickaxe, the corpses stripped, and jewels removed with saws and hammers. A video seen by the Guardian shows bodies being disposed of in black plastic bags and thrown into rubbish bins or burned. A lack of tombs and spaces for urns in cemeteries has become a serious emergency, especially in southernItaly, where the coffins of the dead sometimes lie piled up in warehouses for years. The Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated the crisis. In 2021, in Caltanissetta, Sicily, authorities drew up a lottery to bury bodies in the few graves left free.

    "title": "Hungary passes constitutional amendment banning Pride and restricting rights – as it happened",
    "article_text": "Amendment passes with 140 votes in favour and 21 against despite disruption in the chamber as rights campaigners say it chips away at human rights Despite the weeks-long protests and a brief disruption in the chamber just before the vote,the Hungarian constitutional amendment has now been passed, with 140 votes in favour and 21 against,Indexreported. Monday’s amendment underpins legislation passed on 18 March that bans the annual Pride march, effectively restricting freedom of assembly and triggering protests against the changes fast-tracked by Orbán’s Fidesz party, AFP said. The key provision declares that children’s rights for their “proper physical, mental and moral development take precedence over all other fundamental rights,” except the right to life, AP explained. That provision is seen as a way to strengthen the legal foundations for the prohibition of the Pride march, it added. The amendment proclaims that people can only be male or female, and allows for temporary stripping of citizenship from some dual or multiple nationals, which AP speculates that could target billionaireGeorge Soros,a Hungarian-American and a regular subject of populist conspiracy theories. Opposition forcesare leading a protest against the vote outsidethe parliament. … and on that note, it’s a wrap for today. TheHungarianparliament has adopteda constitutional amendmentthat rights campaigners have described as a “significant escalation” in the government’s efforts to crack down on dissent and chip away at human rights, with some of the key changestargeting LGBTQ community and dual nationals(17:32). EU foreign policy chiefKaja Kallaswarned that “It is clear that they are stalling and not wanting peace at all,” (15:28) when commenting on the latest Russian airstrikes on Ukraine, as she called for more ammunition to be sent to help the country fight against the Russian aggression (15:39). White House economic adviserKevin Hassetttold Fox Business that the US was “making enormous progress on tariff talks with the EU,” as the bloc’s trade chiefMaroš Šefčovičcontinues his visit in Washington DC (14:23). TheBundestaghas confirmed thatthe formal election of the country’s next chancellor is scheduled for 6 May,assuming that the coalition deal gets approved before then (13:48). A youth organisation associated withthe Social Democratsindicated their opposition to the agreement, announced last week, prompting questions about whether it can win the key vote among the SPD members (12:09). Earlier, the presumed next chancellor,Friedrich Merz,suggested last night that his governmentcould finally deliver on Kyiv’s longstanding request to supply Ukraine with Taurus missiles, capable of strikes insideRussia(10:48), marking a shift in Germany’s policy after longstanding opposition from current chancellor, Olaf Scholz. We will be back tomorrow with more updates onEuropeLive. The amendment passed Monday also allows for Hungarians who hold dual citizenship in a non-European Economic Area country to have their citizenship suspended for up to 10 years if they are deemed to pose a threat to public order, public security or national security. Hungary has taken steps in recent months to protect its national sovereignty from what it claims are foreign efforts to influence its politics or even topple Orban’s government. The self-described “illiberal” leader has accelerated his longstanding efforts to crack down on critics such as media outlets and groups devoted to civil rights and anti-corruption, which he says have undermined Hungary’s sovereignty by receiving financial assistance from international donors. In a speech laden with conspiracy theories in March, Orban compared people who work for such groups to insects, and pledged to “eliminate the entire shadow army” of foreign-funded “politicians, judges, journalists, pseudo-NGOs and political activists.” Ádám Remport, a lawyer with the HCLU, said that while Hungary has used facial recognition tools since 2015 to assist police in criminal investigations and finding missing persons, the recent law banning Pride allows the technology to be used in a much broader and problematic manner. That includes for monitoring and deterring political protests, AP reported.“One of the most fundamental problems is its invasiveness, just the sheer scale of the intrusion that happens when you apply mass surveillance to a crowd,” Remport said.“More salient in this case is the effect on the freedom of assembly, specifically the chilling effect that arises when people are scared to go out and show their political or ideological beliefs for fear of being persecuted,” he added. And on that note I’m passing the blog toTom Ambrosewho will bring you more from this as we get first reactions to the vote. Despite the weeks-long protests and a brief disruption in the chamber just before the vote,the Hungarian constitutional amendment has now been passed, with 140 votes in favour and 21 against,Indexreported.

Opposition forcesare leading a protest against the vote outsidethe parliament. I’m keeping an eye on the events in Budapest, and will update you soon. The bloc of votes has just started, according to Hungarian media. But in the meantime, let me bring you this update from US presidentDonald TrumponUkraine. Postingon Truth Social, he insisted he was “working diligently to get the death and destruction to stop,” as he added “we have to get it to stop, and fast.” Here is his post in full: The War between Russia and Ukraine is Biden’s war, not mine. I just got here, and for four years during my term, had no problem in preventing it from happening. President Putin, and everyone else, respected your President! I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS WAR, BUT AM WORKING DILIGENTLY TO GET THE DEATH AND DESTRUCTION TO STOP. If the 2020 Presidential Election was not RIGGED, and it was, in so many ways, that horrible War would never have happened. President Zelenskyy and Crooked Joe Biden did an absolutely horrible job in allowing this travesty to begin. There were so many ways of preventing it from ever starting. But that is the past. Now we have to get it to STOP, AND FAST. SO SAD! TheHungarianvote is accompanied by protests outside the parliament building inBudapest. AFP noted that according tothe organisers of the Pride parade, scheduled for 28 June, the changes move the EU member country closer toauthoritarianism. They also criticise that the amendment conflates being a member of the LGBTQ community with paedophilia and pornography, adding that it is an “attempt … to dehumanise them”. Elsewhere,Hungarianlawmakers are expected to vote ina controversial constitutional amendmenton Monday that rights campaigners have described as a “significant escalation” in the government’s efforts to crack down on dissent and chip away at human rights. Backed by the prime minister,Viktor Orbán,and his rightwing populist party, Fidesz,the amendment seeks to codifythe government’s recent ban on Pride events,paving the way for authorities to use facial recognition software to identify attenders and potentially fine them. The amendment, which the government says prioritises the protection of children’s physical, mental and moral development, also enshrines the recognition of only two sexes, providing a constitutional basis for denying the gender identities of some inHungary. After Orbán’s repeatedclaims of foreign interferencein the country’s politics, the amendment will also allow the government to temporarily suspend Hungarian citizenship in the case of dual nationals deemed to pose a threat to the country’s security or sovereignty. TheHungarian Helsinki Committee, a rights group, described the amendment as a means of “legislating fear” in the EU country. “These laws represent a significant escalation in the government’s efforts to suppress dissent, weaken human rights protection and consolidate its grip on power,” it said in a statement. The oppositionMomentumparty highlighted similarities withrestrictions in Russia. Much likeVladimir Putin,Orbán has sought to portray himself as a champion of traditional family values, ushering in policies that includeblocking same-sex couples from adopting childrenand barring any mention of LGBTQ+ issues in school education programmes. Read the full story here: Kallasalso said that it was “in everybody’s interest” to make Russia “realise it made a mistake” by attackingUkraineand making it clear it cannot win. “Because the will of the Ukrainian people is not broken, and European countries will – and not only European countries, but many other countries – will stand by Ukraine,” she says. In a pointed remark likely aimed at US presidentDonald Trump, she says: “I hope that it’s also clear to everybody now, thatif you want the killing to stop, you should put the pressure on Russia, who actually does the killing.” And that concludes the briefing. Kallasalso reiterates the need to provide more ammunition toUkraine“as soon as possible,” saying “they need it now, because these attacks are [happening], there are civilian casualties in great numbers.” “That’s why they need the ammunition. That’s why they also need the air defence. The calls by Ukraine to have more air defense have been really, really vocal,” she says. Kallasalso summed up the discussion onGaza, with “the first ever high-level political dialogue withPalestine” taking place later today, as the bloc supports the two state solution. She says the overall situation is “very grave” and urged mediators to restart negotiations, agree to a ceasefire and release all hostages. She says thatIsrael“has the right to defend itself, but its current actions go beyond proportionate self-defence.” Kallas also spoke about the discussion leaders had onSyriawith the country’s future “still very fragile,” onIran, and on the EU’s policy onAfrica. She then turned to the bloc’s enlargement policies, praisingAlbaniaandMontenegrofor making “good progress,” and expressing concerns about the attempts to breakBosnia and Herzegovina. She also issued a pointed warning against “any participation in the 9 May parades or celebrations in Moscow,” saying this “will not be taken lightly on the European side, considering thatRussiais really waging a full scale war inEurope.” Talking about putting more pressure onRussia,Kallassays the bloc is working on the 17th package of sanctions covering “shadow fleet and different elements” for the next meeting in May. EU foreign policy chiefKaja Kallasis briefing reporters after the meeting of EU foreign ministers. She opens by saying that all countrieswant to see peace in Ukraine, but pointedlycalls Russia outfor not committing to the US-led proposal for a ceasefire. She says: “Ukraine agreed to unconditional ceasefire already a month ago, and yet we are seeing that Russia alone wants war, because we have seenthe deadliest attack…Sumy airstrike over the weekend. It is clear that they are stalling and not wanting peace at all.” She then adds: “So the only way to get Russia to negotiate seriously is putting some more pressure on Russia.” EU foreign policy chiefKaja Kallasis about to brief journalists about today’s discussions among EU foreign ministers, including onUkraine. You can follow her press conference below, and I will bring you all the key lines in the blog. I brought you earlier the confirmation from the European Commission that EU trade commissionerMaroš Šefčovičis in Brussels for talks with the US on trade. White House economic adviserKevin Hassettjust told Fox Business that the US was “making enormous progress on tariff talks with the EU,” Reuters reported. “There have been a lot of discussions with the EU,” Hassett, director of the National Economic Council said in an interview with Fox Business Network, in comments reported by Reuters. “We’re making enormous progress. It’s going to be very good for American workers, especially American auto workers.” Atop British security expertisbeing appointed as British ambassador to Franceina sign of how the UK sees the future defence relationship with Franceand cooperation with Paris over Ukraine critical to the future of the Franco-British bilateral relationship. Sir Thomas Drewwill take over as ambassador in Paris starting in August 2025. He has spent the last four years as the FCDO’s most senior official responsible for Defence and Intelligence where he led on issues ranging from Covid-19 to threats from hostile states. He will take over fromDame Menna Rawlingsin the summer. The French president,Emmanuel Macron,and the British prime minister,Sir Keir Starmer,have grown into close political allies in the last few months as they have tried to build support for some kind of European led protection force inUkraine. Sir Tom’s previous roles in Government have also included the Director of National Security in both the Foreign Office and Home Office. A Foreign Office source said: “Sir Tom is a seasoned diplomat with invaluable experience, his appointment will build on the new era in our alliance with France under this Government. This is underpinned by closer than ever cooperation by the foreign secretary and prime minister, including joint visits, leading the Coalition of the Willing and a UK-France Summit due later this summer.” Back toGermany, theBundestaghas now confirmed that the formal election of the country’s next chancellor is scheduled for 6 May (assuming that the coalition deal gets approved before then.) The decision was made by the Bundestag president,Julia Klöckner. The timing makes sense: as the new head of the government,Friedrich Merzwould then represent Germany atthe Victory inEuropeDaycelebrations on 8 May and then atthe EU-UK summiton 19 May, creating ample opportunities to meet other leaders in his new role.",

    "title": "Hungary passes constitutional amendment to ban LGBTQ+ gatherings",
    "article_text": "Hungarian lawmakers have voted through a controversial constitutional amendment that campaigners described as a “significant escalation” in the government’s efforts to crack down on dissent and chip away at human rights. Backed by the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, and his rightwing populist party, Fidesz, the amendment passed on Monday along party lines, with 140 votes for and 21 against. It codifiesthe government’s recent ban on Pride events, paving the way for authorities to use facial recognition software to identify attenders and potentially fine them. The amendment, which the government says prioritises the protection of children’s physical, mental and moral development, also enshrines the recognition of only two sexes, providing a constitutional basis for denying the gender identities of some inHungary. Amid Orbán’s repeatedclaims of foreign interferencein the country’s politics, the amendment also allows the government to temporarily suspend Hungarian citizenship in the case of dual nationals deemed to pose a threat to the country’s security or sovereignty. The Hungarian Helsinki Committee, a rights group, described the amendment as a means of “legislating fear” in the EU country. “These laws represent a significant escalation in the government’s efforts to suppress dissent, weaken human rights protection and consolidate its grip on power,” it said in a statement. The opposition Momentum party highlighted similarities withrestrictions in Russia. Much like Vladimir Putin, Orbán has sought to portray himself as a champion of traditional family values, ushering in policies that includeblocking same-sex couples from adopting childrenand barring any mention of LGBTQ+ issues in school education programmes. Before Monday’s vote, Momentum issued a call on social media for Hungarians to join it in a blockade of the country’s parliament, in the hope of keeping lawmakers from voting in the legislation. “Let’s collectively prevent them from leading us down the Putin road and depriving us of our freedom,” it said. On Monday, opposition politicians and other protesters attempted to block the entrance to a parliament parking garage, with some using zip ties to bind themselves together, and were physically removed by police. The constitutional amendment was approved almost a month after lawmakers fast-tracked a law that banned public events held by LGBTQ+ communities. Thousands of people have sincetaken to the streets,blocking bridges and major thoroughfares with chants of “democracy” and “assembly is a fundamental right” in weekly protests. “This government isn’t just dismantling democracy brick by brick, it’s now going at it with a bulldozer,” Ákos Hadházy, an independent lawmaker who campaigns alongside Momentum, said at a recent rally,accordingto Bloomberg. “We are here because we need to act fast to get ahead and stop it.” Orbán and his government have said their aim is to protect children from what they describe as “sexual propaganda”, but analysts have pointed to forthcoming elections to argue that the country’s LGBTQ+ minority is being scapegoated by a government intent on mobilising its conservative base. Orbán, who haslong faced criticismfor weakening democratic institutions and gradually undermining the rule of law, is facing anunprecedented challengefrom a former member of the Fidesz party’s elite, Péter Magyar, before next year’s elections. As news of the Pride ban broke last month, 22 European embassies in Hungary, including those of the UK, France and Germany, issued a joint statement saying they were deeply concerned that the legislation would result in “restrictions on the right of peaceful assembly and the freedom of expression”. Sign up toThis is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion The EU’s equality commissioner, Hadja Lahbib, also weighed in, writing on social media: “Everyone should be able to be who they are, live & love freely. The right to gather peacefully is a fundamental right to be championed across the European Union. We stand with the LGBTQI community – in Hungary & in all member states.” The organisers of Budapest Pride, which regularly attracts tens of thousands of people, said they were determined to go ahead with this year’s march on 28 June. “This is not child protection, this is fascism,” they said last month. The amendment, the 15th to Hungary’s constitution since it was unilaterally authored and approved by the ruling Fidesz-KDNP coalition in 2011, also seeks to reinforce Orbán over what he claims are foreign efforts to influence Hungary’s politics. In a recent speech laced with conspiracy theories, Orbán pledged to “eliminate the entire shadow army” of foreign-funded “politicians, judges, journalists, pseudo-NGOs and political activists”. Rights groups described the amendment as a step in this direction for Orbán, a self-described “illiberal” leader, because it allows for the suspension of Hungarian citizenship for up to 10 years for dual nationals deemed to pose a threat to public order or security. The suspensions would only apply to Hungarians who hold citizenship of another country that is not a member of the EU or European Economic Area. The Hungarian Helsinki Committee, the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union, Amnesty International and the Háttér Society have urged the European Commission to launch a procedure against Hungary’s government, arguing that the recent changes breach EU law. The groups highlighted the “gravity and urgency of the consequences of the adopted changes” in a recent statement, noting that they would “force LGBTQ+ people completely out of the public eye”. The nationwide ban is believed to be the first of its kind in the EU’s recent history. The groups also said the amendment went further than violating the rights of LGBTQ+ people and those who supported them,describing itas a tool to further instil fear among those who voice dissent in the country. “The changes have overarching consequences that affect fundamental rights well beyond the issue of Pride,” they said.",

    "title": "Hundreds of former Mossad operatives criticise Israel’s return to war in Gaza",
    "article_text": "Hundreds of former operatives from Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency have criticised thereturn to war in Gazaamid growing frustration over the failure to bring home the remaining hostages held by Hamas. A group of more than 250 former Mossad figures – including three ex-chiefs – gave their backing to a letter first signed by air force veterans and reservists that urged the Israeli government to prioritise bringing back the hostages over fighting Hamas in Gaza. The Israeli government believes that 24 of the remaining 58 hostages who were taken captive in Hamas’s attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, are still alive. The letter decried the amping-up of Israeli strikes and ground operations in Gaza since the collapse of the ceasefire in March as driven by the personal interests of the prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu. It accused his government of putting the lives of soldiers and the hostages at risk for his own political gain. Critics have alleged that Netanyahu’s decision to return to war in Gaza wasdriven by a need to appease the far-right parties in his coalition, who have threatened to bring down his government if he does not completely crush Hamas. “The war mainly serves political and personal interests and not security interests,” said the letter. The letter was first published and publicly signed last week by almost 1,000 reservists and retired officers from Israel’s air force, which has been at the forefront of the continued assault onGaza. It prompted a vehement response from Netanyahu, who said it was written by “an extreme fringe group that is once again trying to break Israeli society from within” and ordered the dismissal of all the active-duty reservists who had signed it. Several similar statements were successively made in support, including by reservists from Israel’s elite Unit 8200, the biggest military intelligence unit, and hundreds of reservist doctors. On Monday, another public letter signed by more than 1,500 former and current armoured corps soldiers and paratroopers with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), including two former IDF chiefs of staff, called for an immediate end to the war in Gaza. “We are soldiers who have served our country all our lives. We have driven tanks, commanded troops, and paid a heavy price. It is precisely this experience that pushes us today to call for a ceasefire,” said the letter, authored by Col Rami Matan, a former IDF deputy commander, adding: “Why do we continue to sacrifice human lives for unattainable objectives?” Israel and Hamas have been engaged in negotiations in Cairo, with the involvement of Qatar, Egypt and the US, who have been attempting to broker another ceasefire after the last one collapsed in March and Israel launched a wave of strikes. Reports emerged on Monday that Israel had proposed a deal to Hamas that would see 10 hostages released. According to Tikva Forum, a rightwing group advocating for the hostages, Netanyahu told the father of the hostage Eitan Mor on Sunday that the government was working on a deal that would bring home 10 captives, but gave no further details on the conditions Israel had put forward. A Hamas official who spoke to the Lebanese newspaper Al Mayadeen said Israel had proposed the return of 10 hostages in return for an initial 45-day ceasefire, when the Israeli government’s blockade on aid going into Gaza would be lifted and the IDF would withdraw from Gaza territory it had seized since March. According to the official, Israel and Hamas would also commit to negotiations for a second stage, which is where the previous ceasefire commitments had stalled and ultimately fallen apart. This would include discussions of a permanent ceasefire, the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, and the disarmament of Hamas. Speaking to AFP on Monday, Taher al-Nunu, a senior Hamas official, accused Israel of obstructing progress towards a ceasefire. He said Hamas was willing “to release all Israeli captives in exchange for a serious prisoner swap deal, an end to the war, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip and the entry of humanitarian aid”. However, he made it clear that the disarmament of Hamas was not “up for negotiation”. On Sunday night, hundreds of people, including dozens of family members of former and current hostages, staged a protest outside the home of Ron Dermer, the minister Netanyahu has put in charge of the hostage negotiations, leading to five arrests. In recent days, hostage families have alleged that Dermer, who is one of Netanyahu’s closest advisers, has been delaying and obstructing negotiations in order to suit the government’s political agenda. The Netanyahu government has pushed back at the allegations, stating that it was doing everything to free the hostages. Doron Zektser, the father of the hostage Edan Alexander, addressed Dermer in a statement: “Come out, update us on the situation. That’s your responsibility. If you can’t do the job, resign. He doesn’t speak with the families. They’re rushing to war when it’s clear that only a deal will bring the hostages back.”",

Speaking to reporters on Monday, the Hampstead and Highgate MP said: “No one from the Bangladeshi authorities has contacted me. The entire time they’ve done trial by media. My lawyers proactively wrote to the Bangladeshi authorities, they never responded. “I’m sure you’ll understand I can’t dignify this politically motivated smear campaign with any … comments.

    "title": "UK riots led to deterioration in asylum seekers’ mental health, says report",
    "article_text": "Last summer’s riots, which took place after the murder of three girls at a Southport dance class, led to a deterioration in the mental health of asylum seekers, with many becoming fearful of walking down the street in case they were targeted by far-right protesters, according to a report. The report from the Mental Health Foundation, published on Tuesday, identified a decline in the mental health of asylum seekers as a result of the civil unrest andattacks on hotels, compared with the state of their mental health when they published a similar report in February 2024. Mark Rowland, the chief executive of the MentalHealthFoundation, said: “One key development since our last report has been that the racist riots of summer 2024 had a terrible impact on the mental health of many people seeking asylum in UK. Some people told us they were scared to leave their accommodation, risking increased isolation, and others said they feared they’d be attacked walking down the street just because of the colour of their skin.” He added: “The climate of hostility has increased, especially on social media which played a key role in escalating tensions. Disinformation and racist rhetoric have surged, especially on platforms like X, with some of those who spoke to us reflecting they’d see hate within minutes of logging on to the website. More action needs to be taken by the UK government to stem the impact of disinformation and hate both online and offline.” The report also called for asylum seekers to have the right to work in any job if the Home Office has not processed their claim within six months, arguing that this would not only boost asylum seekers’ mental health but also increase tax revenue for the Treasury. The data is based oncalculations by the Institute of Economic and Social Research. According to the figures, allowing asylum seekers to work after six months would save the country £4.4bn in government expenditure, grow the economy by £1bn, increase tax revenue by £880m, reduce the mental health impacts of worklessness and destitution on asylum seekers, promote better integration, and reduce dependence on taxpayer support. The report warned that preventing asylum seekers from getting jobs was leading to “workless stagnation”. It echoes theLift The Bancampaign, a coalition of more than 300 charities, trades unions, businesses, faith groups and thinktanks, which have urged the government to allow asylum seekers to work in a broader range of industries. Under the current rules, only some asylum seekers who are qualified in shortage occupations can apply for jobs if their asylum claim has not been determined after a year. In practice this system bars many from working. Rowland added: “Giving asylum seekers the right to work is a no-brainer. Everyone – from asylum seekers, to businesses, to the government, to the NHS, to our communities – benefits when asylum seekers are given the ability to support themselves. The current system, which is both harmful and expensive, cannot continue as it is.” The foundation, which supports asylum seekers and refugees with their mental health, through programmes across the UK, also highlighted in the report the acute poverty faced by asylum seekers who sometimes have to make a choice between skipping meals or paying the bus fare for a vital appointment. Some felt the words “asylum seeker” stigmatised them. One child told researchers she hid the fact that she was an asylum seeker from her school friends for fear of being excluded by them if she told them about her immigration status. A Home Office spokesperson said: “While the wellbeing of those in the asylum system is important, we remain determined to continue cracking down on anyone working illegally in the UK, and we certainly have no intention of creating a fast-track process so that people who come to the UK outside the established work visa rules are simply allowed to ignore them.”",

    "article_text": "Warm weather in March helped give a lift to retailers despite a late Easter, with sales of gardening, DIY, food, and health and beauty products getting a boost from the spring sunshine. Purchases for Mother’s Day also helped retail sales climb 1.1% last month, according to a British Retail Consortium-KPMG survey, keeping pace with February despite trading against a much stronger period a year before and adownturn in visitor numberson high streets and in retail parks as more sales shifted online. Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the BRC, said: “Despite a challenging global geopolitical landscape, the small increase in both food and non-food sales masked signs of underlying strengthening of demand given March 2025’s comparison with last year’s early Easter. “The improving weather made for a particularly strong final week, with gardening and DIY equipment flying off the shelves.” Spending in garden centres increased by 13.4% last month, according to separate figures from Barclays bank. However experts said growth may have peaked as spending on big-ticket items, such as sofas and TVs, remained weak as consumer confidence fell in the light of concerns about the impact of UStrade tariffsand the UK government tax increases on businesses, which kicked off this month. Dickinson warned that the increase in national insurance contributions for employers and new payments related to packaging recycling would “undoubtedly increase inflation later in the year and hold back critical investment in high streets across the country”. Jobs surveys have shown levels of unemployment rising and job vacancies falling as employers shelve investment plans and become more reluctant about hiring. Households cut spending on essentials such as groceries, petrol and energy bills during the month, according to Barclays, as they prepared for expected price rises, prioritised holidays and splashed out on electronics and digital subscriptions. Karen Johnson, the head of retail at Barclays Corporate Banking, said there were “welcome green shoots” as the warmer weather encouraged consumers to invest in gardening and DIY but households were adopting “prudent budgeting”. “Consumers are feeling the pressure of rising bills, alongside being mindful of the impact recent global events may have on their finances,” she said. Households have been hit with a range of tax and price rises, from an average council tax rise of almost 5%, food inflation on basics such as butter, and water bill increases that in the Thames area and south-west Englandhave risen by more than 30%. “We may have already seen the peak for some time,” said Sarah Bradbury, the chief executive of the grocery trade body IGD. The stock market value of major supermarkets has fallen as companies prepare for a price war. The fight for a share of straitened household budgets is led by Asda, which is struggling to hold on to its position as the UK’s third largest chain. Linda Ellett, the UK head of consumer, retail and leisure at KPMG, said the modest rate of sales growth as costs rise “means there are some retailers really struggling whilst others win, especially online”.",

    "title": "Warwick Davis’s wife died as hospital planned to discharge her, inquest finds",
    "article_text": "The actor and campaigner Samantha Davis, the wife of Harry Potter star Warwick Davis, died after suffering a cardiac arrest hours before a hospital was planning to discharge her, an inquest has found. Davis, who co-founded Little People UK – the dwarfism charity known as “an essential resource for little people and their families” – died aged 53 at London’s University College hospital on 24 March last year. Prof Fiona Wilcox, of Inner West London coroner’s court, concluded during Davis’s inquest on Monday that she had died of arrhythmic cardiac arrest after complications of essential surgical treatment. Davis was admitted to hospital on 7 February last year following a sudden loss of mobility in her lower limbs after a disc prolapse. On 20 February, and then again on 14 March, she had a thoracotomy operation – a surgical procedure where the chest wall is opened. Upon the second surgery, her condition improved and the University College hospital at Westmoreland Street was planning to discharge her, the inquest heard. However, Davis went into cardiac arrest at 11.25pm on 23 March and was pronounced dead in the early hours of the morning on 24 March, after a failed resuscitation attempt. Wilcox said: “I am satisfied that the medical cause of death should be arrhythmic cardiac arrest and complications following left thoracotomies. “In my view, the stress of everything together has precipitated this arrhythmic cardiac arrest in a lady who was not known to have any previous arrhythmia problems.” According to Wilcox, Davis had achondroplasia, a bone growth disorder that results in dwarfism, which was “complicated by very severe spinal problems” requiring multiple surgeries from 2016. The coroner said: “In my view, if this compression hadn’t occurred, Ms Davis simply wouldn’t have been so unwell. She wouldn’t have needed two lots of major surgeries.” She commended the “excellent care” provided by the hospital, noting that it was “frankly heartbreaking” that the surgery itself was successful only for complications to arise and to cause her death. Upon her death last year, Samantha Davis wasdescribed by her husbandas “the greatest love of his life”. Speaking about his wife, he said: “She was a unique character, always seeing the sunny side of life. She had a wicked sense of humour and always laughed at my bad jokes. “Without Sammy, there would have been no Tenable quizshow, no Willow series. No Idiot Abroad series 3.” Warwick Davis said Samantha was his “most trusted confidante and an ardent supporter of everything I did in my career” and that having her by his side felt “like having a superpower”. He dedicated his Bafta film fellowship award to his wife during an emotional tribute at the ceremony in February. Additional reporting: PA Media",

    "title": "Senior Labour figures call for review of Chinese investment in UK infrastructure",
    "article_text": "Senior Labour figures have urged the government to review Chinese investment in UK infrastructure in the wake of theBritish Steel crisis, warning that a rapprochement with Beijing could risk national security. Government officials insisted on Monday the country remained open to funding from Chinese companies even after a dramatic weekend during which ministerswrested controlof the Scunthorpe steelmaking plant from the Chinese owners, Jingye. Both Downing Street and the Treasury said they believed the row over the Scunthorpe plant to be an isolated commercial dispute, even though the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, hasnot ruled outdeliberate Chinese sabotage. But ministers are now coming under mounting pressure to reconsider their drive to secure further infrastructure investment fromChina, including from members of their own party. Helena Kennedy, the Labour peer and co-chair of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (Ipac), said: “There should be an urgent security review of all those Chinese companies operating within our infrastructure which could pose a threat to our national interests – and maybe not just confined to China.” She added: “This fiasco shows the risks, but there are also many which affect our digital infrastructure and technological progress – and our very intelligence arrangements.” Liam Byrne, the Labour MP who chairs the business select committee, said: “We must now be fiercely vigilant about just who is granted the keys to the industries and infrastructure that keep our nation moving. “Not every investor comes with goodwill in their heart, and not every cheque is written with our interests in mind. Economic security can no longer be an afterthought because some now investing in Britain are seeking more than profit from our nation – they are seeking power over our nation.” One Labour frontbencher added: “Serious supply-chain analysis, driven by security, is still lacking. We don’t do it enough or clearly enough and it should be the guiding analysis that drives our industrial strategy.” George Magnus, an associate at the China Centre at Oxford University, said: “We should be running the rule much more carefully over any inward investment coming from China.” The government has attempted to smooth over any friction with Beijing over what has happened at Scunthorpe in the last week. Downing Street on Monday said Jingye, the Beijing-based steelmaking conglomerate, had not “acted in good faith” after it emerged the company had been negotiating over a government bailout while also trying to sell raw supplies destined for the plant. That revelation prompted the government to pass anemergency lawover the weekend to give ministers the power to interfere in how the company is run – a power they have now used to pay for the raw supplies in question. Two shipments of coal and iron ore will be unloaded from vessels docked at Immingham, 30 miles to the east of Scunthorpe, on Tuesday, with another ship making its way to the UK. Ministers say the shipments will help keep the site’s two blast furnaces running without cooling down so much they cannot be restarted. They have not ruled out however having to clean one of the furnaces using a process known as a “salamander tap”, which would take it temporarily out of operation and could make it difficult to restart. Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister, said during a visit to Scunthorpe on Monday: “We’ve got the raw materials, they’ve been paid for, and we’re confident that the furnaces will continue to fire.” Despite government anger over Jingye’s actions, however, both No 10 and the Treasury said they believed this to have been a one-off issue with a private company rather than a sign of the broader risks of Chinese infrastructure investment. A spokesperson for the prime minister said: “We’re not aware of any deliberate acts of sabotage. But as the business sector, and I think the industry minister, said over the weekend, in the talks that we were engaging with the Chinese owners, it became clear that they wanted to shut the blast furnaces. “Obviously this relates to a commercial Chinese company, rather than a state-owned company.” James Murray, the Treasury minister, echoed that message, telling Times Radio: “We are open to [Chinese] investment, whilst being also open-eyed about saying that when there’s foreign involvement in critical infrastructure, whatever country that comes from, we need to make sure there is a high level of scrutiny.” He added: “I think it’s important to make clear that the actions of Jingye, of one company, don’t speak to the actions of all Chinese companies.” The government has made a major push to secure Chinese investment in key parts of British infrastructure, with the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, and the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, both having made high-profile visits to China in recent months. Chinese investors already hold stakes in British water companies, airports and energy infrastructure, while the proposed nuclear power plant at Bradwell B in Essex is being developed in part by China General Nuclear Power. Douglas Alexander, the trade minister, has spent the last few days in China andHong Kong, though British officials would not say whether he discussed the situation at Scunthorpe. Downing Street said Alexander did raise the case of Wera Hobhouse, the Liberal Democrat MP who wasdenied entry to Hong Kong last week. But while Alexander expressed “deep concern” over the incident, the Hong Kong administration later put out a statement defending the decision, saying: “It is the duty of immigration officer to ask questions to ascertain that there is no doubt about the purpose of any visit.”",

    "title": "UK’s oldest Indian restaurant faces closure in dispute with crown estate",
    "article_text": "It has been a fixture of British-Indian dining since it first opened its doors in April 1926 on the day of Elizabeth II’s birth, serving guests over the decades ranging from Marlon Brando to the late Queen herself. Yet despite surviving the Blitz and London’s relentlessly competitive restaurant sector, a dispute with the current monarch’s property developer threatens the survival of London’s oldest Indianrestaurantjust short of its 100th anniversary. Thecrown estate, which owns Victory House, the listed building housing the Michelin-stared Veeraswamy restaurant near Piccadilly Circus, has said that it cannot continue to extend its lease against the backdrop of plans to refurbish and upgrade offices in the same property. Veeraswamy’s co-owner Ranjit Mathrani is now heading to the high court to attempt to have the lease extended. He intends to lodge objections to the plans. Mathrani is also sure that the royal family would be unhappy to hear what is being done in their name to a restaurant long regarded as the grand dame of British-Indian food. He said: “They believe in history, in living history, and that’s what this restaurant is. It’s not just a museum, and I think they would be disappointed that an institution bearing their name would be so heartless.” At lunchtime on Monday, diners waxed lyrical about the restaurant’s heritage and current menu, which includes classics such as patiala shahi raan en croute, a Welsh lamb shank slow-cooked for six hours before being wrapped in pastry and grilled in a tandoor. The same menu includes photos of its historical equivalents, which included wartime offerings of lobster mayonnaise, jugged hare and sherry trifle. While the fare has evolved and sought to keep pace with modern British-Indian cooking, celebrity guests have remained constant. One diner said: “It’s just a really lovely place and for as long as I can remember there’s always been a sort of excitement about it. It was a few years ago but I can remember coming here and the Prince of Wales was in another part of the restaurant. They had curtains drawn but there was a buzz.” Established in 1926 by Edward Palmer, the great-grandson of the first governor general of India’s private secretary and a north Indian Moghul princess, the restaurant was intended to “educate” Londoners about Indian food decades before the era of celebrity chefs. It was sold in 1934 to an MP, Sir William Steward, who made it a fashionable rendezvous among royalty and British elites returning from India. After a period of decline in the 1980s, it was bought by Mathrani and Namita Panjabi, who poured resources into recreating its past glories. In 2008, the restaurant catered for a function held by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace and it was invited back to launch the UK-India 2017 Year of Culture. In 2016, it was awarded a Michelin star. Nevertheless, modern commercial motivations are now a factor in its future. The crown estate, the royals’ ancient portfolio of land and property across England and Wales, wants to take back the restaurant because it plans to extend a ground-floor reception area for offices upstairs in the building that houses Veeraswamy. Knocking into the restaurants’s entrance area, where a uniformed usher greets visitors, would give an extra 11 sq metres. The crown estate said in a statement issued this week that it needed to carry out a comprehensive refurbishment of Victory House. “This includes a major upgrade to the offices and improving the entrance to make it more accessible,” it added. “Due to the limited options available in this listed building we need to remove the entrance to the restaurant, which means we will not be able to offer Veeraswamy an extension when their lease expires.”",

    "title": "Dangerous inmates should not have access to prison kitchen, union chair says",
    "article_text": "Inmates in the jail where three guards were allegedly attacked by the brother of the Manchester Arena bomber were allowed in a kitchen with knives despite being assessed as being so dangerous they should be isolated from other prisoners, according to claims by a union official. The prime suspect for the attack is Hashem Abedi, 28, brother of the Manchester Arena bomber. The attacker used a makeshift sharp weapon fashioned out of metal during the sustained attack, as well as cooking fat. One officer suffered third degree burns. After the incident, the government announced measures to increase safety in the facility, one of which was thebanning of some of the most dangerous offendersfrom the prison cooking area. Mark Fairhurst, national chair of the Prison Officers’ association (POA), said staff were furious, and many had been traumatised by the injuries their colleagues had suffered, with two still in hospital. He said inmates had access to meals in keeping with their dietary requirements, and should not have been allowed access to a kitchen where dangerous utensils were stored. Fairhurst said: “You are giving them the resources to fashion weapons and attack staff. Especially the ideological prisoners, who will not change.” The union had repeatedly called for stab vests for its members. One guard is said to have suffered five stab wounds to their torso, damage which the POA said could have been limited by the availability of vests. The Guardian understands that also housed in the unit wasAnjem Choudary,serving life imprisonment after being convicted in 2024 of directing a terrorist organisation, membership of a proscribed organisation, and encouraging support for a terrorist organisation. He is believed to have been in the prison gym at the time of the attack, and in 2016was convicted of supporting Islamic State. Counter-terrorism police are leading the investigation into the attacks, with the separation unit used to house extremist prisoners believed to pose a danger of radicalising others. Detectives have been able to speak to the three prison officers who were attacked, but only briefly to the two male ones who suffered the worst injuries and who as of Monday, were still in hospital. Their lives are not believed to be in danger, and the injured female prison officer has been released. Fairhurst said: “Staff are traumatised and angry. It has affected them as they were such horrific assaults on their colleagues.” One line of inquiry is whether the attacks were premeditated. Fairhurst said that until the weekend, Abedi had shown no signs of trouble, and that detectives were searching the jail for where the metal used to make the knife-like weapon came from, alongside any Islamist propaganda. After the attacks, the prison service suspended permission for inmates on separation units to access kitchens and the sharp equipment they contain. The Ministry of Justice, responsible for prisons in England and Wales, would not say where Abedi is located. Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion The suspect for the attacks, Abedi, is understood not to be under formal arrest, though he is under investigation. This avoids detectives being under time limits to complete vital stages of their investigation, and any risk their suspect poses is mitigated as he is already behind bars and is also isolated. Families of five of the victims of the 2017 Manchester Arena bomb – Megan Hurley, Eilidh Macleod, Chloe Rutherford, Liam Curry, and Kelly Brewster – wrote to the government describing their “absolute disbelief” at the attack, demanding Abedi be placed in permanent solitary confinement. The BBCreported the letter, which said: “He should not be allowed any privileges whatsoever while serving a sentence for the deaths of 22 innocent lives and the injuring of many more. “He should not have access to anything that he can weaponise, such as hot oil or items he can turn into blades.” Keir Starmer’s official spokesperson said: “The prime minister is appalled by the attack that we saw at the weekend, and his thoughts with the officers involved. It’s clear that something went terribly wrong in the management of this offender and the government has committed to carry out an investigation to urgently get answers.” A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said:“We’ve already taken immediate action to suspend access to kitchens in separation and close supervision centres. We will also launch a full independent review into how this attack was able to happen.”",

    "title": "US begins inquiry into pharmaceutical and chip imports in bid to impose tariffs",
    "article_text": "TheTrump administrationis kicking off investigations into imports of pharmaceuticals and semiconductors as part of a bid to impose tariffs on both sectors on national security grounds, notices posted to the Federal Register on Monday showed. The filings scheduled to be published on Wednesday set a 21-day deadline from that date for the submission of public comment on the issue and indicate the administration intends to pursue the levies under authority granted by the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. Such inquiries need to be completed within 270 days after being announced. The administration ofDonald Trumphas started 232 investigations into imports of copper and lumber, and inquiries completed in the US president’s first term formed the basis for tariffs rolled out since his return to the White House in January on steel and aluminum and on the auto industry. The US began collecting 10% tariffs on imports on 5 April. Pharmaceuticals and semiconductors are exempt from those duties, but Trump has said they will face separate tariffs. Trump said on Sunday he would be announcing a tariff rate on imported semiconductors over the next week, adding that there would be flexibility with some companies in the sector. The US relies heavily on chips imported from Taiwan, something then president Joe Biden sought to reverse by granting billions in Chips Act awards to lure chipmakers to expand production in the United States. The investigation announced on Monday will include both pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical ingredients as well as other derivative products, the notice showed. Drugmakers have argued that tariffs could increase the chance of shortages and reduce access for patients. Still, Trump has pushed for the fees, arguing that the US needs more drug manufacturing so it does not have to rely on other countries for its supply of medicines. Companies in the industry have lobbied Trump to phase in tariffs on imported pharmaceutical products in hopes of reducing the sting from the charges and to allow time to shift manufacturing. Large drugmakers have global manufacturing footprints, mainly in the US, Europe and Asia, and moving more production to the US involves a major commitment of resources and could take years.",

The vice-president ended the Ohio State football team’s visit to the White House by fumbling the team’s national championship trophy. After laudatory speeches by Donald Trump, Buckeyes coach Ryan Day and Vance on the South Lawn, the Vance – an Ohio State graduate – tried to lift the trophy. He didn’t appear to realize that the top of the trophy is detachable from its base. After a moment of struggle, the vice-president lost his grip on the two pieces. OSU running back TreVeyon Henderson, standing behind Vance, grabbed the football-shaped top of the trophy, but the base fell to the ground, forcing Vance to grasp around as it rolled away from him.

Henderson and Day helped Vance reassemble the trophy, and he later held just the top, cradling it in his arms while the players around him chuckled. As pictures and videos of Vance’s fumble spread across the internet, the vice-president tried to explain away the gaffe with self-deprecation: “I didn’t want anyone after Ohio State to get the trophy so I decided to break it,” he wrote on X. Teams who have won a major championship have traditionally been invited to the White House to celebrate their victory with the president. However, during Trump’s first term several teams were not invited or made it clear they would not attend if they were. Those teams included theNBA’s Golden State Warriors, and the United States women’s national teamafter their victoryat the 2019 Women’s World Cup. Teams have been more willing to engage with the White House during Trump’s second term though.

    "title": "‘Silicon Six’ accused of avoiding almost $278bn in US corporation taxes over 10 years",
    "article_text": "The big American tech firms known as the “Silicon Six” have been accused of paying almost $278bn (£211bn) less corporate income tax in the past decade compared with the statutory rate for US companies making the same profits. Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, Netflix, Apple andMicrosoftgenerated $11tn of revenue and $2.5tn of profits over the past 10 years. Yet they paid an average 18.8% in combined national and federal corporation taxes, compared with an average 29.7% in the US, according to the Fair Tax Foundation (FTF), which said the Silicon Six had “hardwired” tax avoidance into their business models. Analysis by the not-for-profit organisation found that if one-off repatriation tax payments in the US connected to historical tax avoidance were excluded, the average corporate income tax contribution of the six firms fell to 16.1% over the past decade. The companies had also inflated their stated tax payments by $82bn over the same period by including contingencies for tax they did not expect to pay, the report claimed. Paul Monaghan, the chief executive of the FTF, said: “Our analysis would indicate that tax avoidance continues to be hardwired into corporate structures. The Silicon Six’s corporate income tax contributions are, in percentage terms, way below what sectors such as banking and energy are paying in many parts of the world.” Monaghan pointed to “aggressive tax practices” such as the contingency tax positions, while the companies also exerted “enormous political influence as well as economic power”, spending millions of dollars on lobbying governments. The report comes as the US tech companies’ influence has been highlighted by thepresence of their bossesincluding Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Apple’s Tim Cook and Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg at Donald Trump’s second inauguration. A significant tax cutfor such companies has reportedly been at the heart of discussions with the UK in its attempts to secure lower tariffs on its products exported to the US. Monaghan said that much of the Silicon Six’s overseas revenue was subject to low-level rates of corporate income tax in the US via a tax break for foreign-derived intangible income. FTF said overseas sales were also subject to lower rates of income tax because of a combination of lower profit margins and booking profits in low-tax jurisdictions. Netflix had the lowest rate of tax actually paid compared with profit booked, at 14.7%, while Microsoft paid 20.4%. FTF said Amazon had the worst tax conduct based on the factors such as the total amount of tax paid and “obvious profit shifting” – such asbooking a sizeable portion of its UK incomein low-tax Luxembourg. However, Amazon’s corporate tax rate was 19.6%, well ahead of Netflix, Meta (15.4%) and Apple (18.4%). A spokesperson forAmazonsaid its UK retail revenues, associated expenses, profits and taxes were recorded in the UK, and reported and paid directly to HM Revenue and Customs. They said: “Governments write the tax laws and Amazon is doing the very thing these laws encourage companies to do – paying all taxes due while also investing billions in creating jobs and infrastructure. Since 2010, we have invested more than $1.2tn in the US and over €250bn [£215bn] in Europe. Coupled with low margins, this investment will naturally result in a lower cash tax rate, particularly when measured as a percentage of revenue.” A spokesperson forMetasaid: “We follow international and local tax rules, ensuring that we pay all taxes required in each of the countries where we operate.” ANetflixspokesperson said: “Governments determine tax rules and rates – and companies comply with them. Netflix complies with the relevant tax rules and regulations in every country in which we operate.” Microsoft,Alphabetand Apple were all approached for comment.",

    "title": "Mohsen Mahdawi, Palestinian green card holder and Columbia student, detained by Ice",
    "article_text": "Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian green card holder and student atColumbia University, was apprehended by US immigration authorities in Vermont on Monday, according to his lawyers and a video of the incident. Mahdawi, who was a leader of the pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia last spring, was arrested by Ice on Monday morning in Colchester,Vermont, while he was attending a naturalization interview, his lawyer said in a statement to the Guardian. “We have not received confirmation as to his whereabouts despite numerous attempts to locate him,” his attorney, Luna Droubi, said. “We have filed a habeas petition in the District of Vermont and have sought a temporary restraining order restraining the government from removing him from the jurisdiction or from the country.” Droubi said “the Trump administration detained Mohsen Mahdawi in direct retaliation for his advocacy on behalf of Palestinians and because of his identity as a Palestinian”, adding that “his detention is an attempt to silence those who speak out against the atrocities in Gaza. It is also unconstitutional.” The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Guardian. Thepetition, submitted by his lawyers on Monday, argues that Mahdawi’s arrest and detention violates his first amendment rights, his statutory rights and due process rights. In the court documents, Mahdawi’s attorneys state that he is a lawful permanent resident of the US, currently on the path to naturalization, and has held a green card for the past 10 years. They assert that this case “concerns the government’s retaliatory and targeted detention and attempted removal of Mr Mahdawi for his constitutionally protected speech”. According to the court filing, Mahdawi was born and raised in a refugee camp in the West Bank, where he lived until he moved to the US in 2014. He became a lawful permanent resident of the US in 2015. He is a student of Columbia University, with an expected graduation date of May 2025. Mahdawi plans to return to the school as he has been accepted into a master’s program at Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs, which will begin this fall, according to the court documents. As a student at Columbia, his lawyers say that he was “an outspoken critic of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza and an activist and organizer in student protests on Columbia’s campus until March of 2024, after which he took a step back and has not been involved in organizing”. On Monday morning, Mahdawi’s attorneys say he was arrested and detained by Department of Homeland Security agents, even though he is a lawful permanent resident, his lawyers wrote. His lawyers say in the filing that it appears as though Mahdawi is facing deportationunder the rarely invoked provision that the administrationhas recently used in other cases, such as in their efforts to deportMahmoud Khalil. The provision gives the secretary of state the right toremove individuals from the US if their presence isdeemed to pose “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States”. On Monday afternoon the Vermont senators Bernie Sanders and Peter Welch, along with Vermont representative Becca Balint, issued a statement on the arrest. “Earlier today, Mohsen Mahdawi of White River Junction, Vermont, walked into an immigration office for what was supposed to be the final step in his citizenship process,” they said. “Instead, he was arrested and removed in handcuffs by plain-clothed, armed, individuals with their faces covered. “These individuals refused to provide any information as to where he was being taken or what would happen to him. This is immoral, inhumane, and illegal. Mr Mahdawi, a legal resident of the United States, must be afforded due process under the law and immediately released from detention.” In avideo being shared onlineof the arrest, Mahdawi is seen in handcuffs being walked out of a building and put into a car by officers. Mahdawi was profiled by Canary Mission, an online database that publishes the names and personal information of people that it considers to be anti-Israel or antisemitic. Last month, the group included Mahdawi in a list on their website titled “Uncovering Foreign Nationals”.",

Israel bombed one of the last working hospitals in Gaza on Sunday, meaning more Palestinians with routine health conditions might now face death.

    "title": "US attacks on Yemen killed 123 people since mid-March: Health authorities",
    "article_text": "The United States’ bombardment campaign in Yemen has killed at least 123 people – mostly civilians – since mid-March, health officials in the capital Sanaa say. Yemen’s Ministry of Health said on Monday that US attacks have also injured 247 others, stressing that the victims include many women and children. Civilians have been targeted,families wiped out, military sites destroyed and soldiers killed. US President Donald Trumphas vowedthat the Houthis will be “completely annihilated” under daily strikes by the United States military. Washington says its campaign aims to stop Houthi attacks against Israel as well as shipping lanes in the Red Sea. However, the Yemeni group has pledged to continue its military operations until Israel ends its war andsiege on Gazain solidarity with Palestinians. Trump has been suggesting that the Houthi group – also known as Ansar Allah – has been severely weakened. But the Yemeni group says the US offensive has proven to be a failure and is only targeting civil officials and civilian infrastructure. On Sunday, a US strike targeted a ceramic factory in Sanaa province,killing six peopleand injuring 30 others, according to the Health Ministry. “We hold the American administration fully responsible for its continuing crimes and massacres against civilian dignitaries and civilians and its direct and repeated bombardment of infrastructure, industrial facilities and civil officials,” the ministry said. On Monday, the Houthi-affiliated Al Masirah TV reported more US attacks, including 15 strikes in the Marib governorate. Despite the US campaign,the Iran-aligned Houthis– who present themselves as Yemen’s official armed forces – said on Sunday that they fired two missiles at Israel and launched a separate drone attack against a “vital” target on the Israeli coast. “The Israeli enemy, along with the Americans, must realise that beloved Yemen – its leadership, people, and army – will not back down from its steadfast position in supporting and backing the oppressed Palestinian people … regardless of the repercussions and the outcomes,” the Yemeni group said in a statement. The Houthi attack triggered sirens in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv on Sunday, but the Israeli army said it detected and intercepted one missile, not two. Hamas praised the latest attack, with the spokesperson of its military branch, Abu Obeida, saying that Palestinians will not forget the “honourable” stance of the Yemeni group. “The honest brothers in Yemen continue to insist on paralysing the heart of the Zionist entity, standing by Gaza, which is being subjected to afierce genocide, despite paying a heavy price with their precious blood and their country’s resources,” Abu Obeida said in a statement.",

    "title": "Hungary approves constitutional change banning LGBTQ+ events",
    "article_text": "Hungary’s parliament has approved a constitutional amendment allowing the government to ban all public events organised by LGBTQ+ groups. Passed on Monday, the amendment formalises a law introduced earlier this year that bans such gatherings, including Budapest’s annual Pride March. It’s seen by critics as another authoritarian lurch by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s right-wing government. Human rights activists and some legal scholars have condemned the law, arguing that it effectively criminalises LGBTQ+ expression in public spaces. Orban’s government has consistently argued that the legislation defends traditional family values and protects children. The amendment passed with 140 votes in favour and 21 against, backed exclusively by MPs from Orban’s ruling Fidesz-KDNP coalition. It required a two-thirds majority to become law. Ahead of the legislative session, opposition lawmakers and demonstrators attempted to prevent access to parliament’s parking area. Protesters, who had bound themselves with zip ties, were forcibly removed by police. The revised constitutional text asserts that a child’s right to moral, physical, and spiritual development takes precedence over all rights except the right to life. Critics say this phrasing is aimed at limiting freedom of assembly. The new amendment enshrines into the constitution “child protection” legislation, which prohibits the “depiction or promotion” of homosexuality to minors. It also states that the constitution recognises two sexes, male and female, adding to an earlier amendment that prohibits same-sex adoption by insisting that a mother is a woman and a father is a man. By giving this law constitutional status, the government strengthens its legal footing and potentially shields it from future legal challenges, including those from European Union institutions. Budapest Pride, which has drawn thousands in recent years, now faces uncertainty under the new framework. Organisers have not yet commented on whether the 2025 event will proceed.",

    "title": "Nvidia commits to $500bn AI server production in the US",
    "article_text": "ChipmakerNvidiasays it plans to build artificial intelligence servers worth as much as $500bn in the United States over the next four years with help from partners such as TSMC. Nvidia is the latest US tech firm to back a push by President Donald Trump’s administration for local manufacturing. Monday’s announcement includes the production of its Blackwell AI chips at TSMC’s factory in Phoenix, Arizona, and supercomputer manufacturing plants in Texas by Foxconn and Wistron, which are expected to ramp up in 12 to 15 months. “Adding American manufacturing helps us better meet the incredible and growing demand for AI chips and supercomputers, strengthens our supply chain and boosts our resiliency,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said. “Manufacturing AI chips and supercomputers in the US will create hundreds of thousands of jobs in the coming decades,” Nvidia said in a statement. Huang had said in March that Nvidia sees little short-term impact from higher US tariffs but would move production to the US in the longer term without giving a timeline. According to an analysis from the Yale Budget Lab, tariffs could cause 740,000 people to lose their jobs across the US economy by the end of the year. Nvidia’s announcement aligns the AI chip giant – whose processors are mostly made in Taiwan – with a clutch of tech firms that have pledged to bring manufacturing back to the US amid threats of steep tariffs from Trump. The Trump administration touted the move. “Onshoring these industries is good for the American worker, good for the American economy, and good for American national security – and the best is yet to come,” the White House said in a statement. “It is unlikely Nvidia would have moved any production to the US if it was not for pressure from the Trump administration,” DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria told the news agency Reuters. “The half a trillion number is likely hyperbole in the same way Apple made a half a trillion promise.” Apple, which assembles most of its iPhones in China, made a$500bn investment commitmentto expand in the US. In February, the Silicon Valley-based tech giant said it would open a new manufacturing facility in Houston, Texas. While Apple’s investment would be the largest it has made, the company made similar commitments under both President Joe Biden in 2021 of $430bn and during Trump’s first term in 2018 of $350bn. Nvidia’s announcement came three days after Trumpexempted electronics such as smartphonesand chips from his reciprocal tariffs on China, but the White House said it would be announcing a new tariff rate on imported chips over the next week. The exemptions indicate an increasing awareness within the Trump administration of the pain that the tariffs could inflict on inflation-weary US consumers as well as on the booming AI industry, which relies on chip-related tools from China and Taiwan. Nvidia said on Monday that TSMC has started production of its latest generation of chips at its Arizona factory. Despite the announcement, the move has not quelled investor fears. As of noon in New York (16:00 GMT), the chipmaker’s stock was trading down 0.8 percent.",

    "title": "‘Forgive me, Mama’: A Gaza mother’s agony for a son Israel killed",
    "article_text": "Mawasi Khan Younis, Gaza– Her son’s final words haunt Ghalia Radwan. “Forgive me, mama,” the 24-year-old said as he lay dying, shot by Israeli soldiers while he was on a rescue mission on March 23, which he recorded until his last breath. He wanted her forgiveness for the pain his death would cause, knowing that she had worried about him every day since he had become a paramedic. “I forgive you, son,” Ghalia has whispered tearfully countless times since then, knowing that Rifaat had wanted his conscience clear before he died in southern Gaza with 14 other emergency workers. She hopes he knows she would always forgive him. On the morning of March 22, Ghalia woke up later than usual and rushed to see Rifaat before he left for work. But he had already left, and her heart filled with dread. “I had kept looking over at him the night before as he was sleeping for some reason,” she says. The night of March 21 was unremarkable. Rifaat came home in time to break his Ramadan fast with his family in the displacement tent they live in. After the simple iftar meal, he talked with his parents a bit and then went to sleep. “Even though I miss him terribly and always look forward to him getting home so we could chat, we always made sure not to tire him with talk or staying up late,” Rifaat’s father, 52-year-old Anwar Radwan, says. Ghalia agrees: “I just would wash his clothes and prepare his sleeping spot, so he could go to work rested.” She’s not sure but believes Rifaat woke up around dawn for suhoor, the daily meal before fasting begins during Ramadan, and was picked up by 6am by his colleagues to go to work. He didn’t come home after that shift, spending the night at the first responders centre instead. On March 23, the family was told Rifaat was one of 15 Palestine Red Crescent Society and Civil Defence rescue workers who were missing and feared ambushed by Israeli soldiers. That news launched the family into eight days of tormented waiting, praying and hoping that Rifaat would be found alive. “I would pace back and forth, crying, praying and pleading with God, while constantly calling the Red Crescent,” Ghalia says of the wait while Palestinian authorities tried to get Israel to agree to a search operation. “Each time they told us Israeli coordination had been denied, I would faint from the sheer pain.” On the morning of Eid al-Fitr, the family got a call from the Red Crescent that Israeli permission had finally been granted for search teams to enter the area. “I wouldn’t wish those agonising hours of waiting on any mother in the world,” Ghalia says. There is no internet coverage in the family’s tent, so Anwar would have to go to an internet point in the camp to check for updates. He came back to the tent at one point and said the Red Crescent had found two bodies, then rushed out again, leaving Ghalia praying desperately that Rifaat was not among them The next time Anwar came back, he said four bodies had been recovered and rushed off again. On his third trip back, he said they had recovered six bodies, including Rifaat’s. “I felt like a dagger pierced my heart, but I resigned myself to God’s will, and we went to the hospital.” At the hospital, the families of the other paramedics were waiting for their loved ones’ bodies to arrive. “We all rushed towards the ambulances, crying. Emergency workers were weeping bitterly as they bid farewell to their colleagues.” As excruciating as the wait for news was, it was nothing compared with watching the video Rifaat had recorded of his last moments, which was found after his body was. Over about 20 minutes, Rifaat can be heard speaking about the mission they were on. An ambulance that had gone to the Tal as-Sultan area of southern Gaza to rescue survivors of an Israeli bombing had disappeared about 4am on March 23. Another ambulance that went out to find it radioed back to base to say the missing colleagues seemed to have been shot, and two more ambulances were sent out to help them. Rifaat was in one. His video clearly shows the worry in the ambulance and the fact that all the emergency vehicles – including a Civil Defence firetruck – were clearly marked and had their lights on, not off as Israel initially claimed as it tried to justify killing 15 emergency workers and burying them and their vehicles. In the video, Ghalia was able to hear as her son spotted the bodies of his colleagues and see everyone in the ambulance rush out to help them as they were wearing clearly identifiable uniforms. Then came the sound of gunfire, and Rifaat fell to the ground as the visuals were obscured and only his voice remained as he repeated the shahada, the Islamic declaration of faith, and begged his mother to forgive him. “Forgive me, mama,” he said. “I wanted to help people. Forgive me.” Both declarations are tied to Rifaat’s faith. The shahada is the most important declaration and prayer recited by Muslims. They also say it on their deathbeds to reaffirm their faith. Muslims believe that the path to heaven is through their parents and through having lived a good life and not harming anyone, and Rifaat wanted to die knowing that his mother would forgive him in death. “Rifaat knew how deeply attached I was to him and how I constantly worried about him, so his last words were asking for my forgiveness because he knew losing him would break my heart,” Ghalia tells Al Jazeera, her eyes brimming with tears. “My son was beautiful and charming. I adored him. He was handsome, generous and giving without limits,” Ghalia says. Anwar remembers a child who always ran after ambulances, firetrucks, bulldozers, anything with flashing emergency lights and a siren. “[Rifaat] loved emergency work, and when he finished high school, he chose that path.” Ghalia worried when Rifaat chose emergency medical services, joining the Palestine Red Crescent Society in October 2023 when Israel’s war on Gaza began but relented when Rifaat showed how determined he was. “He said the same thing to me then that he said in his final moments: ‘Mama, I want to help people.’” Throughout Israel’s war, Ghalia constantly feared for Rifaat’s safety, warning him and begging him to stay safe. Whenever he came home after a difficult day, Rifaat would tell his mother what he had seen as he tried to rescue people. “I would wash his blood-soaked uniform while he apologised and told me how he retrieved the remains of children, women and men from beneath the rubble,” she said. “He was often devastated, but he never gave up.” Rifaat had dreamed of continuing his studies abroad, to learn more about emergency response and return to Gaza to bring his education home to give back to people, Ghalia says. “[He was also] our sole breadwinner due to his father’s illness until he completely exhausted his bank account one day. “I broke down crying, but he reassured me and said it was fine, that I shouldn’t be sad about the money.” There’s pride in Ghalia when she talks about her son, taking comfort in the fact that he sacrificed himself to serve and help others. “My son Rifaat’s message will live on, and I will raise my younger sons to follow in his footsteps and become paramedics,” Ghalia says, referring to her sons Abdul Jawwad, 13, and Suleiman, 11. “Rifaat left us a noble message and an everlasting impact,” she adds. “I always think of him whenever I see the flowers and plants he planted around our tent.”",

    "title": "Qatar, Egypt leaders renew support for Gaza ceasefire, reconstruction plan",
    "article_text": "Egypt and Qatar, the leading intermediaries in talks to end the war on the Gaza Strip, have expressed “grave concern” over the escalation of violence and deaths in the Israeli-besieged and -bombarded Palestinian territory, stressing continuing efforts to achieve a ceasefire. In a joint statement released on Monday during a visit by Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to Qatar, Cairo and Doha reiterated their support for the Arab-backed Gazareconstruction plan. The assertion comes in the face of calls by the United States and Israel for depopulating the territory, which critics and rights groups have called ethnic cleansing. The two countries also announced their intention to organise an international conference in Egypt “in cooperation with regional and international partners, to coordinate humanitarian and development efforts to ensure improved living conditions for the Palestinian people in the Strip”. Later on Monday, an official said Hamas rejected a ceasefire proposal conveyed by Egypt that would require the Palestinian group to disarm. The initiative calls for 45 days of calm that would see the release of the remaining Israeli captives in exchange for allowing food and shelter into Gaza, the unidentifiedHamas officialtold Al Jazeera Arabic. “Our negotiating delegation was surprised that the proposal conveyed by Egypt includes explicit text about disarming the resistance,” the source said. “Egypt informed us that there will be no agreement to stop the war without negotiating the disarmament of the resistance”. The official added that the group stressed to Egypt that the key to reaching an agreement is the full Israeli withdrawal and ending the war on Gaza, not disarming Hamas. For its part, the Egyptian-Qatari statement stressed the need to “ensure the delivery of urgent humanitarian aid to civilians, and support reconstruction efforts” in Gaza. Qatar and Egypt emphasised the “centrality of the Palestinian cause for Arabs”, calling for the establishment of a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders – in Gaza and the occupied West Bank – with East Jerusalem as its capital. El-Sisi met with Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, days after US PresidentDonald Trumprenewed his call for removing all Palestinians from Gaza. With full US support, Israel resumed its assault on Gaza last month and imposed a total siege on the territory, cutting off all food and medical supplies to Palestinians there. Israel and Hamas had agreed a three-phased ceasefire in January, leading to a six-week pause in the fighting. But after the end of the first stage, which saw Hamas release dozens of Israeli captives, Israel refused to negotiate over the second phase of the agreement or commit to a permanent end to the war. Since restarting the offensive, Israel has killed more than 1,600 Palestinians, regularly targetingmedical facilities, civilian shelters and aid workers. On Monday, an Israeli attack on Gaza City’s Tuffah neighbourhood killed at least six civilians, according to the Palestinian news agency Wafa. Separately, Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum reported that a barrage of air strikes hit the Israeli-designated “safe area” al-Mawasi in southern Gaza, killing at least one person. In addition to its bombardments, Israel has again been forcibly displacing Palestinians in their thousands. On Saturday, the Israeli military announced the establishment of a new “corridor” to cut off Rafah, the southernmost city in Gaza, from the rest of the territory, raising fears that Israel may be looking to annex the area. Since the start of the war in October 2023, the Israeli military has killed at least50,983 Palestiniansin Gaza, according to health authorities in the territory. Thousands more have gone missing and are presumed to be dead under the rubble. The Gaza Ministry of Health said at least 38 people were killed by Israeli attacks on Sunday. United Nations experts and leading rights groups have accused Israel of carrying outa genocideagainst Palestinians. The Gaza Government Media Office on Monday accused Israel of imposing a policy of “systemic starvation” against Palestinians and rejected plans for Israel to control the distribution of humanitarian assistance – a task currently undertaken by aid groups and United Nations agencies. “We warn against the plan that the Israeli occupation is trying to pursue by establishing or using security companies and suspicious parties to distribute humanitarian aid,” the office said. It added that the plan aims to advance Israel’s “colonial agenda” under the guise of humanitarian aid. Last year, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over alleged war crimes in Gaza, including using starvation as a weapon of war.",

    "title": "Lebanese PM visits Syria’s president to reset years of strained relations",
    "article_text": "Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam has held talks in Damascus with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, in his first official visit to Syria, in an effort to recalibrate relations between the two nations, which have been strained for decades. The diplomatic shuttle on Monday marks the highest-level Lebanese delegation visiting Syria since Beirut’s new government took office in February, following the ouster of former Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad by opposition forces. A Lebanese official, speaking to the AFP news agency anonymously as they were not authorised to brief the media, described the visit as “key to correcting the course of ties between the two countries on the basis of mutual respect”. Senior Al Jazeera correspondent Zeina Khodr, reporting from Damascus on a pivotal moment for Lebanon-Syria relations, said, “No doubt this is a significant visit. Lebanese officials say that this is an opportunity to correct the trajectory of the relationship between the two countries.” The two nations have long faced strained ties marked by “conflict, friction and tension”, Khodr noted. “There was a time when Bashar al-Assad was in power. Syria was accused of interfering in Lebanon’s internal affairs in dictating domestic policy in Lebanon,” she said, recalling Syria’s years of military presence in the neighbouring country and Hezbollah’s support for al-Assad during Syria’s civil war. Recent political shifts in both countries have opened new possibilities. “New authorities are now in Damascus and there is also a new government in Lebanon … al-Assad is out of power, and his ally, Hezbollah in Lebanon, is no longer the dominant player,” Khodr said, adding that all this has led to a mutual desire to “reset bilateral relations”. After the talks concluded and the Lebanese delegation left Damascus, Salam posted on X: “My visit to Damascus today aims to open a new page in the history of relations between the two countries, based on mutual respect, restoring trust, good neighbourliness, preserving the sovereignty of our two countries, and non-interference in each other’s internal affairs. Lebanon’s prime minister also noted that “Discussions with President Ahmed al-Sharaa focused among other issues on border and crossing control, preventing smuggling, and ultimately demarcating the land and sea borders.” Relations between Lebanon and Syria have remained tense since al-Assad’s fall. Additionally, both countries have been regularly bombarded by Israel. In Lebanon’s case, that has come in spite of the November ceasefire that ended a year-long war. Monday’s talks focused on border security, including efforts to combat smuggling and demarcate the 330km (205-mile) border. Last month, Lebanon and Syria’s defence ministers signed a security agreement in Saudi Arabia following deadly border clashes that left 10 dead. Beirut was also expected to push for a joint investigation into past political killings in Lebanon linked to Syria’s former leadership. Accompanied by senior ministers, Salam discussed the repatriation of Syrian refugees, with Lebanon estimating it hosts 1.5 million Syrians, though the United Nations has registered only 750,000. Before departing from Syria, Salam said he would also raise the issue of Lebanese detainees who vanished in Syrian prisons under al-Assad’s rule. This visit follows a December meeting between al-Sharaa and former Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati, the first such encounter since Syria’s civil war began in 2011. Al-Sharaa had pledged in December that Damascus would respect Lebanon’s sovereignty.",

    "title": "Sudan war to enter third year as RSF assaults in Darfur intensify",
    "article_text": "The United Nations and rights groups are calling for an end to the violencein Sudanas the second anniversary of its civil war looms and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has intensified its attacks in Darfur, killing dozens of people in recent days. As representatives from dozens of countries are to meet in London on Tuesday to try to resolve the Sudan crisis, Human Rights Watch urged the international community to “urgently work to protect civilians and guarantee safe, unfettered aid provision” in the country. “For the last two years, Sudan’s warring parties have subjected the population to horrific abuses and suffering, and blocked aid, plunging the country into the world’s worst humanitarian disasters,” Mohamed Osman, Sudan researcher at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement on Monday. “International leaders should ensure that discussions to improve the humanitarian situation go hand in hand with commitments at the highest level to protect civilians.” This week marks two years since war broke out on April 15, 2023, between the RSF and the Sudanese military. It has killed thousands of people, displaced nearly 13 million people, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and sparked ahunger crisisin parts of the country. In recent weeks, the army has managed to push RSF fighters out of thecapital, Khartoum, but the paramilitary group has been claiming advances in the western region of Darfur, where an already direhumanitarian crisishas been worsening. On Sunday, the RSF said it took control of the Zamzam camp for displaced people near el-Fasher, the provincial capital of North Darfur state. The assault has killed dozens of people, including 23 children and nine aid workers, according to the UN. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) warned on Monday that the fighting near el-Fasher, which has been under an RSF blockade, is hampering access to humanitarian assistance. “Thousands of displaced people are trapped & cut off from aid,” OCHA Sudan said in a social media post. “Hostilities must stop now. All those engaged in the conflict must ensure safe passage for civilians and humanitarian access.” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had condemned the attacks on civilians in and around el-Fasher, urging an end to the fighting. “The Secretary-General emphasizes that attacks directed against civilians and indiscriminate attacks are strictly prohibited under international humanitarian law,” Guterres said in a statement issued via his spokesperson on Sunday. “Humanitarian relief personnel and medical personnel must be respected and protected. The perpetrators of these attacks must be brought to justice. Safe, unhindered and sustained access to the area, including the Zamzam camp, is urgently needed. Civilians who want to leave must be allowed to do so safely.” In a joint statement on Monday, Egypt and Qatar also expressed “grave concerns over the ongoing armed conflict in the Sudan and emphasized the importance of an immediate cessation of military operations”. But the violence continued on Monday. Al Jazeera Arabic quoted local sources in reporting that RSF fighters were shelling the Abu Shouk camp for displaced peopleoutside el-Fasher. Sudan has seen growing instability since longtime PresidentOmar al-Bashirwas removed from power in 2019 after months of antigovernment protests. In October 2021, the Sudanese military staged a coup against the civilian government of Prime MinisterAbdalla Hamdok, leading to his resignation in early 2022. Sudan’s army chief, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and his rival general Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, who leads the RSF, shared power after the coup but then started fighting for control of the state and its resources in April 2023. Davis Makori, humanitarian policy and advocacy specialist, highlighted the impact of the war on children – including psychological trauma, gender-based violence and inability to attend school – saying minors make up half of the civilians affected by the conflict. “While there are pockets of states in Sudan that are not actually active conflict zones, this humanitarian crisis has spread to almost every facet of life,” Makori told Al Jazeera.",

    "title": "It is time Liberia enacts legislation banning FGM",
    "article_text": "In 2022, the National Council of Chiefs and Elders of Liberia (NACCEL) announced a three-year moratorium on female genital mutilation (FGM). A year later, the council made another proclamation to ban FGM and then held ceremonies to end the practice in five of the 11 counties where FGM is practised. However, despite the ban, there have been continuing reports of FGM activity. In September 2024, the National Coalition Against Harmful Practices (NACAPH), a coalition of civil society actors, released a statement expressing concerns about “widespread resurgence of Female Genital Mutilation activities in various regions of Liberia”. It is now clear that the measures already taken have been ineffective. With the three-year ban having expired in February, Liberia needs to move decisively against the practice. Lawmakers must pass a law criminalising FGM, which should be accompanied by government measures to convince communities to end the practice. FGM usually involves the partial or total removal of the external female genitalia. This practice is prevalent in Liberia as it is part of the practices of the Sande Society, a powerful, traditional, secret society, which initiates girls into adulthood in bush schools. According to the United Nations, more than 50 percent of Liberian women between the ages of 15 and 49 have undergone the harmful procedure. However, the exact percentage is difficult to estimate because the secret nature of the Sande Society has resulted in FGM activities being largely underreported, as victims maintain a code of silence. There have also been instances of journalists being targeted and threatened with forceful cutting due to their reporting on FGM, which has further added to the problem of underreporting. Thus far, the fight against FGM has largely been championed by the international community and Liberia’s civil society. But the influence of the Sande Society, traditional beliefs, and patriarchy have largely prevented any attempts to take legal measures against the practice. For example, in 2016, members of Liberia’s lawmakers removed a clause banning the practice from a proposed domestic violence bill, and in 2022, a bill banning the practice was introduced in the Liberian parliament, but it did not get enough support to pass. Pressure to end the practice has resulted so far in interim measures only, which have been largely ineffective. In 2018, on her last day in office, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf signed an executive order that placed a one-year ban on FGM. This was followed by a one-year ban on the practice by NACCEL in 2019, and then the 2022 three-year moratorium and the 2023 ban. There are several problems with tasking NACCEL with the enactment and enforcement of a ban. First, a ban declared by the traditional council does not have the force of law. While the council has traditional authority and influence over the communities who engage in the practice, it remains unclear how it can hold those who breach its prohibitions accountable. Second, some of the chiefs and elders themselves encourage FGM or are not necessarily opposed to it. Third, entrusting the issue of FGM in the hands of NACCEL means that any action on it is based on the political will of whoever is in charge of the council at a given time. The enactment of a law criminalising FGM can solve all of these problems. The state and its agencies have the operational capacity to supervise and enforce a legal ban throughout Liberia. Facing the prospect of punishment would also have a more powerful effect on discouraging the practice. In addition to the law, the Liberian government should also set up a robust reporting and witness protection system to ensure FGM is adequately reported. FGM is largely a taboo topic and reporting could lead to ostracisation. Individuals who choose to inform the authorities when the law is broken should be adequately protected. The implementation of a legal ban should also go hand-in-hand with other initiatives to fight the practice. It has to be recognised that FGM is also an economic matter, as most zoes – female chiefs who traditionally lead initiation rites for the Sande Society and perform FGM – charge for the service. Ending the practice would mean a loss of livelihood for hundreds of women. Therefore, the government should also seek to expand programmes that provide zoes willing to leave behind the practice with training and skills so they can find alternative livelihoods. There is also a cultural element that needs to be recognised. The Sande bush schools have been around for centuries, and they involve various other practices, rituals, and training to prepare girls for their lives as adult women. The government needs to work with communities to ensure that these schools can continue functioning without the FGM component. The NACCEL can help in this regard and with communities accepting the criminalisation of FGM. The best time to enact a law is now, as the political will to do so is higher than it has ever been. Over the past few years, more traditional chiefs have demonstrated openness on the issue, which could influence lawmakers to vote in favour of such legislation. Liberia remains one of the few countries where FGM is endemic that does not have a law criminalising it. This is despite the fact that it is a signatory to a number of regional and international instruments, including the Maputo Protocol, that call for the end of this harmful practice. It is time for Liberia to take action to protect its girls and fulfil its international commitments to end FGM.

    "title": "Ukraine says Russia has targeted Sumy again day after 35 killed in the city",
    "article_text": "Russian forces have intensified their assault on Ukraine’s northeast, striking Sumy and other areas the day after one of the deadliest attacks in recent months killed 35 people in the city and sparked widespread condemnation. Ukraine’s Air Force said on Monday evening on Telegram that Russian troops had fired a missile at Sumy. It did not immediately report any casualties or destruction. But within 20 minutes, it issued a second update warning that Russian warplanes were dropping guided bombs on the city. Earlier, Russian shelling in eastern Ukraine killed at least four civilians, authorities confirmed. In the Kharkiv region, local officials said artillery and rockets struck the town of Kupiansk, a key railway hub briefly seized by Russian forces in 2022 and later recaptured by Ukraine. Overnight, Kharkiv — the country’s second-largest city — was also hit by renewed drone attacks, highlighting Russia’s sustained push to regain territory in the northeast Kharkiv Governor Oleh Syniehubov said a 68-year-old man and a 61-year-old woman were killed in Monday’s shelling while a rocket strike claimed the lives of a 77-year-old woman and a 52-year-old man. The attacks follow Sunday’s twin missile strike on the centre of Sumy, where Christian civilians had gathered to mark Palm Sunday before Easter. Ukrainian officials said at least35 peoplewere killed and more than 100 injured in the blast. Among the dead were two children. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attack as a deliberate targeting of civilians. He urged United States President Donald Trump in an interview on the CBS TV network’s 60 Minutes news programme to “please, before any kind of decisions, any kind of forms of negotiations, come to see people, civilians, warriors, hospitals, churches, children destroyed or dead”. Despite the heavy civilian toll, Trump, who has previously faced criticism for his perceived leniency towards Russia and its President Vladimir Putin, said he was “told they made a mistake”  regarding the Sumy attack. Speaking again on Monday alongside El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele in the White House, Trump used the word “mistake” again and blamed Zelenskyy and former US President Joe Biden because they “allowed the war to happen”. The Kremlin said it struck a military target, saying two Iskander-M tactical missiles hit a meeting of Ukrainian officers in Sumy. Moscow also blamed Kyiv for using civilians as “human shields” without providing any evidence. Russia accused Ukraine of endangering civilians by carrying out military operations in urban areas. According to Russia’s Ministry of Defence, the Sumy target was part of an operational command centre and the attack killed more than 60 Ukrainian soldiers. There has been no confirmation of that from Ukraine’s side. Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski on Monday urged Trump and his advisers to recognise that Putin is “mocking their goodwill”. Several other European Union leaders and the United Kingdom condemned Russia on Sunday. In the meantime, the Kremlin issued warnings to Germany’s incoming chancellor, Friedrich Merz, over suggestions that his government might consider sending long-range Taurus missiles to Ukraine. Merz told German media that if there was a consensus among European allies, he would support the move. “That would be one way of finally putting this country [Ukraine] strategically – to stay with the term – ahead of the situation,” he said, adding that he was not convinced that “Putin would react positively to weakness and peace offers”. Merz called the Sumy attack “a serious war crime”. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned that such a step would “inevitably lead only to a further escalation” and accused Western leaders of fuelling the war. Berlin, one of Kyiv’s top arms suppliers, has so far held back from providing Taurus missiles despite repeated Ukrainian appeals.",

    "title": "Did Trump really ‘exempt’ Chinese phones, chips from tariffs?",
    "article_text": "United States President Donald Trump has threatened new tariffs on Chinese electronic goods, three days after his administrationannounced exemptionson smartphones, laptops, flash drives and a host of other tech products from levies he has announced since April 2. Those exemptions provided relief to US tech companies reliant on Chinese manufacturing, like Apple and chip company Nvidia, which saw their stocks rise considerably after the release of Friday’s notice. Then came Monday’s announcement, which sparked criticism of Trump over hisback-and-forth tariffs– after suggestions from his opponents and some experts that he had in effect withdrawn many of the steep tariffs previously imposed on China. But the latest tariffs that the Trump administration partially rolled back on Friday are only part of the most recent levies imposed on Chinese electronics as part of an ongoing, dizzying tit-for-tat tariff dispute that has been playing out in recent weeks between the world’s two largest economies. In fact, this tense tariff tussle predates Trump’s current term and is rooted in his first stint in office and former President Joe Biden’s own imposition of duties on Chinese goods. So what tariffs did the Trump administration pull back over the weekend? Are Chinese electronics still subject to US tariffs? How much are they? And how is Trump responding to criticism of the rollback? After dramaticback-and-forth tariff hikesbetween the US and China through last week,Washington appeared to bend on Friday. Anoticeissued by US Customs and Border Protection on Friday listed more than a dozen product categories that would be exempted from the wave oftariffsthat Trump has imposed on China since April 2. They included computers, laptops, disc drives and automatic data processing equipment, products that are largely not made in the US but in China. Smartphones, memory cards, semiconductor devices, solar cells, modems, routers and flat panel displays were also included on the exemptions list. Friday’s notice specifically mentioned exemptions for these products from tariffs imposed on China on April 2, Tuesday and Wednesday. The April 2 tariffs raised the duties on all Chinese goods from 20 percent to 54 percent. On Tuesday, Trump announced another 50 percent increase, taking the total tariff rate to 104 percent. Then, a day later, after China increased tariffs on US products to 84 percent, Trump raised duties on imports from China to 145 percent. An analysis by the finance firm Capital Economics concluded that Trump did Apple CEO Tim Cook “a solid” favour with the exemptions. The exemptions covered goods that accounted for 23 percent of US imports from China, the firm concluded. After criticism of Friday’s waivers, Trump iterated that China was not being exempt from tariffs. “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook’ for the unfair Trade Balances, and Monetary Tariff Barriers, that other Countries have used against us, especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst!” Trump posted on his Truth Social media platform. Top officials also insisted that any tariff exemptions that Chinese electronics would benefit from are temporary. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told journalists Chinese electronics were now exempt from sweeping “Liberation Day” tariffs initially imposed by Trump on dozens of countries on April 2 but the goods would still face forthcoming levies that are being prepared. “[Electronics are] exempt from the reciprocal tariffs, but they’re included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,” Lutnick told ABC News on Sunday. Trump then changed that timeline – dramatically. He declared he would announce new tariffs on semiconductors from China on Monday. Not at all. The Trump administration only rolled back tariffs imposed since April 2 on select electronics. Electronics imported by the US – including iPhones, laptops and other gadgets – still face at least the 20 percent tariffs that Trump imposed on all Chinese goods from January 20, the day he took office for the second time, to April 2. On February 1, Trump imposed a 10 percent tax on all Chinese goods. He raised that by another 10 percent on March 4, bringing a baseline surcharge on Chinese goods to 20 percent. And the tariff exemption announced on Friday on semiconductor products is a bit of a mirage too. Even before Trump took office, Biden had introduced a 50 percent tariff on all Chinese semiconductors, which took effect on January 1. Trump has not removed that duty. Most electronic goods that the US imports from China, including smartphones and laptops, run on these semiconductors. It is unclear whether they too might face the brunt of the tariffs on semiconductors. Additionally, a series of Biden-era sanctions on Chinese semiconductor companies, limiting their access to high-end chips, remains in force. Trump has said he plans to impose new tariffs on Chinese electronics on Monday. He also upped the rhetoric against Beijing, saying his administration would launch a “National Security Tariff Investigation” to look into the US semiconductors supply chain and China’s role in it. China is the largest source for semiconductor chips in the world. In 2023 and 2024, the biggest markets for its chip exports were the US ($647m), Singapore ($128m) and Italy ($83.5m), according to data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity. Speaking to CNN, the director of the National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett, explained that the US would investigate the semiconductor supply chain before more tariffs are placed on that industry. Under US trade law, the president has powers to restrict the trade of products seen as critical to national security after an investigation has been concluded. “Semiconductors are the key, important part of a lot of defence equipment. There’s going to be a semiconductor 232 that studies those things carefully and decides what has to be on-shored in order to protect America,” Hassett told CNN on Sunday, referring to Section 232 of the US Trade Expansion Act. The latest salvoes over electronic gadgets and semiconductors are a subplot to a larger trade war that the US and China have escalated in recent days, placingretaliatory tariffson each other since Trump’s April 2 announcement. Chinese exports to the US – other than the electronic goods exempted on Friday – presently carry a 145 percent levy. US goods entering China carry a 125 percent surcharge. Countries have scrambled to negotiate better deals with Washington since the sweeping tariffs were announced. Last week, the USpaused additional tariffson most countries for 90 days, instead imposing a flat 10 percent tariff on all their goods China – which has declared a “fight to the end” – was not included in those deals. Markets have been volatile since Trump announced his tariffs. The president has insisted that stock market turbulence is the “short-term” consequence of resetting the global trade order, which would ultimately prove rewarding to US consumers. However, as expectations of a surge in inflation grow, experts said the US exemptions announced on Friday demonstrated an increasing awareness within the administration of the pain that thetariffshave in store for US manufacturers and consumers. Apple is only one of many US companies on edge during the trade war. The majority of its iPhones – about 90 percent – are assembled in China through its local partner, Foxconn. China produces an estimated 80 percent of Apple’s products. Lobbying groups representing tech companies Intel, Nvidia and other companies have urged Washington to negotiate trade deals that would lower trade barriers globally. Other sectors have been impacted too. In March, Trump placed a 25 percent tariff on steel and aluminium imports from all countries, including China. Beijing is the world’s largest steel and aluminium producer. Direct steel exports to the US in 2024 accounted for only about 4.1 percent of its total production. Aluminium exports to the US were higher at 16 percent of China’s total production in 2024. Then, on April 3, the Trump administration announced a 25 percent tariff on imported automobiles. China was again impacted: Beijing is the world’s biggest car manufacturer. Although its auto exports to the US accounted for about 2 percent of total US auto imports – or just 0.4 percent of auto sales in 2024, according to the credit rating firm S&P, Chinese automakers are so integrated into the global supply chain that new tariffs from any one country could impact them negatively. On May 3, 25 percent tariffs on all imported auto parts also kick in. Although Trump administration officials have suggested Americans can avoid a price increase on foreign cars by buying ones that are made domestically, experts have warned thatno car manufactured in the USrelies entirely on American parts.",

    "title": "Can China use US debt in its tariff war against Trump?",
    "article_text": "The United States and China are in a trade war face-off. The US exported $143bn worth of goods to China in 2024 and has a trade deficit of $295bn. To curb that, President Donald Trump has ratcheted tariffs up to a never-before heard of 145 percent on China, which has retaliated with 125 percent taxes on US goods. While Trump has paused tariffs on most countries for 90 days, China is not on that list, escalating tensions between the two countries. Earlier this week, China’s Ministry of Commerce said it is willing to “fight to the end” and has accused the US of violating the rules of the World Trade Organization. For his part, Trump has said the tariffs are bringing in $2bn a day. According to Treasury Department data, the tariffs have brought in $200m a day. China’s nuclear option revolves around US debt. China is the second largest holder of US debt – otherwise known as treasuries – at $760bn. Countries like China like to buy US debt because the dollar is considered the standard currency in international trade, and thus, a low-risk investment. China is only second to Japan, which holds $1 trillion, according to the US Treasury Department. China could theoretically weaponise the US Treasury holdings – by dumping it – meaning that it would sell off treasury holdings for less than they are worth. By doing so, China would then, because of the amount it owns, devalue the US dollar. “As the tariff barriers become so prohibitive that we are just no longer able to access each other’s markets, the only source of escalation becomes kind of more escalating retaliatory tools,” like selling off US debt for less than it is worth to devalue the dollar, said Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at the economic think tank, the Groundwork Collaborative. “That could have not just domestic but global consequences and really kind of unforeseen ones,” Jacquez said. James Mohs, a professor of accounting, taxation and law at the University of New Haven, says that it could be worse if China were to buy more of the debt that the US may issue. “If we have to issue more debt, that is going to weaken our economic structure. Of course, it’s going to probably weaken the dollar because it’s a pure amount of excess debt,” Mohs told Al Jazeera. However, it’s not clear that China will go down that route of selling treasuries. Such a move would hurt China just as much, by devaluing its dollar assets and strengthening the yuan. That would hurt both global and domestic economic output as it would make Chinese exports more expensive. China does not want its currency at a higher value because the US dollar is the standard of global trade, meaning that it would make more money off another country’s currency rather than its own. However, by owning so much US debt – an estimated $3 trillion between the state and domestic banks – China automatically has leverage over the value of the dollar. Even if China made such a move, the US Federal Reserve could quickly counteract the damage through aggressive quantitative easing (QE). Under QE, the central bank injects money into the economy by buying up key financial assets like government bonds in order to lower interest rates and stimulate economic activity, as it did during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. But with daily changes in tariffs, the central bank’s decision-making is in flux. The Federal Reserve has signalled it will likely not push for interest rate cuts anytime soon. Morgan Stanley forecasted that the Fed would not make any cuts for the rest of the year. “It’s hard for them [the Federal Reserve] to even plan on what they might do at the moment, given that the president doesn’t appear to know what he will be doing day-to-day or week-to-week,” Jacquez added. In the midst of all the chaos, consumers are starting to pull back. The University of Michigan’sConsumer Sentiment Index report, which came out this morning, shows an 11 percent drop from last month amid concerns about what a trade war would mean on issues ranging from personal income to inflation. The report is far from the only metricshowing the American public is worried. The Conference Board reported late last month that consumer confidence fell to a 12-year low. “If every news headline that they turn on is a negative one, and there are threats of nuclear options by China or other trading partners, consumers are going to start to pull back spending,” Jacquez said.",

    "title": "Germany wants to deport four pro-Palestine activists: What you should know",
    "article_text": "Berlin, Germany –Germanyis being accused ofsilencing pro-Palestinian voices, having ordered the deportations of three European nationals and a United States citizen over their alleged actions at demonstrations. None has been convicted of any crime. Critics said the decision is another chapter of German unease with the pro-Palestine movement. Since the war in Gaza began in October 2023, tensions have flared as officials have moved to ban protests andcancel eventswhile cultural institutes havedistanced themselvesfrom artists who raise awareness about the Palestinian cause. Here’s what you should know: The four activists received initial letters in the post in January informing them they had lost the right of freedom of movement. Two months later, their lawyers received deportation letters from Berlin’s state migration authority on behalf of their clients in which they were told to leave by April 21 or be forcibly removed. The activists are: Cooper Longbottom, a 27-year-old US citizen and university student, and cultural workers Kasia Wlaszczyk, a 35-year-old Polish national; Shane O’Brien, 29; and Roberta Murray, 31. O’Brien and Murray are Irish citizens. All four allegedly participated in a sit-in at the Free University of Berlin. On Friday in an emergency injunction, Berlin’s state administrative court ruled that O’Brien may remain until a full hearing is held. The temporary measure is one of interim relief when a court or legal authority acts to protect someone’s rights or interests while a case is still being decided. The court said the migration authority failed to “fulfil sufficiently its official duty of investigation” when deciding to withdraw his European Union freedom of movement rights,accordingto The Irish Times. In a police report seen by Al Jazeera, incidents are listed from October last year onwards. German authorities said the activists have spread “anti-Semitic hatred and incitement” as well as “anti-Israeli hatred”. The four are accused of criminal acts such as resisting arrest, property damage and disturbing the peace. The document also refers to insulting remarks, alleging that some of the activists called a police officer a “fascist”. In Germany, insulting someone is classified as a defamation of honour offence and can be subject to legal punishment. Two were initially accused of this. One – O’Brien – has since been acquitted. In a statement provided to Al Jazeera, the Berlin Senate Department for the Interior and Sport referred to an incident in question. “A group of masked individuals willing to use violence forced their way into a university building. This led to significant property damage inside the building, including graffiti related to the Israel-Palestine conflict, as well as other criminal offences. As far as we are aware, the legal proceedings are still ongoing. No further details can be provided due to data protection regulations,” it said. They have also been accused of supporting Hamas, but police have provided no evidence of this. The Intercept first broke thestory, triggering a round of condemnation towards Germany from critics. The activists’ legal team argued the charges are being used as a pretext to suppress political speech and assembly rights, particularly concerning Palestine. “The decisions to deport our clients have no valid legal basis,” said lawyer Benjamin Dusberg, a member of the five-person legal team representing the activists. “This purely political justification is in no way compatible with the fundamental rights to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly. Not a word is mentioned that our clients protested against the genocide in Gaza and its support through German arms deliveries.” Wlaszczyk said the allegations are unfounded. “I refuse to engage in dishonest accusations of anti-Semitism and falling into the trap of defending myself against this grossabuseof the term being thrown around by police, journalists and the state to slander and criminalise the pro-Palestinian movement,” he told Al Jazeera. “By now, we all know that accusations of anti-Semitism have been turned by the German state into an authoritarian dog whistle and a racist tool which predominantly targets the Palestinian and Arab communities in Germany.” The deportation orders were issued as Germany faces accusations of a broader national clampdown on pro-Palestinian activism. These allegations have grown during Israel’s latest war on Gaza, but they have haunted Germany evenbeforeOctober 2023. Since the Hamas-led incursion into southern Israel on October 7, 2023, during which 1,139 people were killed and more than 200 were taken captive, Israel has killed more than 50,983 people in Gaza, including tens of thousands of children. In a statement, the four activists painted a bleak picture of Berlin over the past 18 months. “Rampant unrestrained police violence goes hand in hand with this repressive use of immigration law to silence pro-Palestinian voices and political dissent. Arbitrary arrests made at protests, combined with false charges, are used as pretexts to justify extrajudicial deportation measures, circumventing any notion of independent judicial process and the rule of law,” they said. In recent years, Berlin authorities have banned pro-Palestinian demonstrations and national symbols associated with Palestinian identity. Germany said protests have been banned because of concerns about the potential for hate speech. Administrative courts have said they pose an “imminent danger to public safety and order”. Berlin has given schools a green light to ban the wearing of Palestinian keffiyeh scarves on the grounds that they may threaten “school peace”. Additionally, chanting slogans like “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” has been banned in certain contexts because they are seen as denying Israel’s right to exist. In August, a protester was fined about $650 over the chant, which German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser has described as a pro-Hamas slogan. Cultural institutions have lost public funding over ties to pro-Palestinian advocacy, raising concerns about artistic freedom and political repression in the country. President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on November 8, 2023, called on Arab communities in Germanyto distance themselvesfrom Hamas, a comment that saw him accused of discrimination. Furthermore, according to amendments to Germany’s citizenship laws, applicants seeking naturalisation will be required to affirm Israel’s right to exist. In the case of the activists, German authorities have cited the principle of “Staatsrason” – or reason of state – as a basis for the deportation orders. Israel’s security is seen by Germany as its reason of state, given Nazi Germany’s role in systematically murdering six million Jews during the Holocaust. “The immigration authorities themselves initially considered the deportation decisions to be illegal as none of our clients had a criminal record. But then they were instructed to do so by the Berlin Senate,” Dusberg said. Internal emails reviewed by Al Jazeera confirm that Federal Foreign Office employeeschallenged the legality of the Berlin Senate’s deportation request,but their objections were unsuccessful. “In the reasons for the decisions, direct reference is then made in the police report to the so-called Staatsrason. According to this report, our clients have acted in conflict with the reason of state,” Dusberg added. While not codified into law, Staatsrason has shaped public discourse as a guiding state doctrine. Observers argued it fosters censorship, pitting democratic values like free speech and freedom of assembly against Germany’s unwavering solidarity with Israel. In March last year, the Financial Times’s Berlin bureau chief, Guy Chazan, wrote: “Any criticism of Israel is now seen by some people in power as antisemitic. It is an approach that is tying Germans up in knots, inflaming social tensions and undermining the country’s credibility in the Global South.” Adding to the controversy surrounding Berlin’s foreign policy as Israel’s genocide against Palestinians in Gaza continues unabated, Friedrich Merz, the likely next German chancellor, recentlyinvitedIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Germany despite an International Criminal Court arrest warrant for the Israeli leader for alleged war crimes.",

    "title": "Peru mourns death of literary giant Mario Vargas Llosa",
    "article_text": "Peru has declared a national day of mourning with flags flying at half-mast on government premises in memory of writer and Nobel laureate Mario Vargas Llosa. Vargas Llosa died at the age of 89 on Sunday in the Peruvian capital, Lima, surrounded by his family. His body will be cremated and “no public ceremony will take place”, in accordance with his wishes and instructions, his family said. “His departure will sadden his relatives, his friends and his readers around the world, but we hope that they will find comfort, as we do, in the fact that he enjoyed a long, adventurous and fruitful life, and leaves behind him a body of work that will outlive him,” his eldest son Alvaro wrote in a message on X, also signed by his siblings Gonzalo and Morgana Vargas Llosa, on Sunday. It is with deep sorrow that we announce that our father, Mario Vargas LLosa, passed away peacefully in Lima today, surrounded by his family.@morganavllpic.twitter.com/c6HgEfyaIe — Álvaro Vargas Llosa (@AlvaroVargasLl)April 14, 2025 Vargas Llosa was a leading light in the 20th-century Latin American literature boom, which also included Colombian Gabriel Garcia Marquez, and won the Nobel Prize for literature in 2010 for works like Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter, Death in the Andes, and The War of the End of the World. Born to middle-class parents in Arequipa,Peru, on March 28, 1936, Vargas Llosa frequently drew from personal experience and his family, at times inserting characters based on his own life into his tales. His acclaimed debut novel, The Time of the Hero (1963), was loosely based on his teenage life as a cadet at a military academy in Lima, while his 1993 memoir, A Fish in the Water, focused on his 1990 presidential run. Other works expressed deep concern for his country. The Storyteller (1987) deals with the clash of Indigenous and European cultures in Peru, while Death in the Andes (1993) recounts the haunting and bloody years of the Shining Path hardline movement. “An author’s work is fed by his own experience and, over the years, becomes richer,” Vargas Llosa told the Reuters news agency in an interview in Madrid in 2001. The Nobel Committee said in 2010 it was awarding him “for his cartography of structures of power and his trenchant images of the individual’s resistance, revolt, and defeat”. Paying tribute to his colleague, fellow Peruvian writer Alfredo Bryce Echenique hailed Vargas Llosa’s “enormity”. He told Peruvian radio RPP his friend’s death was “a sorrow for Peru”. In a post on X, Peru’s President Dina Boluarte called him the “most illustrious Peruvian of all time”. “His intellectual genius and vast body of work will remain an everlasting legacy for future generations,” she added. Vargas Llosa’s works were also translated into some 30 languages. US Deputy State Secretary State Christopher Landau said, “To label him as just Peruvian would be a disservice because his themes and interests were timeless and universal.” “He will live on in my bookshelves and many others in Latin America and around the world,” Landau wrote on X. Besides authoring books, Vargas Llosa was also outspoken on political issues. Although an early supporter of the Cuban revolution led byFidel Castro, he later grew disillusioned and denounced Castro’s Cuba. By 1980, he said he no longer believed in socialism as a solution for developing nations. In 1990, Vargas Llosa ran for president ofPeru, saying he wanted to save his country from economic chaos and a Marxist armed rebellion. He, however, lost in the run-off to Alberto Fujimori, a then-unknown agronomist and university professor who defeated the armed rebels but was later jailed for human rights crimes and corruption. Frustrated by his loss, the writer moved to Spain but remained influential in Latin America, harshly criticising a new wave of strident left-wing leaders led by then-Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. “In reality, I never had a political career,” Vargas Llosa once said. “I took part in politics under very special circumstances … and I always said that whether I won or lost the elections, I was going back to my literary, intellectual job, not politics.”",

    "article_text": "Islamabad, Pakistan –Pakistan has urged Iran to conduct a “comprehensive investigation” after eight Pakistani migrant workers were killed over the weekend in Iran’s Sistan-Baluchestan province, which shares a border with Pakistan’s southwestern Balochistan province. The attack took place on Saturday in Mehrestan county, located roughly 230km (142 miles) from the Pakistan border, where unidentified assailants attacked a workshop. According to Iranian media reports, all eight workers – who belonged to various areas of Pakistan’s Punjab province and were working as mechanics – were tied up and shot dead. The Baloch Nationalist Army (BNA), a lesser-known Baloch group seeking independence from Pakistan, has claimed responsibility for the attack. Iran and Pakistan were both quick to condemn the attack, with the Iranian ambassador to Pakistan, Reza Amiri Moghadam, saying “terrorism is a common threat throughout the region”. The Pakistani envoy to Tehran, Mudassir Tipu, confirmed in astatementon X that the two countries were coordinating efforts to investigate the incident. Earlier, Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs had sought a joint response against the attackers. “Pakistan strongly condemns the inhumane and cowardly killing of its nationals in Iran. We hope for the Iranian side’s full cooperation in investigating the matter and in the timely repatriation of victims’ remains,” it said in a statement on Sunday. Yet experts say the deadly attack only underscored the tense security landscape along their shared border — where the two countries traded missile fire last year, accusing each other of harbouring deadly armed groups. Statement of the Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran to Pakistan:The Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran strongly condemns the inhumane and cowardly armed incident against 8 Pakistani nationals in Iran's Sistan and Balouchestan province.Terrorism is a chronic plight…pic.twitter.com/qbjXe6Q3TC — Reza Amiri Moghadam (@IranAmbPak)April 13, 2025 The Pakistan-Iran border has been tense since January 2024, whenIran launched attackson Pakistani soil. The Iranian government said it was targeting Jaish al-Adl, an armed group it accuses of carrying out multiple attacks in Iran. Pakistanresponded a day laterwith a retaliatory attack that it said was based on “credible intelligence” regarding “impending large-scale terrorist activities” from across the border. Just days after the exchange, at least nine Pakistani labourers were killed in Iran’s Saravan region by unidentified men ina strikingly similar act of violenceto the Mehrestan incident. Balochistan, a region that spans parts of Iran and Afghanistan, has experienced a surge in violence over the past year, with the secessionist group Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) (BLA) carrying out several large-scale attacks. Last month, the BLA launched an audacious attack byhijacking the Jaffer Express, a Pakistani passenger train carrying about 400 people. Following an operation that lasted more than 24 hours, Pakistani security forcesovercame the hijacking, eliminating at least 33 attackers. Thirty people, including 26 passengers and four security personnel, were also killed. Balochistan is home to about 15 million of Pakistan’s estimated 240 million people, according to the 2023 census. Yet, it remains the country’s poorest region despite its wealth in natural resources, including coal, gold, copper, and gas. It also hosts one of Pakistan’s major deep-sea ports at Gwadar, a critical hub in the $62bn China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), designed to connect southwestern China to the Arabian Sea through Pakistan. Baloch nationalist groups allege that the Pakistani state hasneglected their peoplewhile exploiting the province’s resources, fuelling separatist movements and armed rebellions. Baloch activists also accuse the government of human rights violations and of being behind forced disappearances — a charge that Pakistan’s government denies. While Pakistani authorities have repeatedly accused the Taliban group, Afghanistan’s interim rulers, of harbouring violent groups that conduct cross-border attacks, criticism against the Iranian government has remained comparatively restrained, said Ihsanullah Tipu Mehsud, a security analyst. Mehsud, who is also a co-founder of The Khorasan Diary, a security research portal, added that while Tehran insists that it does not harbour Baloch armed separatists, multiple incidents over the past 15 months suggest that Baloch secessionist groups are active on Iran’s side of the border. While the BLA remains the most potent group in Balochistan, targeting law enforcement personnel as well as Chinese interests, Mehsud said the BNA — the group that claimed Saturday’s attack — is smaller, with more limited resources. There is no evidence to suggest that Iran is in any way supportive of the BNA. In fact, the Baloch group views Iran, as it views Pakistan, as an occupier. “BNA has faced internal divisions in the past as well and lags significantly behind BLA in terms of fighter strength, including suicide squads, financial resources, propaganda capabilities, and weapon availability,” Mehsud added. He believes the latest attack may be an attempt by the BNA to reassert its presence. The Islamabad-based analyst adds that although the BNA is opposed to Iran, its threat to Tehran’s interests appears limited compared with Jaish al-Adl, a Baloch group that has repeatedly attacked Iran in the past. That, he said, might explain Iran’s approach to the two groups — prioritising one as a security threat over the other. “Iran’s response to these groups differs significantly, persistently targeting Jaish al-Adl while seemingly not taking action against the BNA,” Mehsud said. Still, following the April 12 attack, Iran has been firm in seeking a regional response to armed groups — which creates the possibility of greater coordination between Tehran and Islamabad in addressing security threats on both sides of the border. “Combating this ominous phenomenon requires collective and joint efforts by all countries to eradicate all forms of terrorism and extremism that have claimed the lives of thousands of innocent people in recent decades,” Moghadam, the Iranian ambassador in Pakistan, wrote on X.",

    "article_text": "Greek police say they are investigating claims by an unknown hardline group that it was responsible for a couple of bomb blasts that rocked Athens over the past year. A police spokeswoman told Greek media on Monday that the authorities were examining a statement issued by Revolutionary Class Struggle that it was behind an explosion on Friday near the offices of railway operator Hellenic Train last week, as well as an attack at the Ministry of Labour last year. The group posted a statement on the website Athens.indymedia.org on Sunday, which dedicated both the attacks to “the Palestinian people and their heroic resistance”. “The claim is being examined with great attention by the relevant officers so that they can gather information,” police spokeswoman Constantina Dimoglidou told Action 24 TV. She said it was too early to draw conclusions about the group’s identity but police were investigating possible links with other cases in the past. The Revolutionary Class Struggle statement blamed Hellenic Train, a unit of Italy’s Ferrovie dello Stato, for arail accidentin 2023 near the Greek village of Tempi. The crash, which killed 57 people, has led to numerousprotestsover deficiencies in the railway system and claims of government corruption. The group’s statement branded them demonstrations against “state capitalist crime”, and sought to link them to Palestine and the war in Gaza “since they took place within a country with an active role in the American-Zionist genocidal war”. The statement also said the group was behind a 2024 attack on the Labour Ministry. Neither attack resulted in any injuries as warnings were sent in advance. Hellenic Train, the operator of passenger and cargo train services, was once a subsidiary of state-owned Hellenic Railways. In February, Greece’s Air and Rail Accident Investigation Authority (HARSIA) said the 2023 accident was due to chronicsafety gapsand that they still needed to be addressed to prevent a repeat. Christos Papadimitriou, the head of HARSIA, resigned on Wednesday, a move expected to further stall efforts to shed light on the country’s worst rail disaster. A judicial investigation is expected to conclude this year.",

    "article_text": "The latest iPad Mini and iPad Pro are getting cheaper by the day, but the basic models offer the best value. The latest iPad Mini and iPad Pro are getting cheaper by the day, but the basic models offer the best value. byBrandon WidderandQuentyn Kennemer If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. While the best iPad deals usually land during major sale events like Black Friday and Amazon Prime Day, many great iPad deals are attainable outside those times. The day-to-day discounts may come and go like changing winds, but there’s often some amount to be saved, particularly on the more affordable iPads. The most recentiPad ProandiPad Miniare also regularly discounted, and you can even save a bit on Apple’slatest iPad Airandbase iPad. It’s difficult to know where exactly you can find the most notable iPad deals unless you’re scouring the major retailers on a daily basis. But that’s often what our deal hunters atThe Vergeare doing each and every day, so let us help you out. Below, we’ve listed the best deals you can get on each iPad model that is currently available, from the10th-gen iPad of 2022and themore recent base model with the A16 chipto the more powerful iPad models with M3 and M4 chips. Apple’s10th-gen iPadcame out in late 2022. It’s still a great tablet overall; however, it’s recently been supplanted byApple’s latest entry-level model, which features an upgraded A16 chip and twice as much base storage. That said, the last-gen iPad still benefits from a modern design and Apple’s long-in-the-making switch to USB-C. The 10.9-inch tablet is also outfitted with a side power button with a fingerprint sensor and uniform bezels, though, unlike its predecessor, it lacks a home button and a 3.5mm headphone jack. In the past, you could often buy Apple’s latest entry-level iPad for $349 ($100 off its initial launch price) — which is now the MSRP. Right now, however, the base model with 64GB of storage is on sale atWalmartin select colors starting around $269 ($80 off), which is $20 more than its best price to date.Amazonis selling the 256GB model with Wi-Fi for just shy of $400 ($100 off), butWalmarthandily beats it with a $349 price tag. Apple’s 10th-gen iPad is the successor to the older ninth-gen model. In exchange for its revised design, landscape-oriented webcam, USB-C port, larger 10.9-inch screen, and faster processor, it ditched the headphone jack and home button. As noted above,Apple’s 11th-gen iPadjust recently landed on the scene. Thenew base-model tabletis a fairly iterative update of the prior model with 128GB of base storage (as opposed to 64GB) and an A16 Bionic chip, which is supposedly nearly 30 percent faster than the A14 chip found in the 10th-gen iPad. The newer chip doesn’t support the various Apple Intelligence features introduced in iPadOS 18.1. For that, you’ll want to opt for a more recent iPad Air, iPad Mini, or iPad Pro model. Apple’s 11th-gen iPad offers 128GB of storage — twice that of its predecessor — and runs on a faster A16 chip. It also comes in four colors: blue, pink, yellow, and silver. Pricing-wise, the new iPad starts at $349 with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage. You can also upgrade to 256GB or 512GB of storage for an additional $100 or $200, respectively, or purchase an LTE model starting at $499. We don’t expect those prices to drop significantly in the coming months, though, if you choose to be an early adopter, the entry-level configuration with 128GB of storage is currently on sale atAmazonstarting at $328 ($22 off). Alternatively, you can grab the 256GB model atAmazonstarting at $419.99 ($30 off), or the 512GB variant atAmazonandWalmartstarting at $614 ($35 off). The newseventh-gen iPad Miniis similar tothe outgoing modelbut comes with faster Wi-Fi and USB-C speeds, support for the Apple Pencil Pro, and a newer A17 Pro processor with 8GB of RAM to support Apple Intelligence. Otherwise, it boasts nearly identical specs and features as the last-gen model, meaning it has an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display, a USB-C port, and options for 5G. It may not be worth upgrading if you already own a sixth-gen Mini, but newcomers to the category will appreciate the upgrades. The 2024 iPad Mini starts at $499 with 128GB of storage, which was the price for the previous generation’s 64GB model. Electing for 256GB of storage brings the price up to $599, and the cellular models start at $649. These are some big numbers for a small iPad, and the larger iPad Air might be worth considering if you prefer your dollar to go further with more screen real estate. But if you want an Apple tablet in the smallest possible form factor, this is where the action is. Right now, there aren’t any deals available on the 128GB base model with Wi-Fi. You can, however, get the 256GB variant atWalmartfor $589, a measly $10 discount. The 512GB model is also on sale atAmazonfor $779 ($20 off). The seventh-gen iPad Mini comes with Apple’s A17 Pro chip and support for Apple Intelligence. It’s also compatible with the Apple Pencil Pro and offers faster Wi-Fi and USB-C speeds. Although the2024 iPad Airisn’t vastly different from thenew M3 model, it was the first Air available in a 13-inch configuration in addition to an 11-inch base model. Apple also introduced Wi-Fi 6E radios and upgraded the chipset to M2, enabling the hover feature when using Apple’s latest styluses. You can use the last-gen Air with theApple Pencil Proand latest Magic Keyboard, too, and while it’s no longer officially a part of Apple’s tablet slate, both the 11- and 13-inch Air are still readily available starting at $599 and $799, respectively. Discounts are limited on the 11-inch base model with 128GB of storage and Wi-Fi starting; It’s selling at its normal $599 price atAmazon. As for the 13-inch iPad Air with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage,Best BuyandWalmartare all selling it in select colors starting at around $699 ($100 off), which is $5 more than its lowest price to date. Apple’s last-gen iPad Air comes with an M2 chip, horizontal placement for the front camera, and support for the Apple Pencil Pro and the latest Magic Keyboard. In addition to the 11-inch model, the M2 iPad Air is also available in a 13-inch configuration. It features a Liquid Retina display, horizontal placement for the front camera, and support for the Apple Pencil Pro and the bigger version of Apple’s new Magic Keyboard. The2025 iPad Airis little more than a spec bump over the previous model, with a few technical upgrades that should allow it to last longer than both the entry-level iPad and the last-gen Air. It features an M3 chip with support for Apple Intelligence and compatibility with Apple’s latest Magic Keyboard, which has a larger trackpad and an extra row of function keys that make the Air a more credible laptop replacement. The 11-inch model starts at $599 and the 13-inch variant $799 — the same price as the previous models — but we’re already starting to see discounts from third-party retailers. Right now, for instance, the 11-inch Air is on sale atWalmart,Amazon, andB&H Photoin its base configuration with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage starting at $549 ($50 off). Amazon also has the256GB model for $649($50 off) and the512GB model starting at $849($50 off). The larger 13-inch model, meanwhile, is currently on sale atAmazonwith 128GB of storage starting at $729.99 (about $70 off) or $754 atWalmart. You can also pick up the Wi-Fi / 256GB model atAmazonandB&H Photofor $849 ($100 off), or the 512GB variant atAmazonandWalmartfor $1,074, just $25 off. The new 11-inch iPad Air comes with Apple’s M3 chip and GPU upgrades. It’s available in dark gray, blue, purple, and a “starlight” cream shade. In addition to the 11-inch model, the iPad Air is also available in a 13-inch configuration with Apple’s M3 processor. Compared to the latest iPad Air, the2024 iPad Prois a far more impressive upgrade. The 11- and 13-inch models start at $999 and $1,299, respectively, and they were the first Apple devices to feature the company’s latestM4 chip, which brings moderate performance gains and dedicated hardware for on-device Apple Intelligence processing. The new Pro models can claim other firsts, too, such as being the first iPad models with OLED displays and the lightest Pros yet, which is true of both sizes. They also feature repositioned front-facing cameras that sit along the horizontal edge, which prevent you from looking as though you’re staring off into space on a video call. As for deals, the 11-inch iPad Pro with Wi-Fi / 256GB of storage is currently on sale atAmazonstarting at $899 ($100 off) — which is about $20 more than its typical sale price. The sleek and super-thin 13-inch model, meanwhile, is on sale in its 256GB base configuration atAmazonstarting at $1,099 ($200 off), which is a particularly noteworthy discount. Apple’s latest iPad Pro is the first Apple device with an M4 processor and an OLED-based Ultra Retina XDR display. It also features an improved camera system with adaptive flash and compatibility with the Apple Pencil Pro and the newest Magic Keyboard. The newest iPad Pro comes in either an 11- or 13-inch configuration with Apple’s M4 processor. Both models also feature an OLED display, a much thinner and lighter build, new horizontal placement for the front camera, and support for the Apple Pencil Pro.

    "article_text": "Every model in Apple’s current lineup, from the entry-level SE to the Ultra 2, is receiving some sort of discount right now. Every model in Apple’s current lineup, from the entry-level SE to the Ultra 2, is receiving some sort of discount right now. byBrandon Widder If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. In September, Apple launched its latest smartwatch, introducing theApple Watch Series 10alongside ablack renditionof theApple Watch Ultra 2. Each wearable has its own pros and cons, as does thesecond-gen Apple Watch SE, but the recent introduction of the new wearables also means there are now more Apple Watch models on the market than ever before — and a lot more deals to be had. But with all of those options, which one should you pick? Generally speaking, you want to buy the newest watch you can afford so that it continues to receive software updates from Apple. The latest update,watchOS 11, launched in September on the Apple Watch Series 6 and newer, ultimately leaving those still using an older Series 4 or Series 5 behind. That being said, picking up a watch from the latest (or a recent) generation ensures you’re getting a smartwatch with an updated design, a robust number of features, and plenty of sensors. Now, let’s get to the deals. The Apple Watch Series 10 has a larger, wide-angle OLED display with up to 30 percent more screen area. It’s also thinner and lighter than its predecessors. The Apple Watch Series 10 has a larger, wide-angle OLED display with up to 30 percent more screen area. It’s also thinner and lighter than its predecessors. The Apple Watch Series 10 represents the latest wearable in Apple’s flagship Series lineup. It features the new S10 SiP chip, faster charging, and a wide-angle OLED display that’s brighter, larger, and easier to read than that of previous models. It weighs half as much as the Ultra, too, and is about 30 percent thinner despite its new 42mm and 46mm sizing. Other upgrades include an added depth and water temperature sensor, as well as a new FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection feature, the latter of which is also available on the last-gen Series 9 and Ultra 2. While the improvements are certainly welcome, the Series 10 isn’t a vast departure from the prior model, theSeries 9. That being said, it’s currently on sale atWalmartright now in the 42mm sizing with GPS starting at $329 ($70 off), which remains its second-best price to date. The 46mm variant, meanwhile, is on sale atAmazonandWalmartstarting at $359 ($70 off) — which is also the second-best price we’ve seen — while the LTE models can be had atAmazonandWalmartstarting at $399 ($100 off). The Apple Watch Series 9 represents a slight upgrade over the prior model, the Apple Watch Series 8. It uses Apple’s S9 SiP processor and second-gen ultra wideband chip, though there aren’t many significant differences beyond that. In 2023, Apple introduced the Apple Watch Series 9 alongside the second-gen Ultra. It uses Apple’s last-gen S9 SiP chip and a second-gen ultra wideband chip, which allows for onboard Siri processing and precision finding with select iPhone models. It also features a brighter, 2,000-nit display and support for Apple’s nifty “double tap” feature — two minor additions that are also present on the Series 10. The Series 9 has been out for more than a year, but specific configurations have become increasingly difficult to find with the arrival of Apple’s latest watch. Luckily, the Series 9 is still on sale at Best Buy in the 41mm / GPS configurationstarting at $279.99($119 off) or in the 45mm / LTE configurationstarting at $343.99(about $185 off). The latest SE borrows a few features from the Series 8, including the same chipset and Crash Detection feature, but it’s an otherwise subtle upgrade from the last-gen SE. Apple’s entry-level wearable represents a minor upgrade when compared to the prior SE, though it does sport a faster chipset and make use of many watchOS 11 features. The Apple Watch SEreceived a refresh in late 2022. It has the same chipset as the Series 8, which is great, but with fewer sensors, no always-on display, and a slightly outdated design compared to the Series 8, Series 9, and Series 10. Those omissions might take this out of the running for some people, but it still may be exactly what you’re after. Best of all, it starts at $249 for the 40mm Wi-Fi / GPS model, which is $30 less than the previous generation’s baseline cost. Opting for cellular connectivity bumps the starting price up to $299 for the 40mm size (44mm adds $20 to each configuration). Right now, the best deal on the latest Apple Watch SE can be found atAmazon, where you can pick the 40mm model with GPS for an all-time low of $169.97 (about $79 off). The 44mm / GPS config, meanwhile, is available atAmazonfor $199.97 (about $79 off). If you want the LTE configuration, the 44mm model is currently on sale atWalmartstarting at $199 ($130 off), or in the smaller 40mm sizing atWalmartstarting at $239 ($60 off). The rugged Apple Watch Ultra 2 comes in one size: 49mm. It offers the brightest display of any wearable in Apple’s lineup, along with better battery life and improved performance. It sports Apple’s last-gen S9 SiP, too, allowing you to take advantage of Apple’s handy double tap feature. The latest Apple Watch Ultra launched at $799 in September with GPS and LTE support, much like the original model. The ultra-capable smartwatch has the most features, sensors, and ruggedness of any Apple Watch model available thus far, along with a display that’s 50 percent brighter than the first Ultra. The 49mm smartwatch also packs Apple’s S9 SiP and second-gen ultra wideband chips, just like the Apple Watch Series 9, while maintaining long-lasting battery life, precise GPS tracking, and a bevy of diving-friendly sensors. In recent months, we saw the Apple Watch Ultra 2 dip to as low as $642 ($157 off) in select configurations. Right now, however, it’s only on sale at Amazonwith a Trail Looporan Ocean Bandstarting at $734.89 (about $64 off), or withan Alpine Loopstarting at $739 ($60 off). You can also pick it up at Best Buywith an Alpine Loop,a Trail Loop, oran Ocean Bandstarting at $739 ($60 off), which is a deal we rarely see at Best Buy. While all of the Apple Watch models and colorways covered here are encased in aluminum (except the Ultra 2, which has a titanium build), Apple does make a more premium range built out of stainless steel and titanium. These offerings are functionally and aesthetically similar to their aluminum counterparts, with slightly refined colors and finishings — polished for the stainless steel and brushed for the titanium. However, they start at much steeper prices of $699 and above. They, too, can often be found on sale, but they’re never discounted as low as the standard base models, so we don’t include them here.

    "article_text": "Apple’s new AI training method involves comparing synthetic data to real-world samples. Apple’s new AI training method involves comparing synthetic data to real-world samples. byEmma Roth Apple says it’s found a way to make its AI models better without training on its users’ data or even copying it from their iPhones and Macs. Ina blog post first reportedonbyBloomberg, the company outlined its plans to have devices compare a synthetic dataset to samples of recent emails or messages from users who have opted into its Device Analytics program. Apple devices will be able to determine which synthetic inputs are closest to real samples, which they will relay to the company by sending “only a signal indicating which of the variants is closest to the sampled data.” That way, according to Apple, it doesn’t access user data, and the data never leaves the device. Apple will then use the most frequently picked fake samples to improve its AI text outputs, such as email summaries. Currently, Apple trains its AI models on synthetic data only, potentially resulting in less helpful responses, according toBloomberg’s Mark Gurman. Apple has struggled with the launch of its flagship Apple Intelligence features, as itpushed backthe launch of some capabilities andreplaced the headof its Siri team. But now, Apple is trying to turn things around by introducing its new AI training system in a beta version of iOS and iPadOS 18.5 and macOS 15.5, according to Gurman. Apple has been talking up its use of a method calleddifferential privacy to keep user data private since at least 2016 with the launch of iOS 10 and has already used it to improve theAI-powered Genmoji feature. This also applies to the company’s new AI training plans as well, as Apple says that introducing randomized information into a broader dataset will help prevent it from linking data to any one person.

    "title": "Trump says he wants to deport some US citizens, too",
    "article_text": "﻿Trump claims he’d like to send Americans to a notorious megaprison in El Salvador. ﻿Trump claims he’d like to send Americans to a notorious megaprison in El Salvador. byGaby Del Valle President Donald Trump wants to expand his alreadychaoticand cruel mass deportations. On Monday, he told reporters that he’s looking into the possibility of sending US citizens to a megaprison in El Salvador. “I’d like to go a step further,” Trump claimed at a press conference with Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele on Monday. “I don’t know what the laws are — we always have to obey the laws — but we also have homegrown criminals that push people into subways, that hit elderly ladies on the back of the head with a baseball bat when they’re not looking, that are absolute monsters. I’d like to include them in the group of people to get them out of the country, but you’ll have to be looking at the laws on that.” In March, Trumpinvoked the Alien Enemies Actto deport 300 Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador’s notorious Terrorism Confinement Center, also called CECOT. The law has been on the books since the 18th century but has only been invoked three times before — most recently to incarcerate Japanese-Americans during World War II — and has never been used during peacetime. But Trump claims that the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua has “invaded” the US, thus allowing him to use the law to deport people the administration accuses of being gang members without due process. The administration isreportedly paying El Salvador $6 millionto imprison238people for one year. Human rights monitors havedocumented several instances of systematic beatings and torture in CECOT, where 368 detainees have died since it opened in 2023. This isn’t the first time Trump has floated the idea of deporting US citizens. After Trumpresponded enthusiasticallyto Buekele’s suggestion that the US detain some of its federal prisoners in CECOT, White House press secretary Karoline Leavittsaid Trump was seriousabout the idea. “These would be heinous, violent criminals who have broken our nation’s laws repeatedly,” Leavitt told reporters. It’s unclear what authority Trump would use to send US citizens to CECOT. According to theBrennan Center for Justice, the Alien Enemies Act applies to both citizens of “enemy nations” and to its “natives,” or those who were born there, even if they’ve since renounced their “enemy nation” citizenship. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has used spurious evidence to accuse people of being linked to Tren de Aragua and send them to CECOT. According to ICE’s “Alien Enemies Act, Validation Guide” which wasobtained by the ACLU, Venezuelan men aged 14 and up can be removed under the Alien Enemies Act if they meet certain criteria, including having “gang tattoos,” as determined by ICE, or if they’ve communicated with other people ICE has accused of being gang members. Neri Alvarado Borges, one of the Venezuelan migrants sent to CECOT by the Trump administration, was accused of being a Tren de Aragua because he had three tattoos, one of which is anautism awareness ribbon. The people deported to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act weren’t given hearings or any other form of due process, and theirfamilies and attorneys denythat they’re involved with Tren de Aragua or any other gangs. Despite these legal issues, the Supreme Courthas allowed Trump to enforce the Alien Enemies Actwhile litigation continues. The court required the administration to give migrants adequate notice that they’re being removed under the act so they have “reasonable time” to filehabeas corpuscomplaints. Butcritics saythe ruling will still allow Trump to send migrants to what is effectively a foreign black site without any due process. The administration admitted tomistakenly deporting a Salvadoran man to CECOTeven though an immigration judge previously ruled that he can’t be sent back to the country because he faces persecution there. Officials said Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s deportation was due to an “administrative error” but have refused to return him to the USdespite a Supreme Court order. The administration says it can’t order Abrego Garcia’s return since he is now in Salvadoran custody. And Bukele, the president of El Salvador,also claimshe doesn’t have the power to return deportees to the US. Trump is using a centuries-old wartime law to deport people to El Salvador with dubious evidence, and keeping them there in violation of court orders. Now he wants to expand his regime of deporting whoever he wants, including US citizens.

    "title": "The best smart rings for tracking sleep and health",
    "article_text": "For folks who want something other than a smartwatch. For folks who want something other than a smartwatch. byVictoria Song If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. So, you’re thinking of buying a smart ring. Well, some good news. Picking the best of the lot is incredibly easy right now. The “bad” news is that, as far as trustworthiness and reliability, your choices are somewhat limited, as this is still a niche and emerging gadget category. Smart rings are in the middle of a resurgence. That means a lot of experimental ideas and newcomer tech brands you’ve probably never heard of. Enough competitors have cropped up that I spent the better part of last summerrocking six ringslike a high-tech mafia don. While these aren’t necessarily bad products (some are pretty good), many aren’t as polished as what you’d see in more mature categories like smartwatches, headphones, and smartphones. Speaking of which, there are a few things to know about the category. Currently, these devices are primarily health trackers. Their benefit is they’re more discreet and are better suited to sleep tracking than a smartwatch. However, the vast majority don’t include smart alarms or push notifications. This makes them best suited to casual athletes or more wellness-minded people. Hardcore athletes would be better served in most cases by a smartwatch or fitness tracker, with a smart ring as a supplementary source of data. (But that’squitean expensive endeavor.) Smart rings are also ill-suited for weightlifters, as they can easily scratch against equipment. With that in mind, here’s the best smart ring for most people in 2025 — and a handful of runners-up worth highlighting for the more tech-adventurous. Smart rings are meant to be a stylish and discreet alternative to traditional fitness trackers. That requires a combination of experiential testing and benchmarks. We wear them daily for weeks to see how well they accommodate bloated fingers and temperature changes. We don’t take them off in the shower or to wash dishes to test waterproofing. And we compare them to a smartwatch, the Oura Ring, and a smart bed to gauge sleep and health tracking accuracy. Other factors we consider are size ranges, sizing kits, app design, syncing times, and, of course, battery life. Your fingers will bloat. How accommodating is the design? What’s the size range offered? (Some of us have tiny fingers!) How easy is it to return? Many people want a smart ring to double as a piece of jewelry. Is it comfortable to wear 24 / 7? Is the design versatile for all sorts of events? Will you get compliments for wearing it? Does the finish scuff? Will you see visible scratches if you wear other rings alongside it? Rings are easy to lose. Does it have a charging case or does it use a charging dock that a cat can easily knock off your nightstand? Sleep tracking is one of the most popular use cases for a smart ring, and for that you need good battery life. How much do you get on a single charge? Many smart ring companies are newcomers. The hardware can be nice, but it means nothing if the app is a nightmare. How easy is the ring to update and sync? Does it sync with larger platforms like Apple Health or Google Health Connect? 9 Verge Score More sizesSlimmer designExpanded auto workout detectionRedesigned appBetter battery life Subscription required to get all featuresI still wish this had a charging case Surprising no one, it’s the Oura Ring 4. I can already hear some of you shouting, “But what about the subscription!” And I agree. Even Oura’s relatively affordable $6 monthly fee can feel more like $100 when you consider the sheer number of apps, gadgets, and services asking for a chunk of your monthly paycheck. However, Oura is still the best in terms of hardware, size range, features offered, app, dedication to research, and experience in the field. Many of the smart rings available today follow the example Oura set this past decade. The upgrades from the Oura Ring Gen 3 to the Oura Ring 4 were mostly software-based, with minor hardware refinements. You can readmore in my review, but the gist is a more accurate heart rate and blood oxygen algorithm, improved automatic activity detection, and an expanded range that spans size 4 to 15. The app has been redesigned to be less cluttered, and in the last few weeks, Oura alsoofficially launched an AI chatbot. (Of the AI chatbots in health trackers I’ve tested, this one is among the more polished implementations — though it often feels like Captain Obvious-level insights.) I’ve been long-term testing three iterations of the Oura Ring since 2018. Accuracy, design, and comfort have improved with each generation. The company continues to frequently and clearly communicate research and scientific developments. Third-party retail options have expanded, and I’ve seeninvestment pour into Oura. In an emerging category, these things matter. A lot. While I believe some of Oura’s newer competitors do some things better or have more creative ideas, Oura is the one I continually recommend for its combination of reliability, accuracy, and experience. If subscriptions are an absolute dealbreaker, you’ll find zero protest here. In that case, here are the best alternatives to the Oura Ring. 7 Verge Score Excellent hardwareLong battery lifeSlim, lightweight designNo subscription Android onlyBetter if used with Samsung productsAccuracy is a mixed bag The $400Samsung Galaxy Ringnails the hardware. Its charging case is more elegant than the Oura Ring’s, and I prefer the slightly concave design for comfort. It also has the second widest size range. If you’re already all-in on aSamsung Galaxy Watch 7orUltra, you get the added benefit of extended battery life. If you have the latestGalaxy Z Flip 6orZ Fold 6, Samsung also has gesture controls for the ring so you can control the camera. There are a lot of interesting ecosystem-centric ideas that Samsung has for its Galaxy Ring, but while there’s no subscription, it’ll cost you a pretty penny to unlock the ring’s full potential. Without discounts, we’re talking about $1,800 to nearly $3,000 for the phone, watch, and ring. The Galaxy Ring is also a first-gen device with some first-gen quirks. Samsung is still catching up with sleep tracking accuracy, and its Galaxy AI-powered health features are rather hit or miss. The Ultrahuman Ring Air is a subscription-free alternative to the Oura Ring that offers a more fitness-focused experience. I’m also keen on the $350Ultrahuman Ring Air. It gave the Oura Ring an honest run for its money when I tested six smart rings at once last year. It’s not quite as good with accuracy, but it’s on par with comfort and design. The app has much more of a fitness focus than wellness. Instead of a subscription, it has “Power Plugs.” You can think of them as add-on features. Some are free, like smart alarms and cycle tracking. Others will come with an additional fee, like a planned atrial fibrillation detection Power Plug and a cardio adaptability metric, which costs $2.90 a month. A lighter, entry-level version of RingConn’s latest smart ring. It offers roughly 10 days of battery life, AI features, and basic health and sleep tracking. Lastly, I’ve been testing theRingConn Gen 2 Air, a slimmer, entry-level version of its Gen 2 ring. At $200, it’s the most affordable smart ring I’ve tested but looks and feels a lot nicer than the original RingConn I tested last summer. I had issues with the RingConn’s squarish shape, but it’s much less noticeable this time around and more comfortable. It’s broadly accurate, and the app goes heavy on AI, to middling effect. It has great battery life. I’ve gotten around eight to nine days on a single charge — far better than any other smart ring I’ve tested.

    "article_text": "﻿ChatGPT’s latest multimodal AI model comes as OpenAI kicks GPT-5 launch down the road. ﻿ChatGPT’s latest multimodal AI model comes as OpenAI kicks GPT-5 launch down the road. byJess WeatherbedandEmma Roth OpenAI has introduced GPT-4.1, a successor to the GPT-4o multimodal AI model launched by the company last year. Duringa livestream on Monday, OpenAI saidGPT-4.1 has an even larger contextwindow and is better than GPT-4o in “just about every dimension,” with big improvements to coding and instruction following. GPT-4.1 is now available to developers, along with two smaller model versions. That includes GPT-4.1 Mini, which,like its predecessor,is more affordable for developers to tinker with, and GPT-4.1 Nano, an even more lightweight model that OpenAI says is its “smallest, fastest, and cheapest” one yet. All three models can process up to one million tokens of context — the text, images, or videos included in a prompt. That’s far more than GPT-4o’s 128,000-token limit. “We trained GPT‑4.1 to reliably attend to information across the full 1 million context length,” OpenAI saysin a post announcingthe models. “We’ve also trained it to be far more reliable than GPT‑4o at noticing relevant text, and ignoring distractors across long and short context lengths.” GPT 4.1 is also 26 percent cheaper than GPT-4o, a metric that has become more important following the debut ofDeepSeek’s ultra-efficient AI model. The launch comes as OpenAI plans to phase out itstwo-year-old GPT-4 modelfrom ChatGPT on April 30th, announcing in a changelog that recent upgrades to GPT‑4o make it a “natural successor” to replace it. OpenAI also plans to deprectate the GPT-4.5 preview in the API on July 14th, as “GPT‑4.1 offers improved or similar performance on many key capabilities at much lower cost and latency. ” GPT-4o, the current default model in ChatGPT, was updated last month to bringnew image-generation capabilitiesto the chatbot, which proved so popular that OpenAI had to limit requests and put access to free ChatGPT accounts on hold toprevent its GPUs from “melting.” The GPT-4.1 reveal confirmsour report from last weekabout OpenAI preparing to launch new models, and marks a pivot in the company’s release schedule. On April 4th,CEO Sam Altman announced on Xthat the GPT-5 launch was being pushed back and should now arrive “in a few months,” later thanthe May deadline that was previously expected. Altman says that the delay is partly because OpenAI “found it harder than we thought it was going to be to smoothly integrate everything.” OpenAI is also set to debut the full version of its o3 reasoning model and an o4 mini reasoning model any day now, with references having already been spotted in the latest ChatGPT web releaseby AI engineer Tibor Blaho.

Want a premium pair of earbuds without having to pay a premium price? Right now,Sony’s noise-canceling WF-1000XM5are on sale atAmazonandTargetfor $179.99 ($120 off), their best price to date. Sony’s flagship WF-1000XM5 earbuds improve upon the previous model with richer sound quality, slightly more powerful ANC, and vastly improved comfort thanks to their reduced size and weight. It’s possible Sony could release the WF-1000XM6sometime later this year, but for now,few wireless earbuds offer as much valueas the current-gen XM5. Along with delivering dynamic and detailed sound, they do a fantastic job of drowning out noise. If you use your earbuds to make phone calls, they’re even more impressive, allowing you to easily eliminate background noise and be heard even in loud environments. With four foam-style ear tips, the wireless earbuds are also comfortable enough to wear for hours at a time, which you can do without worrying about battery life. That’s because the XM5 can last up to eight hours on a single charge with ANC enabled and recharge exceptionally fast using the included charging case. They also feature several Android-only perks and other conveniences, including IPX4-rated water resistance and support for multipoint Bluetooth connectivity, the latter of which lets you connect them to two devices at once.

    "article_text": "﻿The company says it will notify users and give them a chance to opt out. ﻿The company says it will notify users and give them a chance to opt out. byWes Davis Metahas announcedthat it’s preparing to train AI on the data of EU users of its apps, including Facebook and Instagram. The company says that includes things like public posts, comments, and their chat history with Meta AI, but won’t include “private messages with friends and family.” It also only applies to those who are over 18, the company says. According to Meta, it will start notifying its EU users about the training this week, via in-app notifications and email, and will include a link to an objection form for those who want to opt out. You should be able to find such a link in itsprivacy policy, which says as of this writing that, based on regulator feedback, the company is still delaying its plans to train AI models on EU user data. Meta put its AI-training plans in Europe on hold last year after beingasked to do so by Irish regulators. Meta claims it’s training AI on EU user data to help it create models that reflect the regions they’re being used in, including “everything from dialects and colloquialisms, to hyper-local knowledge and the distinct ways different countries use humor and sarcasm.” The company adds that this matters particularly for the text, voice, video, and imagery produced by multi-modal AI. This follows Meta’s announcement last year that itwould start trainingits AI models on British users, who, like those in the EU, are guaranteed more protections regarding the use of their personal data online than people in the US. What Meta will get out of users now is a pittance compared to what it may already have — the companyadmitted last yearit had trained AI using all text and photos adult Facebook users had publicly posted since 2007.

    "title": "El Salvador's Bukele says he won't return Kilmar Abrego Garcia to U.S.",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 14, 2025 / 7:54 PM EDT/ CBS News El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele says he won't returnKilmar Abrego Garciato the United States, after Attorney General Pam Bondi told reporters it's \"up to El Salvador\" whether the manmistakenly deportedto an El Salvador prison returns to the U.S. Bukele and Bondi made the comments in the Oval Office alongside President Trump, as the two world leaders met. Over the weekend, the Justice Department said in court filings that they're willing to take \"all available steps to remove any domestic obstacles\" to facilitate his return. \"How can I return him to the United States?\" Bukele asked the press. \"I smuggle him into the United States or what do I do? Of course, I'm not going to do it. The question is preposterous.\" Bukele referred to Abrego Garcia as a \"terrorist,\" and said \"I don't have the power to return him to the United States.\" Bondi, speaking before Bukele, said it's \"up to El Salvador if they want to return him.\" Bondi said that \"first and foremost, he was illegally in our country.\" \"That's not up to us,\" Bondi said. \"The Supreme Court ruled, President, that if El Salvador wants to return him ... we would facilitate it, meaning provide a plane.\" But theSupreme Courtoffered no qualifier of whether El Salvador wants to return Abrego Garcia. The court ruled that a lower court order properly required the government to \"facilitate\" his release from El Salvador's custody. The Supreme Court on Thursday said the Trump administration must facilitate the release of the man, who lives inMaryland, from custody, but ordered additional proceedings before a federal district court. U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis has ordered the Justice Department to provide daily updates on their efforts to return Abrego Garcia. In Monday's filing, the Justice Department noted Bukele's Oval Office comments. The filing also said that \"DHS does not have the authority to forcibly extract an alien from the domestic custody of a foreign sovereign nation.\" Abrego Garcia's lawyers insist he has no affiliation with MS-13, and has never been charged or convicted of any criminal offenses in the U.S. or El Salvador. The Trump administrationacknowledgedthat his deportation to the high-security prison in El Salvador known as CECOT was an \"administrative error.\" \"It is my understanding based on official reporting from our Embassy in San Salvador that Abrego Garcia is currently being held in the Terrorism Confinement Center in El Salvador,\" Michael G. Kozak, a senior State Department official, said in a Friday court filing. \"He is alive and secure in that facility. He is detained pursuant to the sovereign, domestic authority of El Salvador.\" In a statement after the meeting, Abrego Garcia's wife Jennifer Vasquez Sura said \"the Trump and Bukele administrations continue to play political games with his life.\" The Trump administration sent deportation flights with scores of foreign nationals that they describe as members of the Tren de Aragua and MS-13 gangs. Ananalysis by \"60 Minutes\" last week showed that 75% of the Venezuelans sent to CECOT in El Salvador had no criminal records. At least 22% of the men on the list have criminal records here in the United States or abroad. The vast majority are for non-violent offenses like theft, shoplifting and trespassing. About a dozen are accused of murder, rape, assault and kidnapping. It was unclear if any criminal record existed for the other 3%. Among those deported was Abrego Garcia, who lives in Maryland with his wife and children. He is a native of El Salvador, and his wife is a U.S. citizen. Mr. Trump also expressed openness to sending U.S. citizens convicted of violent crimes to prisons in El Salvador, saying his administration is studying the laws right now to see if that's possible. Mr. Trump said the U.S. can cooperate with Bukele to rehabilitate criminals for \"less money.\" \"If it's a homegrown criminal, I have no problem,\" he said. \"We're studying the laws right now, Pam [Bondi] is studying. If we can do that, that's good.\" Legal scholars say sending U.S. citizens to prisons abroad brings up serious constitutional concerns. In a 1936 case,Valentine v. United States, the Supreme Court determined a president cannot extradite a U.S. citizen except by an act of Congress. Bukele, a tough-on-crime leader, said it was an \"honor to be here\" and \"we're very eager to help\" with stopping crime and terrorism. Bukele told Mr. Trump what he's doing with the border is \"remarkable,\" praising the plunge in crossings at the U.S. southern border. Under Bukele's tenure, El Salvador has seen a dramatic decrease in its crime rate. In announcing his meeting with Bukele, Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post, that their nations \"are working closely together to eradicate terrorist organizations, and build a future of Prosperity.\" \"President Bukele has graciously accepted into his Nation's custody some of the most violent alien enemies of the World and, in particular, the United States,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"These barbarians are now in the sole custody of El Salvador, a proud and sovereign Nation, and their future is up to President B and his Government. They will never threaten or menace our Citizens again!\" Melissa  Quinncontributed to this report.

    "title": "Judge denies bail for PA man accused of starting fire at Governor's Residence",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 14, 2025 / 7:27 PM EDT/ CBS Philadelphia The man accused ofstarting a large firein the Pennsylvania Governor's Residence told police he was \"harboring hatred\" toward Gov. Josh Shapiro, according to new court documents. Cody Balmer, of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, was arrested Sunday after officials said he hopped a fence and intentionally set the fire around 2 a.m. on April 13. Shapiro and his family were home at the time, and had just celebrated the first night of Passover inside the residence the night before. The governor said Sunday that no one was injured. Court documents filed in Dauphin County show Balmer, 38, was officially charged with criminal homicide (attempted murder), terrorism, aggravated arson, aggravated assault, burglary and other counts. Balmer was arraigned on the charges on Monday evening, and a judge denied bail. Earlier Monday, Pennsylvania State Police said Balmer was treated at a hospital for a \"medical event not related to this incident or his arrest.\" Balmer's next appearance in court is scheduled for April 23. \"This weekend, our family witnessed the incredible bravery and excellence of our first responders,\" Shapirosaid in a social media post Monday. \"The entire Shapiro family is eternally grateful for the @PAStatePolice troopers who safely evacuated our family from danger, the firefighters who quickly put out the fire at the Governor's Residence, and the law enforcement officials who've worked to investigate this attack.\" Over the weekend, Shapiroexpressed his gratitudefor the prayers and \"messages of support\" his family received in the wake of the fire. \"I want you all to know that your prayers lift us up, and in this moment of darkness, we are choosing to see light. We appreciate the light that you have shined upon us,\" he said. Harrisburg Fire Chief Brian Enterline estimated Monday that the damage to the historic residence will be in the millions. The 29,000-square-foot home was completed along the Susquehanna River waterfront in 1968 and houses a number of historic pieces of artwork and furniture. Enterline added that if a door separating the main state dining room, which is where the Shapiros celebrated Passover, hadn't been closed at the time of the fire, the flames would have spread further into the residence and put the family at greater risk. \"[Balmer] is a domestic terrorist,\" Enterline said. \"And I hope he spends a lot of time behind jail for the heinous acts that he performed here in our capital city that put not only the first family, but my firefighters at risk.\" In the Oval Office on Monday, President Trump condemned the attack. \"The attacker basically wasn't a fan of anybody, probably just a whack job,\" Trump said. \"And certainly a thing like that cannot be allowed to happen.\" According to charging documents, during their investigation, Pennsylvania State Police were contacted by a woman who described Balmer as her \"ex-paramour\" and told officers that Balmer was responsible for setting the fire. When asked why she believed Balmer was responsible, the woman told investigators that he confessed to her and wanted her to turn him in to police, the complaint said. A short time later, Balmer went to the Pennsylvania State Police Headquarters on Elmerton Avenue in Harrisburg and, according to charging documents, told a trooper he set the fire and wanted to turn himself in. Prior to making contact with Balmer, Pennsylvania State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens said Sunday that the suspected arsonist climbed over a fence and \"evaded troopers\" as they searched for him on the property before the fire. Security footage from inside and outside the residence captured a man, later identified as Balmer, breaking a window in the home's piano room and throwing a homemade Molotov cocktail into the house. Court documents said Balmer then broke another window, climbed into the residence and set off another incendiary device in the dining room. Balmer then left through the dining room door and was seen on camera running from the Governor's Residence. Bivens said Balmer was inside the house for less than one minute. Additional footage from privately owned security cameras in the area helped investigators track Balmer's movements and find a discarded pair of gloves he was seen wearing in videos while setting the fires, investigators said. When asked about how Balmer was able to climb over the fence and evade security before entering the mansion, Enterline said that question would need to be answered by state police and the governor's detail. During an interview with Pennsylvania State Police, Balmer admitted he hated Shapiro, removed gasoline from a lawn mower and poured it into beer bottles before walking an hour to the Governor's Residence and throwing the homemade Molotov cocktails into the home, the criminal complaint said. Balmer also told investigators that he knew it was possible the Shapiros would be home at the time. \"We have a beautiful capital down there that you can picket at, that you can storm whenever you want with your picket signs and your anger,\" Enterline said, \"but it's got to stop before your want to fire bomb an elected official, or anyone for that matter.\" When asked what he would've done if confronted by the governor while inside the residence, the complaint said Balmer stated he would've \"beaten him with his hammer.\" During a search of Balmer's home, police found the sledgehammer seen in surveillance video, along with the clothes Balmer was seen wearing during the attack. Cody Balmer, a 38-year-old who's a longtime Harrisburg resident, spent eight years as a construction equipment repairer in the Army Reserve, according to an Army spokesperson. Public records point to an unstable background for Balmer, including custody battles over his kids and a near foreclosure on a home. His public Facebook profile shows everything from family photos to memes. In 2022, a post was shared showing a crochet pattern depicting a Molotov cocktail and the words, \"Be the light you want to see in the world.\" Court records show Balmer pleaded guilty a decade ago to a scheme involving forged documents. In 2023, he was arrested and charged with assault in connection with a violent domestic dispute involving his wife and son. According to the affidavit, Balmer told investigators he had taken a bottle of pills in an attempt to kill himself. That case is ongoing. Late Sunday night, an auto-repair shop where Balmer is believed to have worked in the past posted to Facebook, \"In light of current events regarding a former employee of ours, we would like to say that he has not worked for us for over two years. While we are saddened to learn of these current charges, we fully support our men and women in law enforcement as well as our government officials.  We have no further comment at this time.\" Balmer's voter registration record is active and not affiliated with a party. Christie Balmer told CBS News that her son is \"mentally ill and he went off his medication\" before the attack on the Governor's Residence and that she had tried to get her son \"picked up\" last week by four different police departments. According to Christie Balmer, she couldn't get anybody to help. \"So he was mentally ill, went off his meds, and this is what happened,\" she said.

    "title": "Why donated organs are left unused",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News This story contains graphic content which some may find disturbing, including depictions of medical procedures blood and human anatomy In the U.S., thousands of donated organs never reach the patients who need them. CBS News found that last year, one in three kidneys recovered from deceased donors were never transplanted. Specialized organ recovery teams made more than 26 million attempts to place these kidneys with transplant centers, offering them again and again in search of a suitable match--before they were ultimately discarded as medical waste. And it's not just kidneys. Nearly 12,000 potentially life-saving organs were discarded last year in the United States. Mitch Potter, a 31-year-old Michigan resident, tragically passed away in a car accident, leaving behind his girlfriend, three children, and a mother grieving his loss. Despite this heartbreak, Mitch saved multiple lives by donating his organs, giving others the chance to live on.“I'm very proud and very happy,” said his mom, Cheryl Potter. “There are people out there who need what he has, and he was willing to give it. He's living on in other people,” she said. Mitch'sheartwent toMinnesota Hiskidneyswent to patients inMichiganandIllinois. Hislivertraveled hundreds of miles to Washington, D.C., but it was ultimately not used. The Washington hospital told a spokesperson representing the recovery team that placed Mitch's organs that the liver did not meet their standards. \"I didn't know he was a donor,\" said Cheryl Potter. \"I'm super proud of him.\" A CBS News analysis of federal procurement and transplant data found kidneys are discarded the most. Nearly one-third of kidneys recovered never make it to a patient. \"The number should be more like 1 in 20,\" said Dr. Richard Formica, president of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network that oversees the U.S. transplant system. \"I consider this to be an existential threat to the whole transplant system.\" To understand why so many organs are discarded, it's important to understand how the system works. Organs go unused for many reasons, including logistical challenges, organ quality, rising donation rates and performance measures. The process involves two players: organ procurement organizations (OPOs) and transplant centers. The procurement organizations identify donors, recover organs, offer them to patients on the waiting list, and arrange transportation. Transplant centers evaluate patients, accept suitable organs, and perform transplant surgeries. Both are rated by the federal government to try to improve patient outcomes. Procurement organizations are incentivized to recover as many viable organs as possible and try to match them with recipients. Transplant centers may be more selective, choosing patients and organs that create the best chance of long-term success. Those competing performance measures contribute to a system where more organs are recovered than ever before--and more organs are being thrown away. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, low-ranking organ procurement organizations risk losing federal funding if they do not meet performance measures. Transplant centers with lower ratings may struggle to attract patients or insurance contracts, Formica said. \"That creates a certain level of risk aversion and encourages transplant centers to say no more often than yes,\" says Dr. Sumit Mohan, a Columbia University kidney specialist.  \"As a result, transplant centers don't do as many transplants as they could.\" The National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine alsoexpressed concern, stating in a 2022 report, \"There is evidence to suggest that some transplant providers might be rejecting good organ offers that could benefit the recipient because of a reluctance to perform riskier surgeries for fear it could damage the transplant center's statistics.\" Theorganizationthat tracks performance measures says that it accounts for those risks. It also holds seminars to explain that taking risks, such as transplanting a less-than-perfect organ, will not necessarily hurt a transplant center's ratings. Federal health officials are exploring ways to reduce organ discards and improve the placement process. In arecent OPTN meeting, they highlighted Hackensack University Medical Center, where Goldstein, a transplant surgeon, and his team transplant riskier kidneys that other centers may turn down. Patients start their transplant journey with a PowerPoint explaining the benefits of choosing a less-than-perfect kidney. Goldstein engages patients in the decision-making process, encouraging them to weigh the risks of waiting for a \"perfect\" kidney against the dangers of staying on dialysis. \"When you're sitting on a waiting list, that's the worst place to be because the risk of dying increases for every day someone remains in kidney failure. So, the choice of which organs you're willing to accept is about choosing life,\" he said. Dialysis keeps patients alive by filtering waste from their blood, but it's not a long-term solution to those with kidney failure. The longer someone stays on dialysis, the higher they are at risk of complications including cardiovascular disease, infections and declining quality of life. Clifford Toliver, 73, faced that choice. Diagnosed with renal disease, he started dialysis in 2022. \"They put the needles in your arm, and you sit in a chair for four hours. You watch TV. You go to sleep. That's all you can do,\" he said. \"This is going to be the rest of your life. And this is how you're going to die.\" Under Goldstein's care, Toliver took a chance on a kidney others might have refused. \"The kidney was 65 years old. That's younger than me. And I know today people live to 99, 100,\" he said. \"If I refuse the kidney, I might not match again ever.\" Hackensack's transplant program accepts kidney offers at three times the national rate and still has a 97.5% patient survival rate one year after surgery, according to theScientific Registry for Transplant Recipients. \"We're trying to figure out how to remove disincentives, as well as to incentivize transplant hospitals to do more,\" Goldstein said. Reducing organ discards requires a shared commitment. \"The more transplant hospitals and OPOs partner together to be part of the solution, to find homes for kidneys that are hard to place, the better we are as a community,\" Goldstein said. For patients like Melanie Knoll, that shift could mean the difference between life and death. She is a diabetic whose kidney failed. No one in her family is a suitable match. She's spent the last three years on dialysis waiting for a donor. \"If a kidney has the potential to be viable, I would much rather explore that than to continue to just live a life on dialysis,\" said Knoll, who lives in Michigan. She would accept a less-than-perfect kidney, especially considering the alternative. \"I hope I don't die waiting for a kidney.\" Reporting:Tom Hanson, Aparna Zalani |Data Analysis:Rachel Gold |Photographer/Editor:Justin Sherman |Visual Design and Web Development:Grace Manthey, Taylor Johnson, Aaron Munoz |Editing and project leadership:Nicole Vap, Chad Cross, John Kelly, Aparna Zalani Copyright ©2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 14, 2025 / 6:20 PM EDT/ CBS News A Mississippi deacon suffered fatal injuries in a shooting that broke out Saturday after an Easter egg hunt hosted by his church,  according to the church and local police. Empowerment Ministries Christian Center, which describes itself as a non-denominational ministry located in the southern Mississippi city of Gulfport, identified the deacon as Eddie Shed, who also served as its head of security. The church said the shooting was not carried out by anyone affiliated with its ministry, and Shed was killed while attempting to intervene. Gunfire erupted at around 2:05 p.m. local time. The Easter egg hunt had been held in Gulfport's Jack and Florence Goldin Park, according to the Gulfport Police Department.

    "title": "Mark Zuckerberg called to testify in Meta's antitrust trial",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 14, 2025 / 6:07 PM EDT/ CBS News Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stand Monday in a Washington, D.C., courtroom to defend his social media company from federal allegations that the technology giant is a monopoly. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, is facing off with the Federal Trade Commission on Monday, for Day one of a landmark antitrust trial that could result in the company's breakup. For Zuckerberg, the case could determine whether the business empire he started building while still a student at Harvard University will be forced to break apart. The trial will be the first big test of the FTC's willingness under President Trump to challenge Big Tech, a long-time target of Republicans. The lawsuit was initially filed against Meta — then called Facebook — in 2020, during Mr. Trump's first term, before being amended in 2021. In itscomplaint, the FTC accuses Meta of \"anticompetitive conduct,\" alleging that the company's ownership of Instagram and WhatsApp gives it excessive control of the social media market. \"There's nothing wrong with Meta innovating,\" said Daniel Matheson, lead attorney for the FTC in his opening statements for the agency Monday, \"It's what happened next that is a problem.\" During his testimony Monday, Zuckerberg defended his decision to buy Instagram and pushed back against FTC claims that he did not invest in developing the app. Purchased by Facebook in2012and2014, respectively, Instagram and WhatsApp have grown into social media powerhouses. To restore competition, Meta must part ways with Instagram and WhatsApp, the government agency says incourt filings. The FTC also wants Meta to provide the government with prior notice for any future mergers and acquisitions. With the landmark trial underway, here's what you need to know. The trial, which begins Monday in federal court in Washington, D.C., is expected to last several weeks. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg will preside over the case, which could see a range of witnesses including Meta CEO and founder Zuckerberg; former Meta Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg; former Meta Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer; Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom; and executives from rival social media platforms. The FTC and Meta made their opening arguments on Monday, with witness testimony expected to start in the afternoon. In his opening statement, lead FTC attorney Matheson said Meta was struggling to compete with the fast-growing WhatsApp and Instagram platforms and in buying them, the tech giant was \"eliminating immediate threats,\" to their market. Meta said the company \"did nothing wrong\" by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. Meta attorney Mark Hansen said in his opening statement that the two apps have grown substantially under the tech company's ownership and that there is no evidence to prove Meta is a monopoly. If Meta had monopoly power, it would exercise control over pricing in the social media space, Hansen said. But Meta's services are free, he noted. \"How can the FTC maintain this monopolization case when [Meta] has never charged users a cent,\" Hansen said. After the opening statements, Zuckerberg was the first person called to the stand to testify. Histestimony largely focused on Facebook's efforts to build a rival photo app that could compete with Instagram, before it decided to ultimately buy the company in 2012. Zuckerberg admitted Facebook was struggling with mobile users in the early 2010s. \"Our whole company had been built up to that point\" for desktop. Referencing email communications sent by the Meta executive, the FTC pointed out that Zuckerberg had been eyeing the progress of competitor Instagram. Facebook at the time was working on launching a new photo app. According to the FTC, Zuckerberg sent an email in Feb 2011 saying \"Instagram seems like it's growing quickly\" that mentioned their numbers and uploads. In 2012, Zuckerberg sent another email in which he described his rationale for buying Instagram, saying it was a good photo-sharing network, according to the FTC. At that point Facebook was \"so far behind that we don't even understand how far behind we are,\" he said, adding, \"I worry that it will take us too long to catch up.\" Zuckerberg is scheduled to return to court Tuesday morning to continue testimony. The showdown is the most significant legal challenge brought against Meta in the company's roughly 20-year history. If the FTC is successful, Meta could be forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp. Instagram, which Meta has owned for over a decade, accounts for half of the company's overall advertising revenue. \"Instagram has also been picking up the slack for Facebook on the user front, particularly among young people, for a long time,\" Emarketer analyst Jasmine Enbergtoldthe Associated Press. \"The trial also comes as Meta is trying to bring back OG Facebook in an effort to appeal to Gen Z and younger users as they join social media. Social media usage is far more fragmented today than it was in 2012 when Facebook acquired Instagram, and Facebook isn't where the cool college kids hang out anymore. Meta needs Instagram to continue growing, especially as more advertisers think Instagram-first with their Meta budgets,\" she added. Meta, headquartered in Menlo Park, California,earnedover $164 billion in revenue in 2024. Facebook and Instagram are the twomost profitablesocial media platforms in the world. In a statement issued Sunday, April 13, Metasaidthe \"stakes could not be higher in this trial for U.S. consumers and businesses.\" The social media company hascalledthe FTC's case \"weak\" and said it \"ignores reality,\" adding that it faces stiff competition from TikTok and YouTube. Both platforms outrank Facebook and Instagram in terms of how long users spend on each. \"Ultimately, an ill-conceived lawsuit like this will make companies think twice before investing in innovation, knowing they may be punished if that innovation leads to success,\" Meta'sstatementreads. \"On top of it, this weak case is costing taxpayers millions of dollars.\" \"The FTC's lawsuit against Meta defies reality,\" a Meta spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others.\" \"Regulators should be supporting American innovation, rather than seeking to break up a great American company and further advantaging China on critical issues like AI,\" the spokesperson added. The FTC did not reply to a request for comment. The history of the Meta case stretches back several years. The FTC initially filed the suit in 2020 during President Trump's first term in office. In June 2021, U.S. District Judge James Boasbergdismissedthe antitrust lawsuit brought by the FTC, claiming the lawsuits were \"legally insufficient\" and did not supply sufficient evidence to prove Facebook was a monopoly. But the federal judge later cleared the path for the case to proceed after the FTC introduced more evidence in an amended complaint,accordingto The Washington Post.

Vance — anOhio State alumnus— tried to lift up the trophy, but it appeared to separate from its base as the vice president bobbled it in his hands. With the Marine Corps Band's rendition of Queen's \"We Are The Champions\" still blaring in the background, Ohio State running back TreVeyon Henderson, who was standing next to Vance, swiftly recovered the fumble. Vance later shrugged off the near-turnover,posting on X, \"I didn't want anyone after Ohio State to get the trophy so I decided to break it.\" The moment came after Vance and President Trump spoke at the celebration, flanked by Ohio State players and coaches. The Buckeyes defeated Notre Dame 34-23 in the title game on Jan. 20 — the same day as Mr. Trump's inauguration. In a set of brief remarks, Mr. Trump congratulated the Buckeyes on their victory and praised the state of Ohio more generally: \"We won that state in a landslide.\" Vance talked up the team, but also took a moment to needle Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. The twoagreed to a friendly wageron an Ohio State-University of Texas playoff game earlier this year, with the loser agreeing to wear the winning team's jersey and drop off food and beer from their home state — a bet Vance claimed Cruz has \"still not paid up on.\" \"I don't like losing any bet, but I really don't want to lose a bet to Ted Cruz,\" Vance said. Vance, an Ohio native who got his bachelor's degree from Ohio State before attending Yale Law School, also excoriated an audience member who he claimed wore a hat for Ohio's archnemesis, the University of Michigan. \"I'm about to tell the Secret Service he's got a dangerous weapon,\" Vance said. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 14, 2025 / 4:38 PM EDT/ CBS News Stocks rallied for a second consecutive trading day after electronics including smartphones and computerswere exemptedfrom the Trump administration's punishing tariffs on imports from goods made in China, giving some breathing room to stocks including Apple and Nvidia. The S&P 500 jumped 42 points, or 0.8%, to 5,406 on Monday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 312 points, or 0.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 0.6%. Among the notable gainers in early Monday trading were technology stocks including Apple, with the tech giant facing potentially massive price increases to its mainstay productslike the iPhone, most of which are manufactured in China. Still, it's unclear how long the reprieve will last, given that President Trump on Sundaydenied that he exemptedany products from his trade war and plans to study new tariffs on electronics components such as semiconductors. \"Even if President Trump does reach differing trade deals with some countries in the meantime, the lack of a consistent, clear path for trade policy has added to the overall level of uncertainty for markets, with no clear end to that in sight,\" John Canavan, lead U.S. analyst with Oxford Economics, said in a research note. \"So long as the situation lingers, demand for risk assets is likely to suffer, and volatility will remain significantly elevated as a result.\" Among the tech stocks that gained on Monday was Apple, with its shares rising $4.37, or 2.2%, to $202.52. Other outperforming sectors on Monday included drug and biotech companies, banks and insurers, according to financial data firm FactSet. The tech exemptions come after China and the U.S. traded tariff increases over several days. China said on Friday it wouldraise tariffson U.S. goods from 84% to 125%, while Mr. Trump's universal tariffs on China now total 145%. At the same time, Mr. Trump paused tariffs on most other countriesfor 90 daysafter global stock markets plunged earlier this month, and the bond market had ahostile reactionto the tariffs. Economists are warning that the friction between the world's two largest economies could cause widespread damage and a possible global recession, even after after the 90-day pause on some tariffs. \"If the rebound is going to have legs in the near term, investors will probably need to see continued signs of flexibility from the White House on tariffs,\" noted Chris Larkin, managing director of trading and investing at E*TRADE from Morgan Stanley. Larkin added, \"Uncertainty is still high, and day-to-day volatility could remain elevated, especially if soft data stokes recession concerns.\" Aimee Picchi is the associate managing editor for CBS MoneyWatch, where she covers business and personal finance.

Dallas led off the three-round, 38-pick WNBA draft Monday in New York by selecting Bueckers first overall, as expected, just eight days after she led Connecticut to the NCAA championship. “Dallas, I’m so excited,” Bueckers said on the ESPN broadcast minutes after she was drafted. “A new city, a new start, a fresh start, and so I’m excited. Let’s get it.” Bueckers said she had an “overwhelming sense of gratitude” for being selected first after a collegiate career in which injuries often sidelined her. “I didn’t do it alone,” she said. “So it took a village.” Seattle selected French center Dominique Malonga second, and Washington took Notre Dame's Sonia Citron and USC's Kiki Iriafen third and fourth, respectively. At fifth overall, Lithuanian guard Juste Jocyte became the first draft pick taken in the history of the Golden State Valkyries, the expansion franchise set to play its first season in 2025. Like Malonga, Jocyte is a 19-year-old who will enter the league younger than their collegiate counterparts. Bueckers averaged 19.8 points, shooting 53% from the field and 42% on 3-pointers during her superlative four-year career at UConn, which ended with her winning her long-elusive national title — Connecticut’s first in nine years — in her final game. Bueckers put herself in contention to become a future No. 1 overall pick as early as 2021 after she became the first freshman to win multiple awards for collegiate player of the year. Yet leg injuries sidelined her for half of her sophomore season, and then in the following offseason she tore the anterior cruciate ligament in her left knee and missed the entire 2022-23 season. The Wings picked first after they finished 9-31 last season, the WNBA’s second-worst record. As Connecticut was preparing for the Final Four of the NCAA women’s basketball tournament last week, Bueckers was tight-lipped when she was asked about speculation that she didn’t prefer to play in Dallas, saying there was “nowhere specific” she wanted to be. “Wherever I end up,” Bueckers told reporters days before the Huskies’ championship victory in Tampa, Florida. The Wings made little secret their intention to draft Bueckers and the excitement it could generate for a franchise that is trying to build buy-in from local fans. The team originated as the Detroit Shock in 1998, moved to Tulsa in 2010 and relocated again to Texas in 2016. It currently plays in Arlington. Greg Bibb, the Wings’s president and chief executive, told The Dallas Morning News before the draft that he was confident drafting Bueckers \"will move the needle for the Dallas Wings and women’s basketball in north Texas.” The WNBA won’t be the only league in which Bueckers plays next year. On Sunday, she reportedly agreed to a three-year contract to play in Unrivaled, a start-up league founded by WNBA stars Napheesa Collier and Breanna Stewart that takes part during the WNBA’s winter offseason. Whether Bueckers would actually end up with the Wings wasn’t the only intrigue involving the draft. Notre Dame’s Olivia Miles, projected to be the second overall pick, LSU’s Flau’Jae Johnson and Connecticut’s Azzi Fudd all have said they will remain in college an extra season rather than turn professional. Those choices could be influenced by the Women’s National Basketball Players’ Association’s decision in October to opt out of its current college bargaining agreement with the league. Should the players association and league strike a deal by next year, an increase in media rights fees paid to the league could allow players who enter the league in 2026 to earn higher salaries than those in the 2025 draft class. The WNBA is coming off a season in which viewership soared behind the cross-cultural popularity of rookies Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese. The league’s championship finals were its most-viewed in 25 years, and regular-season viewership was up 170 percent compared to 2023,ESPN said last fall. Women’s basketball players endure an extremely quick turnaround between the ends of their college careers and their rookie WNBA seasons; training camps open April 27, with the regular season beginning May 16. WNBA teams will play 44 games, the longest schedule in league history.",

    "title": "Tanner's mom from 'Love on the Spectrum' shares scene that made her 'uncomfortable'",
    "article_text": "Tanner Smith, one of the breakout personalities from theNetflix series“Love on the Spectrum,” encapsulates his life philosophy with a simple phrase in hisInstagram bio: “Bring the joy.” At 26, Smith brings that same buoyant spirit to his job in maintenance at the Shepherd Hotel in downtown Clemson, South Carolina, where he greets guests with warmth and enthusiasm. In a recent phone interview, his mother, Nicci Smith — a former nurse turned fitness instructor — recalls casually stumbling upon her son in the middle of aFaceTime call with actor Mark Wahlberg. Wahlberg, she explains, has a daughter enrolled at Clemson University, and Tanner struck up a conversation with him in the lobby of the Shepherd Hotel, where they became fast friends. “Tanner can talk to anyone,” Nicci tells TODAY, her voice brimming with pride. There was a time when Tanner — diagnosed with autism at 2-and-a-half — wouldn’t make eye contact with teachers and peers. As child, while the other kids rushed to the slide, Tanner would quietly drift toward the swings. “If it wasn’t me or a family member, he would turn his face away,” Nicci says. “The world is seeing happy, social Tanner now, but there were years when he didn’t play with other children. I couldn’t take him to basketball games because the buzzers were too loud. And every time we went out as a family, we were all on edge — wondering what might upset Tanner.” Looking at Tanner today, Nicci is still in disbelief. A graduate ofClemson University’s LifeSkills program, he’s living with roommates, thriving in a job that he loves and stepping bravely into the spotlight — putting himself out there as he searches for love on streaming television. “If you had told me when Tanner was a little boy that he would be doing now what he’s doing now,” she says, “he’s a freaking miracle.” In Season 3 of “Love on the Spectrum,” viewers — including Nicci — tuned in as Tanner embarked on a blind date with Shyann at a goat farm. Though the two bonded over their shared love of animals, the exchange was punctuated by awkward pauses. Ultimately, Tanner realized their personalities didn’t quite align; he was looking for someone outgoing and talkative, while Shyann was more reserved and soft-spoken. “To me, that date was very uncomfortable, because I know him,” Nicci says. “I felt bad for both of them — I think she had a bit of stage fright and didn’t know what to say, and he felt like it was his responsibility to carry the conversation but didn’t know how to draw her out.” “Everybody sees Tanner as the happy, joyful guy,” she says. “But when you’re autistic, anxiety is always there — and he was really struggling. I was ready for the goat date to be over. It just wasn’t clicking. But he learned from it, and he did a good job.”",

    "title": "Inside an anti-vaccine autism summit in the age of RFK Jr.",
    "article_text": "SAN DIEGO — The attendees ofthe second-annual Autism Health Summit had already sat through hours of presentations about treatments that promise miracles to help heal the condition — water filters and electromagnetic gadgets, supplements, stem cell treatments only available in Europe, and fecal transplants here in the U.S. Of all the speakers at the conference, the one who got the biggest round of applause wasn’t even in the room. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., aformer fixtureat this kind of gathering, addressed the audience in a short, prerecorded video — not as the anti-vaccine lawyer and activist as he had so many times before, but as a member of President Donald Trump’s Cabinet, the secretary of health and human Services. And from that seat of power, Kennedy affirmed he was still their man, praising summit organizers Tracey and Steve Slepcevic as “dear friends” who had “given their lives in service to the autistic and their families.\" “Your issue is no longer on the fringe,” he said, finishing with a promise of a future “where autism is once again, very rare, where families with autism are well supported, where people on the spectrum are valued for the unique gifts they have to offer in our society.” These types of gatherings are on the rise. While they may advertise different themes, there’s a shared belief system among them: a rejection of mainstream science, skepticism about the government and loud complaints that the powerful are hiding something from the everyday American. With Kennedy now in Washington, and the president himself suggesting there’s merit to those claims, the gatherings are becoming less fringe and more politically relevant. The conference room at the Town and Country hotel was already abuzz with Kennedy’s latest bombshell. While rattling off his department’s early endeavors ata televised Cabinet meetinglast week — they included getting “bad chemicals” out of food and “good food” into school lunches — he stated plainly that he would, in five months, discover the cause of autism. “By September,” he had said to the president, “we will know what has caused the autism epidemic. And we’ll be able to eliminate those exposures.” “That would be so big,” Trump replied. And it would — if it weren’t sounlikely. Kennedy latertold Fox Newsthat National Institutes of Health Director Jay Bhattacharya had only just begun soliciting proposals from scientists around the world, and HHS hasn’t said more about the timeline. Even if they handed out grants immediately, it would give them barely more than a season to solve a puzzle that has preoccupied researchers for over 80 years. Since Austrian-American psychiatristDr. Leo Kannerfirst gave it a name in 1943,doctors, scientists, parents, and people with autism have sought answers to the complex set of conditions that vary widely in presentation and severity. About 1 out of 36 children has been identified as having an autism spectrum disorder, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Researchpoints togenetics as the primary factor, likely in combination with certain environmental and developmental influences that scientists are still researching. But theextensively studiedand disproven theory that vaccines are to blame for autism has been embraced by parents and groups like those at the summit. The condition generally emerges during childhood, around when routine immunizations are administered. To this group, it’s no coincidence. Science isn’t built to prove a universal negative. Every variable cannot be tested in every circumstance across all time. So it is that despitelarge, peer-reviewed studiesin the U.S., Japan, Denmark, and elsewhere showing no causal link between vaccines and autism, it’s never beenprovento the satisfaction of the anti-vaccine community. The question has alsobeen litigated, and claims have fallen short against the overwhelming evidence presented by doctors and scientists. Still, because there’s always a sliver of possibility — however remote — that something could be true somewhere, somehow, the theory persists. Before his autism announcement, Kennedy’s short tenure as HHS secretary had already stirred condemnation amongpublic health expertswho said that his anti-vaccine views undermined trust in science. Author James Terence Fisher, who has an autistic son, said in an op-ed in thePittsburgh Post-Gazettethat Kennedy’s rise to power had “re-traumatized” many autism families and warned that the administration could make people like his son “guinea pigs for experiments and treatments based on conspiratorial and money-making theories that have frequently led to abusive and ineffective treatments.” It’s happened before, he wrote. Andrew Wakefield, the British former physician whose retracted 1998 study in The Lancet helped launch the modern anti-vaccine movement, used “invasive and demeaning techniques,” Fischer wrote, adding that Wakefield had paid children at his own child’s birthday party for blood samples. Kennedy's faithful bristled when he recentlyrecommendedthat children in Texas get vaccinated to protect against measles, after an outbreak there sickened hundreds and killed at least two. To them, the guidance was a betrayal of a movement he helped create. But with Kennedy's promise to root out and eliminate by this fall the specific environmental causes of autism — whether in food, water or, as Trump suggested at the Cabinet meeting, “the shots”— Kennedy offered a return to the foundational myth of the modern anti-vaccine movement. The crowd at the Autism Health Summit heard him loud and clear, and now they were on their feet. The three-day summit didn’t have an option for press coverage on its website, so I paid the $395 for a ticket using my name and work email. I wore my name badge and introduced myself as a journalist, handing out my business card to everyone I spoke with. Photos and videos were permitted, and the event was livestreamed to remote attendees. Advertised as a “journey to wellness,” the Autism Health Summit was one of several anti-vaccine-adjacent events to take place in recent weeks. The Summit for Truth & Wellness was held at the end of March in Rochester, New York. Drs. Pierre Kory and Mary Talley Bowden, both known for prescribing Ivermectin for Covid-19 and long Covid despite a lack of evidence, shared a stage with the writer andconspiracy theoristNaomi Wolf and Mary Holland, president of the Children’s Health Defense, the anti-vaccine group Kennedy once chaired. Earlier this month, a hotel in Atlanta hosted Honest Medicine: Redefining Health, a conference organized by the Independent Medical Alliance — formerly the Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance, a group whose doctors prescribe anti-viral medications that go against medical consensus. Some of their doctors have been disciplined by medical boards for spreading misinformation. There used to be just one such marquee gathering. AutismOne, held annually by a nonprofit of the same name in a Chicago hotel near the airport, wasthe flagship conventionfor self-described Autism Moms and Dads. But with the growth of other anti-vaccine groups thatthrived during the pandemic— including Kennedy’s own Children’s Health Defense — and the ease of online organizing, AutismOne’s funding dried up. Itquietly dissolvedin January. Into that void stepped Tracy Slepcevic, an Air Force veteran and author of the book \"Warrior Mom\" (not to be confused with former anti-vaccine spokeswoman Jenny McCarthy’s \"Mother Warriors\"). Slepcevicsupported Kennedy’s failed run for presidentin 2024 and registered Autism Health Inc. as a nonprofit last year. She currently coaches other parents on how to “heal” their autistic kids. She said she tried hyperbaric oxygen, special diets, stem cell therapy and “everything but the kitchen sink” to “heal” her now-adult son’s autism, which she believes was caused by vaccines. Slepcevic told the crowd that she spent all the money she had, even short-selling her house to pay for the treatments. “If anyone says, ‘I can’t afford it,’ I’m not going to feel sorry for you,” Slepcevic said from the stage. After a song performed by movementstalwartsGeoff and Simone Sewell, Slepcevic called up a couple to the stage — her new clients, she explained. The father told the crowd that after just two weeks of following Slepcevic’s advice restricting dairy and cutting out apple juice, their 6-year-old son had seemed to improve. He spoke of how they had been lost and hopeless and sad. They were depressed, just like many in the crowd, he suspected. But now, they were optimistic. They were going to do whatever it takes, he said. They were going to be warrior parents. Outside the ballroom were the vendors, about 50 tables packed together, all offering the same message: healing was possible — for a price. Each table pushed a product or service promising some pathway to wellness. There were water filters — one to detoxify, another to “alkalize”— and a nearly $6,000 electromagnetic gadget that claimed to improve circulation. Contraptions emitted infrared light or pulsed electromagnetic fields. Supplement kits promised to flush out mold, heavy metals and microplastics. Vibrating plates were pitched as neurological reset tools. And there were countless devices — necklaces, patches, laptop shields, pet collars and full-body blankets — meant to block 5G, electromagnetic fields and radiation, including the Wi-Fi all around us. Alongside the gadgets were services, too — nutritionists offering on-the-spot consultations, sessions in a hyperbaric chamber and one vendor advertising something described as a “blood oil change.”",

    "title": "Pride organizers say sponsors are pulling back amid DEI rollbacks, economic fears",
    "article_text": "Several of the nation’s largest LGBTQ Pride celebrations are down hundreds of thousands of dollars in corporate sponsorships this year, with some event organizers saying promised funds have been withdrawn or reduced and others saying they’ve been ghosted by longtime corporate partners. Pride organizers say some companies fear being targeted by the Trump administration over participation in diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, while others are preserving cash in a tumultuous economy. “I know that they’re facing tough decisions inside those organizations, and I don’t want to call them out. I want to call them in,” Suzanne Ford, the executive director of San Francisco Pride, said of disappearing sponsors. “We will remember who stood by us and who didn’t. When it was politically popular, they were lined up.” Eve Keller, co-president of USA Prides, a national network of LGBTQ Pride organizers,said members across the country have reported receiving significantly less in sponsorship dollars this year.Some of the smaller, rural Prides are down 70% to 90% when compared to the average year, she said. “We’re trying not to sound a huge alarm or to make this the only focus, but when we are down money, we’re down safety and security and accessibility as well,” she said, adding that most Prides don’t want to make any cuts to their security measures, so instead they are holding fewer and smaller events. We will remember who stood by us and who didn’t. When it was politically popular, they were lined up. Suzanne Ford, san francisco pride Last month, Pride St. Louis announced Anheuser-Buschdeclined to sponsor the organization’s annual PrideFestin St. Louis, where the brewing company is based, after a more than 30-year partnership. The announcement also noted that “funding has been coming in well below expectations,” leaving Pride St. Louis more than$150,000 short of last year’s totalPride budget, which organizers told NBC News was about $480,000. However, on Wednesday, Pride St. Louis’ DEI and outreach director, Jordan Braxton, said the organization made up almost all of that deficit with an outpouring of individual donations. The loss of the Anheuser-Busch partnership is still “devastating,” Braxton said, because it sends a hurtful message to the community that the company’s support is dependent on who is president. Anheuser-Busch did not return requests for comment. The organizers of several of the country’s premier Pride celebrations told NBC News they have also lost funding from corporate sponsors this year, to the tune of $200,000 to $350,000 each. For some larger organizations — like those in New York City and San Francisco — the shortage makes up about 10% of their total Pride event budget, while for others, like St. Pete Pride in Florida, it could be about half. Some organizers said past sponsors that are not returning or are reducing their sponsorship amounts this year have cited the political climate and the Trump administration’s hostility toward DEI and the LGBTQ community, while others have cited fear of an economic recession. Some didn’t provide any reasons at all, organizers said. Bob Witeck, president of Witeck Communications, a firm specializing in LGBTQ marketing, said he isn’t surprised that corporations are reducing or withdrawing Pride sponsorships this year, because many of them are feeling vulnerable to “unfair and uninvited attacks.” He said publicly regulated businesses and those that work directly with federal agencies and under contracts “are more vulnerable to possible litigation as well as facing potential losses.” Ford said several companies that had agreed to sponsor this year’s San Francisco Pride march had withdrawn: Anheuser-Busch, Comcast, Diageo and Nissan. Those sponsorships add up to about $300,000, Ford estimated. The total budget for this year’s celebration, she said, is $3.2 million, and the nonprofit had hoped to raise about $2.3 million of that through corporate sponsorships, with the remainder coming from individual donations, beverage sales and other means. So far, corporate sponsors have committed $1.25 million, Ford said, adding that San Francisco Pride is still waiting to hear back from several large companies that have sponsored in the past. Lloryn Love-Carter, a spokesperson for Nissan, said the company is “currently reviewing all marketing and sales spending, including auto shows, sports properties and other entertainment activations, to maximize both efficiency and breakthrough effectiveness.” Love-Carter added that “Nissan remains committed to promoting an inclusive culture for employees, consumers, dealers and other key stakeholders.” A spokesperson for Diageo said there were some changes to the company’s sponsorships budget in California, but that the company was still going to be active around San Francisco for Pride Month in June and would be involved in Pride events around the country through its Smirnoff vodka brand. A spokesperson for Comcast, which owns NBC Universal, the parent company of NBC News, declined to comment on why the company isn't sponsoring San Francisco Pride this year. The spokesperson said local teams make their own sponsorship decisions and noted the company's California team is sponsoring other Pride celebrations in the state including Silicon Valley Pride, Oakland Pride and events associated with San Francisco Pride that are hosted by other nonprofits. Corporations began increasingly supporting Pride festivities in the years following the Supreme Court’s 2015 decision in favor of same-sex marriage. A few years ago, large companies had become so ubiquitous at major Pride events — with their logos emblazoned on everything from floats to paper fans — that some revelers began to lament the so-called corporatization of Pride, or what became known as “rainbow capitalism.” However, over the last two years — as dozens of states have passedlegislation restricting LGBTQ rightsand conservative influencers havetargeted pro-LGBTQ companies— the landscape has shifted, and some companies are leaning away from publicly supporting the community. Anheuser-Busch and Target faced particularly intense conservative pressure in 2023: Anheuser-Busch for itsBud Light partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney, and Target forsome of the offeringsin itsannualPride collection. President Donald Trump further fueled the corporate retreat from Pride initiatives with a series of executive orders from his first day in office. Inone order, Trump declared DEI initiatives “illegal and immoral” and barred the government from funding them. Inanother, he prohibited federal funds from promoting “gender ideology,” which has become a right-wing term to refer to transgender people and their rights. At the same time, many big corporations are facing economic headwinds, including the Trump administration’s efforts to reduce government spending and the implementation of tariffs that have roiled the markets. Byron Green, the board president of St. Pete Pride in St. Petersburg, Florida, said no sponsors have officially pulled their support for the annual event, though he hasn’t yet heard from many of them. Some have had to significantly reduce their sponsorships, Green said, including one major donor who previously gave $40,000 to $60,000 and is only donating about $10,000 this year. “They have all said, ‘We get government funding, and we have to be very careful, because we don’t know if that funding is going to go away,’” Green said, adding that companies are worried about being able to pay their staff. In the past, the nonprofit has relied entirely on corporate sponsors to cover the $600,000-$700,000 budget for Pride events held throughout the month of June, including its annual parade, which draws hundreds of thousands of attendees. So far, the nonprofit has received about half of that, according to Green. “We are navigating what feels like a tightrope,” he said. “How do we create the experience that is the largest Pride in the state of Florida and one of the largest in the Southeast and the pace of dollars coming in is drastically less than it has been in the past?” Ryan Bos is the executive director of Capital Pride Alliance, which organizes annual Pride celebrations in Washington, D.C., and willhost this year’s WorldPride, an international celebration that is held in a new location every two years. Bos said the nonprofit was in talks with Target — which sponsored WorldPride in New York City in 2019 and has sponsored D.C.’s Capital Pride march in the past — but the company ultimately decided to pass. Bos said other sponsors, like Wegmans Food Markets, have recommitted and increased their support for the festivities, which will take place from May 23 to June 8. Kevin Kilbride, the media marketing manager of NYC Pride, said the budget for the organization’s annual Pride events in June is usually between $3 million and $6 million. Last year’s budget was $4.6 million, and this year’s will be about $3.5 million, he said. Kilbride said about two-thirds of the organization’s previous sponsors have reaffirmed their support for this year’s events, which include one of the largest LGBTQ Pride marches in the world. As of Thursday, he said, one-third of the organization’s total partners had either pulled, scaled back or not yet finalized their funding commitments. As a result, NYC Pride is looking at a $350,000 dip in sponsorship funding, he said. “A lot of it still is in the air at this point,” he said. “Folks are just moving a little bit more strategically and slowly than usual ... and I think it’s a combination of the political environment, folks not sure what the repercussions would be, if any, but also the economy as well.” Target is still sponsoring New York City’s annual LGBTQ Pride march, Kilbride said, though he noted the company has “chosen to take a silent partnership role,” and as a result is not listed as a sponsor on its website. Target declined to comment on its decision not to sponsor WorldPride and on its partnership with NYC Pride. Several Pride organizers — including those in Seattle, Boston and Minnesota’s Twin Cities — said they are being more selective about which sponsors they work with to ensure the companies’ policies align with their values. Philadelphia Pride made the decision in 2022 not to work with corporations at all as a response to the community conversation about rainbow capitalism. Twin Cities Pride, whichdraws about half a million people to its annual parade, announced earlier this year that it would not be partnering with Target as a sponsor for this year’s events after the Minneapolis-based retailer told employees in January that it would roll back DEI initiatives. Andi Otto, the executive director of Twin Cities Pride, said he chose to turn down the company’s $50,000 sponsorship because he didn’t like the message it was sending to the LGBTQ community and communities of color. After Twin Cities Pride announced it wouldn’t partner with Target, Otto said, he launched a fundraiser that ended up doubling Target’s planned sponsorship. Target declined to comment on Otto rejecting the company’s sponsorship. Witeck said he’s not surprised that some brands are “facing a chilly environment” this year, as some Pride organizers and LGBTQ advocates question the values and consistency of some of their past sponsors. “Community leaders have long opposed forms of ‘rainbow-washing’ if it’s felt the company has demonstrated weak or faltering loyalty,” he said, using a term similar to rainbow capitalism. Pride organizers have said the effects of losing major sponsors could vary widely, though none of the organizers who spoke with NBC News said they are scaling back security — and many, in fact, have said they’re increasing it. NYC’s Kilbride said that as a result of having fewer committed sponsors and a reduced budget this year, three dance parties will not return for this year’s NYC Pride slate. “We just have fewer options with a lower budget as far as what we can do, what kind of spaces we can provide for this community at a time that it’s obviously, in my opinion, more important than ever for these spaces to exist,” Kilbride said. Otto said Twin Cities Pride, which typically spends about $800,000 on its annual Pride festival, is currently short about $200,000. In addition to declining Target’s donation, Otto said the organization had one big sponsor back out of negotiations and has not heard from several of its past sponsors yet. As a result, he said, this year’s festival will feature three stages for performances instead of its usual four. The organizers of San Francisco Pride, which hosts a concert, parade and street fair the last weekend of June, usually start planning the three-day event nearly a year in advance, Ford said. As a result, she said, any potential funding shortage won’t affect this year’s events. While many Pride organizers are making due with fewer corporate sponsors and lower budgets this year, Keller said the important thing to remember is Pride is “not going away.” “You’re going to see even more people show up and need to find a safe space and find community and find where they can be their authentic selves, and that’s going to be at the Pride parade,” she said.",

    "title": "Arson at Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro's residence exposes potential security failures",
    "article_text": "Under the cover of darkness, a man \"harboring hatred\" toward PennsylvaniaGov. Josh Shapiro made a stunning breachof the sprawling grounds of the executive mansion in Harrisburg, police said. Over several minutes early Sunday, the intruder evaded security, smashing through ground-floor windows with a hammer and torching two rooms with incendiary devices, before he disappeared back out over perimeter fencing. Had the man found the governor, police later said he told them, he would have attacked him. The intruder's ability to break into the Governor's Residence and then flee — only for a suspect to be apprehended after he turned himself in hours later — exposes potential security gaps and calls into question how a breakdown in protocols seemingly occurred, former state law enforcement officials said. Policeidentified the suspect as Cody Balmer, 38. \"I was surprised, alarmed, and, quite frankly, I couldn't believe that happened,\" Glenn Walp, the state police commissioner in the 1990s under Gov. Bob Casey, said Monday after he learned about the incident, which included reports of a fire igniting around 2 a.m. Hours earlier, Shapiro hadposted on social mediathat he was having Passover dinner with his family in the residence's state dining room. That was the room damaged in what investigators say was an act of arson. No one was hurt. \"This could have turned into something far worse,\" Walp said, had the man tried to do something when people were awake. \"It could have been a tremendous tragedy.\" State police troopers are tasked with providing the governor with around-the-clock security, whether he’s traveling, at events or at his official residence. Mark Garrett, a retired California Highway Patrol chief, said security protocols should be in place whether it's the afternoon, when more people are around, or in the middle of the night, when everyone's asleep. That an unauthorized person could have been on the property for several minutes, that he was able to cause serious destruction and that he could have gotten close to Shapiro indicates a glaring lapse, he added. \"Something was not followed here,\" Garrett said. \"There was some breakdown in procedure. Or the procedure was not robust enough to begin with.\" Balmer surrendered to state police Sunday afternoon after, authorities said, an ex-girlfriend also called police. He was charged with attempted criminal homicide, aggravated arson, burglary, terrorism and other counts, the Dauphin County District Attorney's Office said Monday. Balmer told police that had he located Shapiro, \"he would have beaten him with his hammer,\" according to a probable cause affidavit, which added that \"Balmer admitted to harboring hatred\" toward Shapiro. Officials didn't provide additional detail. Investigators say they are reviewing security measures at the property to prevent such an attack from happening again.\"We look at all aspects, personnel, technical, surveillance equipment, security equipment, all of that will be reviewed, and we will do our best to ensure that the governor and his family are safe in this residence,\" State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens told reporters Sunday. The 29​,000-square-footGeorgian-style brick mansionhas been home to eight governors and their families over the years. It sits close to the Susquehanna River, just off a street accessible to cars. \"It is wide open to the public,\" Walp said. \"If you're driving down the street, you stop the car, you open the door and you jump over the fence. It's not way back in.\" Authorities say Balmer was dressed in black and carrying a bag when, they say, he climbed the nearly 7-foot-high iron fence that surrounds the property. (Such asecurity breach has been more commonly associated with the White Houseover the years.) Cameras are installed throughout the grounds of the Governor's Residence. At the time, security \"knew that there had been a breach on the property, and we were searching to determine what had occurred,\" Bivens said. The intruder, however, \"actively evaded troopers who were here to secure the residence,\" he added, \"even while they were searching for him on the property.\" During that time, Balmer used a hammer to break the windows of a piano room on the home's south side, police allege, and then tossed a Molotov cocktail that set off a \"substantial fire.\" He went to an adjacent window and broke the glass before he entered inside, where he deployed another device in the dining room, causing a second fire, the probable cause affidavit says. He fled the home through an exit in the room and climbed back over the perimeter fence, investigators added. \"That was all playing out over a period of several minutes,\" Bivens said, and it was a \"very quick event that occurred.\" Shapiro recounted Sunday that he and his family awoke to the noise of a state trooper banging on their door to guide them to safety. On Monday, Harrisburg Fire Chief Brian Enterline said a closed door in the area of the residence where the fires were set helped contain the flames and prevent the blaze from rapidly spreading down a hallway. Had that door been open, it \"would have definitely put the governor at even greater risk,\" Enterline told reporters. Given the size of the grounds, especially at night, it's possible that security wouldn't have immediately located the intruder, law enforcement experts say. But whether it could have gotten to the intruder sooner, before he was even able to break into the home, must be assessed, they added. \"From a professional security perspective, the fact that the individual was able to scale the fence and do what he did, that's not security,\" Walp said. \"Security should be free of danger and threat, and it shows a hole that needs to be corrected, and I'm sure the state police will correct it.\" He added that officials must determine whether more security personnel are needed and where they should be placed at the residence. \"Obviously, for this situation, security needs to be tightened up,\" he said. Jeffrey Miller, who was the state police commissioner under Gov. Ed Rendell in the 2000s, said determining whether more security is necessary for top public officials and for how long can be complicated since it involves the use of taxpayer money. Security details for past Pennsylvania governors and lieutenant governors havecost millions of dollarsa year, although Shapiro's predecessor, Tom Wolf,reportedly paid for his own. Such costs also come amid a heightened political climate, when online threats have turned intodangerous swatting incidentsandassassination attemptsagainstleadersandtheir families. \"The divisive nature of political rhetoric in our country has contributed to an increase in both threats, as well as political violence,\" Miller said. \"People say a lot of things, post a lot of things, make a lot of threats. And you have to cut through that and try to determine which ones are the ones that you really have to be concerned about.\"",

    "article_text": "KALAMAZOO, Mich. — A Michigan man who was upset that he had to watch pets while his girlfriend’s family went on a cruise was sentenced to eight months in prison Monday for making a false bomb threat. The email forced Carnival Corp. to check more than 1,000 rooms after the ship had departed Miami in January 2024, prosecutors said. “Anyone making a bomb threat should expect to be taken at his word. Fortunately, this particular hoax did not result in physical injury,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Nils Kessler said in a court filing. Joshua Lowe, 19, was sentenced to prison during an appearance in federal court in Kalamazoo. “FBI agents traced the email address to Lowe, who was living with his girlfriend’s family,” Kessler said. “Lowe admitted he sent the message because he was upset that the family went on the cruise, while leaving him behind to care for their pets.” Lowe apologized in a letter to U.S. District Judge Paul Maloney. “This is all my fault and take full responsibility,” he said.",

Vice President and proud Ohio State alum JD Vance tried to help the Buckeyes celebrate their NCAA football championship during a White House visit Monday — but ended up fumbling their trophy. The awkward moment came toward the end of the event, after Vance called out a man sporting a hat with the name of Ohio State’s top rival, the University of Michigan, and the team presented Vance and President Donald Trump with a custom helmet and jersey. As the U.S. Marine Band played “We Are the Champions,” Vance — who graduated from the school in 2009 with a degree in philosophy and political science — tried to lift the 3-foot championship trophy, which the team earned by defeating Notre Dame 34-23 in January.",

    "title": "Who is Eugene in 'The Last of Us'? Mystery character explained",
    "article_text": "As viewers discovered on April 13 with the second season premiere of “The Last of Us” (HBO/Max), there’s a raft of new characters to get acquainted with — including Joel’s (Pedro Pascal) therapist Gail (Catherine O’Hara). But Gail — and Joel — have a connection to another character: Eugene. During their first session together, Gail tells Joel, “You killed Eugene … I hate you for it.” So, who is this newcomer to the hit killer fungus series, based on a video game of the same name, and why is he important? Let’s find out. “The Last of Us” started as a video game series in 2013. (There’s a “Last of Us: Left Behind,” “Last of Us Part II,” and a remake of the first one called “Last of Us Part 1,” too.) Eugene isn’t a major character, though, and he doesn’t show up until “The Last of Us Part II.” In “Part II,” Eugene was a friend of Tommy’s (Joel’s brother), a former Firefly-turned-patrolman living in Jackson, Wyoming. He’d left his wife Claire and a daughter to fight in the rebellion, which left him lonely as he grew older. While in Jackson, Eugene became close friends with Dina (played by Isabela Merced in the show); in the game she says he taught her about things like electronics. According to the show’s lore, he died in 2038 of a stroke when he was 73. Eugene gets a much bigger part in Season 2, taking these bare bone details and expanding them — like it did with Bill and Frank in the “Long, Long Time” bottle episode from Season 1, which won episode star Nick Offerman an Emmy. He’s first mentioned when Joel goes to Gail for their therapy session. He pays her in marijuana, and she remarks that Eugene could grow weed no matter what the month of the year was. Then she notes, “It’s my first birthday without my husband in 41 years.” Now, “Last of Us” Season 2 hasjumped ahead more than five yearsfromSeason 1. That means that if Gail is correct in accusing Joel of killing Eugene, he’s done it between seasons — and it’s something we haven’t seen. Gail tells Joel mid-session, “You shot and killed my husband. You killed Eugene. And I resent you for it. No. Maybe a little more than that. I hate you for it. I hate you for it. And yes, I know you had no choice. I know that. I know I should forgive you. Well I’ve tried, and I can’t. Because of how you did it. And looking at your face, sitting in our home, makes me so f------ angry.” This might not be the ideal doctor-patient relationship. But over the seven episodes of Season 2, expect Eugene’s death to have repercussions for Joel and his relationship to Ellie (Bella Ramsey). Show co-creatorNeil Druckmann told Newsweekthey wanted to give more layers to the character than exists in the video game. “Someone like Eugene, we had a take on that character to say, ‘OK, well, how does that expand Joel and Ellie’s relationship? How does it expand the town of Jackson? How does that expand what the story’s about, which is this idea of love and the extremes that love can take you to?’” This is unknown as of the first episode. Since Gail says “I know you had no choice,” there’s a good chance that Eugene was infected. And let’s not forget that Joel is still part of the community, so it’s not like he’s been ostracized for murder. But it seems that Gail has a few issues of her own to work out — and that Joel is still immersed in a dangerous, if slightly more civilized, world than we saw in Season 1. As of yet, Eugene hasn’t been seen on screen — but as they’ve cast Emmy-winner Joe Pantoliano in the role, there’s a good chance we’ll see him in flashbacks in coming episodes. Pantoliano is a veteran character actor who’s appeared in scores of films and TV shows, including “The Goonies,” “The Matrix,” “Memento” and “Bad Boys.” He earned his lone Emmy in for playing Ralph on “The Sopranos” in 2003.",

    "title": "Walton Goggins applauds 'SNL' skit mocking 'White Lotus'",
    "article_text": "Walton Goggins fanned rumors of a feud between him and his “White Lotus” co-star Aimee Lou Wood by responding positively to a “Saturday Night Live” parody of the show that mocked Wood’s appearance. On its April 12 episode, “SNL” aired a pre-recorded political spoof called“The White Potus.”Though the sketch mostly poked fun at the actions of the Trump administration, it also featured cast member Sarah Sherman wearing prosthetic teeth to mock Wood’s real teeth. Wood, 31, initiallyresponded to the parodyin anInstagram story, calling it “mean and unfunny.” But Goggins, 53, who played Wood’s love interest in the third season of “The White Lotus,” posted his approval of the sketch on the official “SNL” Instagram page. “Hahahahahhahaha Amazzzingggg,” Goggins wrote in a since-deleted comment. Goggins’ response comes amid headlines about a feud between him and his British co-star that began after eagle-eyed fans of the HBO dark comedy noticed the pair no longer follow each other on Instagram. Fans have also commented online about Goggins and Wood paying homage to their characters’ romance on Instagram without tagging each other. In the “SNL”sketch, guest host Jon Hamm played a slightly maniacal version of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the United States’ controversial secretary of health and human services. “What if we took all the fluoride out of the drinking water? What would that do to people’s teeth?” asks Hamm’s Kennedy. “Fluoride? What’s that?” responds Sherman’s version of Wood’s “White Lotus” character, Chelsea, in a campy British accent. Wood saidin her Instagram responsethat she wished “SNL” had taken a “cleverer, more nuanced, less cheap” approach to the portion of the parody that featured her character. The former “Sex Education” star, who described herself as “not thin-skinned,” wrote, “I don’t mind caricature — I understand that’s what SNL is. But the rest of the skit was punching up and I/Chelsea was the only one punched down on.” Wood, who later said that “SNL” had reached out to her to apologize, wasn’t the only viewer disappointed by the sketch. “Brilliant sketch, except they really didn’t have to make fun of Aimee Lou Wood, it’s just being horrid to a lovely actress for no reason,” one wrote on Instagram. “You could have done it without mocking Amy, my luvs,” wrote wrote another while a third viewer called Sherman’s impression of Wood “mean girl energy.”",

    "article_text": "Tyra Banks says doing IVF to conceive her sonYork Banks Aslaleft her “feeling so inadequate” at times. Banks, who co-hosted the April 14 episode of \"TODAY with Jenna & Friends,\" recalled one part of her vitro fertilization experience that stuck with her. In January 2016,Banks and her ex-partner Erik Asla welcomed their son Yorkthrough surrogacy. In her Instagram birth announcement, Banks called York a “miracle baby” and thanked “the angel of a woman that carried” him. “Isn’t being a mom one of the best things in the world?”Jenna Bush Hagerasked co-host Banks, whose son is 9. “I remember being 24 years old and I was saying, ‘In three years, I’m going to have a child ... and I kept putting my career first .... and then, it was almost too late,” said Banks, 51. She added, “IVF saved me and it was the last of my eggs ... and so, I just made it and it is the most amazing thing.” Jenna added, “I also love that you never gave up on that dream.” Banks shared a “crazy” memory from after her egg retrieval, when she was admitted to a shared room. “So the doctor would say to me, ‘You got six eggs’ and then he would go to the next curtain, ‘You got 35 eggs,’” recalled Banks. “I’m like, ‘Really, can you just whisper this or write it on a sheet of paper?’ Because here I am, feeling so inadequate.” Banks said that her son York loves hearing about how his birth was a blessing. “In my apartment here in New York, I made a tile in my son’s bedroom before he was even born,” Banks told Jenna. “It said, ‘Mommy already loves you.’ And so, when he comes to New York, he’s like, ‘Mommy, Mommy, you love me and I wasn’t even here. Tell me how much you wanted me.’” York is his mama’s mini me. “He’s finally understanding that I’m a model,” Banks toldTODAY style correspondent Zanna Roberts Rassiin October 2024. “And then he’s like, ‘Mommy, is this a model face?’” Banks said, adding, “I’m not pushing him to model. Like, if he wants to do it, he wants to do it, but I’m not going to be that mama.”",

    "article_text": "Welcome to the online version ofFrom the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail. In today’s edition, Bridget Bowman breaks down the state of the 2026 Senate map as campaigns across the country start to get off the ground. Plus, Ben Kamisar finds another example of how President Donald Trump has remade the Republican Party in our most recent poll. Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here. — Adam Wollner The next battle for the Senate majority has come into clearer focus in recent weeks, with candidates in both parties making their intentions known in high-profile races across the map. AsBridget Bowman reports, Democrats face an uphill climb to take control of the chamber in the 2026 elections: The party must reach into GOP territory to net the four seats they need, while also defending competitive seats in Georgia, Michigan and New Hampshire. Republicans, meanwhile, are looking to expand their 53-47 majority while defending blue-leaning Maine and battleground North Carolina. Here’s the latest on who’s in, who’s out and who still needs to make a decision in the top Senate contests of the cycle. Michigan:The latest piece of the puzzle fell into place Monday, with former Rep. Mike Rogersbecoming the first major Republicanto jump into the Michigan Senate race. He quickly snagged endorsements from Senate Majority Leader John Thune and National Republican Senatorial Committee Chair Tim Scott. Rogers lost to Democrat Elissa Slotkin in last year’s Senate race by less than 1 percentage point. On the Democratic side, state Sen. Mallory McMorrow entered the race to replace retiring Sen. Gary Peters last week. Several other Democrats, including Rep. Haley Stevens and former Wayne County health director Abdul El-Sayed, are also considering bids. New Hampshire:Former New Hampshire GOP Gov. Chris Sununu announced last week he would not run for Senate, despite encouragement from President Donald Trump. Former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown is weighing a bid in the state, where he lost a 2014 Senate race. Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas launched his Senate campaign last week, and fellow Rep. Maggie Goodlander is also still considering a run for the seat being vacated by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. North Carolina:Whileformer Rep. Wiley Nickel announced last week he would take on Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, Democrats are waiting on former Gov. Roy Cooper to decide if will run against one of the party’s top targets next year. Maine:It’s a similar story for the party in Maine, with Democratic Gov. Janet Mills not ruling out a campaign against GOP Sen. Susan Collins. Democrats have struggled to defeat Collins even as they’ve consistently carried Maine at the presidential level. Georgia:Likewise,the GOP is waiting on a major shoe to drop in Georgia. National Republicans have been recruiting Gov. Brian Kemp to run against Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff, one of their top targets on the map. If he doesn’t, it would likely open the floodgates for Republicans to enter the contest. Read more from Bridget on the Senate map, including the latest from Minnesota, Ohio and Texas → Homeward bound:We could see more campaign announcements over the two-week congressional recess, with lawmakers back in their home states and districts. Alexandra Marquez reportsthat Republicans are largely avoiding holding in-person town halls during this period, as National Republican Congressional Committee Chair Richard Hudsonhas advised. According to news releases and publicly posted event notices, the majority of town halls and town hall-style events taking place over the congressional recess will be hosted by Democrats. Youth movement:In addition to the battleground races, there’s also activity bubbling up in Democratic primaries amid dissatisfaction from the base over the direction of the party.Faith Wardwell and Elias Miller writethat a crop of candidates in their 20s and 30s is stepping in to challenge older Democrats for their seats in Congress. Recent polling from NBC News shows how President Donald Trump has consolidated the Republican Party not just around himself, but also around his broader “Make America Great Again” movement. Thirty-six percent of registered voters identified themselves as MAGA supporters in an NBC News poll conducted in March. It’s a significant increase from past polling — up from 23% of respondents in a merged sample of all of NBC News’ polling throughout 2023, and 27% of respondents in a merged sample of 2024 polling. The overall share is powered by the 71% of Republicans who now call themselves MAGA supporters. NBC News’ polling already showed signs of a shift afoot between the beginning of the 2024 presidential primary and the final weeks before Election Day, as the GOP consolidated around Trump. In January 2024, days after Trump won nominating contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, just 20% of registered voters said they aligned with the MAGA movement. But in NBC News’ combined polling in October and early November 2024, that number ticked up to 29%. A shift among Republicans moving more into Trump’s camp is primarily driving this movement, with a 16-point increase in GOPers identifying with the MAGA movement between the two polls right before the 2024 election (55%) and March this year (71%). There’s also been a similar shift among college-educated men, from 21% in 2024 to 37% in March — also a 16-point increase. It’s the kind of pro-Trump consolidation that led to himmatching his best-ever approval rating(47%) in NBC News’ March poll, though a majority of registered voters, 51%, still disapproved of his job performance. “All of that shift is coming from Republicans,” said Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster with Public Opinion Strategies who conducted the survey along with Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt, of Hart Research Associates.

    "article_text": "Immigration authorities detained another Columbia University student in “direct retaliation” for his participation in protests against the Israel-Gaza war, his lawyer said Monday. Mohsen Mahdawi, who was born and raised in a refugee camp in the West Bank and is a U.S. permanent resident, was taken into custody by the Department of Homeland Security during his naturalization interview in Vermont on Monday, the lawyer, Luna Droubi, said in a filing. Mahdawi was detainedamid a wideningand unprecedentedcrackdown on foreign students. Video posted by a Vermont lawmaker showed three officers, two of whom were masked, escorting Mahdawi in handcuffs to an SUV. Andrew Delaney, another one of his attorneys, said Mahdawi is being held in Vermont. A petition challenging his detention says it appears he was taken into custody for deportation. A federal judge temporarily blocked his removal Monday. In a joint statement, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt.,called Mahdawi's detention \"immoral, inhumane and illegal.\" \"Earlier today, Mohsen Mahdawi of White River Junction, Vermont, walked into an immigration office for what was supposed to be the final step in his citizenship process,\" they said. \"Instead, he was arrested and removed in handcuffs by plainclothes, armed, individuals with their faces covered. These individuals refused to provide any information as to where he was being taken or what would happen to him.\" \"Mr. Mahdawi, a legal resident of the United States, must be afforded due process under the law and immediately released from detention,\" they added. Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Department of Homeland Security referred NBC News to the State Department, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Citing federal privacy law, a Columbia spokesperson declined to comment. Mahdawi was detained days afteran immigration judge in Louisiana ruledthat Columbia student and green card holder Mahmoud Khalil can be deported — even though a federal judge in New Jersey has barred his deportation while he challenges his detention in that state. Federal officials have accused Khalil, who led students protests at Columbia, of supporting terrorists and harassing people based on their faith. The White House and federal officials have cited a rarely used provision in immigration law that allows them to \"remove aliens who pose serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.” Plainclothes agents detained a student at Tufts University, Rumeysa Öztürk, after she wrote an opinion piece in her school newspaper criticizing the school's response to the war in Gaza, according to her lawyers. Federal officials said last month that hundreds of student visas have been revoked amid the unprecedented crackdown. An NBC News analysis has found that the students, many of whom are Middle Eastern, are from at least 29 states. According to a temporary restraining order Droubi filed for Monday, Mahdawi moved to the United States in 2014. The filing describes him as an outspoken critic of Israel's military campaign who helped organized protests at Columbia University until March 2024, when he stepped back. Mahdawi recently attended Columbia and planned to return to the school in the fall for a master's degree, according to filing.",

    "article_text": "A group of five small businesses on Monday sued PresidentDonald Trump, seeking to block newtariffsthat he has imposed onforeign importsin recent weeks. The lawsuit in theU.S. Court of International Tradealleges that Trump has illegally usurped Congress’ power to levy tariffs by claiming that trade deficits with othercountriesconstitute an emergency. “Congress has not delegated any such power,” the suit says. “The statute the President invokes — theInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act(‘IEEPA’) — does not authorize the President to unilaterally issue across-the-board worldwide tariffs.” TheLiberty Justice Center, which is representing the owner-operated companies, said Trump’s so-called Liberation Day tariffs of at least10% on importsfrom most countries, and higher rates for scores of other nations, are devastating small businesses across the country.” “His claimed emergency is a figment of his own imagination: trade deficits, which have persisted for decades without causing economic harm, are not an emergency,” the suit says. “Nor do these trade deficits constitute an ’unusual and extraordinary threat.” The Liberty Justice Center noted that the Trump administration imposed tariffs even on countries with which the United States does not have a trade deficit, “further undermining the administration’s justification.” “This Court should declare the President’s unprecedented power grab illegal, enjoin the operation of the executive actions that purport to impose these tariffs under the IEEPA and reaffirm this country’s core founding principle: there shall be no taxation without representation,” the suit says. The plaintiffs include New York-basedVOS Selections, which imports and distributes small-production wines, spirits, and sakes;FishUSAin Pennsylvania, a retail and wholesale e-commerce business making and selling sportfishing tackle and related gear; andGenova Pipein Utah, which makes plastic pipe, conduit, and fittings for plumbing, irrigation, drainage, and electrical applications. The other plaintiffs areMicroKits LLCin Virginia, which makes educational electronic kits and musical instruments, andTerry Precision Cycling, a Vermont-based brand of women’s cycling apparel. “Terry Cycling has already paid $25,000 in unplanned tariffs this year for goods for which Terry was the importer of record, and Terry projects that the tariffs will cost the company approximately $250,000 by the end of 2025,” the suit says. Terry Cycling in 2026 expects to “face an estimated $1.2 million in tariff costs — an amount that is simply not survivable for a business of its size,” the suit says. CNBC has requested comment from the White House on the lawsuit.",

    "article_text": "WASHINGTON — If an immigrant who the government claims is a gang member can be deported to El Salvador without any due process rights, then why not a U.S. citizen? That was the nightmarish scenario immigration advocates and constitutional law experts were considering on Monday after President Donald Trump again pushed a provocative plan to deport U.S. citizens who have been convicted of unspecified crimes. Trump discussed the issue in the White House with El Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, who has agreed to deposit people deported from the U.S. into a notorious prison. “We always have to obey the laws, but we also have homegrown criminals that push people into subways, that hit elderly ladies on the back of the head with a baseball bat when they’re not looking, that are absolute monsters,” Trump told reporters. “I’d like to include them.” Follow live politics coverage here Last week, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump was interested in deporting \"heinous, violent criminals\" who are U.S. citizens to El Salvador \"if there's a legal pathway to do that.\" It is unclear if the administration is referring only to naturalized citizens. In rare circumstances, naturalized citizens can have their citizenship revoked if, for example, they obtained it through fraudulent means. During Monday’s White House meeting, Trump said that Attorney General Pam Bondi is \"studying the law.\" The White House and Justice Department did not respond to messages seeking additional information about the proposal. \"It is pretty obviously illegal and unconstitutional,\" said Ilya Somin, a professor at George Mason University’s Antonin Scalia Law School. Immigration law that gives the government the authority to deport people simply does not apply to U.S. citizens, noted Emma Winger, a lawyer at the American Immigration Council, a nonprofit advocacy group. Anthony Kreis, a professor at Georgia State University College of Law, noted that the British policy of removing certain alleged criminals from colonies to be put on trial elsewhere was one of the grievances during the lead-up to the American Revolution. \"I can’t see how exiling someone is permissible as part of the bundle of rights that are fundamental to citizenship — doubly so if the effort to house American citizens overseas means turning a person over to a foreign authority,\" he added. David Bier, an immigration expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, said Trump's remarks show how \"absolutely critical it is for the courts to put an immediate stop to this extrajudicial imprisonment by foreign proxy.\" \"U.S. citizens may not be deported to imprisonment abroad. There is no authority for that in any U.S. law,\" he added. The U.S. government alleges the people sent to El Salvador are violent gang members, although some have been sent without the ability of courts to determine whether they have been correctly identified, raising serious constitutional issues. In one case arising from Trump's effort to invoke a war-time law called the Alien Enemies Act, the Supreme Courthas already ruledthat people subject to such deportations have due process rights. In a separate opinion in that case, Justice Sonia Sotomayor addressed the extreme nature of some of the government's arguments. \"The implication of the government’s position is that not only noncitizens but also United States citizens could be taken off the streets, forced onto planes, and confined to foreign prisons with no opportunity for redress if judicial review is denied unlawfully before removal,\" she wrote. The parallel legal dispute over Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the immigrant who the Justice Department has admitted was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, also has bearing on any proposal to deport U.S. citizens. Abrego Garcia was not charged or convicted of any crimes in the United States or El Salvador and was whisked off to El Salvador before courts could intervene to ensure that he could vindicate his due process rights. The government alleges he is a member of the MS-13 gang. Although a judge has ordered that Abrego Garcia be returned, the Trump administration is now saying that he is outside their jurisdiction and that the decision on whether he is returned is solely up to El Salvador. Bukele said on Mondayhe would not do so. The Supreme Court alsoweighed in on thecase, saying that although the government was obliged to \"facilitate\" Abrego Garcia's return, the courts could not infringe upon the president's authority to conduct foreign policy. If that logic is applied to U.S. citizens, they could potentially be summarily deported without being able to challenge it. Although Trump has said he would only want to target criminals, there is also no reason the government could treat others who have not been convicted of crimes in the same way. \"The U.S. government has already deported someone to this prison illegally and claimed no recourse to get them back, so the courts must shut down this unconstitutional train wreck before U.S. citizens are unlawfully caught up in it,\" Bier said. In the United States, prisoners still have basic constitutional rights and often challenge their convictions and conditions of confinement. It is unclear if they have any such rights if detained in an overseas prison. Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said at an event in Phoenix that Bukele had told her that people sent to the prison in El Salvador \"will never leave.\" Trump's plan is \"an additional reason why courts must force Trump to return Abrego Garcia and others illegally deported to imprisonment in El Salvador,\" Somin, the law professor, said.",

    "title": "Hungary passes constitutional amendment to ban LGBTQ public events",
    "article_text": "BUDAPEST, Hungary — Hungary’s parliament on Monday passed an amendment to the constitution that allows the government to ban public events by LGBTQ communities, a decision that legal scholars and critics call another step toward authoritarianism by the populist government. The amendment, which required a two-thirds vote, passed along party lines with 140 votes for and 21 against. It was proposed by the ruling Fidesz-KDNP coalition led by populist Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. Ahead of the vote — the final step for the amendment — opposition politicians and other protesters attempted to blockade the entrance to a parliament parking garage. Police physically removed demonstrators, who had used zip ties to bind themselves together. The amendment declares that children’s rights to moral, physical and spiritual development supersede any right other than the right to life, including that to peacefully assemble. Hungary’s contentious “child protection” legislation prohibits the “depiction or promotion” of homosexuality to minors aged under 18. The amendment codifies a law fast-tracked through parliament in March that bans public events held by LGBTQ communities, including the popular Pride event in Budapest that draws thousands annually. That law also allows authorities to use facial recognition tools to identify people who attend prohibited events — such as Budapest Pride — and can come with fines of up to 200,000 Hungarian forints ($546). Dávid Bedő, a lawmaker with the opposition Momentum party who participated in the attempted blockade, said before the vote that Orbán and Fidesz for the past 15 years “have been dismantling democracy and the rule of law, and in the past two or three months, we see that this process has been sped up.” He said as elections approach in 2026 and Orbán’s party lags in the polls behind a popular new challenger from the opposition, “they will do everything in their power to stay in power.” Opposition lawmakers used air horns to disrupt the vote, which continued after a few moments. Hungary’s government has campaigned against LGBTQ communities in recent years, and argues its “child protection” policies, which forbid the availability to minors of any material that mentions homosexuality, are needed to protect children from what it calls “woke ideology” and “gender madness.” Critics say the measures do little to protect children and are being used to distract from more serious problems facing the country and mobilize Orbán’s right-wing base ahead of elections. “This whole endeavor which we see launched by the government, it has nothing to do with children’s rights,” said Dánel Döbrentey, a lawyer with the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union, calling it “pure propaganda.” The new amendment also states that the constitution recognizes two sexes, male and female, an expansion of an earlier amendment that prohibits same-sex adoption by stating that a mother is a woman and a father is a man. The declaration provides a constitutional basis for denying the gender identities of transgender people, as well as ignoring the existence of intersex individuals who are born with sexual characteristics that do not align with binary conceptions of male and female. In a statement on Monday, government spokesperson Zoltán Kovács wrote that the change is “not an attack on individual self-expression, but a clarification that legal norms are based on biological reality.” Döbrentey, the lawyer, said it was “a clear message” for transgender and intersex people: “It is definitely and purely and strictly about humiliating people and excluding them, not just from the national community, but even from the community of human beings.” The amendment is the 15th to Hungary’s constitution since Orbán’s party unilaterally authored and approved it in 2011. Ádám Remport, a lawyer with the HCLU, said that while Hungary has used facial recognition tools since 2015 to assist police in criminal investigations and finding missing persons, the recent law banning Pride allows the technology to be used in a much broader and problematic manner. That includes for monitoring and deterring political protests. “One of the most fundamental problems is its invasiveness, just the sheer scale of the intrusion that happens when you apply mass surveillance to a crowd,” Remport said. “More salient in this case is the effect on the freedom of assembly, specifically the chilling effect that arises when people are scared to go out and show their political or ideological beliefs for fear of being persecuted,” he added. The amendment passed Monday also allows for Hungarians who hold dual citizenship in a non-European Economic Area country to have their citizenship suspended for up to 10 years if they are deemed to pose a threat to public order, public security or national security. Hungary has taken steps in recent months to protect its national sovereignty from what it claims are foreign efforts to influence its politics or even topple Orbán’s government. The self-described “illiberal” leader has accelerated his longstanding efforts to crack down on critics such as media outlets and groups devoted to civil rights and anti-corruption, which he says have undermined Hungary’s sovereignty by receiving financial assistance from international donors. In a speech laden with conspiracy theories in March, Orbán compared people who work for such groups to insects, and pledged to “eliminate the entire shadow army” of foreign-funded “politicians, judges, journalists, pseudo-NGOs and political activists.”",

    "article_text": "By Henry Larson , Noah Caldwell , Ashley Brown A viral \"true crime\" story was actually made up, generated by A.I. Reporter Henry Larson explores the ethical questions raised by this new frontier of content. AILSA CHANG, HOST:Our next story plays with the line between fact and fiction. It begins with a mysterious video.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)AUTOMATED VOICE: Today, we uncover the tragic and complex story of Richard Engelbert, a successful real estate agent whose hidden life and secrets led to his brutal murder.CHANG: The crime had supposedly taken place in a city outside Denver more than a decade ago - or that's what viewers were led to believe. Reporter Henry Larson picks up the story from here for our regular segment of short-form audio documentaries.HENRY LARSON: Elizabeth Hernandez had never heard about the case of Richard Engelbert. She's a reporter at The Denver Post, and back in August, people started sending her newsroom a bunch of emails all about this one YouTube video.ELIZABETH HERNANDEZ: My editor said, like, hey, we're getting these messages. We have this thing from a tip line. Do you want to look at this video?LARSON: The video was called \"Husband's Secret Gay Love Affair With Stepson Ends In Grizzly Murder.\" Almost 2 million people had watched it.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)AUTOMATED VOICE: The truth about Richard's life and death had been revealed, but the scars left behind would take much longer to heal. The trial of...LARSON: That stilted narration was accompanied by these hazy images of houses against some mountains, and headshots of suspects and victims.Can you describe to me the tips? What did they say?HERNANDEZ: At least one of them said something along the lines of, why hasn't The Denver Post covered this?LARSON: What did you feel when you read that?HERNANDEZ: Rage.LARSON: Rage - because this crime readers were writing in about and blaming her paper for missing actually hadn't happened.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)HERNANDEZ: To me, it was very evident that it was not real pretty quickly. I was at The Denver Post in 2014 and probably would have remembered a very salacious case like this.LARSON: She called law enforcement sources and quickly confirmed her suspicions. The video was fake - the characters, the plot, the narrator all generated by AI.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: The video belonged to a YouTube channel called True Crime Case Files (ph). It was one of more than 150 videos on the page. A lot of them were hyper-sexual or hyper-violent. None of them were real. They'd all been created with AI and pretended to be about real places and people, and commenters were buying it.JOHN: The point is, it needs to be called true crime because true crime is a genre. It's not just two words melded together. It's a genre - true crime.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: Can you tell me your name?JOHN: My name's John (ph).LARSON: And John, that's your real first name?JOHN: Yes, that's my real first name.LARSON: And we're not using your last name, right?JOHN: Yes, we're not.LARSON: John and I started talking late last year. He was reluctant to go on the record, but agreed to chat over the phone in December. John said he started receiving hate mail and threats a while ago because of his videos, so NPR isn't using his last name to protect his identity. I was really fascinated with this whole operation. There are lots of people who lie on the internet, but it felt like John was lying in a brand-new way. It started after he graduated college, when the pandemic was in full swing.JOHN: Me and my family - 'cause I was saying with my family then - we were - ended up binge-watching \"Dateline.\" Because you know that there's, like, 20 seasons of \"Dateline.\" Each was, like, 40 episodes. So, I mean, there's - you can watch it for hours and hours.LARSON: John taught himself the show's formula - a scandalous affair, some brutal crime and a stunning trial of a perpetrator to bring things home. Around this time, John also started trying out ChatGPT. He experimented with making parodies of another kind of super-formulaic content - Hallmark movies. He uploaded these videos with titles like \"Romance And Reindeer\" (ph) to YouTube. They were pretty simple, but John also made sure to include a note on each one disclosing that they were AI-generated.Why'd you stop?JOHN: Well, because I realized it didn't do well. And I labeled it AI parody, and it didn't do well. I think the best one maybe got 20 views.LARSON: The lesson John learned was that people wouldn't watch videos tagged as AI-generated. Then, around Thanksgiving two years ago, John also realized he could combine his AI video knowhow with what he learned watching all that \"Dateline,\" and True Crime Case Files was born. This time, though, there was no mention that videos were made up or that they used AI. For months, he cranked out these videos, uploading sometimes two or three a week. He got about 100,000 subscribers, and his videos sometimes got 10 times that number in views. He told me he was making enough to live on.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: Here's the thing that made me keep calling John. He believes what he's doing is better than real true crime because his stories don't use the suffering of real people as content.JOHN: At the end of the day, true crime, no matter how much it's dressed up as, we care about the victims or is this about finding justice, it's a form of entertainment.LARSON: Yeah. But, I mean, if you are so critical of true crime, and if it's causing all these problems in the world, why are you making it?JOHN: I'm creating an alternative to it because in this way, people can have all the luridness they want, but it's not hurting people. So I see of myself sort of like the vegan alternative to true crime.LARSON: Lots of people agree with John about this part - that true crime, popular as it is, has real problems. A 2003 study in the Journal of Communications showed people who watch violent, dramatic television news were more worried about crime. Nationwide, violent crime has been declining for decades, and yet polling consistently shows Americans believe crime is rising. Considering the tip sent to The Denver Post, some locals believed John's video, too. For some of John's critics, that's a problem.CHARLIE SHUNICK: I found myself in this world on May 19, 2012, when my sister, Mickey Shunick, went missing. She was abducted and murdered by a stranger. It was a really high-profile case for the time.LARSON: That's Charlie Shunick. These days, she's a missing persons advocate. Charlie estimates there have been thousands of videos, documentaries and podcasts all made about her sister's death. She knows from her own experience that real true crime can revictimize survivors. But as long as John keeps pretending his videos are true, she thinks he isn't any better.SHUNICK: The fact that people are calling in about these fake cases is one of the things that just enrages me. It's so hard, especially for cold case or long-term missing person cases, to get any type of attention and support and sometimes to even get law enforcement or media to respond to a call, email, DM. And the fact that they're going to dedicate time and resources to fake cases because the people making these don't have the decency to say that they're not real, it's infuriating.LARSON: When you press John about all this, though, about the kind of impact his videos might have, it falls flat.Do you have misgivings about what you do?JOHN: No, I don't. It's an absurdist art form. If people don't understand it, that says a lot about human nature and their own natures and the nature of true crime. And perhaps they're not willing to question themselves. But I don't have any misgivings about what I'm doing.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: While reporting this story, I went to YouTube for comment about John's videos. A few days later, they told me they had deleted his channel, not because the videos were made by AI or that he lied about them being true, they were deleted for violating policies prohibiting child sexual exploitation. John disputes this. He says all of his characters were over the age of 18. But John's still making content. He uploads the stories as podcasts now, and he has copycats. YouTube channels with names like Hidden Family Crime Stories, True Crime Cases (ph) and Crime Tapes are pumping out more and more AI-generated true crime videos every day.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CHANG: That was reporter Henry Larson.

So, I mean, there's - you can watch it for hours and hours.LARSON: John taught himself the show's formula - a scandalous affair, some brutal crime and a stunning trial of a perpetrator to bring things home. Around this time, John also started trying out ChatGPT. He experimented with making parodies of another kind of super-formulaic content - Hallmark movies. He uploaded these videos with titles like \"Romance And Reindeer\" (ph) to YouTube. They were pretty simple, but John also made sure to include a note on each one disclosing that they were AI-generated.Why'd you stop?JOHN: Well, because I realized it didn't do well. And I labeled it AI parody, and it didn't do well. I think the best one maybe got 20 views.LARSON: The lesson John learned was that people wouldn't watch videos tagged as AI-generated. Then, around Thanksgiving two years ago, John also realized he could combine his AI video knowhow with what he learned watching all that \"Dateline,\" and True Crime Case Files was born. This time, though, there was no mention that videos were made up or that they used AI. For months, he cranked out these videos, uploading sometimes two or three a week. He got about 100,000 subscribers, and his videos sometimes got 10 times that number in views. He told me he was making enough to live on.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: Here's the thing that made me keep calling John. He believes what he's doing is better than real true crime because his stories don't use the suffering of real people as content.JOHN: At the end of the day, true crime, no matter how much it's dressed up as, we care about the victims or is this about finding justice, it's a form of entertainment.LARSON: Yeah. But, I mean, if you are so critical of true crime, and if it's causing all these problems in the world, why are you making it?JOHN: I'm creating an alternative to it because in this way, people can have all the luridness they want, but it's not hurting people. So I see of myself sort of like the vegan alternative to true crime.LARSON: Lots of people agree with John about this part - that true crime, popular as it is, has real problems. A 2003 study in the Journal of Communications showed people who watch violent, dramatic television news were more worried about crime. Nationwide, violent crime has been declining for decades, and yet polling consistently shows Americans believe crime is rising. Considering the tip sent to The Denver Post, some locals believed John's video, too. For some of John's critics, that's a problem.CHARLIE SHUNICK: I found myself in this world on May 19, 2012, when my sister, Mickey Shunick, went missing. She was abducted and murdered by a stranger. It was a really high-profile case for the time.LARSON: That's Charlie Shunick. These days, she's a missing persons advocate. Charlie estimates there have been thousands of videos, documentaries and podcasts all made about her sister's death. She knows from her own experience that real true crime can revictimize survivors. But as long as John keeps pretending his videos are true, she thinks he isn't any better.SHUNICK: The fact that people are calling in about these fake cases is one of the things that just enrages me. It's so hard, especially for cold case or long-term missing person cases, to get any type of attention and support and sometimes to even get law enforcement or media to respond to a call, email, DM. And the fact that they're going to dedicate time and resources to fake cases because the people making these don't have the decency to say that they're not real, it's infuriating.LARSON: When you press John about all this, though, about the kind of impact his videos might have, it falls flat.Do you have misgivings about what you do?JOHN: No, I don't. It's an absurdist art form. If people don't understand it, that says a lot about human nature and their own natures and the nature of true crime. And perhaps they're not willing to question themselves. But I don't have any misgivings about what I'm doing.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: While reporting this story, I went to YouTube for comment about John's videos. A few days later, they told me they had deleted his channel, not because the videos were made by AI or that he lied about them being true, they were deleted for violating policies prohibiting child sexual exploitation. John disputes this. He says all of his characters were over the age of 18. But John's still making content. He uploads the stories as podcasts now, and he has copycats. YouTube channels with names like Hidden Family Crime Stories, True Crime Cases (ph) and Crime Tapes are pumping out more and more AI-generated true crime videos every day.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CHANG: That was reporter Henry Larson.

The authoritative record of NPR’s programming is the audio record. Our next story plays with the line between fact and fiction. It begins with a mysterious video.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)AUTOMATED VOICE: Today, we uncover the tragic and complex story of Richard Engelbert, a successful real estate agent whose hidden life and secrets led to his brutal murder.CHANG: The crime had supposedly taken place in a city outside Denver more than a decade ago - or that's what viewers were led to believe. Reporter Henry Larson picks up the story from here for our regular segment of short-form audio documentaries.HENRY LARSON: Elizabeth Hernandez had never heard about the case of Richard Engelbert. She's a reporter at The Denver Post, and back in August, people started sending her newsroom a bunch of emails all about this one YouTube video.ELIZABETH HERNANDEZ: My editor said, like, hey, we're getting these messages. We have this thing from a tip line. Do you want to look at this video?LARSON: The video was called \"Husband's Secret Gay Love Affair With Stepson Ends In Grizzly Murder.\" Almost 2 million people had watched it.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)AUTOMATED VOICE: The truth about Richard's life and death had been revealed, but the scars left behind would take much longer to heal. The trial of...LARSON: That stilted narration was accompanied by these hazy images of houses against some mountains, and headshots of suspects and victims.Can you describe to me the tips? What did they say?HERNANDEZ: At least one of them said something along the lines of, why hasn't The Denver Post covered this?LARSON: What did you feel when you read that?HERNANDEZ: Rage.LARSON: Rage - because this crime readers were writing in about and blaming her paper for missing actually hadn't happened.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)HERNANDEZ: To me, it was very evident that it was not real pretty quickly. I was at The Denver Post in 2014 and probably would have remembered a very salacious case like this.LARSON: She called law enforcement sources and quickly confirmed her suspicions. The video was fake - the characters, the plot, the narrator all generated by AI.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: The video belonged to a YouTube channel called True Crime Case Files (ph). It was one of more than 150 videos on the page. A lot of them were hyper-sexual or hyper-violent. None of them were real. They'd all been created with AI and pretended to be about real places and people, and commenters were buying it.JOHN: The point is, it needs to be called true crime because true crime is a genre. It's not just two words melded together. It's a genre - true crime.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: Can you tell me your name?JOHN: My name's John (ph).LARSON: And John, that's your real first name?JOHN: Yes, that's my real first name.LARSON: And we're not using your last name, right?JOHN: Yes, we're not.LARSON: John and I started talking late last year. He was reluctant to go on the record, but agreed to chat over the phone in December. John said he started receiving hate mail and threats a while ago because of his videos, so NPR isn't using his last name to protect his identity. I was really fascinated with this whole operation.

It was one of more than 150 videos on the page. A lot of them were hyper-sexual or hyper-violent. None of them were real. They'd all been created with AI and pretended to be about real places and people, and commenters were buying it.JOHN: The point is, it needs to be called true crime because true crime is a genre. It's not just two words melded together. It's a genre - true crime.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: Can you tell me your name?JOHN: My name's John (ph).LARSON: And John, that's your real first name?JOHN: Yes, that's my real first name.LARSON: And we're not using your last name, right?JOHN: Yes, we're not.LARSON: John and I started talking late last year. He was reluctant to go on the record, but agreed to chat over the phone in December. John said he started receiving hate mail and threats a while ago because of his videos, so NPR isn't using his last name to protect his identity. I was really fascinated with this whole operation. There are lots of people who lie on the internet, but it felt like John was lying in a brand-new way. It started after he graduated college, when the pandemic was in full swing.JOHN: Me and my family - 'cause I was saying with my family then - we were - ended up binge-watching \"Dateline.\" Because you know that there's, like, 20 seasons of \"Dateline.\" Each was, like, 40 episodes. So, I mean, there's - you can watch it for hours and hours.LARSON: John taught himself the show's formula - a scandalous affair, some brutal crime and a stunning trial of a perpetrator to bring things home. Around this time, John also started trying out ChatGPT. He experimented with making parodies of another kind of super-formulaic content - Hallmark movies. He uploaded these videos with titles like \"Romance And Reindeer\" (ph) to YouTube. They were pretty simple, but John also made sure to include a note on each one disclosing that they were AI-generated.Why'd you stop?JOHN: Well, because I realized it didn't do well. And I labeled it AI parody, and it didn't do well. I think the best one maybe got 20 views.LARSON: The lesson John learned was that people wouldn't watch videos tagged as AI-generated. Then, around Thanksgiving two years ago, John also realized he could combine his AI video knowhow with what he learned watching all that \"Dateline,\" and True Crime Case Files was born. This time, though, there was no mention that videos were made up or that they used AI. For months, he cranked out these videos, uploading sometimes two or three a week. He got about 100,000 subscribers, and his videos sometimes got 10 times that number in views. He told me he was making enough to live on.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: Here's the thing that made me keep calling John. He believes what he's doing is better than real true crime because his stories don't use the suffering of real people as content.JOHN: At the end of the day, true crime, no matter how much it's dressed up as, we care about the victims or is this about finding justice, it's a form of entertainment.LARSON: Yeah. But, I mean, if you are so critical of true crime, and if it's causing all these problems in the world, why are you making it?JOHN: I'm creating an alternative to it because in this way, people can have all the luridness they want, but it's not hurting people. So I see of myself sort of like the vegan alternative to true crime.LARSON: Lots of people agree with John about this part - that true crime, popular as it is, has real problems. A 2003 study in the Journal of Communications showed people who watch violent, dramatic television news were more worried about crime. Nationwide, violent crime has been declining for decades, and yet polling consistently shows Americans believe crime is rising. Considering the tip sent to The Denver Post, some locals believed John's video, too. For some of John's critics, that's a problem.CHARLIE SHUNICK: I found myself in this world on May 19, 2012, when my sister, Mickey Shunick, went missing. She was abducted and murdered by a stranger. It was a really high-profile case for the time.LARSON: That's Charlie Shunick. These days, she's a missing persons advocate. Charlie estimates there have been thousands of videos, documentaries and podcasts all made about her sister's death. She knows from her own experience that real true crime can revictimize survivors. But as long as John keeps pretending his videos are true, she thinks he isn't any better.SHUNICK: The fact that people are calling in about these fake cases is one of the things that just enrages me. It's so hard, especially for cold case or long-term missing person cases, to get any type of attention and support and sometimes to even get law enforcement or media to respond to a call, email, DM. And the fact that they're going to dedicate time and resources to fake cases because the people making these don't have the decency to say that they're not real, it's infuriating.LARSON: When you press John about all this, though, about the kind of impact his videos might have, it falls flat.Do you have misgivings about what you do?JOHN: No, I don't. It's an absurdist art form. If people don't understand it, that says a lot about human nature and their own natures and the nature of true crime. And perhaps they're not willing to question themselves. But I don't have any misgivings about what I'm doing.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: While reporting this story, I went to YouTube for comment about John's videos. A few days later, they told me they had deleted his channel, not because the videos were made by AI or that he lied about them being true, they were deleted for violating policies prohibiting child sexual exploitation. John disputes this. He says all of his characters were over the age of 18. But John's still making content. He uploads the stories as podcasts now, and he has copycats. YouTube channels with names like Hidden Family Crime Stories, True Crime Cases (ph) and Crime Tapes are pumping out more and more AI-generated true crime videos every day.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CHANG: That was reporter Henry Larson.

What did they say?HERNANDEZ: At least one of them said something along the lines of, why hasn't The Denver Post covered this?LARSON: What did you feel when you read that?HERNANDEZ: Rage.LARSON: Rage - because this crime readers were writing in about and blaming her paper for missing actually hadn't happened.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)HERNANDEZ: To me, it was very evident that it was not real pretty quickly.

What did they say?HERNANDEZ: At least one of them said something along the lines of, why hasn't The Denver Post covered this?LARSON: What did you feel when you read that?HERNANDEZ: Rage.LARSON: Rage - because this crime readers were writing in about and blaming her paper for missing actually hadn't happened.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)HERNANDEZ: To me, it was very evident that it was not real pretty quickly. I was at The Denver Post in 2014 and probably would have remembered a very salacious case like this.LARSON: She called law enforcement sources and quickly confirmed her suspicions. The video was fake - the characters, the plot, the narrator all generated by AI.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: The video belonged to a YouTube channel called True Crime Case Files (ph). It was one of more than 150 videos on the page. A lot of them were hyper-sexual or hyper-violent. None of them were real. They'd all been created with AI and pretended to be about real places and people, and commenters were buying it.JOHN: The point is, it needs to be called true crime because true crime is a genre. It's not just two words melded together. It's a genre - true crime.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: Can you tell me your name?JOHN: My name's John (ph).LARSON: And John, that's your real first name?JOHN: Yes, that's my real first name.LARSON: And we're not using your last name, right?JOHN: Yes, we're not.LARSON: John and I started talking late last year. He was reluctant to go on the record, but agreed to chat over the phone in December. John said he started receiving hate mail and threats a while ago because of his videos, so NPR isn't using his last name to protect his identity. I was really fascinated with this whole operation. There are lots of people who lie on the internet, but it felt like John was lying in a brand-new way. It started after he graduated college, when the pandemic was in full swing.JOHN: Me and my family - 'cause I was saying with my family then - we were - ended up binge-watching \"Dateline.\" Because you know that there's, like, 20 seasons of \"Dateline.\" Each was, like, 40 episodes. So, I mean, there's - you can watch it for hours and hours.LARSON: John taught himself the show's formula - a scandalous affair, some brutal crime and a stunning trial of a perpetrator to bring things home. Around this time, John also started trying out ChatGPT. He experimented with making parodies of another kind of super-formulaic content - Hallmark movies. He uploaded these videos with titles like \"Romance And Reindeer\" (ph) to YouTube. They were pretty simple, but John also made sure to include a note on each one disclosing that they were AI-generated.Why'd you stop?JOHN: Well, because I realized it didn't do well. And I labeled it AI parody, and it didn't do well. I think the best one maybe got 20 views.LARSON: The lesson John learned was that people wouldn't watch videos tagged as AI-generated. Then, around Thanksgiving two years ago, John also realized he could combine his AI video knowhow with what he learned watching all that \"Dateline,\" and True Crime Case Files was born. This time, though, there was no mention that videos were made up or that they used AI. For months, he cranked out these videos, uploading sometimes two or three a week. He got about 100,000 subscribers, and his videos sometimes got 10 times that number in views. He told me he was making enough to live on.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: Here's the thing that made me keep calling John. He believes what he's doing is better than real true crime because his stories don't use the suffering of real people as content.JOHN: At the end of the day, true crime, no matter how much it's dressed up as, we care about the victims or is this about finding justice, it's a form of entertainment.LARSON: Yeah. But, I mean, if you are so critical of true crime, and if it's causing all these problems in the world, why are you making it?JOHN: I'm creating an alternative to it because in this way, people can have all the luridness they want, but it's not hurting people. So I see of myself sort of like the vegan alternative to true crime.LARSON: Lots of people agree with John about this part - that true crime, popular as it is, has real problems. A 2003 study in the Journal of Communications showed people who watch violent, dramatic television news were more worried about crime. Nationwide, violent crime has been declining for decades, and yet polling consistently shows Americans believe crime is rising. Considering the tip sent to The Denver Post, some locals believed John's video, too. For some of John's critics, that's a problem.CHARLIE SHUNICK: I found myself in this world on May 19, 2012, when my sister, Mickey Shunick, went missing. She was abducted and murdered by a stranger. It was a really high-profile case for the time.LARSON: That's Charlie Shunick. These days, she's a missing persons advocate. Charlie estimates there have been thousands of videos, documentaries and podcasts all made about her sister's death. She knows from her own experience that real true crime can revictimize survivors. But as long as John keeps pretending his videos are true, she thinks he isn't any better.SHUNICK: The fact that people are calling in about these fake cases is one of the things that just enrages me. It's so hard, especially for cold case or long-term missing person cases, to get any type of attention and support and sometimes to even get law enforcement or media to respond to a call, email, DM. And the fact that they're going to dedicate time and resources to fake cases because the people making these don't have the decency to say that they're not real, it's infuriating.LARSON: When you press John about all this, though, about the kind of impact his videos might have, it falls flat.Do you have misgivings about what you do?JOHN: No, I don't. It's an absurdist art form. If people don't understand it, that says a lot about human nature and their own natures and the nature of true crime. And perhaps they're not willing to question themselves. But I don't have any misgivings about what I'm doing.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: While reporting this story, I went to YouTube for comment about John's videos. A few days later, they told me they had deleted his channel, not because the videos were made by AI or that he lied about them being true, they were deleted for violating policies prohibiting child sexual exploitation. John disputes this. He says all of his characters were over the age of 18. But John's still making content. He uploads the stories as podcasts now, and he has copycats. YouTube channels with names like Hidden Family Crime Stories, True Crime Cases (ph) and Crime Tapes are pumping out more and more AI-generated true crime videos every day.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CHANG: That was reporter Henry Larson.

They'd all been created with AI and pretended to be about real places and people, and commenters were buying it.JOHN: The point is, it needs to be called true crime because true crime is a genre. It's not just two words melded together. It's a genre - true crime.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: Can you tell me your name?JOHN: My name's John (ph).LARSON: And John, that's your real first name?JOHN: Yes, that's my real first name.LARSON: And we're not using your last name, right?JOHN: Yes, we're not.LARSON: John and I started talking late last year. He was reluctant to go on the record, but agreed to chat over the phone in December. John said he started receiving hate mail and threats a while ago because of his videos, so NPR isn't using his last name to protect his identity. I was really fascinated with this whole operation. There are lots of people who lie on the internet, but it felt like John was lying in a brand-new way. It started after he graduated college, when the pandemic was in full swing.JOHN: Me and my family - 'cause I was saying with my family then - we were - ended up binge-watching \"Dateline.\" Because you know that there's, like, 20 seasons of \"Dateline.\" Each was, like, 40 episodes. So, I mean, there's - you can watch it for hours and hours.LARSON: John taught himself the show's formula - a scandalous affair, some brutal crime and a stunning trial of a perpetrator to bring things home. Around this time, John also started trying out ChatGPT. He experimented with making parodies of another kind of super-formulaic content - Hallmark movies. He uploaded these videos with titles like \"Romance And Reindeer\" (ph) to YouTube. They were pretty simple, but John also made sure to include a note on each one disclosing that they were AI-generated.Why'd you stop?JOHN: Well, because I realized it didn't do well. And I labeled it AI parody, and it didn't do well. I think the best one maybe got 20 views.LARSON: The lesson John learned was that people wouldn't watch videos tagged as AI-generated. Then, around Thanksgiving two years ago, John also realized he could combine his AI video knowhow with what he learned watching all that \"Dateline,\" and True Crime Case Files was born. This time, though, there was no mention that videos were made up or that they used AI. For months, he cranked out these videos, uploading sometimes two or three a week. He got about 100,000 subscribers, and his videos sometimes got 10 times that number in views. He told me he was making enough to live on.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: Here's the thing that made me keep calling John. He believes what he's doing is better than real true crime because his stories don't use the suffering of real people as content.JOHN: At the end of the day, true crime, no matter how much it's dressed up as, we care about the victims or is this about finding justice, it's a form of entertainment.LARSON: Yeah. But, I mean, if you are so critical of true crime, and if it's causing all these problems in the world, why are you making it?JOHN: I'm creating an alternative to it because in this way, people can have all the luridness they want, but it's not hurting people. So I see of myself sort of like the vegan alternative to true crime.LARSON: Lots of people agree with John about this part - that true crime, popular as it is, has real problems. A 2003 study in the Journal of Communications showed people who watch violent, dramatic television news were more worried about crime. Nationwide, violent crime has been declining for decades, and yet polling consistently shows Americans believe crime is rising. Considering the tip sent to The Denver Post, some locals believed John's video, too. For some of John's critics, that's a problem.CHARLIE SHUNICK: I found myself in this world on May 19, 2012, when my sister, Mickey Shunick, went missing. She was abducted and murdered by a stranger. It was a really high-profile case for the time.LARSON: That's Charlie Shunick. These days, she's a missing persons advocate. Charlie estimates there have been thousands of videos, documentaries and podcasts all made about her sister's death. She knows from her own experience that real true crime can revictimize survivors. But as long as John keeps pretending his videos are true, she thinks he isn't any better.SHUNICK: The fact that people are calling in about these fake cases is one of the things that just enrages me. It's so hard, especially for cold case or long-term missing person cases, to get any type of attention and support and sometimes to even get law enforcement or media to respond to a call, email, DM. And the fact that they're going to dedicate time and resources to fake cases because the people making these don't have the decency to say that they're not real, it's infuriating.LARSON: When you press John about all this, though, about the kind of impact his videos might have, it falls flat.Do you have misgivings about what you do?JOHN: No, I don't. It's an absurdist art form. If people don't understand it, that says a lot about human nature and their own natures and the nature of true crime. And perhaps they're not willing to question themselves. But I don't have any misgivings about what I'm doing.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: While reporting this story, I went to YouTube for comment about John's videos. A few days later, they told me they had deleted his channel, not because the videos were made by AI or that he lied about them being true, they were deleted for violating policies prohibiting child sexual exploitation. John disputes this. He says all of his characters were over the age of 18. But John's still making content. He uploads the stories as podcasts now, and he has copycats. YouTube channels with names like Hidden Family Crime Stories, True Crime Cases (ph) and Crime Tapes are pumping out more and more AI-generated true crime videos every day.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CHANG: That was reporter Henry Larson.

Then, around Thanksgiving two years ago, John also realized he could combine his AI video knowhow with what he learned watching all that \"Dateline,\" and True Crime Case Files was born. This time, though, there was no mention that videos were made up or that they used AI. For months, he cranked out these videos, uploading sometimes two or three a week. He got about 100,000 subscribers, and his videos sometimes got 10 times that number in views. He told me he was making enough to live on.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: Here's the thing that made me keep calling John. He believes what he's doing is better than real true crime because his stories don't use the suffering of real people as content.JOHN: At the end of the day, true crime, no matter how much it's dressed up as, we care about the victims or is this about finding justice, it's a form of entertainment.LARSON: Yeah. But, I mean, if you are so critical of true crime, and if it's causing all these problems in the world, why are you making it?JOHN: I'm creating an alternative to it because in this way, people can have all the luridness they want, but it's not hurting people. So I see of myself sort of like the vegan alternative to true crime.LARSON: Lots of people agree with John about this part - that true crime, popular as it is, has real problems. A 2003 study in the Journal of Communications showed people who watch violent, dramatic television news were more worried about crime. Nationwide, violent crime has been declining for decades, and yet polling consistently shows Americans believe crime is rising. Considering the tip sent to The Denver Post, some locals believed John's video, too. For some of John's critics, that's a problem.CHARLIE SHUNICK: I found myself in this world on May 19, 2012, when my sister, Mickey Shunick, went missing. She was abducted and murdered by a stranger. It was a really high-profile case for the time.LARSON: That's Charlie Shunick. These days, she's a missing persons advocate. Charlie estimates there have been thousands of videos, documentaries and podcasts all made about her sister's death. She knows from her own experience that real true crime can revictimize survivors. But as long as John keeps pretending his videos are true, she thinks he isn't any better.SHUNICK: The fact that people are calling in about these fake cases is one of the things that just enrages me. It's so hard, especially for cold case or long-term missing person cases, to get any type of attention and support and sometimes to even get law enforcement or media to respond to a call, email, DM. And the fact that they're going to dedicate time and resources to fake cases because the people making these don't have the decency to say that they're not real, it's infuriating.LARSON: When you press John about all this, though, about the kind of impact his videos might have, it falls flat.Do you have misgivings about what you do?JOHN: No, I don't. It's an absurdist art form. If people don't understand it, that says a lot about human nature and their own natures and the nature of true crime. And perhaps they're not willing to question themselves. But I don't have any misgivings about what I'm doing.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: While reporting this story, I went to YouTube for comment about John's videos. A few days later, they told me they had deleted his channel, not because the videos were made by AI or that he lied about them being true, they were deleted for violating policies prohibiting child sexual exploitation. John disputes this. He says all of his characters were over the age of 18. But John's still making content. He uploads the stories as podcasts now, and he has copycats. YouTube channels with names like Hidden Family Crime Stories, True Crime Cases (ph) and Crime Tapes are pumping out more and more AI-generated true crime videos every day.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CHANG: That was reporter Henry Larson.

AUTOMATED VOICE: The truth about Richard's life and death had been revealed, but the scars left behind would take much longer to heal. The trial of...LARSON: That stilted narration was accompanied by these hazy images of houses against some mountains, and headshots of suspects and victims.Can you describe to me the tips? What did they say?HERNANDEZ: At least one of them said something along the lines of, why hasn't The Denver Post covered this?LARSON: What did you feel when you read that?HERNANDEZ: Rage.LARSON: Rage - because this crime readers were writing in about and blaming her paper for missing actually hadn't happened.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)HERNANDEZ: To me, it was very evident that it was not real pretty quickly. I was at The Denver Post in 2014 and probably would have remembered a very salacious case like this.LARSON: She called law enforcement sources and quickly confirmed her suspicions. The video was fake - the characters, the plot, the narrator all generated by AI.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: The video belonged to a YouTube channel called True Crime Case Files (ph). It was one of more than 150 videos on the page. A lot of them were hyper-sexual or hyper-violent. None of them were real. They'd all been created with AI and pretended to be about real places and people, and commenters were buying it.JOHN: The point is, it needs to be called true crime because true crime is a genre. It's not just two words melded together. It's a genre - true crime.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: Can you tell me your name?JOHN: My name's John (ph).LARSON: And John, that's your real first name?JOHN: Yes, that's my real first name.LARSON: And we're not using your last name, right?JOHN: Yes, we're not.LARSON: John and I started talking late last year. He was reluctant to go on the record, but agreed to chat over the phone in December. John said he started receiving hate mail and threats a while ago because of his videos, so NPR isn't using his last name to protect his identity. I was really fascinated with this whole operation. There are lots of people who lie on the internet, but it felt like John was lying in a brand-new way. It started after he graduated college, when the pandemic was in full swing.JOHN: Me and my family - 'cause I was saying with my family then - we were - ended up binge-watching \"Dateline.\" Because you know that there's, like, 20 seasons of \"Dateline.\" Each was, like, 40 episodes. So, I mean, there's - you can watch it for hours and hours.LARSON: John taught himself the show's formula - a scandalous affair, some brutal crime and a stunning trial of a perpetrator to bring things home. Around this time, John also started trying out ChatGPT. He experimented with making parodies of another kind of super-formulaic content - Hallmark movies. He uploaded these videos with titles like \"Romance And Reindeer\" (ph) to YouTube. They were pretty simple, but John also made sure to include a note on each one disclosing that they were AI-generated.Why'd you stop?JOHN: Well, because I realized it didn't do well.

And the fact that they're going to dedicate time and resources to fake cases because the people making these don't have the decency to say that they're not real, it's infuriating.LARSON: When you press John about all this, though, about the kind of impact his videos might have, it falls flat.Do you have misgivings about what you do?JOHN: No, I don't. It's an absurdist art form. If people don't understand it, that says a lot about human nature and their own natures and the nature of true crime. And perhaps they're not willing to question themselves. But I don't have any misgivings about what I'm doing.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: While reporting this story, I went to YouTube for comment about John's videos. A few days later, they told me they had deleted his channel, not because the videos were made by AI or that he lied about them being true, they were deleted for violating policies prohibiting child sexual exploitation. John disputes this. He says all of his characters were over the age of 18. But John's still making content. He uploads the stories as podcasts now, and he has copycats. YouTube channels with names like Hidden Family Crime Stories, True Crime Cases (ph) and Crime Tapes are pumping out more and more AI-generated true crime videos every day.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CHANG: That was reporter Henry Larson.

The authoritative record of NPR’s programming is the audio record. Can you describe to me the tips? What did they say?HERNANDEZ: At least one of them said something along the lines of, why hasn't The Denver Post covered this?LARSON: What did you feel when you read that?HERNANDEZ: Rage.LARSON: Rage - because this crime readers were writing in about and blaming her paper for missing actually hadn't happened.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)HERNANDEZ: To me, it was very evident that it was not real pretty quickly. I was at The Denver Post in 2014 and probably would have remembered a very salacious case like this.LARSON: She called law enforcement sources and quickly confirmed her suspicions. The video was fake - the characters, the plot, the narrator all generated by AI.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: The video belonged to a YouTube channel called True Crime Case Files (ph). It was one of more than 150 videos on the page. A lot of them were hyper-sexual or hyper-violent. None of them were real. They'd all been created with AI and pretended to be about real places and people, and commenters were buying it.JOHN: The point is, it needs to be called true crime because true crime is a genre. It's not just two words melded together. It's a genre - true crime.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: Can you tell me your name?JOHN: My name's John (ph).LARSON: And John, that's your real first name?JOHN: Yes, that's my real first name.LARSON: And we're not using your last name, right?JOHN: Yes, we're not.LARSON: John and I started talking late last year. He was reluctant to go on the record, but agreed to chat over the phone in December. John said he started receiving hate mail and threats a while ago because of his videos, so NPR isn't using his last name to protect his identity. I was really fascinated with this whole operation. There are lots of people who lie on the internet, but it felt like John was lying in a brand-new way. It started after he graduated college, when the pandemic was in full swing.JOHN: Me and my family - 'cause I was saying with my family then - we were - ended up binge-watching \"Dateline.\" Because you know that there's, like, 20 seasons of \"Dateline.\" Each was, like, 40 episodes. So, I mean, there's - you can watch it for hours and hours.LARSON: John taught himself the show's formula - a scandalous affair, some brutal crime and a stunning trial of a perpetrator to bring things home. Around this time, John also started trying out ChatGPT. He experimented with making parodies of another kind of super-formulaic content - Hallmark movies. He uploaded these videos with titles like \"Romance And Reindeer\" (ph) to YouTube. They were pretty simple, but John also made sure to include a note on each one disclosing that they were AI-generated.Why'd you stop?JOHN: Well, because I realized it didn't do well. And I labeled it AI parody, and it didn't do well. I think the best one maybe got 20 views.LARSON: The lesson John learned was that people wouldn't watch videos tagged as AI-generated. Then, around Thanksgiving two years ago, John also realized he could combine his AI video knowhow with what he learned watching all that \"Dateline,\" and True Crime Case Files was born. This time, though, there was no mention that videos were made up or that they used AI. For months, he cranked out these videos, uploading sometimes two or three a week. He got about 100,000 subscribers, and his videos sometimes got 10 times that number in views. He told me he was making enough to live on.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: Here's the thing that made me keep calling John. He believes what he's doing is better than real true crime because his stories don't use the suffering of real people as content.JOHN: At the end of the day, true crime, no matter how much it's dressed up as, we care about the victims or is this about finding justice, it's a form of entertainment.LARSON: Yeah. But, I mean, if you are so critical of true crime, and if it's causing all these problems in the world, why are you making it?JOHN: I'm creating an alternative to it because in this way, people can have all the luridness they want, but it's not hurting people. So I see of myself sort of like the vegan alternative to true crime.LARSON: Lots of people agree with John about this part - that true crime, popular as it is, has real problems. A 2003 study in the Journal of Communications showed people who watch violent, dramatic television news were more worried about crime. Nationwide, violent crime has been declining for decades, and yet polling consistently shows Americans believe crime is rising. Considering the tip sent to The Denver Post, some locals believed John's video, too. For some of John's critics, that's a problem.CHARLIE SHUNICK: I found myself in this world on May 19, 2012, when my sister, Mickey Shunick, went missing. She was abducted and murdered by a stranger. It was a really high-profile case for the time.LARSON: That's Charlie Shunick. These days, she's a missing persons advocate. Charlie estimates there have been thousands of videos, documentaries and podcasts all made about her sister's death. She knows from her own experience that real true crime can revictimize survivors. But as long as John keeps pretending his videos are true, she thinks he isn't any better.SHUNICK: The fact that people are calling in about these fake cases is one of the things that just enrages me.

It started after he graduated college, when the pandemic was in full swing.JOHN: Me and my family - 'cause I was saying with my family then - we were - ended up binge-watching \"Dateline.\" Because you know that there's, like, 20 seasons of \"Dateline.\" Each was, like, 40 episodes. So, I mean, there's - you can watch it for hours and hours.LARSON: John taught himself the show's formula - a scandalous affair, some brutal crime and a stunning trial of a perpetrator to bring things home. Around this time, John also started trying out ChatGPT. He experimented with making parodies of another kind of super-formulaic content - Hallmark movies. He uploaded these videos with titles like \"Romance And Reindeer\" (ph) to YouTube. They were pretty simple, but John also made sure to include a note on each one disclosing that they were AI-generated.Why'd you stop?JOHN: Well, because I realized it didn't do well. And I labeled it AI parody, and it didn't do well. I think the best one maybe got 20 views.LARSON: The lesson John learned was that people wouldn't watch videos tagged as AI-generated. Then, around Thanksgiving two years ago, John also realized he could combine his AI video knowhow with what he learned watching all that \"Dateline,\" and True Crime Case Files was born. This time, though, there was no mention that videos were made up or that they used AI. For months, he cranked out these videos, uploading sometimes two or three a week. He got about 100,000 subscribers, and his videos sometimes got 10 times that number in views. He told me he was making enough to live on.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: Here's the thing that made me keep calling John. He believes what he's doing is better than real true crime because his stories don't use the suffering of real people as content.JOHN: At the end of the day, true crime, no matter how much it's dressed up as, we care about the victims or is this about finding justice, it's a form of entertainment.LARSON: Yeah. But, I mean, if you are so critical of true crime, and if it's causing all these problems in the world, why are you making it?JOHN: I'm creating an alternative to it because in this way, people can have all the luridness they want, but it's not hurting people. So I see of myself sort of like the vegan alternative to true crime.LARSON: Lots of people agree with John about this part - that true crime, popular as it is, has real problems. A 2003 study in the Journal of Communications showed people who watch violent, dramatic television news were more worried about crime. Nationwide, violent crime has been declining for decades, and yet polling consistently shows Americans believe crime is rising. Considering the tip sent to The Denver Post, some locals believed John's video, too. For some of John's critics, that's a problem.CHARLIE SHUNICK: I found myself in this world on May 19, 2012, when my sister, Mickey Shunick, went missing. She was abducted and murdered by a stranger. It was a really high-profile case for the time.LARSON: That's Charlie Shunick. These days, she's a missing persons advocate. Charlie estimates there have been thousands of videos, documentaries and podcasts all made about her sister's death. She knows from her own experience that real true crime can revictimize survivors. But as long as John keeps pretending his videos are true, she thinks he isn't any better.SHUNICK: The fact that people are calling in about these fake cases is one of the things that just enrages me. It's so hard, especially for cold case or long-term missing person cases, to get any type of attention and support and sometimes to even get law enforcement or media to respond to a call, email, DM. And the fact that they're going to dedicate time and resources to fake cases because the people making these don't have the decency to say that they're not real, it's infuriating.LARSON: When you press John about all this, though, about the kind of impact his videos might have, it falls flat.Do you have misgivings about what you do?JOHN: No, I don't. It's an absurdist art form. If people don't understand it, that says a lot about human nature and their own natures and the nature of true crime. And perhaps they're not willing to question themselves. But I don't have any misgivings about what I'm doing.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: While reporting this story, I went to YouTube for comment about John's videos. A few days later, they told me they had deleted his channel, not because the videos were made by AI or that he lied about them being true, they were deleted for violating policies prohibiting child sexual exploitation. John disputes this. He says all of his characters were over the age of 18. But John's still making content. He uploads the stories as podcasts now, and he has copycats. YouTube channels with names like Hidden Family Crime Stories, True Crime Cases (ph) and Crime Tapes are pumping out more and more AI-generated true crime videos every day.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CHANG: That was reporter Henry Larson.

HERNANDEZ: Rage.LARSON: Rage - because this crime readers were writing in about and blaming her paper for missing actually hadn't happened.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)HERNANDEZ: To me, it was very evident that it was not real pretty quickly. I was at The Denver Post in 2014 and probably would have remembered a very salacious case like this.LARSON: She called law enforcement sources and quickly confirmed her suspicions. The video was fake - the characters, the plot, the narrator all generated by AI.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: The video belonged to a YouTube channel called True Crime Case Files (ph). It was one of more than 150 videos on the page. A lot of them were hyper-sexual or hyper-violent. None of them were real. They'd all been created with AI and pretended to be about real places and people, and commenters were buying it.JOHN: The point is, it needs to be called true crime because true crime is a genre. It's not just two words melded together. It's a genre - true crime.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: Can you tell me your name?JOHN: My name's John (ph).LARSON: And John, that's your real first name?JOHN: Yes, that's my real first name.LARSON: And we're not using your last name, right?JOHN: Yes, we're not.LARSON: John and I started talking late last year.

A few days later, they told me they had deleted his channel, not because the videos were made by AI or that he lied about them being true, they were deleted for violating policies prohibiting child sexual exploitation. John disputes this. He says all of his characters were over the age of 18. But John's still making content. He uploads the stories as podcasts now, and he has copycats. YouTube channels with names like Hidden Family Crime Stories, True Crime Cases (ph) and Crime Tapes are pumping out more and more AI-generated true crime videos every day.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CHANG: That was reporter Henry Larson.

I was at The Denver Post in 2014 and probably would have remembered a very salacious case like this.LARSON: She called law enforcement sources and quickly confirmed her suspicions. The video was fake - the characters, the plot, the narrator all generated by AI.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: The video belonged to a YouTube channel called True Crime Case Files (ph). It was one of more than 150 videos on the page. A lot of them were hyper-sexual or hyper-violent. None of them were real. They'd all been created with AI and pretended to be about real places and people, and commenters were buying it.JOHN: The point is, it needs to be called true crime because true crime is a genre. It's not just two words melded together. It's a genre - true crime.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: Can you tell me your name?JOHN: My name's John (ph).LARSON: And John, that's your real first name?JOHN: Yes, that's my real first name.LARSON: And we're not using your last name, right?JOHN: Yes, we're not.LARSON: John and I started talking late last year. He was reluctant to go on the record, but agreed to chat over the phone in December. John said he started receiving hate mail and threats a while ago because of his videos, so NPR isn't using his last name to protect his identity. I was really fascinated with this whole operation. There are lots of people who lie on the internet, but it felt like John was lying in a brand-new way. It started after he graduated college, when the pandemic was in full swing.JOHN: Me and my family - 'cause I was saying with my family then - we were - ended up binge-watching \"Dateline.\" Because you know that there's, like, 20 seasons of \"Dateline.\" Each was, like, 40 episodes. So, I mean, there's - you can watch it for hours and hours.LARSON: John taught himself the show's formula - a scandalous affair, some brutal crime and a stunning trial of a perpetrator to bring things home. Around this time, John also started trying out ChatGPT. He experimented with making parodies of another kind of super-formulaic content - Hallmark movies. He uploaded these videos with titles like \"Romance And Reindeer\" (ph) to YouTube. They were pretty simple, but John also made sure to include a note on each one disclosing that they were AI-generated.Why'd you stop?JOHN: Well, because I realized it didn't do well. And I labeled it AI parody, and it didn't do well. I think the best one maybe got 20 views.LARSON: The lesson John learned was that people wouldn't watch videos tagged as AI-generated. Then, around Thanksgiving two years ago, John also realized he could combine his AI video knowhow with what he learned watching all that \"Dateline,\" and True Crime Case Files was born. This time, though, there was no mention that videos were made up or that they used AI. For months, he cranked out these videos, uploading sometimes two or three a week. He got about 100,000 subscribers, and his videos sometimes got 10 times that number in views. He told me he was making enough to live on.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: Here's the thing that made me keep calling John. He believes what he's doing is better than real true crime because his stories don't use the suffering of real people as content.JOHN: At the end of the day, true crime, no matter how much it's dressed up as, we care about the victims or is this about finding justice, it's a form of entertainment.LARSON: Yeah. But, I mean, if you are so critical of true crime, and if it's causing all these problems in the world, why are you making it?JOHN: I'm creating an alternative to it because in this way, people can have all the luridness they want, but it's not hurting people. So I see of myself sort of like the vegan alternative to true crime.LARSON: Lots of people agree with John about this part - that true crime, popular as it is, has real problems. A 2003 study in the Journal of Communications showed people who watch violent, dramatic television news were more worried about crime. Nationwide, violent crime has been declining for decades, and yet polling consistently shows Americans believe crime is rising. Considering the tip sent to The Denver Post, some locals believed John's video, too. For some of John's critics, that's a problem.CHARLIE SHUNICK: I found myself in this world on May 19, 2012, when my sister, Mickey Shunick, went missing. She was abducted and murdered by a stranger. It was a really high-profile case for the time.LARSON: That's Charlie Shunick. These days, she's a missing persons advocate. Charlie estimates there have been thousands of videos, documentaries and podcasts all made about her sister's death. She knows from her own experience that real true crime can revictimize survivors. But as long as John keeps pretending his videos are true, she thinks he isn't any better.SHUNICK: The fact that people are calling in about these fake cases is one of the things that just enrages me. It's so hard, especially for cold case or long-term missing person cases, to get any type of attention and support and sometimes to even get law enforcement or media to respond to a call, email, DM. And the fact that they're going to dedicate time and resources to fake cases because the people making these don't have the decency to say that they're not real, it's infuriating.LARSON: When you press John about all this, though, about the kind of impact his videos might have, it falls flat.Do you have misgivings about what you do?JOHN: No, I don't. It's an absurdist art form. If people don't understand it, that says a lot about human nature and their own natures and the nature of true crime. And perhaps they're not willing to question themselves. But I don't have any misgivings about what I'm doing.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: While reporting this story, I went to YouTube for comment about John's videos.

Nationwide, violent crime has been declining for decades, and yet polling consistently shows Americans believe crime is rising. Considering the tip sent to The Denver Post, some locals believed John's video, too. For some of John's critics, that's a problem.CHARLIE SHUNICK: I found myself in this world on May 19, 2012, when my sister, Mickey Shunick, went missing. She was abducted and murdered by a stranger. It was a really high-profile case for the time.LARSON: That's Charlie Shunick. These days, she's a missing persons advocate. Charlie estimates there have been thousands of videos, documentaries and podcasts all made about her sister's death. She knows from her own experience that real true crime can revictimize survivors. But as long as John keeps pretending his videos are true, she thinks he isn't any better.SHUNICK: The fact that people are calling in about these fake cases is one of the things that just enrages me. It's so hard, especially for cold case or long-term missing person cases, to get any type of attention and support and sometimes to even get law enforcement or media to respond to a call, email, DM. And the fact that they're going to dedicate time and resources to fake cases because the people making these don't have the decency to say that they're not real, it's infuriating.LARSON: When you press John about all this, though, about the kind of impact his videos might have, it falls flat.Do you have misgivings about what you do?JOHN: No, I don't. It's an absurdist art form. If people don't understand it, that says a lot about human nature and their own natures and the nature of true crime. And perhaps they're not willing to question themselves. But I don't have any misgivings about what I'm doing.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: While reporting this story, I went to YouTube for comment about John's videos. A few days later, they told me they had deleted his channel, not because the videos were made by AI or that he lied about them being true, they were deleted for violating policies prohibiting child sexual exploitation. John disputes this. He says all of his characters were over the age of 18. But John's still making content. He uploads the stories as podcasts now, and he has copycats. YouTube channels with names like Hidden Family Crime Stories, True Crime Cases (ph) and Crime Tapes are pumping out more and more AI-generated true crime videos every day.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CHANG: That was reporter Henry Larson.

The authoritative record of NPR’s programming is the audio record. LARSON: She called law enforcement sources and quickly confirmed her suspicions. The video was fake - the characters, the plot, the narrator all generated by AI.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: The video belonged to a YouTube channel called True Crime Case Files (ph). It was one of more than 150 videos on the page. A lot of them were hyper-sexual or hyper-violent. None of them were real. They'd all been created with AI and pretended to be about real places and people, and commenters were buying it.JOHN: The point is, it needs to be called true crime because true crime is a genre. It's not just two words melded together. It's a genre - true crime.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: Can you tell me your name?JOHN: My name's John (ph).LARSON: And John, that's your real first name?JOHN: Yes, that's my real first name.LARSON: And we're not using your last name, right?JOHN: Yes, we're not.LARSON: John and I started talking late last year. He was reluctant to go on the record, but agreed to chat over the phone in December. John said he started receiving hate mail and threats a while ago because of his videos, so NPR isn't using his last name to protect his identity. I was really fascinated with this whole operation. There are lots of people who lie on the internet, but it felt like John was lying in a brand-new way. It started after he graduated college, when the pandemic was in full swing.JOHN: Me and my family - 'cause I was saying with my family then - we were - ended up binge-watching \"Dateline.\" Because you know that there's, like, 20 seasons of \"Dateline.\" Each was, like, 40 episodes. So, I mean, there's - you can watch it for hours and hours.LARSON: John taught himself the show's formula - a scandalous affair, some brutal crime and a stunning trial of a perpetrator to bring things home. Around this time, John also started trying out ChatGPT. He experimented with making parodies of another kind of super-formulaic content - Hallmark movies. He uploaded these videos with titles like \"Romance And Reindeer\" (ph) to YouTube. They were pretty simple, but John also made sure to include a note on each one disclosing that they were AI-generated.Why'd you stop?JOHN: Well, because I realized it didn't do well. And I labeled it AI parody, and it didn't do well. I think the best one maybe got 20 views.LARSON: The lesson John learned was that people wouldn't watch videos tagged as AI-generated. Then, around Thanksgiving two years ago, John also realized he could combine his AI video knowhow with what he learned watching all that \"Dateline,\" and True Crime Case Files was born. This time, though, there was no mention that videos were made up or that they used AI. For months, he cranked out these videos, uploading sometimes two or three a week. He got about 100,000 subscribers, and his videos sometimes got 10 times that number in views. He told me he was making enough to live on.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: Here's the thing that made me keep calling John. He believes what he's doing is better than real true crime because his stories don't use the suffering of real people as content.JOHN: At the end of the day, true crime, no matter how much it's dressed up as, we care about the victims or is this about finding justice, it's a form of entertainment.LARSON: Yeah. But, I mean, if you are so critical of true crime, and if it's causing all these problems in the world, why are you making it?JOHN: I'm creating an alternative to it because in this way, people can have all the luridness they want, but it's not hurting people.

But, I mean, if you are so critical of true crime, and if it's causing all these problems in the world, why are you making it?JOHN: I'm creating an alternative to it because in this way, people can have all the luridness they want, but it's not hurting people. So I see of myself sort of like the vegan alternative to true crime.LARSON: Lots of people agree with John about this part - that true crime, popular as it is, has real problems. A 2003 study in the Journal of Communications showed people who watch violent, dramatic television news were more worried about crime. Nationwide, violent crime has been declining for decades, and yet polling consistently shows Americans believe crime is rising. Considering the tip sent to The Denver Post, some locals believed John's video, too. For some of John's critics, that's a problem.CHARLIE SHUNICK: I found myself in this world on May 19, 2012, when my sister, Mickey Shunick, went missing. She was abducted and murdered by a stranger. It was a really high-profile case for the time.LARSON: That's Charlie Shunick. These days, she's a missing persons advocate. Charlie estimates there have been thousands of videos, documentaries and podcasts all made about her sister's death. She knows from her own experience that real true crime can revictimize survivors. But as long as John keeps pretending his videos are true, she thinks he isn't any better.SHUNICK: The fact that people are calling in about these fake cases is one of the things that just enrages me. It's so hard, especially for cold case or long-term missing person cases, to get any type of attention and support and sometimes to even get law enforcement or media to respond to a call, email, DM. And the fact that they're going to dedicate time and resources to fake cases because the people making these don't have the decency to say that they're not real, it's infuriating.LARSON: When you press John about all this, though, about the kind of impact his videos might have, it falls flat.Do you have misgivings about what you do?JOHN: No, I don't. It's an absurdist art form. If people don't understand it, that says a lot about human nature and their own natures and the nature of true crime. And perhaps they're not willing to question themselves. But I don't have any misgivings about what I'm doing.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: While reporting this story, I went to YouTube for comment about John's videos. A few days later, they told me they had deleted his channel, not because the videos were made by AI or that he lied about them being true, they were deleted for violating policies prohibiting child sexual exploitation. John disputes this. He says all of his characters were over the age of 18. But John's still making content. He uploads the stories as podcasts now, and he has copycats. YouTube channels with names like Hidden Family Crime Stories, True Crime Cases (ph) and Crime Tapes are pumping out more and more AI-generated true crime videos every day.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CHANG: That was reporter Henry Larson.

The authoritative record of NPR’s programming is the audio record. JOHN: The point is, it needs to be called true crime because true crime is a genre. It's not just two words melded together. It's a genre - true crime.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: Can you tell me your name?JOHN: My name's John (ph).LARSON: And John, that's your real first name?JOHN: Yes, that's my real first name.LARSON: And we're not using your last name, right?JOHN: Yes, we're not.LARSON: John and I started talking late last year. He was reluctant to go on the record, but agreed to chat over the phone in December. John said he started receiving hate mail and threats a while ago because of his videos, so NPR isn't using his last name to protect his identity. I was really fascinated with this whole operation. There are lots of people who lie on the internet, but it felt like John was lying in a brand-new way. It started after he graduated college, when the pandemic was in full swing.JOHN: Me and my family - 'cause I was saying with my family then - we were - ended up binge-watching \"Dateline.\" Because you know that there's, like, 20 seasons of \"Dateline.\" Each was, like, 40 episodes. So, I mean, there's - you can watch it for hours and hours.LARSON: John taught himself the show's formula - a scandalous affair, some brutal crime and a stunning trial of a perpetrator to bring things home. Around this time, John also started trying out ChatGPT. He experimented with making parodies of another kind of super-formulaic content - Hallmark movies. He uploaded these videos with titles like \"Romance And Reindeer\" (ph) to YouTube. They were pretty simple, but John also made sure to include a note on each one disclosing that they were AI-generated.Why'd you stop?JOHN: Well, because I realized it didn't do well. And I labeled it AI parody, and it didn't do well. I think the best one maybe got 20 views.LARSON: The lesson John learned was that people wouldn't watch videos tagged as AI-generated. Then, around Thanksgiving two years ago, John also realized he could combine his AI video knowhow with what he learned watching all that \"Dateline,\" and True Crime Case Files was born. This time, though, there was no mention that videos were made up or that they used AI. For months, he cranked out these videos, uploading sometimes two or three a week. He got about 100,000 subscribers, and his videos sometimes got 10 times that number in views.

And the fact that they're going to dedicate time and resources to fake cases because the people making these don't have the decency to say that they're not real, it's infuriating.LARSON: When you press John about all this, though, about the kind of impact his videos might have, it falls flat.Do you have misgivings about what you do?JOHN: No, I don't. It's an absurdist art form. If people don't understand it, that says a lot about human nature and their own natures and the nature of true crime. And perhaps they're not willing to question themselves. But I don't have any misgivings about what I'm doing.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: While reporting this story, I went to YouTube for comment about John's videos. A few days later, they told me they had deleted his channel, not because the videos were made by AI or that he lied about them being true, they were deleted for violating policies prohibiting child sexual exploitation. John disputes this. He says all of his characters were over the age of 18. But John's still making content. He uploads the stories as podcasts now, and he has copycats. YouTube channels with names like Hidden Family Crime Stories, True Crime Cases (ph) and Crime Tapes are pumping out more and more AI-generated true crime videos every day.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CHANG: That was reporter Henry Larson.

LARSON: Can you tell me your name?JOHN: My name's John (ph).LARSON: And John, that's your real first name?JOHN: Yes, that's my real first name.LARSON: And we're not using your last name, right?JOHN: Yes, we're not.LARSON: John and I started talking late last year. He was reluctant to go on the record, but agreed to chat over the phone in December. John said he started receiving hate mail and threats a while ago because of his videos, so NPR isn't using his last name to protect his identity. I was really fascinated with this whole operation. There are lots of people who lie on the internet, but it felt like John was lying in a brand-new way. It started after he graduated college, when the pandemic was in full swing.JOHN: Me and my family - 'cause I was saying with my family then - we were - ended up binge-watching \"Dateline.\" Because you know that there's, like, 20 seasons of \"Dateline.\" Each was, like, 40 episodes. So, I mean, there's - you can watch it for hours and hours.LARSON: John taught himself the show's formula - a scandalous affair, some brutal crime and a stunning trial of a perpetrator to bring things home. Around this time, John also started trying out ChatGPT. He experimented with making parodies of another kind of super-formulaic content - Hallmark movies. He uploaded these videos with titles like \"Romance And Reindeer\" (ph) to YouTube. They were pretty simple, but John also made sure to include a note on each one disclosing that they were AI-generated.Why'd you stop?JOHN: Well, because I realized it didn't do well. And I labeled it AI parody, and it didn't do well. I think the best one maybe got 20 views.LARSON: The lesson John learned was that people wouldn't watch videos tagged as AI-generated. Then, around Thanksgiving two years ago, John also realized he could combine his AI video knowhow with what he learned watching all that \"Dateline,\" and True Crime Case Files was born. This time, though, there was no mention that videos were made up or that they used AI. For months, he cranked out these videos, uploading sometimes two or three a week. He got about 100,000 subscribers, and his videos sometimes got 10 times that number in views. He told me he was making enough to live on.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: Here's the thing that made me keep calling John. He believes what he's doing is better than real true crime because his stories don't use the suffering of real people as content.JOHN: At the end of the day, true crime, no matter how much it's dressed up as, we care about the victims or is this about finding justice, it's a form of entertainment.LARSON: Yeah. But, I mean, if you are so critical of true crime, and if it's causing all these problems in the world, why are you making it?JOHN: I'm creating an alternative to it because in this way, people can have all the luridness they want, but it's not hurting people. So I see of myself sort of like the vegan alternative to true crime.LARSON: Lots of people agree with John about this part - that true crime, popular as it is, has real problems. A 2003 study in the Journal of Communications showed people who watch violent, dramatic television news were more worried about crime. Nationwide, violent crime has been declining for decades, and yet polling consistently shows Americans believe crime is rising. Considering the tip sent to The Denver Post, some locals believed John's video, too. For some of John's critics, that's a problem.CHARLIE SHUNICK: I found myself in this world on May 19, 2012, when my sister, Mickey Shunick, went missing. She was abducted and murdered by a stranger. It was a really high-profile case for the time.LARSON: That's Charlie Shunick. These days, she's a missing persons advocate. Charlie estimates there have been thousands of videos, documentaries and podcasts all made about her sister's death. She knows from her own experience that real true crime can revictimize survivors.

It started after he graduated college, when the pandemic was in full swing.JOHN: Me and my family - 'cause I was saying with my family then - we were - ended up binge-watching \"Dateline.\" Because you know that there's, like, 20 seasons of \"Dateline.\" Each was, like, 40 episodes. So, I mean, there's - you can watch it for hours and hours.LARSON: John taught himself the show's formula - a scandalous affair, some brutal crime and a stunning trial of a perpetrator to bring things home. Around this time, John also started trying out ChatGPT. He experimented with making parodies of another kind of super-formulaic content - Hallmark movies. He uploaded these videos with titles like \"Romance And Reindeer\" (ph) to YouTube. They were pretty simple, but John also made sure to include a note on each one disclosing that they were AI-generated.Why'd you stop?JOHN: Well, because I realized it didn't do well. And I labeled it AI parody, and it didn't do well. I think the best one maybe got 20 views.LARSON: The lesson John learned was that people wouldn't watch videos tagged as AI-generated. Then, around Thanksgiving two years ago, John also realized he could combine his AI video knowhow with what he learned watching all that \"Dateline,\" and True Crime Case Files was born. This time, though, there was no mention that videos were made up or that they used AI. For months, he cranked out these videos, uploading sometimes two or three a week. He got about 100,000 subscribers, and his videos sometimes got 10 times that number in views. He told me he was making enough to live on.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: Here's the thing that made me keep calling John. He believes what he's doing is better than real true crime because his stories don't use the suffering of real people as content.JOHN: At the end of the day, true crime, no matter how much it's dressed up as, we care about the victims or is this about finding justice, it's a form of entertainment.LARSON: Yeah. But, I mean, if you are so critical of true crime, and if it's causing all these problems in the world, why are you making it?JOHN: I'm creating an alternative to it because in this way, people can have all the luridness they want, but it's not hurting people. So I see of myself sort of like the vegan alternative to true crime.LARSON: Lots of people agree with John about this part - that true crime, popular as it is, has real problems. A 2003 study in the Journal of Communications showed people who watch violent, dramatic television news were more worried about crime. Nationwide, violent crime has been declining for decades, and yet polling consistently shows Americans believe crime is rising. Considering the tip sent to The Denver Post, some locals believed John's video, too. For some of John's critics, that's a problem.CHARLIE SHUNICK: I found myself in this world on May 19, 2012, when my sister, Mickey Shunick, went missing. She was abducted and murdered by a stranger. It was a really high-profile case for the time.LARSON: That's Charlie Shunick. These days, she's a missing persons advocate. Charlie estimates there have been thousands of videos, documentaries and podcasts all made about her sister's death. She knows from her own experience that real true crime can revictimize survivors. But as long as John keeps pretending his videos are true, she thinks he isn't any better.SHUNICK: The fact that people are calling in about these fake cases is one of the things that just enrages me. It's so hard, especially for cold case or long-term missing person cases, to get any type of attention and support and sometimes to even get law enforcement or media to respond to a call, email, DM. And the fact that they're going to dedicate time and resources to fake cases because the people making these don't have the decency to say that they're not real, it's infuriating.LARSON: When you press John about all this, though, about the kind of impact his videos might have, it falls flat.Do you have misgivings about what you do?JOHN: No, I don't. It's an absurdist art form. If people don't understand it, that says a lot about human nature and their own natures and the nature of true crime. And perhaps they're not willing to question themselves. But I don't have any misgivings about what I'm doing.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: While reporting this story, I went to YouTube for comment about John's videos. A few days later, they told me they had deleted his channel, not because the videos were made by AI or that he lied about them being true, they were deleted for violating policies prohibiting child sexual exploitation. John disputes this. He says all of his characters were over the age of 18. But John's still making content. He uploads the stories as podcasts now, and he has copycats. YouTube channels with names like Hidden Family Crime Stories, True Crime Cases (ph) and Crime Tapes are pumping out more and more AI-generated true crime videos every day.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CHANG: That was reporter Henry Larson.

But as long as John keeps pretending his videos are true, she thinks he isn't any better.SHUNICK: The fact that people are calling in about these fake cases is one of the things that just enrages me. It's so hard, especially for cold case or long-term missing person cases, to get any type of attention and support and sometimes to even get law enforcement or media to respond to a call, email, DM. And the fact that they're going to dedicate time and resources to fake cases because the people making these don't have the decency to say that they're not real, it's infuriating.LARSON: When you press John about all this, though, about the kind of impact his videos might have, it falls flat.Do you have misgivings about what you do?JOHN: No, I don't. It's an absurdist art form. If people don't understand it, that says a lot about human nature and their own natures and the nature of true crime. And perhaps they're not willing to question themselves. But I don't have any misgivings about what I'm doing.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: While reporting this story, I went to YouTube for comment about John's videos. A few days later, they told me they had deleted his channel, not because the videos were made by AI or that he lied about them being true, they were deleted for violating policies prohibiting child sexual exploitation. John disputes this. He says all of his characters were over the age of 18. But John's still making content. He uploads the stories as podcasts now, and he has copycats. YouTube channels with names like Hidden Family Crime Stories, True Crime Cases (ph) and Crime Tapes are pumping out more and more AI-generated true crime videos every day.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CHANG: That was reporter Henry Larson.

The authoritative record of NPR’s programming is the audio record. LARSON: John and I started talking late last year. He was reluctant to go on the record, but agreed to chat over the phone in December. John said he started receiving hate mail and threats a while ago because of his videos, so NPR isn't using his last name to protect his identity. I was really fascinated with this whole operation. There are lots of people who lie on the internet, but it felt like John was lying in a brand-new way. It started after he graduated college, when the pandemic was in full swing.JOHN: Me and my family - 'cause I was saying with my family then - we were - ended up binge-watching \"Dateline.\" Because you know that there's, like, 20 seasons of \"Dateline.\" Each was, like, 40 episodes. So, I mean, there's - you can watch it for hours and hours.LARSON: John taught himself the show's formula - a scandalous affair, some brutal crime and a stunning trial of a perpetrator to bring things home. Around this time, John also started trying out ChatGPT. He experimented with making parodies of another kind of super-formulaic content - Hallmark movies. He uploaded these videos with titles like \"Romance And Reindeer\" (ph) to YouTube. They were pretty simple, but John also made sure to include a note on each one disclosing that they were AI-generated.Why'd you stop?JOHN: Well, because I realized it didn't do well. And I labeled it AI parody, and it didn't do well. I think the best one maybe got 20 views.LARSON: The lesson John learned was that people wouldn't watch videos tagged as AI-generated. Then, around Thanksgiving two years ago, John also realized he could combine his AI video knowhow with what he learned watching all that \"Dateline,\" and True Crime Case Files was born. This time, though, there was no mention that videos were made up or that they used AI. For months, he cranked out these videos, uploading sometimes two or three a week. He got about 100,000 subscribers, and his videos sometimes got 10 times that number in views. He told me he was making enough to live on.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: Here's the thing that made me keep calling John. He believes what he's doing is better than real true crime because his stories don't use the suffering of real people as content.JOHN: At the end of the day, true crime, no matter how much it's dressed up as, we care about the victims or is this about finding justice, it's a form of entertainment.LARSON: Yeah. But, I mean, if you are so critical of true crime, and if it's causing all these problems in the world, why are you making it?JOHN: I'm creating an alternative to it because in this way, people can have all the luridness they want, but it's not hurting people. So I see of myself sort of like the vegan alternative to true crime.LARSON: Lots of people agree with John about this part - that true crime, popular as it is, has real problems. A 2003 study in the Journal of Communications showed people who watch violent, dramatic television news were more worried about crime. Nationwide, violent crime has been declining for decades, and yet polling consistently shows Americans believe crime is rising. Considering the tip sent to The Denver Post, some locals believed John's video, too. For some of John's critics, that's a problem.CHARLIE SHUNICK: I found myself in this world on May 19, 2012, when my sister, Mickey Shunick, went missing. She was abducted and murdered by a stranger. It was a really high-profile case for the time.LARSON: That's Charlie Shunick. These days, she's a missing persons advocate.

And the fact that they're going to dedicate time and resources to fake cases because the people making these don't have the decency to say that they're not real, it's infuriating.LARSON: When you press John about all this, though, about the kind of impact his videos might have, it falls flat.Do you have misgivings about what you do?JOHN: No, I don't. It's an absurdist art form. If people don't understand it, that says a lot about human nature and their own natures and the nature of true crime. And perhaps they're not willing to question themselves. But I don't have any misgivings about what I'm doing.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: While reporting this story, I went to YouTube for comment about John's videos. A few days later, they told me they had deleted his channel, not because the videos were made by AI or that he lied about them being true, they were deleted for violating policies prohibiting child sexual exploitation. John disputes this. He says all of his characters were over the age of 18. But John's still making content. He uploads the stories as podcasts now, and he has copycats. YouTube channels with names like Hidden Family Crime Stories, True Crime Cases (ph) and Crime Tapes are pumping out more and more AI-generated true crime videos every day.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CHANG: That was reporter Henry Larson.

The authoritative record of NPR’s programming is the audio record. Why'd you stop?JOHN: Well, because I realized it didn't do well. And I labeled it AI parody, and it didn't do well. I think the best one maybe got 20 views.LARSON: The lesson John learned was that people wouldn't watch videos tagged as AI-generated. Then, around Thanksgiving two years ago, John also realized he could combine his AI video knowhow with what he learned watching all that \"Dateline,\" and True Crime Case Files was born. This time, though, there was no mention that videos were made up or that they used AI. For months, he cranked out these videos, uploading sometimes two or three a week. He got about 100,000 subscribers, and his videos sometimes got 10 times that number in views. He told me he was making enough to live on.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: Here's the thing that made me keep calling John. He believes what he's doing is better than real true crime because his stories don't use the suffering of real people as content.JOHN: At the end of the day, true crime, no matter how much it's dressed up as, we care about the victims or is this about finding justice, it's a form of entertainment.LARSON: Yeah. But, I mean, if you are so critical of true crime, and if it's causing all these problems in the world, why are you making it?JOHN: I'm creating an alternative to it because in this way, people can have all the luridness they want, but it's not hurting people. So I see of myself sort of like the vegan alternative to true crime.LARSON: Lots of people agree with John about this part - that true crime, popular as it is, has real problems. A 2003 study in the Journal of Communications showed people who watch violent, dramatic television news were more worried about crime. Nationwide, violent crime has been declining for decades, and yet polling consistently shows Americans believe crime is rising. Considering the tip sent to The Denver Post, some locals believed John's video, too. For some of John's critics, that's a problem.CHARLIE SHUNICK: I found myself in this world on May 19, 2012, when my sister, Mickey Shunick, went missing. She was abducted and murdered by a stranger. It was a really high-profile case for the time.LARSON: That's Charlie Shunick. These days, she's a missing persons advocate. Charlie estimates there have been thousands of videos, documentaries and podcasts all made about her sister's death. She knows from her own experience that real true crime can revictimize survivors. But as long as John keeps pretending his videos are true, she thinks he isn't any better.SHUNICK: The fact that people are calling in about these fake cases is one of the things that just enrages me.

He believes what he's doing is better than real true crime because his stories don't use the suffering of real people as content.JOHN: At the end of the day, true crime, no matter how much it's dressed up as, we care about the victims or is this about finding justice, it's a form of entertainment.LARSON: Yeah. But, I mean, if you are so critical of true crime, and if it's causing all these problems in the world, why are you making it?JOHN: I'm creating an alternative to it because in this way, people can have all the luridness they want, but it's not hurting people. So I see of myself sort of like the vegan alternative to true crime.LARSON: Lots of people agree with John about this part - that true crime, popular as it is, has real problems. A 2003 study in the Journal of Communications showed people who watch violent, dramatic television news were more worried about crime. Nationwide, violent crime has been declining for decades, and yet polling consistently shows Americans believe crime is rising. Considering the tip sent to The Denver Post, some locals believed John's video, too. For some of John's critics, that's a problem.CHARLIE SHUNICK: I found myself in this world on May 19, 2012, when my sister, Mickey Shunick, went missing. She was abducted and murdered by a stranger. It was a really high-profile case for the time.LARSON: That's Charlie Shunick. These days, she's a missing persons advocate. Charlie estimates there have been thousands of videos, documentaries and podcasts all made about her sister's death. She knows from her own experience that real true crime can revictimize survivors. But as long as John keeps pretending his videos are true, she thinks he isn't any better.SHUNICK: The fact that people are calling in about these fake cases is one of the things that just enrages me. It's so hard, especially for cold case or long-term missing person cases, to get any type of attention and support and sometimes to even get law enforcement or media to respond to a call, email, DM. And the fact that they're going to dedicate time and resources to fake cases because the people making these don't have the decency to say that they're not real, it's infuriating.LARSON: When you press John about all this, though, about the kind of impact his videos might have, it falls flat.Do you have misgivings about what you do?JOHN: No, I don't. It's an absurdist art form. If people don't understand it, that says a lot about human nature and their own natures and the nature of true crime. And perhaps they're not willing to question themselves. But I don't have any misgivings about what I'm doing.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: While reporting this story, I went to YouTube for comment about John's videos. A few days later, they told me they had deleted his channel, not because the videos were made by AI or that he lied about them being true, they were deleted for violating policies prohibiting child sexual exploitation. John disputes this. He says all of his characters were over the age of 18. But John's still making content. He uploads the stories as podcasts now, and he has copycats. YouTube channels with names like Hidden Family Crime Stories, True Crime Cases (ph) and Crime Tapes are pumping out more and more AI-generated true crime videos every day.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CHANG: That was reporter Henry Larson.

But as long as John keeps pretending his videos are true, she thinks he isn't any better.SHUNICK: The fact that people are calling in about these fake cases is one of the things that just enrages me. It's so hard, especially for cold case or long-term missing person cases, to get any type of attention and support and sometimes to even get law enforcement or media to respond to a call, email, DM. And the fact that they're going to dedicate time and resources to fake cases because the people making these don't have the decency to say that they're not real, it's infuriating.LARSON: When you press John about all this, though, about the kind of impact his videos might have, it falls flat.Do you have misgivings about what you do?JOHN: No, I don't. It's an absurdist art form. If people don't understand it, that says a lot about human nature and their own natures and the nature of true crime. And perhaps they're not willing to question themselves. But I don't have any misgivings about what I'm doing.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LARSON: While reporting this story, I went to YouTube for comment about John's videos. A few days later, they told me they had deleted his channel, not because the videos were made by AI or that he lied about them being true, they were deleted for violating policies prohibiting child sexual exploitation. John disputes this. He says all of his characters were over the age of 18. But John's still making content. He uploads the stories as podcasts now, and he has copycats.

A 2003 study in the Journal of Communications showed people who watch violent, dramatic television news were more worried about crime. Nationwide, violent crime has been declining for decades, and yet polling consistently shows Americans believe crime is rising. Considering the tip sent to The Denver Post, some locals believed John's video, too. For some of John's critics, that's a problem.CHARLIE SHUNICK: I found myself in this world on May 19, 2012, when my sister, Mickey Shunick, went missing. She was abducted and murdered by a stranger. It was a really high-profile case for the time.LARSON: That's Charlie Shunick. These days, she's a missing persons advocate.

    "title": "Hot off her NCAA title, Paige Bueckers is the 1st pick in the WNBA draft",
    "article_text": "Becky Sullivan APRIL 14: Paige Bueckers reacts to being selected with the first overall pick by the Dallas Wings the 2025 WNBA Draft at The Shed on April 14, 2025 in New York City.Elsa/Getty Imageshide caption Barely a week aftercutting down the netsat the women's Final Four,Paige Bueckershas gotten another jewel in her crown. At Monday night's WNBA Draft, the 23-year-old combo guard was the first overall pick selected by the Dallas Wings. The choice could transform the franchise, which hasn't won a title since 2008 when the team was in Detroit. The Wings only won nine games last year. There, Bueckers joins the league's growing roster of superstars — from newcomers likeCaitlin ClarkandAngel Reeseto veterans likeA'ja Wilsonand Sabrina Ionescu — who delivered amassive boom in audiencefor the league in 2024. The Wings won the top overall pick in November's WNBA Draft Lottery, which was widely viewed as a Paige Bueckers sweepstakes. Days later, Dallas announced it hadsold out of season ticketsfor 2025. \"We know what No. 1 draft picks can do to this league, how they've impacted other franchises,\" said Dallas Wings general manager Curt Miller in January. \"It's a truly, truly exciting time to have the No. 1 pick.\" High expectations are nothing new for Bueckers. She was the top recruit in the country coming out of high school in 2020 — an achievement itself in a class that also included future stars Clark, Reese and Cameron Brink. And the hype was real: In her freshman year at UConn, Bueckers was everything she had been promised to be. She averaged 20 points per game, led the Huskies to the Final Four and became the first freshman to win each of four different major national Player of the Year awards. But then injuries sidelined her for most of the following two years. And her return in the 2023-24 season was overshadowed by the undefeated South Carolina Gamecocks championship run and Clark and the Iowa Hawkeyes, who beat Bueckers' Huskies in the Final Four. Bueckers opted to return for her senior year rather than enter the WNBA Draft in 2024, when she was projected to be a top-three pick (after Clark, taken first overall by the Indiana Fever, and perhaps Brink, the Stanford star forward who was ultimately selected second by the Los Angeles Sparks). And it paid off. Just over a week ago, Bueckers brought home that coveted championship for UConn, the powerhouse's first title in nearly a decade, with a dominant 82-59 win over South Carolina in which Bueckers scored 17 points and added six rebounds. \"It's been a story of resilience, of gratitude, of adversity, of overcoming adversity, just responding to life's challenges,\" Bueckers told reporters after the championship game. \"To be rewarded with something like this, you can't really even put it into words.\" Monday's draft is also poised to reshape the struggling Washington Mystics, who have finished with a losing record in four of the past five seasons. Last year's performance earned the Mystics the No. 4 pick, which they used to select forward Kiki Iriafen of the University of Southern California. Trades netted them the No. 3 and No. 6 picks, where they chose Notre Dame guard Sonia Citron and Kentucky guard Georgia Amoore, respectively. The Seattle Storm finished 25-15 last season yet had the second pick in the draft, thanks to a four-team trade, and drafted French star Dominique Malonga. The league's newest franchise, the Golden State Valkyries, had the No. 5 pick and selected the Lithuanian guard Juste Jocyte. And the Los Angeles Sparks will look to bounce back with their No. 9 pick, Alabama guard Sarah Ashlee Barker, after the team finished last season at a league-worst 8-32 after losing Brink to an ACL tear in June. Sixteen players were invited to Monday's draft, including Bueckers, Iriafen, Citron and Malonga. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Trump administration freezes more than $2.2 billion after Harvard rejects its demands",
    "article_text": "Jonaki Mehta Harvard University has refused to make changes in hiring, admissions and DEI programs.Brian Snyder/Reutershide caption The Trump administration responded quickly to Harvard University's defiance on Monday, freezing more than $2.2 billion in multi-year grants and contracts after the university rejected demands that it change hiring, admissions and other policies. Earlier in the day, Alan Garber, Harvard's president, said in a letter to faculty and students that the university would not submit to a list of demands made last Friday. Among them are that it eliminate DEI programs, screen international students who are \"supportive of terrorism or anti-Semitism\" and ensure \"viewpoint diversity\" in its hiring. At stake, the government said, was some $9 billion in federal funding. \"No government,\" Garber wrote, \"regardless of which party is in power — should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue.\" Hours after Harvard's lawyers sent a formal rejection of the administration's demands, the government's Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism responded: \"Harvard's statement today reinforces the troubling entitlement mindset that is endemic in our nation's most prestigious universities and colleges – that federal investment does not come with the responsibility to uphold civil rights laws.\" The statement announced a freeze on $2.2 billion in multi-year grants and an additional $60 million in multi-year contracts intended for Harvard. \"The disruption of learning that has plagued campuses in recent years is unacceptable,\" the statement continued. \"It is time for elite universities to take the problem seriously and commit to meaningful change if they wish to continue receiving taxpayer support.\" Asked for a response late Monday, a Harvard spokesperson referred back to Garber's letter, which noted that: \"For the government to retreat from these partnerships now risks not only the health and well-being of millions of individuals, but also the economic security and vitality of our nation.\" The Trump administration has been targeting major universities for alleged violations of civil rights laws in an effort to eliminate DEI programs across the country. Following a year of pro-Palestinian protests on Columbia University's campus, the administration cut $400 million in federal money for the institution. It also froze about $1 billion in funding for Cornell University and about $790 million for Northwestern University. University leaderstold NPRit has been a struggle to cope with demands from the federal government while trying to focus on the well-being of their students, and education. In March, the federal government said the multi-agency task force was conducting a \"comprehensive review\" of $9 billion in federal contracts and \"multi-year grant commitments\" to Harvard. \"Harvard's failure to protect students on campus from anti-Semitic discrimination - all while promoting divisive ideologies over free inquiry - has put its reputation in serious jeopardy,\" wrote U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon. \"Harvard can right these wrongs,\" she added, \"and restore itself to a campus dedicated to academic excellence and truth-seeking, where all students feel safe on its campus.\" In the letter rejecting the government's demands, Harvard's lawyers outlined the steps the university has taken in the past 15 months to address antisemitism on its campus, including imposing \"meaningful discipline for those who violate university policies\" and hiring staff to support such programs. Harvard's lawyers wrote that the requested changes were in violation of the university's First Amendment rights and exceeded the legal limits of the government's authority to enforce civil rights laws.

    "title": "Millions watch as underwater camera documents daily life on a Miami coral reef",
    "article_text": "By Greg Allen MIAMI — For five years and counting, acontinuous livestream on YouTubehas shown daily life in a community few people get a chance to visit — a coral reef in Biscayne Bay. TheCoral City Camerashows endangered corals that are thriving and remarkably resilient in the heart of Miami's busy port. The live feed has helped scientists gain a new understanding of the value and beauty of something they call \"urban corals.\" The underwater camera is the brainchild of Colin Foord. He's a marine biologist who, while he was still in high school, became intrigued by corals. They're the tiny marine animals that build large, stony colonies, creating diverse and colorful underwater ecosystems. Five years ago, Foord installed a video camera on corals living in a busy channel in Miami's port. Since then, the live feed of corals and fish has been viewed more than 3.7 million times. He says, \"We've got close to 20 different species of stony corals living in one of the busiest ports in the entire world.\" Colin Foord installed an underwater video camera on a busy channel on Miami's Biscayne Bay.Greg Allen/NPRhide caption Foord spends time each week maintaining the camera, which he accesses from a spit of land in the port. To get there, he drives past cruise terminals and huge gantry cranes unloading container ships. He arrives at a spot, just across the channel from Miami Beach that's remarkably peaceful. Just offshore, in abot nine feet of water is his video camera. Gazing across the bay, he says, \"You can see, the water is really gorgeous. It's turquoise blue. And we're standing on this limestone rip rap.\" Rip rap are large pieces of rock that armor a shoreline, protecting it from erosion, storm surge and sea level rise. \"These boulders go down into the water,\" he says. \"They provide great habitat for fish and for corals to recruit onto the limestone. It's geologically basically the same as coral skeletons so corals are happy to grow on it.\" Huge cruise ships and recreational boaters pass by just 150 feet away. Foord operates the Coral City Camera from a warehouse and lab several miles inland from the port in a warehouse where he has at least 50 saltwater tanks and nearly a thousand species of coral. He hopes to eventually expand his \"coral museum\" and open it to the public. Using a computer, Foord controls the video camera, changing its angles several times a day. He calls the live feed a \"free-range aquarium.\" Foord has nearly a thousand species of coral in at least 50 saltwater tanks in a warehouse he calls his \"coral museum.\"Greg Allen/NPRhide caption Volunteer moderators contribute to the chat on the feed, alerting viewers to sightings of squid and manatees. He says repeat viewers begin to notice some of what he calls \"the regulars.\" \"We have Lisa, the lemon shark who has this Mona Lisa smile,\" he says. \"You begin to recognize that they really do live here. It's their neighborhood.\" Almost 20 years ago, Foord helped startCoral Morphologic, a company that blends his interest in corals with art. He's been involved in a number of projects, including one during Miami's Art Basel fair a few years ago thatprojected images of coralonto the city's performing arts center. He says, \"We approach corals from a slightly different perspective than the academic or scientific community might. Our goal really is to try and reach the public and get them to really fall in love with these organisms that are just so alien, that how can you not be captivated by them?\" The Coral City Camera has begun to show not just the beauty, but also the resilience of these \"urban corals,\" corals that persist and sometimes thrive in port cities like Miami, Singapore and Sydney. Foord says that was demonstrated dramatically two years ago when record-high ocean temperatures causedcorals around the world to bleachand, in many cases, die. \"2023 was an absolutely dreadful year,\" he says. \"We watched corals all up and down the Florida reef tract bleaching and dying. And yet for the most part, the corals living at the port of Miami around the Coral City camera didn't even bleach.\" Using daily screenshots from his video feed, Foord compiled what he believes is the world's longest-runningunderwater time lapse video feeddocumenting the bleaching event. It shows the death of some corals over several months and the resiliency and regrowth of others. In part because of Foord's work, NOAA research ecologist Ian Enochs is studying Miami's urban corals and haspublished some surprising findings. He says, \"They may be genetically stronger, more capable of dealing with environmental conditions that are otherwise killing corals.\" Climate change, ocean acidification and pollution are degrading coral reefs worldwide. In Florida, NOAA and a host of research groups are working to restore the ailing reefs. Enochs says these urban corals may play a key role in that effort. He says, \"If we can find individuals that are able to deal with these environmental stressors, if we can grow them, if we can outplant them, then we can build reefs that are more resilient.\" To help make that happen, Coral Morphologic is building a lab to breed and cultivate urban coral species. It's a high-tech endeavor, with continuously controlled water quality and specially designed LED lights. Foord says, \"We can simulate the solar and lunar cycles to induce these urban corals to spawn.\" The plan, he says, is \"They can pass on their resilient genes to produce hardy babies that we're then going to bring out to the reef line to plant to other places in Miami.\" At Coral Morphologic, Foord is building a lab to breed and cultivate resilient coral that can be planted on reefs in Miami.Greg Allen/NPRhide caption It's one of a number of projects Foord has in the works. This summer working with other artists and scientists, he'll begin planting corals on an artificial reef that's planned to be seven miles long and within swimming distance of Miami Beach.

    "article_text": "Sergio Martínez-Beltrán One day before her court hearing, Yasmelin Valazquez is hospitalized at John F. Kennedy Memorial Hospital in Indio, Calif., on April 9, 2025.Zaydee Sanchez for NPRhide caption INDIO, Calif. — When the nurse told Yasmelin Velazquez she was going to be hospitalized for a couple of days, Velazquez's anxiety spiked. \"I can't stay!\" she exclaimed. \"I have immigration court tomorrow!\" The hospitalization comes at a bad time. Missing her first court hearing the next day would almost guarantee a deportation order for the 36-year-old Venezuelan immigrant and her two young sons. She's especially on edge since receivingan emailfrom the U.S. Department of Homeland Security two days earlier notifying her that her temporary status in the country was terminated. \"It is time for you to leave the United States,\" the email read. \"Do not attempt to remain in the United States — the federal government will find you.\" Velazquez is among the growing number of migrants who received the DHS email. All of them came to the U.S. through legal pathways now terminated by President Trump, or were given temporary protection from deportation after surrendering to immigration authorities at the U.S.-Mexico border. They are now left in limbo: Should they stay and continue the legal process? Could they be detained or deported while waiting for their day in court? NPR has followed Velazquez's immigration journey from Ciudad Juárez, México, where she waited 8 months to enter the U.S. via the CBP One app, a Biden-era legal pathway for asylum seekers. She became one of 900,000 people who used the app, which was the only way to schedule an immigration hearing in the U.S. at the time. But as her court date approached, Velazquez told NPR she was getting nervous. Migrants have been picked up by immigration authorities at court lately, and that could happen to her, too. Then, her doctor called during Velazquez's shift at Walmart. The doctor explained that she had some bad test results and might need to stay in the emergency room for a couple of days. After pushing back, Velazquez was cleared to leave the hospital. She will make it to court the next day – but the doctor warns her condition could worsen. Outside John F. Kennedy Memorial Hospital in Indio, Calif., Yasmelin Valazquez waits for her partner to bring the car around on April 9, 2025.Zaydee Sanchez for NPRhide caption After being away overnight, Yasmelin Valazquez is greeted with joy as her two sons jump on her in a reunion on April 9, 2025.Zaydee Sanchez for NPRhide caption The sun had not risen when Velazquez, her partner, and her two little boys, 2-year-old Jeremías and 4-year-old Jordan, left their home in Indio, California, the next day. \"Father God, be our lawyer, be our judge,\" they prayed. \"Touch the heart of Judge Simmons.\" They are anxious — so they sing while they drive their used black SUV down the highway. After more than two hours on the road, the family pulls up at the immigration court in an industrial park in a Southern California suburb. A dozen or so other families make their way into the courtroom. Yasmelin Valazquez wakes up her two sons at 3:30 in the morning to have breakfast before they leave for immigration court. April 10, 2025.Zaydee Sanchez for NPRhide caption Yasmelin Valazquez's sons sit quietly as the family drives two hours to immigration court on April 10, 2025.Zaydee Sanchez for NPRhide caption First hearings like this one are usually low-stakes. A judge validates the migrants' identities, and they decide whether to file for a form of relief, such as asylum. Then a second hearing is scheduled. But under Trump, anything can happen. Inside the courtroom, Velazquez and the kids sit in the first row of wooden benches. They wait an hour for their turn– long enough that the two-year-old pees his pants. Finally, the judge asks Velazquez whether she understands the reason she's in court: that the government believes she doesn't have a legal right to be in the U.S. \"Yes,\" she replies quietly, adding that she's planning to claim asylum later this summer. The judge tells her to come back in August, this time with an attorney. The whole interaction only took a few minutes. Velazquez is free to go. With a little nervousness, Yasmelin Valazquez and her family arrive for thier immigration court hearing in Santa Ana, California on April 10, 2025.Zaydee Sanchez for NPRhide caption After immigration court, Yasmelin Valazquez secures her paperwork inside her folder where she keeps track of her documents. April 10, 2025. Zaydee Sanchez/NPRZaydee Sanchez for NPRhide caption \"I feel victorious,\" she tells NPR after the hearing, her relieved laughter ringing over the parking lot while her kids snack on juice and arepas. But their day isn't over yet. Next is another hour-long drive to Velazquez's regular in-person check-in with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which she has to do every few months in addition to weekly calls and texts with the agent in charge of her parole. This week, the check-in seems scarier. There have been reports of migrants being picked up by agents as they go into the ICE office. And now, there's that email from DHS to worry about. Velazquez enters the office and meets with the agent assigned to her case. Eight minutes later, she comes out again, beaming a huge smile. \"Today, my future looks marvelous,\" she says. She was not detained today, but her optimism might be premature. After a long day, Yasmelin Valazquez and her family share a moment of joy at a parking lot in San Bernadino, California on April 10, 2025. Zaydee Sanchez/NPRZaydee Sanchez for NPRhide caption She has a long way to go in her quest for legal status, and the Trump administration is unpredictable and willing to push legal limits to fulfill its goal of deporting millions of people. But Velazquez knows that when you are living day-to-day in the U.S., you take a win when you can. \"I feel like I'll be able to obtain permanent residency, and who knows, maybe citizenship, too!\" she says, laughing and smiling.",

    "title": "CT scans could cause 5% of cancers, study finds; experts note uncertainty",
    "article_text": "The estimates are small and uncertain, but balancing risks and benefits is critical. Computed tomography scans have become vital, even lifesaving, medical imaging for diagnosing and monitoring health conditions. But they do expose patients to ionizing radiation at levels linked to higher risks of cancer. Ina new study in JAMA Internal Medicine, researchers tried to estimate what those higher risks are exactly—and although the estimates come with uncertainty, they may seem startling. Based on data from 93 million CT scans performed on 62 million people in 2023, the researchers estimated that the CT scans would lead to 103,000 future cancers. To put that in context, those 103,000 cancers would account for about 5 percent of cancers diagnosed each year, based on the current cancer rates and the current usage of CT scans. And the estimate puts CT scans on par with alcohol consumption and obesity in terms of risk factors for developing cancer. The most common types of cancers estimated to be a result of CT scans were lung cancer and colon cancer—two cancers that are becoming more common in younger people for reasons experts do not fully understand. The types of CT scans linked to the greatest number of cancers were abdomen and pelvis CT scans. The study's authors—led by epidemiology and biostatistics researchers at the University of California, San Francisco—concluded that doctors should use CT scans when they can be justified and at optimized doses to balance the risks and benefits. \"CT is frequently lifesaving, yet its potential harms are often overlooked, and even very small cancer risks will lead to a significant number of future cancers given the tremendous volume of CT use in the United States,\" they write. Since 2007, use of CT scans has increased 35 percent, an increase not entirely explained by population growth, they note. Outside experts agreed that CT scans should be used judiciously. But, they highlighted that there is much uncertainty in the modeling, which tried to assess absorbed doses in different organs and the increased risk of site-specific cancer. While some large studies have found links between CT scans in children and young adults and increased risks ofbloodandbrain cancers,  the risks for adults have largely been extrapolated from studies on Japanese atomic bomb survivors or people with occupational radiation exposures. \"The estimates, while based on the best models available to the authors, are indirect, so there is considerable uncertainty about the estimates,\" Stephen Duffy, emeritus professor of Cancer Screening at Queen Mary University of London, said in a statement. \"Thus, I would say to patients that if you are recommended to have a CT scan, it would be wise to do so.\" Duffy also highlighted that in the context of a person's overall risk of cancer, CT scans don't move the needle much. There were a little over 100,000 cancers linked to 93 million scans. \"This amounts to around a 0.1 percent increase in cancer risk over the patient's lifetime per CT examination,\" he said. The lifetime risk of cancer in the US population isaround 40 percent. Thus, the additional risk from CT scans \"is small.\" Overall, when a CT scan is deemed necessary, the \"likely benefit in diagnosis and subsequent treatment of disease outweighs the very small increase in cancer risk.\" Doreen Lau, a cancer biology expert at Brunel University of London, agreed: \"The findings don’t mean that people should avoid CT scans when recommended by a doctor. In most cases, the benefit of detecting or ruling out serious illness far outweighs the very small risk of harm.\" Still, the rise in CT scans in recent years may suggest that doctors could cut back on their use. Inan accompanying editorial, Ilana Richman of Yale University and Mitchell Katz of NYC Health and Hospitals discussed ways that doctors could make sure they're balancing risks and benefits before using CT scans, including using diagnostic algorithms and offering alternative imaging options, such as ultrasounds and magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs). \"As with all complex problems, there will be no simple solution,\" they write. But, \"educating clinicians about avoiding low-value testing and, in circumstances where alternatives are readily available, involving patients in the decision to do a CT scan may help shift culture and practice.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "After Harvard says no to feds, $2.2 billion of research funding put on hold",
    "article_text": "The university also turned its homepage into a tribute to research. The Trump administration has beenusing federal research funding as a cudgel. The government has blocked billions of dollars in research funds and threatened to put a hold on even more in order to compel universities to adopt what it presents as essential reforms. In the case of Columbia University, that includes changes in the leadership of individual academic departments. On Friday, the government sent a list of demands that it presented as necessary to \"maintain Harvard’s financial relationship with the federal government.\" On Monday, Harvard responded that accepting these demands would \"allow itself to be taken over by the federal government.\" The university also changed its home page into an extensive tribute to the research that would be eliminated if the funds were withheld. In response, the Trump administration laterput $2.2 billion of Harvard's research funding on hold. Harvard postedthe letter it receivedfrom federal officials, listing their demands. Some of it is what you expect, given the Trump administration's interests. The admissions and hiring departments would be required to drop all diversity efforts, with data on faculty and students to be handed over to the federal government for auditing. As at other institutions, there are also some demands presented as efforts against antisemitism, such as the defunding of pro-Palestinian groups. More generally, it demands that university officials \"prevent admitting students hostile to the American values and institutions.\" There are also a bunch of basic culture war items, such as a demand for a mask ban, and a ban on \"de-platforming\" speakers on campus. In addition, the government wants the university to screen all faculty hires for plagiarism issues, which is what causedHarvard's former president to resignafter she gave testimony to Congress. Any violation of these updated conduct codes by a non-citizen would require an immediate report to the Department of Homeland Security and State Department, presumably so they can prepare to deport them. However, the most striking aspect of the letter is the complete shift in tone about diversity. After having presented Harvard's existing diversity efforts as the antithesis of a merit-based approach, it suddenly demands that the university enforce what it terms viewpoint diversity. It never defines what this term means—perhaps alchemy in the chemistry department? But the implications are that it amounts to affirmative action for conservatives. Harvard is directed to \"audit the student body, faculty, staff, and leadership for viewpoint diversity, such that each department, field, or teaching unit must be individually viewpoint diverse.\" Any department that fails the audit would be required to start hiring new faculty until it can pass the undefined standards demanded by the feds. Again, all this is being presented as necessary for Harvard to continue receiving research funds. The university has decided these demands force it to fight, and it's attacking on two fronts. The first is public-facing; Harvard has turned itshomepageinto a tribute to its researchers and the work they pursue. Although it starts with a huge banner article as shown here, links to 30 individual articles on research fill the entire page. I have a fairly high-resolution screen, and it took hitting page down nine times to finally reach the bottom, where a handful of links to the rest of the university finally appear. The message is clear: The research that's under threat matters, and humanity will be worse off if its funding is cut. Separately, Harvard'slegal response, which it made public today, is basically: nope. After detailing the steps the university has already taken to address antisemitism, it gets to the crux of the issue: \"your letter disregards Harvard’s efforts and instead presents demands that, in contravention of the First Amendment, invade university freedoms long recognized by the Supreme Court.\" The harms these demands are meant to address, the letter alleges, haven't actually been demonstrated through processes that are required by law. It continues by essentially calling the government's demands the equivalent of a hostile takeover: The university will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights. Neither Harvard nor any other private university can allow itself to be taken over by the federal government. Accordingly, Harvard will not accept the government’s terms as an agreement in principle. Let's be clear: There is a good chance that Harvard is risking a catastrophic loss of funding, resulting in entire research programs being shut down, layoffs, and grad students with no way to pursue their thesis projects. It could well be a crisis that requires generations of new faculty hires to recover from. At the same time, the university also saw one of its peers, Columbia University, accede to a somewhat more limited set of demands, and have its funding put on hold anyway. Given that, the decision to prepare to gain public support and fight it out in court doesn't seem unreasonable. This story has been updated to reflect the actions of the federal government.

    "article_text": "Should we all just readA City on Marsand call the whole thing off? Mars is back on the agenda. During his address to a joint session of Congress in March, President Donald Trump said the United States \"will pursue our Manifest Destiny into the stars, launching American astronauts to plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars.\" What does this mean? Manifest destiny is the belief, which was particularly widespread in 1800s America, that US settlers were destined to expand westward across North America. Similarly, then, the Trump administration believes it is the manifest destiny of Americans to settle Mars. And he wants his administration to take steps toward accomplishing that goal. But should we really do this? I recently participated in a debate with Shannon Stirone, a distinguished science writer, on this topic. The debate was sponsored byOpen to Debate, and professionally moderated by Emmy award-winning journalist John Donvan. Spoiler alert: I argued in favor of settlement.

    "title": "OpenAI continues naming chaos despite CEO acknowledging the habit",
    "article_text": "OpenAI's brand new \"GPT-4.1\" has a funky name but reasonable performance for the price. On Monday, OpenAIannouncedthe GPT-4.1 model family, its newest series of AI language models that brings a 1 million token context window to OpenAI for the first time and continues a long tradition of very confusing AI model names. Three confusing new names, in fact: GPT‑4.1, GPT‑4.1 mini, and GPT‑4.1 nano. According to OpenAI, these models outperformGPT-4oin several key areas. But in an unusual move, GPT-4.1 will only be available through the developer API, not in the consumerChatGPTinterface where most people interact with OpenAI's technology. The 1 million token context window—essentially the amount of text the AI can process at once—allows these models to ingest roughly 3,000 pages of text in a single conversation. This puts OpenAI's context windows on par withGoogle's Gemini models, which have offered similar extended context capabilities for some time. At the same time, the company announced it will retire the GPT-4.5 Preview model in the API—a temporary offering launched in February that one criticcalled a \"lemon\"—giving developers until July 2025 to switch to something else. However, it appears GPT-4.5 will stick around in ChatGPT for now. If this sounds confusing, well, that's because it is. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman acknowledged OpenAI's habit of terrible product names in February whendiscussing the roadmaptoward the long-anticipated (and still theoretical) GPT-5. \"We realize how complicated our model and product offerings have gotten,\" Altmanwroteon X at the time, referencing a ChatGPT interface already crowded with choices like GPT-4o, various specialized GPT-4o versions, GPT-4o mini, the simulated reasoning o1-pro, o3-mini, and o3-mini-high models, and GPT-4. The stated goal for GPT-5 will be consolidation, a branding move to unify o-series models and GPT-series models. So, how does launching another distinctly numbered model, GPT-4.1, fit into that grand unification plan? It's hard to say. Altman foreshadowed this kind of ambiguity in March 2024, telling Lex Friedman the company had major releases coming but was unsure about names: \"before we talk about a GPT-5-like model called that, or not called that, or a little bit worse or a little bit better than what you’d expect...\" GPT-4.1 feels exactly like that \"called that, or not called that\" model—a significant iteration, but apparently not the generational leap worthy of the GPT-5 moniker, further fragmenting the lineup before the promised consolidation. Also, it's worth noting that Altmansaidin February that GPT-4.5 would be the company's \"last non-chain-of-thought model.\" But apparently, plans have changed. In some key ways, 4.1 is greater than 4.5. It makes us wonder if OpenAI has been using LLMs to name its products, owing to the famous example last year where ChatGPTcommonlyreportedthat the numerical value \"9.11\" was greater than \"9.9\". Jokes aside, the confusing naming strategy is matched by equally puzzling performance claims. OpenAI positions GPT-4.1 as a clear advancement over GPT-4o, particularly in coding and following complex instructions (you can see the full benchmarks onOpenAI's site). The new model family also brings that massive 1 million token context window—about four times larger than GPT-4o's capability. Notably, unlike the multimodal GPT-4o (where \"o\" stood for \"omni\"), the announcement for the GPT-4.1 family makes no mention of audio input or output capabilities, suggesting a focus on text and image inputs with text output, as AI expert Simon Willisonnotedin his blog. Compared to the soon-to-be-retired GPT-4.5 Preview, the picture becomes far more complicated. While GPT-4.1 scores significantly better on theSWE-bench Verifiedcoding benchmark (54.6 percent versus 38.0 percent for GPT-4.5) and generates code diffs more reliably, OpenAI's benchmark data reveals GPT-4.5 still performed better on academic knowledge tests, instruction following, and several vision-related tasks. (SWE-bench Verified is an industry benchmark that aims to evaluate how well AI models can understand and modify real-world software repositories to fix bugs or implement new features—essentially measuring how useful the AI would be to actual software engineers in production environments.) This raises the question: Why retire a seemingly more capable model in the API? OpenAI explains that GPT-4.1 delivers \"improved or similar performance on many key capabilities at much lower cost and latency.\" In other words, GPT-4.1 hits a practical sweet spot—good enough performance for most API use cases, but delivered faster and cheaper than the more resource-intensive GPT-4.5 Preview. GPT-4.5 is very slow and very expensive. The new models come with lower prices compared to their predecessors. GPT-4.1 costs $2 per million tokens for input and $8 per million tokens for output, representing a 26 percent cost reduction for median queries compared to GPT-4o. GPT-4.1 mini is priced at $0.40 for input and $1.60 for output per million tokens, while GPT-4.1 nano costs just $0.10 for input and $0.40 for output per million tokens. In comparison, GPT-4.5's pricing was off the charts--costing $75 per million input tokens and $150 per million output tokens through the API. So 4.1 is an upgrade over 4o that almost matches 4.5 but costs far, far less to run. Got that? So another question remains: Why create a model that outperforms GPT-4o in important ways but not offer it to ChatGPT users? According to OpenAI, many improvements from these research models \"have been gradually incorporated into the latest version of GPT-4o\" in ChatGPT, with more features planned for future updates. Essentially, ChatGPT's GPT-4o has become a constantly evolving \"brand\" model that absorbs capabilities from the company's various research models over time. This creates a two-track system: developers using the API get specific, consistent models with clearly defined capabilities, while regular ChatGPT users receive a single model that changes behind the scenes. Developers can select precisely which model fits their needs and cost requirements, choosing between 4.1, 4.1 mini, 4.1 nano, 4o, and other variants. Meanwhile, consumers get whatever version of GPT-4o OpenAI decides to push out. But it won't make the naming simpler. As one Hacker News commenter astutely observed, \"I need an AI to understand the naming conventions that OpenAI is using.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Lunar Gateway’s skeleton is complete—its next stop may be Trump’s chopping block",
    "article_text": "The NASA official in charge of Gateway briefed Ars on the program's challenges and achievements. In one way or another, the Lunar Gateway has lingered around the periphery of NASA's human exploration program since the Obama administration. Back then, the elements that eventually coalesced into the Gateway were geared toward a nebulous initiative to capture a small asteroid and reposition it closer to Earth. Under direction from the first Trump administration, NASA ditched the asteroid idea and repackaged the concept to become a mini-space station in orbit around the Moon. NASA officials justified the Lunar Gateway program by highlighting its utility as a staging point or safe haven for astronauts traveling to and from the surface of the Moon. Crews could launch from Earth and travel to the Moon's vicinity inside NASA's Orion spacecraft, connect with the Gateway, and then float into their lunar lander already docked with the outpost. When plans for the Gateway came together nearly a decade ago, officials hailed the lunar station as a way to help lunar landers reach the Moon's south pole, where scientists believe large quantities of water ice reside in the bottoms of dark craters. At the time, NASA said the Gateway would also offer additional living space for astronauts beyond the relatively cramped quarters of the Orion crew capsule or small lunar landers. NASA cited other reasons for the Lunar Gateway program. It would help NASA gain experience sustaining human crews 1,000 times farther from Earth than the International Space Station. Gateway's design is about one-sixth the mass of ISS, with provisions to support astronauts for missions lasting up to 90 days when complete. The core of Lunar Gateway, called the Power and Propulsion Element (PPE), will have 12-kilowatt Hall thrusters, the highest-power electric propulsion system ever sent into space. On future missions, these fuel-efficient engines could push heavy cargo into deep space and help enable human expeditions to Mars. Now, the justification for Lunar Gateway is less technical and more political. Many of the objectives listed above no longer make sense, or they could be met through other means. NASA will now use a much more voluminous lunar landing craft with its own muscular propulsion system—SpaceX's Starship—than engineers envisioned when work started on Gateway. Starship and NASA's second lunar lander, to be built by Blue Origin, doesn't need to dock with an outpost like Gateway to reach the surface of the Moon. In fact, docking Starship to the Gatewaypresents its own set of challenges. The Gateway's maneuvering thrusters weren't designed to keep the station stable with a massive spacecraft like Starship attached to it. You might say the Gateway is not only unnecessary, but an impediment to NASA's goals. If NASA wants a permanent outpost at the Moon, why not put it on the lunar surface? These arequestions some space community stakeholders have askedsince before the Gateway was even a line item in NASA's budget. If you ask NASA officials and other Gateway supporters today why it's important, you'll probably get an answer underscoring the program's international flavor. NASA is in charge of the Gateway's first two components, the PPE module and the Habitation and Logistics Outpost (HALO), which will provide spartan accommodations to sustain the station's initial crews for up to 40 days. But it's true that most of the pieces required to complete Gateway's assembly will come from international partners. Europe and Japan will provide a larger habitation module to accommodate astronauts for up to 90 days, the United Arab Emirates has agreed to build an airlock to add spacewalking capability to the Gateway, and Canada is developing a robotic arm. The European Space Agency (ESA) is also responsible for the Gateway's refueling and communications systems. All told, international partners will pay about 60 percent of the cost of developing and building the Gateway, according to Amit Kshatriya, deputy associate administrator for NASA's Moon to Mars program. That sounds like a pretty good deal for NASA, but it still leaves the US space agency with a hefty bill. NASA has spent more than $3.5 billion on the Gateway program since its official start in 2019, and the agency is responsible for operating and resupplying the station once it is in space. At a recent event hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Kshatriya said NASA's international partnerships have been \"one of the great results\" of the International Space Station program. The Lunar Gateway, he said, is important for \"cultivating that and making sure it endures.\" There are other ways international partners can contribute to NASA's human exploration program. For example, Europe already builds service modules for the Orion spacecraft designed to ferry astronauts to and from Earth. Japan has agreed to develop a pressurized rover for astronauts to drive on the Moon. The focus of NASA's Artemis program is currently on the Moon—as it has been since the first Trump administration—with an eye toward building experience for future human voyages to the red planet. The balance between the Moon and Mars could shift in the second Trump administration, thickening the cloud of uncertainty about the Gateway's value to NASA. For now, the Gateway's first two modules are scheduled for launch at the end of 2027. That's five years later than the schedule NASA released six years ago. NASA currently projects it will cost the US government about $5.3 billion to build, launch, and activate the PPE and HALO in space. The two modules will launch together on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket. Officials blame changing requirements for much of the delays and rising costs. NASA managers dramatically changed their plans for the Gateway program in 2020, when they decided to launch the PPE and HALO on the same rocket, prompting major changes to their designs. Jared Isaacman, Trump's nominee for NASA administrator, declined to commit to the Gateway program during a confirmation hearing before the Senate Commerce Committee on April 9. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), the committee's chairman, pressed Isaacman on the Lunar Gateway. Cruz is one of the Gateway program's biggest backers in Congress since it is managed by Johnson Space Center in Texas. If it goes ahead, Gateway would guarantee numerous jobs at NASA's mission control in Houston throughout its 15-year lifetime. \"That’s an area that if I’m confirmed, I would love to roll up my sleeves and further understand what’s working right?\" Isaacman replied to Cruz. \"What are the opportunities the Gateway presents to us? And where are some of the challenges, because I think the Gateway is a component of many programs that are over budget and behind schedule.\" Nevertheless, the Gateway program achieved a milestone one week before Isaacman's confirmation hearing. The metallic pressure shell for the HALO module was shipped from its factory in Italy to Arizona. The HALO module is only partially complete, and it lacks life support systems and other hardware it needs to operate in space. Over the next couple of years, Northrop Grumman will outfit the habitat with those components and connect it with the Power and Propulsion Element under construction at Maxar Technologies in Silicon Valley. This stage of spacecraft assembly, along with prelaunch testing, often uncovers problems that can drive up costs and trigger more delays. Ars recently spoke with Jon Olansen, a bio-mechanical engineer and veteran space shuttle flight controller who now manages the Gateway program at Johnson Space Center. A transcript of our conversation with Olansen is below. It is lightly edited for clarity and brevity. Ars:The HALO module has arrived in Arizona from Italy. What's next? Olansen:This HALO module went through significant effort from the primary and secondary structure perspective out at Thales Alenia Space in Italy. That was most of their focus in getting the vehicle ready to ship to Arizona. Now that it's in Arizona, Northrop is setting it up in their facility there in Gilbert to be able to do all of the outfitting of the systems we need to actually execute the missions we want to do, keep the crew safe, and enable the science that we're looking to do. So, if you consider your standard spacecraft, you're going to have all of your command-and-control capabilities, your avionics systems, your computers, your network management, all of the things you need to control the vehicle. You're going to have your power distribution capabilities. HALO attaches to the Power and Propulsion Element, and it provides the primary power distribution capability for the entire station. So that'll all be part of HALO. You'll have your standard thermal systems for active cooling. You’ll have the vehicle environmental control systems that will need to be installed, [along with] some of the other crew systems that you can think of, from lighting, restraint, mobility aids, all the different types of crew systems. Then, of course, all of our science aspects. So we have payload lockers, both internally, as well as payload sites external that we'll have available, so pretty much all the different systems that you would need for a human-rated spacecraft. Ars:What's the latest status of the Power and Propulsion Element? Olansen:PPE is fairly well along in their assembly and integration activities. The central cylinder has been integrated with the propulsion tanks... Their propulsion module is in good shape. They're working on the avionics shelves associated with that spacecraft. So, with both vehicles, we're really trying to get the assembly done in the next year or so, so we can get into integrated spacecraft testing at that point in time. Ars:What’s in the critical path in getting to the launch pad? Olansen:The assembly and integration activity is really the key for us. It’s to get to the full vehicle level test. All the different activities that we're working on across the vehicles are making substantive progress. So, it's a matter of bringing them all in and doing the assembly and integration in the appropriate sequences, so that we get the vehicles put together the way we need them and get to the point where we can actually power up the vehicles and do all the testing we need to do. Obviously, software is a key part of that development activity, once we power on the vehicles, making sure we can do all the control work that we need to do for those vehicles. [There are] a couple of key pieces I will mention along those lines. On the PPE side, we have the electrical propulsion system. The thrusters associated with that system are being delivered. Those will go through acceptance testing at the Glenn Research Center [in Ohio] and then be integrated on the spacecraft out at Maxar; so that work is ongoing as we speak. Out at ESA, ESA is providing the HALO lunar communication system. That'll be delivered later this year. That'll be installed on HALO as part of its integrated test and checkout and then launch on HALO. That provides the full communication capability down to the lunar surface for us, where PPE provides the communication capability back to Earth. So, those are key components that we're looking to get delivered later this year. Ars:What's the status of the electric propulsion thrusters for the PPE? Olansen:The first one has actually been delivered already, so we'll have the opportunity to go through, like I said, the acceptance testing for those. The other flight units are right on the heels of the first one that was delivered. They'll make it through their acceptance testing, then get delivered to Maxar, like I said, for integration into PPE. So, that work is already in progress. [The Power and Propulsion Element will have three xenon-fueled 12-kilowatt Hall thrusters produced by Aerojet Rocketdyne, and four smaller 6-kilowatt thrusters.] Ars:The Government Accountability Office (GAO) outlined concerns last year about keeping the mass of Gateway within the capability of its rocket. Has there been any progress on that issue? Will you need to remove components from the HALO module and launch them on a future mission? Will you narrow your launch windows to only launch on the most fuel-efficient trajectories? Olansen:We’re working the plan. Now that we're launching the two vehicles together, we're working mass management. Mass management is always an issue with spacecraft development, so it's no different for us. All of the things you described are all knobs that are in the trade space as we proceed, but fundamentally, we're working to design the optimal spacecraft that we can, first. So, that's the key part. As we get all the components delivered, we can measure mass across all of those components, understand what our integrated mass looks like, and we have several different options to make sure that we're able to execute the mission we need to execute. All of those will be balanced over time based on the impacts that are there. There's not a need for a lot of those decisions to happen today. Those that are needed from a design perspective, we've already made. Those that are needed from enabling future decisions, we’ve already made all of those. So, really, what we're working through is being able to, at the appropriate time, make decisions necessary to fly the vehicle the way we need to, to get out to NRHO [Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit, an elliptical orbit around the Moon], and then be able to execute the Artemis missions in the future. Ars:The GAO also discussed a problem with Gateway's controllability with something as massive as Starship docked to it. What's the latest status of that problem? Olansen:There are a number of different risks that we work through as a program, as you'd expect. We continue to look at all possibilities and work through them with due diligence. That's our job, to be able to do that on a daily basis. With the stack controllability [issue], where that came from for GAO, we were early in the assessments of what the potential impacts could be from visiting vehicles, not just any one [vehicle] but any visiting vehicle. We're a smaller space station than ISS, so making sure we understand the implications of thruster firings as vehicles approach the station, and the implications associated with those, is where that stack controllability conversation came from. The bus that Maxar typically designs doesn't have to generally deal with docking. Part of what we've been doing is working through ways that we can use the capabilities that are already built into that spacecraft differently to provide us the control authority we need when we have visiting vehicles, as well as working with the visiting vehicles and their design to make sure that they're minimizing the impact on the station. So, the combination of those two has largely, over the past year since that report came out, improved where we are from a stack controllability perspective. We still have forward work to close out all of the different potential cases that are there. We'll continue to work through those. That's standard forward work, but we've been able to make some updates, some software updates, some management updates, and logic updates that really allow us to control the stack effectively and have the right amount of control authority for the dockings and undockings that we will need to execute for the missions.

    "title": "Razer built a game-streaming app on top of Moonlight, and it’s not too bad",
    "article_text": "Razer took an open source app and made it simpler. A lead dev is all for it. Razer, maker of green-hued gaming hardware and accessories, has entered the game-streaming space with its new—but not entirely new—app,PC Remote Play. It's based on very good existing streaming tech and makes connecting a PC to mobile devices fairly simple. It's worth checking out unless you have a hard-and-fast policy about avoiding software \"utilities\" from RGB-obsessed gaming companies. That, or you're already using and comfortable withMoonlight. Moonlight andSunshineare the open source game-streaming client and server thatwonderfully picked up where Nvidia's Gamestream left off. PC Remote Play is based on Moonstream's open source code, and Razer hasmade much of its own version's code available. You're getting a few small upgrades when using PC Remote Play: I tested out PC Remote Play on my home network, streamingAvowed,Satisfactory, andtheMonster Train 2demofrom my Windows PC to an iPad Air (5th generation/M1). To get there, I had to pair a Bluetooth controller (Xbox One wireless) to my iPad and install Razer Remote Play on it, andRazer Cortexon the PC. Razer would also like you to install other Razer apps on each device, like theNexus game launcheron mobile, and something like two to three other tools on PC. With attention and small effort, you can skip past those things, make the two apps see each other, and start playing. I intentionally touched as few settings as I could on each device (minus a curious poke or two at the \"Optimize\" option), and the experience was fairly streamlined. I didn't have to set resolutions or guess at a data-streaming rate; Razer defaults to 30Mbps, which generally provides rock-solid 1080p and pretty smooth 1440p-ish resolutions. My main complaints were the missing tricks I had picked up in Moonlight, like holding the start/menu button to activate a temporary mouse cursor or hitting a button combination to exit out of games. Razer's app is not limited to Steam games like Steam Link or Xbox/Game Pass titles like Remote Play and can work with pretty much any game you have installed. It is, however, limited to Windows and the major mobile platforms, leaving out Macs, Apple TVs, Linux, Steam Deck and other handhelds, Raspberry Pi setups, and so on. Still, for what it does, it works pretty well, and its interface, while Razer-green and a bit showy, was easier to navigate than Moonlight. I did not, for example, have to look up the launching executables and runtime options for certain games to make them launch directly from my mobile device. Streaming-wise, I noticed no particular differences from the Moonlight experience, which one might expect, given the shared codebase. The default choice of streaming at my iPad's native screen resolution and refresh rate saved me the headaches of figuring out the right balance of black box cut-offs and resolution that I would typically go through with Steam Link or sometimes Moonlight. How would the folks at Moonlight feel about Razer getting their glowing-green hands on their hard-won streaming tech? Great, it turns out. Cameron Gutman, one of the founders and lead developers on Moonlight, told me by email that he was \"very supportive of individuals and companies building on top of our software, provided that they respect the terms of the GPL (GNU General Public License 3.0).\" Gutman noted that a number of forks of Moonlight already exist, coveringseamless virtual display integration,multi-session support, andsupport for non-US devices. And what Razer looks to be delivering here is a more user-friendly UI, Gutman wrote (he had not personally tested the software as of last week). That's something from which Moonlight, and other open source projects, can often benefit. \"As with many open-source developers and projects, we can tend to write software that caters to more technical users (sometimes unintentionally), which leaves a gap for someone like Razer to come along with a team of UX designers and Product Managers to take things back to basics and tackle some of thepapercutsthat impact the experience of ordinary folks,\" Gutman wrote. I'm still using Moonlight and Sunshine because I'm comfortable messing with the nitty-gritty settings and also capable of setting up my own solution for remote access. But as a tool that covers the biggest PC gaming platform and portable devices, PC Remote Play is not a bad tool to keep in mind for gaming away from a PC desk.

    "title": "Scientists made a stretchable lithium battery you can bend, cut, or stab",
    "article_text": "Its performance isn't great, but its endurance is similar to standard lithium-ion. The Li-ion batteries that power everything from smartphones to electric cars are usually packed in rigid, sealed enclosures that prevent stresses from damaging their components and keep air from coming into contact with their flammable and toxic electrolytes. It’s hard to use batteries like this in soft robots or wearables, so a team of scientists at the University California, Berkeley built a flexible, non-toxic, jelly-like battery that could survive bending, twisting, and even cutting with a razor. While flexible batteries using hydrogel electrolytes have been achieved before, they came with significant drawbacks. “All such batteries could [only] operate [for] a short time, sometimes a few hours, sometimes a few days,” says Liwei Lin, a mechanical engineering professor at UC Berkeley and senior author of the study. The battery built by his team endured 500 complete charge cycles—about as many as the batteries in most smartphones are designed for. “Current-day batteries require a rigid package because the electrolyte they use is explosive, and one of the things we wanted to make was a battery that would be safe to operate without this rigid package,” Lin told Ars. Unfortunately, flexible packaging made of polymers or other stretchable materials can be easily penetrated by air or water, which will react with standard electrolytes, generating lots of heat, potentially resulting in fires and explosions. This is why, in 2017, scientists started to experiment with quasi-solid-state hydrogel electrolytes. These hydrogels were made of a polymer net that gave them their shape, crosslinkers like borax or hydrogen bonds that held this net together, a liquid phase made of water, and salt or other electrolyte additives providing ions that moved through the watery gel as the battery charged or discharged. But hydrogels like that had their own fair share of issues. The first was a fairly narrow electrochemical stability window—a safe zone of voltage the battery can be exposed to. “This really limits how much voltage your battery can output,” says Peisheng He, a researcher at UC Berkeley Sensor and Actuator Center and lead author of the study. “Nowadays, batteries usually operate at 3.3 volts, so their stability window must be higher than that, probably four volts, something like that.” Water, which was the basis of these hydrogel electrolytes, typically broke down into hydrogen and oxygen when exposed to around 1.2 volts. That problem was solved by using highly concentrated salt water loaded with highly fluorinated lithium salts, which made it less likely to break down. But this led the researchers straight into safety issues, as fluorinated lithium salts are highly toxic to humans. The challenge Lin, He, and their colleagues set for themselves was making a hydrogel battery with a wide electrochemical window—ideally above 3 volts—that would not cause severe chemical burns when damaged. The chemistry of the battery they made started with a polymer that has both positive and negative charges (these are termed “zwitterionic”) as the structural net. Water molecules form hydrogen bonds with any charged parts, while lithium ions are attracted to its negatively charged parts. This way, the zwitterionic polymer could bind water tightly enough to prevent it from splitting at higher voltages while still releasing lithium ions when needed. The team then used acrylic acid as the gel’s crosslinker and an electrolyte with a fluorine-free lithium salt to provide lithium ions. Credit:\n\n          \n          He et al. The salt also played an additional role: It pulled water from the air. The usual way of getting the “hydro” part into a hydrogel is soaking the crosslinked, hydrophilic polymer in water; it will typically reach 80 percent water content. Lin, He, and their colleagues didn’t want their hydrogel to contain that much water because of the water-splitting issue. So they just left it to absorb water from ambient moisture. The result was a water-scarce hydrogel electrolyte that contained only 19 percent water and remained stable in a normal room humidity of 50 percent or so. Once the electrolyte was ready, the team added electrodes and built a fully functional battery powering a printed circuit with a few LED lights. The battery could work for over a month without sealed packaging and operate at over 3.1 volts without much water splitting—a voltage close to that used by commercial batteries. Despite this success, they started inflicting all sorts of punishment on it. The soft, jelly-like battery could power the LEDs when it was twisted 180 degrees, bent, punctured with a needle, and cut with a razor. It could even self-heal and get back to 90 percent of its original capacity after the team cut it in half, although this required putting it back together and warming it in an oven. Because the electrolyte reached its equilibrium state in ambient air, it didn’t degrade due to air exposure as other hydrogel electrolytes did and remained functional after 500 complete charge cycles. There were some drawbacks, though. A commercial battery designed for 500 cycles, in principle, should retain 80 percent of its capacity once those 500 cycles are done. Lin and He’s soft battery retained around 60 percent, which leaves lots of room for improvement. Another problem was the energy density. “When you compare this with state-of-the-art batteries we have today, we achieved roughly one-tenth of their capacity,” He says. “So, I think definitely we can try to optimize more towards energy density. Depending on the application, we may sacrifice some properties, like self-healing.” Lin, however, thinks that the relatively low energy density does not tell the full story. “Your smartwatch is powered by a battery, but a band for this watch today performs only the mechanical function,” Lin says. “If you can replace the band with our battery, you have more area, more volume to work with. Instead of needing a recharge once a day, it could perhaps work for, like, a week.” Science Advances, 2025.  DOI:www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adu3711 Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Zuckerberg’s 2012 email dubbed “smoking gun” at Meta monopoly trial",
    "article_text": "FTC’s “entire” monopoly case rests on decade-old emails, Meta argued. Starting the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) antitrust trial Monday with a bang, Daniel Matheson, the FTC's lead litigator, flagged a \"smoking gun\"—a 2012 email where Mark Zuckerberg suggested that Facebook could buy Instagram to \"neutralize a potential competitor,\" The New York Timesreported. And in \"another banger of an email from Zuckerberg,\" Brendan Benedict, an antitrust expert monitoring the trial for Big Tech on Trial,postedon X that the Meta CEO wrote, \"Messenger isn't beating WhatsApp. Instagram was growing so much faster than us that we had to buy them for $1 billion... that's not exactly killing it.\" These messages and others, the FTC hopes to convince the court, provide evidence that Zuckerberg runs Meta by the mantra \"it's better to buy than compete\"—seemingly for more than a decade intent on growing the Facebook empire by killing off rivals, allegedly in violation of antitrust law. Another message from Zuckerberg exhibited at trial, Benedictnotedon X, suggests Facebook tried to buy yet another rival, Snapchat, for $6 billion. \"We should probably prepare for a leak that we offered $6b... and all the negative [attention] that will come from that,\" the Zuckerberg message said. At the trial, Matheson suggested that \"Meta broke the deal\" that firms have in the US to compete to succeed, allegedly deciding \"that competition was too hard, and it would be easier to buy out their rivals than to compete with them,\" the NYT reported. Ultimately, it will be up to the FTC to prove that Meta couldn't have achieved its dominance today without buying Instagram and WhatsApp (in 2012 and 2014, respectively), while legal experts told the NYT that it is \"extremely rare\" to unwind mergers approved so many years ago. Later today, Zuckerberg will take the stand and testify for perhaps seven hours, likely being made to answer for these messages and more. According to the NYT, the FTC will present a paper trail of emails where Zuckerberg and other Meta executives make it clear that acquisitions were intended to remove threats to Facebook's dominance in the market. It's apparent that Meta plans to argue that it doesn't matter what Zuckerberg or other executives intended when pursuing acquisitions. In apretrial brief, Meta argued that \"the FTC’s case rests almost entirely on emails (many more than a decade old) allegedly expressing competitive concerns\" but suggested that this is only \"intent\" evidence, \"without any evidence of anticompetitive effects.\" It is the FTC's burden to show that Meta's acquisitions harmed consumers and the market (and those harms outweigh any believable pro-competitive benefits alleged by Meta), but it remains to be seen whether Meta will devote ample time to testifying that \"Mark Zuckerberg got it wrong\" when describing his rationale for acquisitions, Big Tech on Trialnoted. Meta's lead lawyer, Mark Hansen,told Law360that \"what people thought at Meta is not really what this case is.\" (For those keeping track of who's who in this case, Hansen apparently once was the boss of James Boasberg, the judge in the case, Big Tech on Trial reported.) The social media company hopes to convince the court that the FTC's case is political. So far, Meta has accused the FTC of shifting its market definition while willfully overlooking today's competitive realities online, simply to punish a tech giant for its success. In ablog poston Sunday, Meta's chief legal officer, Jennifer Newstead, accused the FTC of lobbing a \"weak case\" that \"ignores reality.\" Meta insists that the FTC has \"gerrymandered a fictitious market\" to exclude Meta's actual rivals, like TikTok, X, YouTube, or LinkedIn. Boasberg will be scrutinizing the market definition, as well as alleged harms, and the FTC will potentially struggle to win him over on the merits of their case. Big Tech on Trial—which suggested that Meta's acquisitions, if intended to kill off rivals, would be considered \"a textbook violation of the antitrust laws\"—noted that the court previously told the FTC that the agency had an \"uphill climb\" in proving its market definition. And because Meta's social platforms are free, it's harder to show direct evidence of consumer harms, experts have noted. Still, for Meta, the stakes are high, as the FTC could pursue a breakup of the company, including requiring Meta to spin off WhatsApp and Instagram. Losing Instagram would hit Meta's revenue hard, as Instagram is supposed to bring in more than half of its US ad revenue in 2025, eMarketerforecastedlast December. The trial is expected to last eight weeks, but much of the most-anticipated testimony will come early. Facebook's former chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, as well as Kevin Systrom, co-founder of Instagram, are expected to testify this week. All unsealed emails and exhibits will eventually be posted on a website jointly managed by the FTC and Meta, but Ars was not yet provided a link or timeline for when the public evidence will be posted online. The FTC is arguing that Meta overpaid to acquire Instagram and WhatsApp to maintain an alleged monopoly in the personal social networking market that includes rivals like Snapchat and MeWe, a social networking platform that brands itself as a privacy-focused Facebook alternative. In opening arguments, the FTC alleged that once competition was eliminated, Meta then degraded the quality of its platforms by limiting user privacy and inundating users with ads. Meta has defended its acquisitions by arguing that it has improved Instagram and WhatsApp. At trial, Meta's lawyer Hansen made light of the FTC's \"ad load theory,\" stirring laughter in the reportedly packed courtroom, Benedictpostedon X. \"If you don't like an ad, you scroll past it. It takes about a second,\" Hansen said. Meanwhile, Newstead, who reportedly attended opening arguments, argued in her blog that \"Instagram and WhatsApp provide a model for what successful acquisitions can achieve: Meta has made Instagram and WhatsApp better, more reliable and more secure through billions of dollars and millions of hours of investment.\" By breaking up these acquisitions, Hansen argued, the FTC would be sending a strong message to startups that \"would kill entrepreneurship\" by seemingly taking mergers and acquisitions \"off the table,\" Benedictpostedon X. To defeat the FTC, Meta will likely attempt to broaden the market definition to include more rivals. In support of that, Meta has already pointed to the recent TikTok ban driving TikTok users to Instagram, which allegedly shows the platforms are interchangeable, despite the FTC differentiating TikTok as a video app. The FTC will likely lean on Meta's internal documents to show who Meta actually considers rivals. During opening arguments, for example, the FTCreportedlyshared a Meta document showing that Meta itself has agreed with the FTC and differentiated Facebook as connecting \"friends and family,\" while \"LinkedIn connects coworkers\" and \"Nextdoor connects neighbors.\" \"Contemporaneous records reveal that Meta and other social media executives understood that users flock to different platforms for different purposes and that Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp were specifically designed to operate in a distinct submarket for family and friend connections,\" the American Economic Liberties Project, which is partnering with Big Tech on Trial to monitoring the proceedings, said in a press statement. But Newstead suggested that \"evidence of fierce and increasing competition in the market has only grown in the four years since the FTC’s complaint was filed,\" and Meta now \"faces strong competition in a rapidly shifting tech landscape that includes American and foreign competitors.\" To emphasize the threats to US consumers and businesses, Newstead also invoked the supposed threat to America's AI leadership if one of the country's leading tech companies loses momentum at this key moment. \"It’s absurd that the FTC is trying to break up a great American company at the same time the Administration is trying to save Chinese-owned TikTok,\" Newstead said. \"And, it makes no sense for regulators to try and weaken US companies right at the moment we most need them to invest in winning the competition with China for leadership in AI.\" Zuckerberg has been criticized for his supposed last-ditch attempts to push the Trump administration to pause or toss the FTC's case. Last month, the CEO visited Trump in the Oval Office to discuss a settlement, Politicoreported, apparently worrying officials who don't want Trump to bail out Meta. On Monday, the FTC did not appear to be wavering, however, prompting alarm bells in the tech industry. Patrick Hedger, the director of policy for NetChoice—a trade group that represents Meta and other Big Tech companies—warned that if the FTC undoes Meta's acquisitions, it would harm innovation and competition while damaging trust in the FTC long-term. \"This bait-and-switch against Meta for acquisitions approved over 10 years ago in the fiercely competitive social media marketplace will have serious ripple effects not only for the US tech industry, but across all American businesses,\" Hedger said. Seemingly accusing Donald Trump's FTC of pursuing Lina Khan's alleged agenda against Big Tech, Hedger added that \"with Meta at the forefront of open-source AI innovation and a global competitor, the outcome of this trial will have spillover into the entire economy. It will create a fear among businesses that making future, pro-competitive investments could be reversed due to political discontent—not the necessary evidence traditionally required for an anticompetitive claim.\" Big Tech on Trial noted that it's possible that the FTC could \"vote to settle, withdraw, or pause the case.\" Last month,Trump fired the two Democrats, eliminating a 3–2 split and ensuringonly Republicans are steering the agencyfor now. But Trump's FTC seems determined to proceed in attempts to disrupt Meta's business. FTC Chair Andrew Fergusontold Fox BusinessMonday that \"antitrust laws can help make sure that no private sector company gets so powerful that it affects our lives in ways that are really bad for all Americans,\" and \"that’s what this trial beginning today is all about.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Samsung’s Android 15 update has been halted",
    "article_text": "Samsung has stopped the One UI 7 update due to unforeseen bugs. Samsung began the process of updating millions of smartphones around the world to its latest One UI 7 (Android 15) software last week, but that process has now been halted. Over the weekend, Samsung purged the One UI 7 update from its servers, which indicates that a serious problem has occurred. The company isn't offering any explanation for the pause yet, but reports around the Internet suggest there are some bugs problematic enough that it required Samsung to slam on the brakes. This update was destined for the Galaxy S24, Z Fold 6, and Z Flip 6, all of which launched with One UI 6 (Android 14). Samsung promises seven years of update support like Google, but it takes longer for it to release new operating system versions. Not only does Samsung modify the way Android looks, but it also integrates a raft of Galaxy AI features with Android. It takes time to do that—seven months and counting since Android 15's release—but it seems Samsung should have spent a little more time testing all those changes. As soon as Samsung began the rollout on April 7, Galaxy S24 users in Korea noticed their phones would intermittently refuse to unlock, asreportedby frequent Samsung leaker IceUniverse. There are also reports that Samsung's supposedly private Secure Folder has a bug in One UI 7 that can see photos from the gallery appear in auto-generated Stories. These Stories are accessible from outside the Secure Folder, which rather defeats the purpose of having private photos. When asked about specifics, Samsung doesn't have much to say. \"The One UI 7 rollout schedule is being updated to ensure the best possible experience. The new timing and availability will be shared shortly,\" the company said. One UI 7 is based on Android 15, which is the latest version of the OS for the moment. Google plans to release the first version of Android 16 in June, which is much earlier than in previous cycles. Samsung's current-gen Galaxy S25 familylaunched with One UI 7, so owners of those devices don't need to worry about the buggy update. Samsung is no doubt working to fix the issues and restart the update rollout. Its statement is vague about timing—\"shortly\" can mean many things. We've reached out and will report if Samsung offers any more details on the pause or when it will be over. When One UI 7 finally arrives on everyone's phones, the experience will be similar to what you get on the Galaxy S25 lineup. There are a handful of base Android features in the update, but it's mostly a Samsung affair. There's the new AI-infused Now Bar, more expansive AI writing tools, camera UI customization, and plenty of interface tweaks.

    "title": "Report: Apple will take another crack at iPad multitasking in iPadOS 19",
    "article_text": "It would be Apple's first overhaul of iPad multitasking since 2022's iPadOS 16. Apple is taking another crack at iPad multitasking, according to areportfrom Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. This year's iPadOS 19 release, due to be unveiled at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conferenceon June 9, will apparently include an \"overhaul that will make the tablet's software more like macOS.\" The report is light on details about what's actually changing, aside from a broad \"focus on productivity, multitasking, and app window management.\" But Apple will apparently continue to stop short of allowing users of newer iPads to run macOS on their tablets, despite the fact that modern iPad Airs and Pros use the same processors as Macs. If this is giving you déjà vu, you're probably thinking aboutiPadOS 16, the last time Apple tried making significant upgrades to the iPad's multitasking model. Gurman's reporting at the time even used similar language, saying that iPads running the new software would work \"more like a laptop and less like a phone.\" The result of those efforts was Stage Manager. It had steep hardware requirements and launched in pretty rough shape, even though Apple delayed the release of the update by a month tokeep polishing it. Stage Manager did allow for more flexible multitasking, and on newer models, it enabled true multi-monitor support for the first time. But early versions were buggy and frustrating in ways that still haven't fully been addressed by subsequent updates (MacStories' Federico Viticci keeps the Internet'smost comprehensive recordof theissues with the software.) Stage Manager was Apple's first crack at a full overhaul for the iPad's app multitasking; the original implementation dated back to iOS 9, the first release to allow a pair of iPad apps to run side by side on the screen at the same time. Apple gradually improved this multitasking mode in subsequent releases, and it's still the way multitasking works on older iPads and the $349 11th-generation iPad. But features like Split View and Slide Over were designed for iPads with weaker processors and as little as 2GB of RAM; by the time the iPads began shipping with the same M-series processors that Apple used for the Macs, it was clear that the hardware was capable of more. A hallmark of our iPad Pro reviews, fromthe original in 2015all the way up throughlast year's M4 models, is that iPadOS and its apps aren't making the best possible use of the hardware, especially for the prices Apple charges. The new software update could fix that, making the iPad Pro and Air feel more like the laptop replacements they're clearly capable of being. It could also feel like another half-measure. Either way, we'll know more in just a few weeks. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Amid Trump tariff chaos, Nvidia launches AI chip production on US soil",
    "article_text": "New announcement seems aimed at appeasing Trump, signals company shift. Nvidiaannounced planstoday to manufacture AI chips and build complete supercomputers on US soil for the first time, commissioning over one million square feet of manufacturing space across Arizona and Texas. The politically timed move comes amid rising US-China tensions and the Trump administration's push for domestic manufacturing. Nvidia's announcement comes less than two weeks after the Trump administration'schaotic rolloutof new tariffs and just two days after the administration's contradictory messages on electronic component exemptions. On Friday night, the US Customs and Border Protectionposted a bulletinexempting electronics including smartphones, computers, and semiconductors from Trump's steep reciprocal tariffs. But by Sunday, Trump and his commerce secretary Howard Lutnick contradicted this move, claiming the exemptionswere only temporaryand that electronics would face new \"semiconductor tariffs\" in thecoming months. Nvidia says it has already begun producing its Blackwell chips at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co's (TSMC) facilities in Phoenix. Until now, the company's AI chips have been manufactured exclusively in Taiwan, presenting geopolitical risks to the supply chain. The company is also setting up supercomputer manufacturing plants in Texas—partnering with Foxconn in Houston and Wistron in Dallas, with mass production expected to ramp up within 12 to 15 months. \"The engines of the world's AI infrastructure are being built in the United States for the first time,\" said Jensen Huang, Nvidia's founder and CEO, in a news release. \"Adding American manufacturing helps us better meet the incredible and growing demand for AI chips and supercomputers, strengthens our supply chain, and boosts our resiliency.\" For chip packaging and testing operations, Nvidia is collaborating withAmkorandSPILin Arizona. The supply chain for building the kinds of advanced GPUs that accelerate training and running AI models requires advanced manufacturing, packaging, and testing technologies that each partner works together to provide. The development also comes days after Nvidia reportedly avoided export controls on its H20 chip by striking a domestic manufacturing deal with the Trump administration. The H20 is Nvidia's most powerful AI chip that can still be legally exported to China under current US restrictions; it's designed with reduced specifications to comply with export controls while maintaining compatibility with Nvidia's CUDA platform. According to reporting fromTechCrunchandNPR, the H20, which can still be exported to China, was spared after Huang promised to invest capital into components for US-based AI data centers. Nvidia's new US manufacturing initiative is ambitious in scope—the company aims to produce up to half a trillion dollars of AI infrastructure in the United States over the next four years. The company claims its efforts could create \"hundreds of thousands\" of jobs and drive \"trillions of dollars\" in economic activity in the coming decades. However, given the uncertainty surrounding domestic and international trade policy under the current US administration, it's difficult to say whether those plans will actually come to pass exactly as envisioned today. Trump has reportedlypressured TSMC directly, telling the company it would face a tariff of up to 100 percent if it didn't build new chip factories in the US. As TechCrunchnotes, retaliatory tariffs on Chinese parts threaten the supply of raw materials to build chips in America, and the US lacks the necessary quantity of skilled manufacturing workers for assembling chips. The Trump administration's moves toundermine the CHIPS Actcould further deter investments from semiconductor giants. Significant questions remain about the viability of full production onshoring for Nvidia chips. Reports from Decemberindicatedthat while front-end processing of Blackwell chips could take place in Arizona, the chips might still need to be shipped to Taiwan for advanced packaging using TSMC's chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) technology, which isn't yet available at the Arizona facilities. While Nvidia highlights potential US job creation in its announcement, the company also plans to use its own technologies in these facilities, including \"NVIDIA Omniverse to create digital twins of factories and NVIDIA Isaac GR00T to build robots to automate manufacturing.\" This suggests the company intends to incorporate significant automation in its US manufacturing operations.

    "title": "F1 in Bahrain: I dare you to call that race boring",
    "article_text": "After a snoozer in Japan, F1's return to the Middle East went well. What a difference a week makes. This past weekend, Formula 1 went back to Bahrain, the site of this year's preseason test, for round four of the 2025 season.Last week's race in Japansent many to sleep, but that was definitely not the case on Sunday. The overtaking was frenetic, the sparks didn't set anything on fire, and the title fight just got that little bit more complicated. It was a heck of a race. Before the racing got underway, the sport got some clarity on future powertrain rules.An ambitious new rulesetgoes into effect next year, with an all-new, small-capacity turbocharged V6 engine working together with an electric motor that powers the rear wheels. Just under half the total power comes from the hybrid system, much more than the two hybrid systems on current F1 cars, and developing themis no easy task. Nor is it cheap. F1 is also moving to supposedlycarbon-neutral synthetic fuelsnext year, and that has prompted some to wonder—increasingly loudly—if instead of the expensive hybrids lasting for four years, maybe they could be replaced with a cheaper non-hybrid engine instead,like a naturally aspirated V10. This would placate Red Bull. Next year, that team will field an engine of its own design and manufacture (albeit with Ford providing the hybrid stuff), and it has been increasingly noisy about looking for alternatives to the small-capacity V6—problems with that program, perhaps? It would also start to decouple F1 from the automakers. But naturally aspirated V10s don't mean much to the tens of millions of fans who have flocked to the sport since the start of the decade—they've only ever known the muted drone of turbocharged V6s. V10s mean even less to OEMs like Audi, Honda, Cadillac, and Ford, which committed to the 2026 rule set specificallybecausethe powertrains are hybridized. So we're going to stick with the original plan and can expect hybrids to continue into the 2031 ruleset, too, albeit probably a much smaller, lighter, cheaper, and less powerful electrified system than we'll see next year. Speaking of hybrid systems, both Red Bulls and both RBs had to have their Honda hybrid systems replaced for this weekend. Each driver is only allowed two units in a season; if a third (or fourth) is needed after that point, that incurs a penalty, demoting them down the grid. There are still 20 rounds left in the season, so this is probably something to keep an eye on for the rest of the year. In Japan, the sparks from the cars' titanium skid blocks were a nuisance, setting fire to the dry grass at trackside and causing multiple red flags during practice and qualifying. There was nothing to burn at the Bahraini race track, and at night, the showers of bright sparks filled the air above the track as the pack of 20 cars, laden with fuel and running close to the ground, bottomed out at speed. Unlike Suzuka, Bahrain is one of F1's crop of modern circuits and is better-suited to the cars raced today. McLaren's Oscar Piastri won pole position on Saturday, and on Sunday, he made full use of his car's advantage to streak off into the distance before a NASCAR-like debris caution closed everything up a little toward the end of the race. Mercedes' George Russell had an eventful day to finish second. His brake-by-wire system failed and needed resetting multiple times during a lap—sometimes the pedal was hard; other times, it went to the floor. Next, the display on his wheel went, too. As a result, his engineer on the pit wall had to tell him when to use certain settings. Despite this, he held onto a credible second place ahead of Lando Norris in the second McLaren. Ferrari also had a much better time in the race this weekend. Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton finished fourth and fifth, and the seven-time champ Hamilton looked a lot more at ease in his new red race car. The Ferrari requires a different driving style to his old Mercedes, using engine braking to slow the car, for instance, something he said he never did in his Mercedes or McLaren days. \"It's clear the car really does require a different driving style, and I think I'm... slowly adjusting to that—and also setup. I think I've been a bit all over the place a long way from Charles the past two weekends and then slowly migrating toward him,\" Hamilton told reporters after the race. Last year's champion, Max Verstappen, had a torrid time and finished sixth in an uncompetitive Red Bull. Normally the one to put moves on other drivers, Verstappen found himself an easy target for Mercedes' rookie Kimi Antonelli—shades of a young Schumacher up against an established Senna or the upstart Verstappen starting to challenge Hamilton, perhaps. The other Red Bull scored points thanks to Yuki Tsunoda, the first time for that car since last year's race in Las Vegas. Others who are heading to Saudi Arabia for next week's race with a smile on their faces include the Alpine team, which finally put some points on the board with Pierre Gasly's seventh-place finish (and a much better race for Jack Doohan) and Haas, which got both cars in the points, with rookie Oliver Bearman making up 10 places during the race. McLaren's Norris leaves Bahrain still in the title lead, but he did not have the measure of his younger teammate at any point this past weekend. Having two equally fast drivers can be a problem for a team—McLaren in 2007 is a good example of this. But I'm starting to think the 1996 Williams pairing of Damon Hill and Jacques Villeneuve might be more apt?Like Hill,Norris is self-conscious, perhaps too much so for a cutthroat and competitive sport like F1, where confidence is so important. Watching which of the pair comes out on top this year is going to be fascinating. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

But just how accurate is an 18th-century musket when it comes to hitting a target? Did the rifle really determine the outcome of the war? And just how much damage did cannon inflict? A team of military weapons experts and re-enactors set about testing some of those questions in a new NOVA documentary,Revolutionary War Weapons. The documentary examines the firing range and accuracy ofBrown Bess musketsandlong riflesused by both the British and the Continental Army during theBattles of Lexington and Concord; the effectiveness of Native Americantomahawksfor close combat (no, they were usually not thrown as depicted in so many popular films, but there are modern throwing competitions today); and the effectiveness of cannons against thegabionsand other defenses employed to protect the British fortress during the pivotalSiege of Yorktown. There is even a fascinating segment on the first military submarine, dubbed \"the Turtle,\" created by American inventor David Bushnell. To capture all the high-speed ballistics action, director Stuart Powell relied upon a range of high-speed cameras called the Phantom Range. \"It is like a supercomputer,\" Powell told Ars. \"It is a camera, but it doesn't feel like a camera. You need to be really well-coordinated on the day when you're using it because it bursts for, like, 10 seconds. It doesn't record constantly because it's taking so much data. Depending on what the frame rate is, you only get a certain amount of time. So you're trying to coordinate that with someone trying to fire a 250-year-old piece of technology. If the gun doesn't go off, if something goes wrong on set, you'll miss it. Then it takes five minutes to reboot and get ready for the new shot. So a lot of the shoot revolves around the camera; that's not normally the case.\" Constraints to keep the run time short meant that not every experiment the crew filmed ended up in the final document, according to Powell. For instance, there was one experiment in a hypoxia chamber for the segment on the Turtle, meant to see how long a person could function once the sub had descended, limiting the oxygen supply. \"We felt there was slightly too much on the Turtle,\" said Powell. \"It took up a third of the whole film.\" Also cut, for similar reasons, were power demonstrations for the musket, using boards instead of ballistic gel. But these cuts were anomalies in the tightly planned shooting schedule; most of the footage found its way onscreen. The task of setting up all those field experiments fell to experts like military historian and weapons expertJoel Bohy, who is a frequent appraiser forAntiques Roadshow. We caught up with Bohy to learn more. Ars Technica: Obviously you can't work with the original weapons because they're priceless. How did you go about making replicas as close as possible to the originals? Joel Bohy: Prior to our live fire studies, I started to collect the best contemporary reproductions of all of the different arms that were used. Over the years, I've had these custom-built, and now I have about 14 of them, so that we can cover pretty much every different type of arm used in the Revolution. I have my pick when we want to go out to the range and shoot at ballistics gelatin. We've publishedsome great papers. The latest one was in conjunction with a bullet strike study where we went through and used modern forensic techniques to not only locate where each shooter was, what caliber the gun was, using ballistics rods and lasers, but we also had 18th-century house sections built and shot at the sections to replicate that damage. It was a validation study, and those firearms came in very handy. Ars Technica: What else can we learn from these kinds of experiments? Joel Bohy: One of the things that's great about the archeology end of it is when we're finding fired ammunition. I mostly volunteer with archaeologists on the Revolutionary War. One of my colleagues has worked on the Little Bighorn battlefield doing firing pin impressions, which leave a fingerprint, so he could track troopers and Native Americans across the battlefields. With [the Revolutionary War], it's harder to do because we're using smooth-bore guns that don't necessarily leave a signature. But what they do leave is a caliber, and they also leave a location. We GIS all this stuff and map it, and it's told us things about the battles that we never knew before. We just did one last August that hasn't been released yet that changes where people thought a battle took place. We like to combine that with our live fire studies. So when we [conduct the latter], we take a shot, then we metal detect each shot, bag it, tag it. We record all the data that we see on our musket balls that we fired so that when we're on an archeology project, we can correlate that with what we see in the ground. We can see if it hits a tree, if it hits rocks, how close was a soldier when they fired—all based upon the deformation of the musket ball. Ars Technica: What is the experience of shooting a replica of a musket compared to, say, a modern rifle? Joel Bohy: It's a lot different. When you're firing a modern rifle, you pull the trigger and it's very quick—a matter of milliseconds and the bullet's downrange. With the musket, it's similar, but it's slower, and you can anticipate the shot. By the time the cock goes down, the flint strikes the hammer, it ignites the powder in the pan, which goes through the vent and sets off the charge—there's a lot more time involved in that. So you can anticipate and flinch. You may not necessarily get the best shot as you would on a more modern rifle. There's still a lot of kick, and there's a lot more smoke because of the black powder that's being used. With modern smokeless powder, you have very little smoke compared to the muskets. Ars Technica: It's often said that throughout the history of warfare, whoever has the superior weapons wins. This series presents a more nuanced picture of how such conflicts play out. Joel Bohy: In the Revolutionary War, you have both sides basically using the same type of firearm. Yes, some were using rifles, depending on what region you were from, and units in the British Army used rifles. But for the most part, they're all using flintlock mechanisms and smoothbore guns. What comes into play in the Revolution is, on the [Continental] side, they don't have the supply of arms that the British do. There was an embargo in place in 1774 so that no British arms could be shipped into Boston and North America. So you have a lot of innovation with gunsmiths and blacksmiths and clockmakers, who were taking older gun parts, barrels, and locks and building a functional firearm. You saw a lot of the Americans at the beginning of the war trying to scrape through with these guns made from old parts and cobbled together. They're functional. We didn't really have that lock-making and barrel-making industry here. A lot of that stuff we had imported. So even if a gun was being made here, the firing mechanism and the barrels were imported. So we had to come up with another way to do it. We started to receive a trickle of arms from the French in 1777, and to my mind, that's what helped change the outcome of the war. Not only did we have French troops arriving, but we also had French cloth, shoes, hats, tin, powder, flints, and a ton of arms being shipped in. The French took all of their old guns from their last model that they had issued to the army, and they basically sold them all to us. So we had this huge influx of French arms that helped resupply us and made the war viable for us. Ars Technica: There are a lot of popular misconceptions about the history of the American Civil War. What are a couple of things that you wish more Americans understood about that conflict? Joel Bohy: The onset of the American Revolution, April 1775, when the war began—these weren't just a bunch of farmers who grabbed their rifle from over the fireplace and went out and beat the British Army. These people had been training and arming themselves for a long time. They had been doing it for generations before in wars with Native forces and the French since the 17th century. So by the time the Revolution broke out, they were as prepared as they could be for it. \"The rifle won the Revolution\" is one of the things that I hear. No, it didn't. Like I said, the French arms coming in helped us win the Revolution. A rifle is a tool, just like a smoothbore musket is. It has its benefits and it has its downfalls. It's slower to load, you can't mount a bayonet on it, but it's more accurate, whereas the musket, you can load and fire faster, and you can mount a bayonet. So the gun that really won the Revolution was the musket, not the rifle. It's all well and good to be proud of being an American and our history and everything else, but these people just didn't jump out of bed and fight. These people were training, they were drilling, they were preparing and arming and supplying not just arms, but food, cloth, tents, things that they would need to continue to have an army once the war broke out. It wasn't just a big—poof—this happened and we won. Revolutionary War Weaponsis now streamingon YouTubeand is also availableon PBS.

    "title": "NOAA scientists scrub toilets, rethink experiments after service contracts end",
    "article_text": "One federal lab has lost janitorial services, hazardous waste support, IT, and building maintenance. Federal scientists responsible for monitoring the health of West Coast fisheries are cleaning office bathrooms and reconsidering critical experiments after the Department of Commerce failed to renew their lab’s contracts for hazardous waste disposal, janitorial services, IT, and building maintenance. Trash is piling up at the Northwest Fisheries Science Center, part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, staffers told ProPublica. Ecologists, chemists, and biologists at Montlake Laboratory, the center’s headquarters in Seattle, are taking turns hauling garbage to the dumpster and discussing whether they should create a sign-up sheet to scrub toilets. The scientists—who conduct genetic sampling of endangered salmon to check the species’ stock status and survival—routinely work with chemicals that can burn skin, erupt into flames, and cause cancer. At least one said they’d have to delay mission-critical research if hazardous waste removal isn’t restored. The deteriorating conditions at Montlake stem from a new policy at the Commerce Department that says Secretary Howard Lutnick must personally approve all contracts over $100,000.NPR reported that the bottleneckhas disrupted operations at many NOAA facilities. ProPublica spoke to three Montlake employees who described what it was like to work there as, one by one, service contracts expire and aren’t renewed. People are running around looking for compost bags and wondering who will empty out the female sanitary waste containers in the bathrooms, they said. The floors are getting dirty, and workers have no access to vacuums or mops. Some scientists have bought their own soap and cleaning supplies. Nor can people escape by working from home: The Trump administration has increasingly ordered federal workers to return to the office five days a week. At Montlake, that policy will apply to everyone by April 21. “It’s making our work unsafe, and it’s unsanitary for any workplace,” but especially an active laboratory full of fire-reactive chemicals and bacteria, one Montlake researcher said. Press officers at NOAA, the Commerce Department, and the White House did not respond to requests for comment. Montlake employees were informed last week that a contract for safety services — which includes the staff who move laboratory waste off-campus to designated disposal sites — would lapse after April 9, leaving just one person responsible for this task. Hazardous waste “pickups from labs may be delayed,” employees were warned in a recent email. The building maintenance team’s contract expired Wednesday, which decimated the staff that had handled plumbing, HVAC, and the elevators. Other contacts lapsed in late March, leaving the Seattle lab with zero janitorial staff and a skeleton crew of IT specialists. During a big staff meeting at Montlake on Wednesday, lab leaders said they had no updates on when the contracts might be renewed, one researcher said. They also acknowledged it was unfair that everyone would need to pitch in on janitorial duties on top of their actual jobs. Nick Tolimieri, a union representative for Montlake employees, said the problem is “all part of the large-scale bullying program” to push out federal workers. It seems like every Friday “we get some kind of message that makes you unable to sleep for the entire weekend,” he said. Now, with these lapsed contracts, it’s getting “more and more petty.” The problems, large and small, at Montlake provide a case study of the chaos that’s engulfed federal workers across many agencies as the Trump administration has fired staff, dumped contracts, and eliminated long-time operational support. Yesterday,hundreds of NOAA workers who had been fired in February, then briefly reinstated, were fired again. Local management had new service contracts ready to go ages ago, Tolimieri said. The delay from headquarters means employees will struggle to get repairs for their computers or basic building maintenance; the aging elevators at Montlake already break so often that Tolimieri joked it would be easier to send notices on the occasions when they did work. The fisheries center employs more than 350 people, most of whom work at Montlake. The rest are scattered across several research stations in Oregon and Washington. Staff at the center conduct research and provide scientific advice for policies on sustainable fishing and endangered species, including a population of orcas in Puget Sound. They test seafood after oil spills to ensure the fish are safe to eat. Their work helps restore native salmon populations and support regional farming. NOAA is “so uncontroversial,” said the Montlake researcher who’s worried about hazardous waste disposal. Employees are just “trying to do weather reports and give people good seafood.” The researcher said lab workers are trained in basic lab safety, so the chemicals are properly stored, handled, and placed into appropriate waste containers after use. But there’s a limit to how much chemical waste can be kept on site. And the contractors who left were experts on handling emergencies like large chemical spills or serious toxic exposures. If those contractors don’t return soon, the researcher said, the lab may need to delay or pause important research. That could include chemical-intensive lab work like testing sea lions, killer whales, and walruses from Alaska for environmental contaminants, Tolimieri said. “For a bunch of people who are screaming about efficiency,” he said, referring to the administration’s efforts to downsize the federal government, “they’ve done the most inefficient things possible.” This story originally appeared onProPublica.

    "title": "Google created a new AI model for talking to dolphins",
    "article_text": "DolphinGemma will get its first test run this summer. Dolphins are generally regarded assome of the smartestcreatures on the planet. Research has shown they can cooperate, teach each other new skills, and even recognize themselves in a mirror. For decades, scientists have attempted to make sense of the complex collection of whistles and clicks dolphins use to communicate. Researchers might make a little headway on that front soon with the help of Google's open AI model and some Pixel phones. Google has been finding ways to work generative AI into everything else it does, so why not its collaboration with the Wild Dolphin Project (WDP)? This group has been studying dolphins since 1985 using a non-invasive approach to track a specific community of Atlantic spotted dolphins. The WDP creates video and audio recordings of dolphins, along with correlating notes on their behaviors. One of the WDP's main goals is to analyze the way dolphins vocalize and how that can affect their social interactions. With decades of underwater recordings, researchers have managed to connect some basic activities to specific sounds. For example, Atlantic spotted dolphins have signature whistles that appear to be used like names, allowing two specific individuals to find each other. They also consistently produce \"squawk\" sound patterns during fights. WDP researchers believe that understanding the structure and patterns of dolphin vocalizations is necessary to determine if their communication rises to the level of a language. \"We do not know if animals have words,\" says WDP's Denise Herzing. The ultimate goal is to speak dolphin, if indeed there is such a language. The pursuit of this goal has led WDP to create a massive, meticulously labeled data set, which Google says is perfect for analysis with generative AI. The large language models (LLMs) that have become unavoidable in consumer tech are essentially predicting patterns. You provide them with an input, and the models predict the next token over and over until they have an output. When a model has been trained effectively, that output can sound like it was created by a person. Google and WDP hope it's possible to do something similar with DolphinGemma for marine mammals. DolphinGemma is based on Google'sGemma open AI models, which are themselves built on the same foundation as the company'scommercial Gemini models. The dolphin communication model uses a Google-developed audio technology called SoundStream to tokenize dolphin vocalizations, allowing the sounds to be fed into the model as they're recorded. Google saysit trained the model using the Wild Dolphin Project's acoustic archive. It's an audio-in, audio-out model. So after providing it with a dolphin vocalization, the model does just what human-centric language models do—it predicts the next token. If it works anything like a standard LLM, those predicted tokens could be sounds that a dolphin would understand. The team hopes that DolphinGemma will help tease out complex patterns that will allow for the creation of a shared vocabulary. Having humans examine the data in this way would be prohibitively time-consuming, Google claims. Google says it designed DolphinGemma with WDP's research approach in mind. The team uses Pixel phones in the field, so the model had to be efficient. Running AI models on a smartphone is often challenging because of constrained resources. The larger and more capable a model is, the more RAM and processing throughput it needs to operate. DolphinGemma consists of about 400 million parameters. That's on the small side for a typical LLM. Since the team observes wild dolphins in underwater environments, they need compact audio systems. For the last several years, WDP has been using a device created at the Georgia Institute of Technology called CHAT (Cetacean Hearing Augmentation Telemetry) based on the Pixel 6. The team uses CHAT to create synthetic dolphin vocalizations that they attempt to associate with an object. It can also listen to dolphin sounds for a matching \"mimic\" reply. Google says the team will have a new Pixel 9-based CHAT for the 2025 summer research season. Moving to thePixel 9will reportedly allow CHAT to run deep learning models and template-matching algorithms at the same time. The team does not appear to be interested in piping DolphinGemma's output right into the CHAT audio transducer for the animals to hear. The work with CHAT could benefit from Google's AI work, but it's a parallel area of investigation. No one is expecting DolphinGemma and the new CHAT to immediately make humans conversant in dolphin whistles, but the system could enable basic interactions in time. Like the human-language Gemma models, DolphinGemma is an open access project. Google will release the model for researchers around the world to use this summer. While DolphinGemma has been trained on Atlantic spotted dolphin sounds, Google suggests it should be feasible to fine-tune it for other cetacean species.

    "title": "HBO’s The Last of Us is back for season 2, and so are we",
    "article_text": "One game-player and one newbie return to recap HBO's fungal free-for-all. New episodes of season 2 ofThe Last of Usare premiering on HBO every Sunday night, and Ars' Kyle Orland (who's played the games) and Andrew Cunningham (who hasn't)will be talking about them here every Monday morning. While these recaps don't delve into every single plot point of the episode, there are obviouslyheavy spoilerscontained within, so go watch the episode first if you want to go in fresh. Things fell apart at the end of last season when the Fireflies (a group of survivalists/doctors/scientists/etc.) may or may not have been threatening to kill Ellie in order to research their cure, which made Joel go on a murder rampage, which he then lied to Ellie about. We fade to black as they make their way back toward the one semi-functioning human settlement they’d visited on their travels, where Joel’s brother and his family also happen to live. Going into this season: I know nothing. I don’t really engage in TV show fandoms or keep up with casting announcements or plot speculation. And the only thing I know about the second game going into this is a vague sense that it wasn’t as well-received as the first. In short, I am as a newborn baby, ready to take in the second season of a show I kind of like with the freshest possible eyes. Without giving too much away, I think the second game misses a lot of what made the narrative of the first one special and gets sidetracked in a lot of frankly gratuitous directions. That said, this premiere episode of the second season drew me in more than I expected. One jarring thing (in a good way) about both the second game and the second season is suddenly seeing Joel and Ellie just existing in a thriving community with electric lights, music, alcohol, decent food, laughter, etc., etc. After the near-constant precarity and danger they've faced in the recent past, it really throws you for a loop. And while Joel will happily fix your circuit breaker or re-string your guitar, he emphatically rejected a needs-of-the-many-outweigh-the-needs-of-the-few approach at the end of last season. When stuff breaks bad (and I feel confident that it will, that’s the show that it is) these may not be the best people to have in your corner. My only real Game Question for you at the outset is the big one: Is season 2 adaptingThe Last of Us Part IIor is it doing its own thing or are we somewhere in between or is it too early to say? The debut episode is also already showing a willingness to move around scenes from the game to make them fit better in chronological order, which I'm already appreciating. One thing I think the show is already doing well, too, is showing 19-year-old Ellie \"acting like every 19-year-old ever\" (as one character puts it) to father figure Joel. Even in a zombie apocalypse, it's a relatable bit of character-building for anyone who's been a teenager or raised a teenager. I didn’t know if it was a direct adaptation, but I did notice that the show’s video gamey storytelling reflexes were still fully intact. We almost instantly end up in a ruined grocery store chock-full of environmental storytelling (Ellie notes a happy birthday banner and 2003’s Employee of the Year wall). And like in anynew gamenew season of a TV show, we quickly run into a whole new variant of mushroom monster that retains some of its strategic instincts and can take cover rather than blindly rushing at you. Some of the jump scares were so much like quick-time events that I almost grabbed my controller so I could press X and help Ellie out. Itdoesseem like we’re moving into Phase 2 of most zombie apocalypse fiction. Phase 1 is: There’s an infection! Society collapses. Phase 2 is: Humanity attempts to rebuild. But maybe the scariest monster of all… is humankind?? I’ve always found Phase 2 to be inherently less interesting because I can watch all kinds of shows where people are the antagonists, but Joel and Ellie remain unique and compelling enough as characters that maybe they’ll carry me through. Speaking of which, I wondered what you made of the brief scenes we get with Abby leading a reluctant but willing band of revenge-seekers that see doctor-murdering Joel as an unalloyed evil (somewhat justifiably, especially from their point of view). But in seriousness, yes, it’s obvious that What Joel Did is a bomb that’s going to go off sooner rather than later. Trying to address it without addressing it has pushed taciturn, closed-off Joel into therapy, where he insists to a woman whose (presumably infected) husband he killed that he’s a “good guy.” And it seems clear to me that Ellie’s shunning of Joel is coming from her sense that something is amiss, just as much as it is about a 19-year-old rebelling against her would-be father figure. In Joel’s case, it’s telling that it seems like lying to Ellie is weighing on him more than the murder-rampage itself. But having these improbably fresh-faced Firefly remnants chasing him down will mean that he might end up paying for both. As we close, and while at least trying to avoid spoilers, are there any game moments you’re looking forward to seeing? Or are you just hoping that this season can “fix” a story that didn’t work as well for you in video game form? Besides making me an instant fan of the song \".44 Pistol,\" that scene had me very excited to see how the social adventures of \"All Growed Up\" Ellie might develop. And while I don't feel like the game really delivered a very satisfying or believable version of Ellie's evolution, I'm hopeful the show might be able to smooth out some of the rough storytelling edges and give a more compelling version of the character.

    "title": "An Ars Technica history of the Internet, part 1",
    "article_text": "In our new 3-part series, we remember the people and ideas that made the Internet. In a very real sense, the Internet, this marvelous worldwide digital communications network that you’re using right now, was created because one man was annoyed at having too many computer terminals in his office. The year was 1966. Robert Taylor was the director of the Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Information Processing Techniques Office. The agency was created in 1958 by President Eisenhower in response to the launch ofSputnik. So Taylor was in the Pentagon, a great place for acronyms like ARPA and IPTO. He had three massive terminals crammed into a room next to his office. Each one was connected to a different mainframe computer. They all worked slightly differently, and it was frustrating to remember multiple procedures to log in and retrieve information. In those days, computers took up entire rooms, and users accessed them through teletype terminals—electric typewriters hooked up to either a serial cable or a modem and a phone line. ARPA was funding multiple research projects across the United States, but users of these different systems had no way to share their resources with each other. Wouldn’t it be great if there was a network that connected all these computers? Taylor’s predecessor, Joseph “J.C.R.” Licklider, had released amemoin 1963 that whimsically described an “Intergalactic Computer Network” that would allow users of different computers to collaborate and share information. The idea was mostly aspirational, and Licklider wasn’t able to turn it into a real project. But Taylor knew that he could. In a 1998interview, Taylor explained: “In most government funding, there are committees that decide who gets what and who does what. In ARPA, that was not the way it worked. The person who was responsible for the office that was concerned with that particular technology—in my case, computer technology—was the person who made the decision about what to fund and what to do and what not to do. The decision to start the ARPANET was mine, with very little or no red tape.” Taylor marched into the office of his boss, Charles Herzfeld. Hedescribedhow a network could save ARPA time and money by allowing different institutions to share resources. He suggested starting with a small network of four computers as a proof of concept. “Is it going to be hard to do?” Herzfeld asked. “Oh no. We already know how to do it,” Taylor replied. “Great idea,” Herzfeld said. “Get it going. You’ve got a million dollars more in your budget right now. Go.” Taylor wasn’t lying—at least, not completely. At the time, there were multiple people around the world thinking about computer networking. Paul Baran, working for RAND, published apaperin 1964 describing how a distributed military networking system could be made resilient even if some nodes were destroyed in a nuclear attack. Over in the UK, Donald Davies independently came up with a similarconcept(minus the nukes) and invented a term for the way these types of networks would communicate. He called it “packet switching.” On a regular phone network, after some circuit switching, a caller and answerer would be connected via a dedicated wire. They had exclusive use of that wire until the call was completed. Computers communicated in short bursts and didn’t require pauses the way humans did. So it would be a waste for two computers to tie up a whole line for extended periods. But how could many computers talk at the same time without their messages getting mixed up? Packet switching was the answer. Messages were divided into multiple snippets. The order and destination were included with each message packet. The network could then route the packets in any way that made sense. At the destination, all the appropriate packets were put into the correct order and reassembled. It was like moving a house across the country: It was more efficient to send all the parts in separate trucks, each taking their own route to avoid congestion. By the end of 1966, Taylor had hired a program director, Larry Roberts. Roberts sketched a diagram of a possible network on a napkin and met with his team to propose a design. One problem was that each computer on the network would need to use a big chunk of its resources to manage the packets. In a meeting, Wes Clark passed a note to Roberts saying, “You have the network inside-out.” Clark’s alternative plan was to ship a bunch of smaller computers to connect to each host. These dedicated machines would do all the hard work of creating, moving, and reassembling packets. With the design complete, Roberts sent out a request for proposals for constructing the ARPANET. All they had to do now was pick the winning bid, and the project could begin. IBM, Control Data Corporation, and AT&T were among the first to respond to the request. They all turned it down. Their reasons were the same: None of these giant companies believed the network could be built. IBM and CDC thought the dedicated computers would be too expensive, but AT&T flat-out said that packet switching wouldn’t work on its phone network. In late 1968, ARPA announced a winner for the bid: Bolt Beranek and Newman. It seemed like an odd choice. BB&N had started as a consulting firm that calculated acoustics for theaters. But the need for calculations led to the creation of a computing division, and its first manager had been none other than J.C.R. Licklider. In fact, some BB&N employees had been working on a plan to build a network even before the ARPA bid was sent out. Robert Kahn led the team that drafted BB&N’s proposal. Their plan was to create a network of “Interface Message Processors,” or IMPs, out of Honeywell 516 computers. They were ruggedized versions of theDDP-51616-bit minicomputer. Each had 24 kilobytes ofcorememory and no mass storage other than a paper tape reader, and each cost $80,000 (about $700,000 today). In comparison, an IBM 360 mainframe cost between $7 million and $12 million at the time. The 516’s rugged appearance appealed to BB&N, who didn’t want a bunch of university students tampering with its IMPs. The computer came with no operating system, but it didn’t really have enough RAM for one. The software to control the IMPs was written on bare metal using the 516’sassemblylanguage. One of the developers was Will Crowther, who went on to create the first computeradventuregame. One other hurdle remained before the IMPs could be put to use: The Honeywell design was missing certain components needed to handle input and output. BB&N employees were dismayed that the first 516, which they named IMP-0, didn’t have working versions of the hardware additions they had requested. It fell on Ben Barker, a brilliant undergrad student interning at BB&N, to manually fix the machine. Barker was the best choice, even though he had slight palsy in his hands. After several stressful 16-hour days wrapping and unwrapping wires, all the changes were complete and working. IMP-0 was ready. In the meantime, Steve Crocker at the University of California, Los Angeles, was working on a set of software specifications for the host computers. It wouldn’t matter if the IMPs were perfect at sending and receiving messages if the computers themselves didn’t know what to do with them. Because the host computers were part of important academic research, Crocker didn’t want to seem like he was a dictator telling people what to do with their machines. So he titled hisdrafta “Request for Comments,” or RFC. This one act of politeness forever changed the nature of computing. Every change since has been done as an RFC, and the culture of asking for comments pervades the tech industry even today. RFC No. 1 proposed two types of host software. The first was the simplest possible interface, in which a computer pretended to be a dumb terminal. This was dubbed a “terminal emulator,” and if you’ve ever done any administration on a server, you’ve probably used one. The second was a more complex protocol that could be used to transfer large files. This became FTP, which is still used today. A single IMP connected to one computer wasn’t much of a network. So it was very exciting in September 1969 when IMP-1 was delivered to BB&N and then shipped via air freight to UCLA. The first test of the ARPANET was done with simultaneous phone support. The plan was to type “LOGIN” to start a login sequence. This was the exchange: “Did you get the L?” “I got the L!” “Did you get the O?” “I got the O!” “Did you get the G?” “Oh no, the computer crashed!” It was an inauspicious beginning. The computer on the other end was helpfully filling in the “GIN” part of “LOGIN,” but the terminal emulator wasn’t expecting three characters at once and locked up. It was the first time that autocomplete had ruined someone’s day. The bug was fixed, and the test completed successfully. IMP-2, IMP-3, and IMP-4 were delivered to the Stanford Research Institute (where Doug Engelbart was keen to expand hisvisionof connecting people), UC Santa Barbara, and the University of Utah. Now that the four-node test network was complete, the team at BB&N could work with the researchers at each node to put the ARPANET through its paces. They deliberately created the first ever denial of service attack in January 1970, flooding the network with packets until it screeched to a halt. Surprisingly, many of the administrators of the early ARPANET nodes weren’t keen to join the network.  They didn’t like the idea of anyone else being able to use resources on “their” computers. Taylor reminded them that their hardware and software projects were mostly ARPA-funded, so they couldn’t opt out. The next month, Stephen Carr, Stephen Crocker, and Vint Cerf releasedRFC No. 33. It described a Network Control Protocol (NCP) that standardized how the hosts would communicate with each other. After this was adopted, the network was off and running. The ARPANET grew significantly over the next few years. Important events included the first everemailbetween two different computers, sent by Roy Tomlinson in July 1972. Another groundbreakingdemonstrationinvolved a PDP-10 in Harvard simulating, in real-time, an aircraft landing on a carrier. The data was sent over the ARPANET to a MIT-based graphics terminal, and the wireframe graphical view was shipped back to a PDP-1 at Harvard and displayed on a screen. Although it was primitive and slow, it was technically the first gaming stream. A big moment came in October 1972 at the International Conference on Computer Communication. This was the first time the network had beendemonstratedto the public. Interest in the ARPANET was growing, and people were excited. A group of AT&T executives noticed a brief crash and laughed, confident that they were correct in thinking that packet switching would never work. Overall, however, the demonstration was a resounding success. But the ARPANET was no longer the only network out there. The rest of the world had not been standing still. In Hawaii, Norman Abramson and Franklin Kuo createdALOHAnet, which connected computers on the islands using radio. It was the first public demonstration of a wireless packet switching network. In the UK, Donald Davies’ team developed the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) network. It seemed like a good idea to start connecting these networks together, but they all used different protocols, packet formats, and transmission rates. In 1972, the heads of several national networking projects created an International Networking Working Group. Cerf was chosen to lead it. The first attempt to bridge this gap was SATNET, also known as the Atlantic Packet Satellite Network. Using satellite links, it connected the US-based ARPANET with networks in the UK. Unfortunately, SATNET itself used its own set of protocols. In true tech fashion, an attempt to make a universal standard had createdone morestandard instead. Robert Kahn asked Vint Cerf to try and fix these problems once and for all. They came up with a new plan called theTransmission Control Protocol, or TCP. The idea was to connect different networks through specialized computers, called “gateways,” that translated and forwarded packets. TCP was like an envelope for packets, making sure they got to the right destination on the correct network. Because some networks were not guaranteed to be reliable, when one computer successfully received a complete and undamaged message, it would send an acknowledgement (ACK) back to the sender. If the ACK wasn’t received in a certain amount of time, the message was retransmitted. In December 1974, Cerf, Yogen Dalal, and Carl Sunshine wrote a completespecificationfor TCP. Two years later, Cerf and Kahn, along with a dozen others, demonstrated the first three-network system. The demo connected packet radio, the ARPANET, and SATNET, all using TCP. Afterward, Cerf, Jon Postel, and Danny Cohen suggested a small but important change: They should take out all the routing information and put it into a new protocol, called the Internet Protocol (IP). All the remaining stuff, like breaking and reassembling messages, detecting errors, and retransmission, would stay in TCP. Thus, in 1978, the protocol officially became known as, and was forever thereafter, TCP/IP. If the story of creating the Internet was a movie, the release of TCP/IP would have been the triumphant conclusion. But things weren’t so simple. The world was changing, and the path ahead was murky at best. At the time, joining the ARPANET required leasing high-speed phone lines for $100,000 per year. This limited it to large universities, research companies, and defense contractors. The situation led the National Science Foundation (NSF) to propose a new network that would be cheaper to operate. Other educational networks arose at around the same time. While it made sense to connect these networks to the growing Internet, there was no guarantee that this would continue. And there were other, larger forces at work. By the end of the 1970s, computers had improved significantly. The invention of the microprocessor set the stage for smaller, cheaper computers that were just beginning to enter people’s homes. Bulky teletypes were being replaced with sleek, TV-like terminals. The first commercial online service,CompuServe, was released to the public in 1979. For just $5 per hour, you could connect to a private network, get weather and financial reports, and trade gossip with other users. At first, these systems were completely separate from the Internet. But they grew quickly. By 1987, CompuServe had 380,000 subscribers. Meanwhile, the adoption of TCP/IP was not guaranteed. At the beginning of the 1980s, the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) group at the International Standardization Organization (ISO) decided that what the world needed was more acronyms—and also a new, global, standardized networking model. The OSI model was first drafted in 1980, but it wasn’t published until 1984. Nevertheless, many European governments, and even the US Department of Defense, planned to transition from TCP/IP to OSI. It seemed like this new standard was inevitable. While the world waited for OSI, the Internet continued to grow and evolve. In 1981, the fourth version of the IP protocol, IPv4, was released. On January 1, 1983, the ARPANET itself fully transitioned to using TCP/IP. This date is sometimes referred to as the “birth of the Internet,” although from a user’s perspective, the network still functioned the same way it had for years. In 1986, the NFSNET came online, running under TCP/IP and connected to the rest of the Internet. It also used a new standard, the Domain Name System (DNS). This system, still in use today, used easy-to-remember names to point to a machine’s individual IP address. Computer names were assigned “top-level” domains based on their purpose, so you could connect to “frodo.edu” at an educational institution, or “frodo.gov” at a governmental one. The NFSNET grew rapidly, dwarfing the ARPANET in size. In 1989, the original ARPANET was decommissioned. The IMPs, long since obsolete, were retired. However, all the ARPANET hosts were successfully migrated to other Internet networks. Like a Ship of Theseus, the ARPANET lived on even after every component of it was replaced. Still, the experts and pundits predicted that all of these systems would eventually have to transfer over to the OSI model. The people who had built the Internet were not impressed. In 1987, writingRFC No. 1,000, Crocker said, “If we had only consulted the ancient mystics, we would have seen immediately that seven layers were required.” The Internet pioneers felt they had spent many years refining and improving a working system. But now, OSI had arrived with a bunch of complicated standards and expected everyone to adopt their new design. Vint Cerf had a more pragmatic outlook. In 1982, he left ARPA for a new job at MCI, where he helped build the first commercial email system (MCI Mail) that was connected to the Internet. While at MCI, he contacted researchers at IBM, Digital, and Hewlett-Packard and convinced them to experiment with TCP/IP. Leadership at these companies still officially supported OSI, however. The debate raged on through the latter half of the 1980s and into the early 1990s. Tired of the endless arguments, Cerf contacted the head of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)and asked him to write a blue ribbon report comparing OSI and TCP/IP. Meanwhile, while planning a successor to IPv4, the Internet Advisory Board (IAB) was looking at the OSI Connectionless Network Protocol and its 128-bit addressing for inspiration. In an interview with Ars, Vint Cerf explained what happened next. “It was deliberately misunderstood by firebrands in the IETF [Internet Engineering Task Force] that we are traitors by adopting OSI,” he said. “They raised a gigantic hoo-hah. The IAB was deposed, and the authority in the system flipped. IAB used to be the decision makers, but the fight flips it, and IETF becomes the standard maker.” To calm everybody down, Cerf performed a striptease at a meeting of the IETF in 1992. He revealed a T-shirt that said “IP ON EVERYTHING.” At the same meeting, David Clark summarized the feelings of the IETF by saying, “We reject kings, presidents, and voting. We believe in rough consensus and running code.” The split design of TCP/IP, which was a small technical choice at the time, had long-lasting political implications. In 2001, David Clark and Marjory Blumenthal wrote apaperthat looked back on the Protocol War. They noted that the Internet’s complex functions were performed at the endpoints, while the network itself ran only the IP part and was concerned simply with moving data from place to place. These “end-to-end principles” formed the basis of “… the ‘Internet Philosophy’: freedom of action, user empowerment, end-user responsibility for actions undertaken, and lack of controls ‘in’ the Net that limit or regulate what users can do,” they said. In other words, the battle between TCP/IP and OSI wasn’t just about two competing sets of acronyms. On the one hand, you had a small group of computer scientists who had spent many years building a relatively open network and wanted to see it continue under their own benevolent guidance. On the other hand, you had a huge collective of powerful organizations that believedtheyshould be in charge of the future of the Internet—and maybe the behavior of everyone on it. But this impossible argument and the ultimate fate of the Internet was about to be decided, and not by governments, committees, or even the IETF. The world was changed forever by the actions of one man. He was a mild-mannered computer scientist, born in England and working for a physics research institute in Switzerland.

    "title": "Eli Roth Says Pandemic Problems Hurt Borderlands",
    "article_text": "TheÂBorderlandsÂmovie came out last year and was largely met withderision, thenindifference. What did the movie in? You’ll get a different answer depending on who you ask, but director Eli Roth thinks part of the issue waswhenÂ it was made. In case you forgot,ÂBorderlandsÂbegan filming in 2021 during the early days of the covid-19 pandemic. Speaking in a recent episode ofThe Townpodcast, Roth recalled how no oneâspecifically during that production, orHollywood overallâ”anticipated how complicated things were gonna be with covid.” Back then, things were so chaotic because distancing protocols meant “we couldn’t prep in a room together. I couldn’t be with my stunt people or do pre-vis, everyone’s spread all over the place.” “You have six people that are all on different sets and every one of those sets is getting shut down because the cities have opened up,” Roth continued. Making a big-budget movie at that size was a challenge, and a humbling one. (“I think we all thought we could pull it off and we got our asses handed to us a bit,” he admitted.) For Roth, things were further complicated by him filming his slasher movieThanksgivingin 2023, promptingDeadpooldirector Tim Miller to leadBorderlands‘reshootsin 2023. Said reshoots also containednew pagesfrom writer Zak Olkewicz, which built off the rewrites already done toCraig Mazin’s initial 2020 script. So by the time he’d moved ontoThanksgiving,Roth basically knew what was going withBorderlandsÂas much as we did. When he finally watched it, he noted how surreal it was to “sit down to watch my own movie that says I wrote and directed it, and I genuinely donât know whatâs going to happen.” None of this soured his relationship with Lionsgate, but it did teach him to stop taking the hits for something he was only half-involved with and prompted a return back to horror.

    "article_text": "Sometimes disruptions in movie theaters are spontaneous, like the current frenzy among audiences watchingA Minecraft Movie. Other times, they’re planned, as with the upcoming “second screen” experiencethat Blumhouse crafted with Meta’s helpfor a special “Halfway to Halloween” screening ofM3GAN.Â In the second example, at least, fans of the communal movie-going ritual that traditionally emphasizes leaving the world behind to focus on the big screen have a major movie chain in their corner. TheM3GANgimmick, which encourages audience members to use their phones to interact with the movie as it’s playing, goes in direct opposition to the Alamo Drafthouse’s long-standing “no phones” rule. In a news report fromVariety, the company will not be allowing access to the “Movie Mate”M3GANchatbot during screenings. If you try to light up your phone for pop-up trivia mid-screening, you’re risking being booted from the theater. So if you’re excited to revisitM3GANon the big screenâBlumhouse’s “Halfway to Halloween” revival series also includesAnnabelleandMa, neither of which come with a chatbot add-onâbut you don’t want to be interrupted by your neighbor’s flashing phone screen, Alamo Drafthouse seems the best bet. Truly, it’s getting dire out there with the etiquette of the movie theater experience getting ripped apart in order to potentially keep theaters going. I’m not sure if it would help if its turns people off from going unless now screenings add specific ones for “second screen” users alongside ones that strongly discourage phone use or talking.

    "article_text": "The Last of Usseason two premierehad story elements fans expectedâtension, trauma, a time jump, infected-adjacent horrors, etc.âbut it also featured the surprising sight of Joel (Pedro Pascal) getting some much-needed counseling from Gail, a therapist played by Catherine O’Hara. According to a new interview inVariety, co-showrunner Craig Mazin originally wanted to explore that idea in season one of the hit HBO series, but ultimately there wasn’t enough room to fit it in. When season two was being mapped out, he decided to bring it back. âIn all closed economies, certain things would be valued more than others,” Mazin explained. “Letâs say you were good at fixing shoesâvaluable. Letâs say you taught physicsâprobably not valuable anymore. What if you were a therapist?Extraordinarilyvaluable. Every single person has gone through a horror. There is no one who can say, âIâve actually had a great time.â I think that therapy is a fantastic mirror to say, not just, âOh, what are you really thinking?ââI think therapy is best when you find out what people are refusing to talk about.â That last bit propels Joel and Gail’s interactions; she’s mourning a great loss that she blames Joel for, even though she knows he had no choice in his actions. She brings it up as a way to draw him outâto get him to talk about the bloody choice he made to save Ellie (Bella Ramsey) at the end of season one. Their back-and-forth conversation is styled as “a shootout” of words, according to Mazin. “Iâve sat in enough therapy sessions to know how things can turn on a dime, from laughing to crying to anger, because things are being exposed. I loved writing it. I loved shooting it. I loved editing it,” Mazin said. “Itâs one of my favorite scenes so far among both seasons, in no small part, because I got to watch these two legends at the top of their game talk.” New episodes ofThe Last of Usarrive Sundays on HBO and Max.

    "title": "David Zaslav Wants a Friendlier Relationship With Trump, Was Told to Be More Like Jeff Bezos",
    "article_text": "David Zaslav is looking for friends. Well, one friend, specifically: the guy who currently holds all of the levers of power, including ones that could significantly impact his business, Warner Bros. Discovery.According to a profile from New York Magazine, the head of WBD knows that his industry is on shaky ground and he’s looking to cozy up to Donald Trump as a means of survival. Zaslav isn’t the first to have this idea. The tech billionaires likeMark Zuckerbergand Elon Musk have certainly managed to solidify their position through some shameless pandering, and it’sworked out pretty wellfor them (so far, at leastâwe’ll see if Zuck can leverage his friendship towriggle out of an antitrust lawsuit). But, per New York Magazine, a person in Trump’s orbit has a different tech god-king for Zaslav to model: Jeff Bezos. The parallel is pretty simple. Bezos has used his media arm to make nice with Trump, mostly by flattering his family and giving them a lot of moneyâincluding ponying up$40 million for a Melania Trump documentarythat she’ll serve as a producer on. Zaslav has basically nothing but airtime to offer, and Trump loves flattering coverage from the media. Suggestions provided to Zaslav,per NYMag, included a hunting and fishing show starring Donald Trump, Jr. (that’d be fascinating, given his penchant for allegedlyillegalandunethicalhunting tactics) and adding more pro-Trump voices to the WBD-owned CNN. Sucking up to Trump this way would likely come across as extremely transparent favor-trading, but what’s a CEO to do? Plus, Zaslav might have some business he’d probably like to fast-track through approval if he can. Last year, hetold Bloombergthat he was hoping the next president would bring a new attitude to mergers because “We just need an opportunity for deregulation, so companies can consolidate and do what we need to to be even better.” It’s not clear if WBD has any acquisition targets in mind at the moment, though it does seem he’s willing to do whatever he needs to keep the company going (except take a pay cut, seeing as hetook home $52 million last year). And if you want to do a media deal, you’ll definitely need Trump on your side. When Time Warner was going to sell to AT&T during Trump’s first term, hetried to step in to block it. And just last night, hecalledfor the FCC to fine and potentially pull the license of CBS over a “60 Minutes” segment he didn’t like.

    "title": "Trump’s New Plan for Acquiring Greenland Is UBI for Its Residents—on Americans’ Dime: Report",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump’s obsession with acquiring Greenland is ongoing, despite aggressive disinterest on the part of the territory’s inhabitants, or those of its parent country, Denmark. Indeed, the White House is reportedly considering some pretty creative tactics to sell Greenlanders on the deal, including paying them a regular annual stipendâon the U.S. taxpayer’s dime. The New York Timesreportedlast week that the White House has a plan that sounds strikingly similar to a universal basic income scheme, or UBI. Such a program would represent the “carrot” approach, rather than the “stick” (Trump has also suggesteda military invasion of Greenland, should Denmark refuse to sell). The newspaper reports that the Trump administration is: …studying financial incentives for Greenlanders, including the possibility of replacing the $600 million in subsidies that Denmark gives the island with an annual payment of about $10,000 per Greenlander. Some Trump officials believe those costs could be offset by new revenue from the extraction of Greenlandâs natural resources, which include rare earth minerals, copper, gold, uranium and oil. For decades, proponents of basic income have encouraged the government to adopt such a program as a means of easing economic stress for millions of people here in America. Now, it seems the Trump administration is actually considering creating such a programâalbeit for people living tens of thousands of miles away. The fact that the program would be funded with Americans’ money would presumably add insult to injury to the voters who thought Trump would shrink government spending, not add to it. Recent news suggests that the Greenland acquisition may not be all about extractingvaluable mineral depositsfrom its frozen tundra. Last week, ReutersreportedÂ that Ken Howery, a former “PayPal mafia” member and the Trump administrationâs pick for ambassador to Denmark, is officially involved in plans to use Greenland as a testbed for the development of so-called “freedom cities”ânewfangled communities where government oversight and regulation are negligible and corporate profits and “freedom” are the priority. It waspreviously reportedthat Howery, who is a longtime friend of billionaires Peter Thiel and Elon Musk (both of whom have expressed interest in such communities), was in the running for the Danish ambassadorship. Howery previously served as the U.S. ambassador to Sweden between 2019 and 2021. Despite being geographically huge, Greenland only has a population of some 57,000 people. To deranged libertarian billionaires, it must seem like the perfect location to trial their utopian fantasies. Citing sources who are aware of the administration’s plans for the territory, Reuters reports: The vision for Greenland, one of the people said, could include a hub for artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, space launches, micro nuclear reactors and high-speed rail. The discussions reflect a longstanding Silicon Valley movement to establish low-regulation cities globally, including in the United States, which Trump himself promised to do in aÂ 2023 campaign video. Proponents use different names for variations on the idea, including startup cities or charter cities, with the common goal of spurring innovation through sweeping regulatory exemptions. Additionally, Reuters reports that Howery is taking these discussions “seriously”: The discussions are in early stages, but the idea has been taken seriously by Trump’s pick for Denmark ambassador, Ken Howery, who is expected to be confirmed by Congress in the coming months and lead Greenland-acquisition negotiations, the people said. Howery, whose involvement with the idea hasn’t been previously reported, once co-founded a venture-capital firm with tech billionaire Peter Thiel, a leading advocate for such low-regulation cities. The pursuit of the “freedom city” dream has been fueled by a bizarre ideological movement known as the “Network State movement.” True believers of said movement want to build their ownprivately owned, cryptocurrency-powered citiesâthe likes of which are untouchable by traditional open and democratic government structures. This movement has been partially funded by Howery’s pal and fellow “mafia” gang member, Thiel. Indeed, the organizations behind the Network State movement have received considerable financial support from the billionaire, who also financially supported Trump during his first presidential run in 2016. In a statement to Reuters, Thiel’s spokesperson denied he was involved in “freedom city” plans: âPeter isnât involved in any plans or discussions regarding Greenland,” they said.

    "title": "This Unassuming Mushroom Packs the Bitterest Taste Ever Measured",
    "article_text": "Would you eat the forbidden fungi? Scientists have uncovered a mushroom-derived compound that seems to be the most bitter substance known on Earth. Researchers in Germany made the not-so-tasty find in a species of mushroom calledAmaropostia stipticaâalso aptly known as the bitter bracket fungus. The compound is one of three new bitter molecules discovered by studying the mushroom. The findings may help scientists better understand how animals like us evolved to detect bitterness, among other unanswered questions, the researchers say. Ourtaste budscan broadly pick out five distinctive types of taste, one of which is bitterness. Scientists have identifiedaround 2,400 different moleculesthat elicit a bitter taste, with over 800 linked to at least one specific taste receptor. According to the study researchers, however, this list is only a small sample of the many bitter-inducing things truly out there. Most of these compounds identified so far have come from flowering plants or are synthetically produced. And there’s simply a lot less we know about the bitter tastes that originate from the other branches of life, fungi included. So the researchers decided to take a closer look at the known but less studied bitter bracket fungus. ThoughA. stipticaisn’t toxic like some species of mushroom, it is practically inedible due to its bitterness. The researchers found that some of its taste can be explained by the previously known compounds oligoporins A and B, which are examples of triterpene glycosides. But they also discovered three new similar compounds, which they’ve coined oligoporins D through F. One of these compounds, oligoporin D, is so bitter that it can set off our bitter taste receptors (formally called TAS2Rs) at the incredibly low concentration of 63 millionths of a gram per liter, according to the researchers. To put it in plainer terms, this would be the equivalent of one gram dropped into roughly 100 bathtubs’ worth of water. Scientists at the Leibniz Institute for Food Systems Biology at the Technical University of Munich in Freising and at the Leibniz Institute of Plant Biochemistry in Halle made the discovery together. Their findings werepublishedearlier this February in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry. The researchers say their study is the first to subject mushroom-derived compounds toÂ functional bitter taste receptor screening. And what we learn from studyingA. stipticaand similar mushrooms could help us better understand the nature of bitterness. Bitterness is thought to be commonly used by living things to signal their toxicity to potential predators and avoid being eaten, for instance. But the bitter bracket fungus isn’t toxic to humans, and other very toxic fungal species like the deathcap mushroom taste quite fine. We also have bitter taste receptors in other parts of the body besides the mouth, but scientists still aren’t sure why. So discovering and studying these bitter compounds is an important part of the process needed to answer these and other burning questions, the researchers say. âOur results contribute to expanding our knowledge of the molecular diversity and mode of action of natural bitter compounds,â said study researcher Maik Behrens in astatementfrom the Leibniz Institute for Food Systems Biology. âIn the long term, insights in this area could enable new applications in food and health research, for example in the development of sensorially appealing foods that positively influence digestion and satiety.â Personally, I’m hoping scientists will one day explain why I hate olives so much.

    "title": "The Apple Watch Should Be Getting a Glassy Makeover Later This Year",
    "article_text": "Last year, Applerevampedthe Apple Watch with a thinner chassis and larger, brighter OLED display. This year, the software that powers the wearable, watchOS, could be getting a much bigger makeover. While plenty have been assuming this would happen given the relatively minor changes to the Apple Watch over the last few years, the rumors are starting to feel very real thanks toa new report from Bloomberg. The latest PowerOn newsletter, where we typically get a whopper of a factoid drop each week, focused on Apple readying a pair of headsets and more productivity features for iPadOS 19. But at the very bottom, in the questions and answers section, Gurman spills the latest details on the changes coming to watchOS later this year: The watch doesn’t currently have Apple Intelligence, and that isn’t exactly changing with the upcoming watchOS 12 software. But the company is branding a new set of features as “powered by Apple Intelligence” (even though the device isn’t actually running the AI models directly). As for design changes, the Apple Watch is destined to get some of the new interface elements here and there, but without a major overhaul. In other words, the watch will provide a smaller taste of the big shifts underway at Apple. The “smaller taste” of the “big shifts” that Gurman mentions in that last sentence likely references the new internally-named Solarium design that’s coming for the Apple ecosystem. For the unfamiliar, a solarium is a room with glass walls and a ceiling that allows natural light in for plants to grow and humans to recharge. It’s a popular fixture of brutalist balconies in post-Soviet states and fancy homes built into hillsides. In Apple’s case, Solarium refers to the glass-like appearance of the buttons and the rest of the interface,coming to iOS 19. It was mentioned in another edition of the sameBloombergnewsletter about two weeks ago. Your iPhone Home Screen Could Look Entirely Different Very Soon As for Apple Intelligence, it’s no surprise to hear that it won’t run on the Apple Watch any time soon. Apple isstill figuring outwhat is happeningwithApple Intelligenceon the iPhone. Also, more practically, AI is a heavy load on a smartwatch, especially running it locally, and with how far behind Apple is on Apple Intelligence, the Apple Watch is a secondary, maybe even tertiary, consideration over the rest of the ecosystem. The iPhone has to land it first. But it seems like the Watch could still be getting some AI touches. We’ve been fielding news about how the Apple Watch could utilize AI for a while. The Apple Watch is rumored tosomeday have a camera insideit to do some digital seeing aided byâwhat elseâartificial intelligence, which is almost believable if you considerthe yearsofpatent leakspreceding it. We also know from thesameBloombergpieceintroducing Solarium that Apple has plans for an “AI Doctor,” which would likely use the stats collected by one of Apple’s most powerful accessories, the Apple Watch. The company is reportedly investing in a facility where it will invite doctors and other health experts to make videos about related topics such as sleep, nutrition, and mental health. The idea is that when the Apple Health app sees your stats trending downwardâassuming it includes aggregate data from the Apple Watchâit can surface these videos and other content as part of what is being tentatively called “Health+” by those on the inside. For now, we know nothing. We only know the dreams and fantasies of glassed-over interfaces and floating menu items. There are only fan-made renders so far to get an idea of what’s to come. Honestly, it’s giving skeuomorphism re-dubbed. We will hopefully know more about what Solarium is and what it looks like on watchOS and everywhere else onceWWDC hits in June.

    "title": "Under RFK Jr., Insiders Worry America’s Health Agency Is a Cybersecurity Disaster Waiting to Happen",
    "article_text": "It’s only been a few months since RFK Jr. took office as head of the Department of Health and Human Services but, unless something changes drastically, he is shaping up to be one of the worst health leaders in the history of the agency. Under Kennedy’s watch, the HHShas fired thousands of staff, including researchers and scientists from the CDC, the FDA, and other key health and science agencies that do critical research and protect Americans’ health. At the same time, massive funding cuts have threatenedstate and local health programsthat rely on government money to operate. Last week, Kennedy claimedhe was “not familiar”with many of the cuts that have gone through. Now, a new report claims that the government is also in the midst of purging itself of its IT and cybersecurity teamsâa move that leaves countless terabytes of sensitive health and science data at risk of online exposure, critics claim. Wiredwrites that,under Kennedy, the HHS has become a massive data breach waiting to happen. Major cuts that impact units like the Computer Security Incident Response Centerâa team tasked with protecting the agency’s various departments from cyberattacksâhave resulted in a situation that government insiders describe as a “looming catastrophe.” The problem is that a large amount of administrative staff who are tasked with filling slots for mission-critical IT and cybersecurity roles have been let go, leaving many of those programs in limbo. The magazine notes that “staff who oversee and renew contracts for critical enterprise services are no longer there.” Those missing staff are responsible for overseeing “hundreds of contractors, some of whom play a crucial role in keeping systems and data safe from cyberattacks.” In particular, the HHS is waiting for the renewal of contracts for “hundreds of specialized contractors who perform critical tasks for the department, including a dozen cybersecurity contractors who work at the Computer Security Incident Response Center (CSIRC)âthe primary component of the departmentâs overall cybersecurity program which is overseen by the chief information security officer,” the magazine writes. That is really bad news since the HHS is tasked with maintaining thousands of incredibly sensitive records, including the health records of hundreds of millions of Americans and clinical trial data. That data could be subject to online attacks if the cybersecurity protections around it falter, sources interviewed by the magazine said. âPretty soon, within the next couple of weeks, everything regarding IT and cyber at the department will start to operationally reach a point of no return,â one source, who was recently let go, told the magazine. Some of the blame has also been placed on the new agency’s new chief information officer, Clark Minor. Previously alongtime Palantir employee, Minor took over as CIO at the HHS in February. Wired’s report quotes anonymous staff who said that Minor seemed “overwhelmed” by the position, and that, as of yet, he has not provided any “guidance to the remaining HHS staff” on the current situation. Gizmodo reached out to the HHS for comment. In a statement provided to Wired, an HHS spokesperson said: âThe suggestion that critical IT and cybersecurity functions at HHS are being left unsecured is simply untrue. Essential operations at HHS, including contract management and cybersecurity oversightâremain staffed and functional. Itâs unfortunate that some former employees are spreading unfounded rumors. HHS remains committed to a secure, modernized HHS that serves the American people, not internal bureaucracy.â Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Researchers Develop a Soft Battery That Has the Consistency of Toothpaste",
    "article_text": "From our cell phones to our smartwatches and laptops, we’re surrounded by battery-powered devices. Today, batteries are solid, voluminous components of our technologyâbut what if they could be malleable, flexible, and even printable? Embracing this idea, researchers in Sweden have developed a fluid battery that can be shaped into different forms. As detailed in astudypublished April 11 in the journal Science, the battery makes use of electrodesâkey conductive materials in batteriesâin fluid form. The novel soft structure paves the way for innovative designs of future battery-powered technology. “Batteries are the largest component of all electronics. Today they are solid and quite bulky. But with a soft and conformable battery, there are no design limitations. It can be integrated into electronics in a completely different way and adapted to the user,â Aiman Rahmanudin, a co-author of the study, said in a universitystatement. “The texture is a bit like toothpaste. The material can, for instance, be used in a 3D printer to shape the battery as you please.” According to the statement, previous attempts to achieve soft, stretchable batteries relied on mechanical features like sliding connections or required rare materials that are environmentally harmful to process. The key to Rahmanudin and his colleagues’ success was converting electrodes into a liquid form. To understand the significance of this achievement, it’s important to remember how batteries actually work.Â Simply put, anelectrochemical batteryconsists of two different metals, or electrodes: an anode and a cathode. A chemical reaction causeselectrons to flowfrom the anode to the cathodeâa process we call electricityâwhich can do work as it moves, like powering a lightbulb or a device.Â Larger batteries have greater electrical capacity, but also thickerâand hence more rigidâelectrodes. âWeâre the first to show that capacity is independent of rigidity,â said Rahmanudin, who is also a research leader at LinkÃ¶ping University’s Soft Electronics Group at the Laboratory of Organic Electronics. Prior attempts at developing fluid electrodesrelied on liquid metals that sometimes solidified, according to the statement. To bypass these issues, the team used plastics capable of conducting electricityâcalled conjugated polymersâand lignin, a waste product in paper production. The resulting battery can be recharged over 500 times, even when stretched to twice its original length. Furthermore, âsince the materials in the battery are conjugated polymers and lignin, the raw materials are abundant. By repurposing a byproduct like lignin into a high value commodity such as a battery material we contribute to a more circular model. So, itâs a sustainable alternative,â says Mohsen Mohammadi, a lead author of the study and postdoctoral fellow at LinkÃ¶ping University’s Laboratory of Organic Electronics. Moving forward, the team hopes to improve the battery’s electrical voltage. “We have shown that the concept works but the performance needs to be improved. The voltage is currently 0.9 volts,” Rahmanudin explained. For comparison,standard AA batteriesare between 1.2 and 1.5 volts, andmost smartphonesoperate at between 3.7 and 4.2 volts. “So now weâll look at using other chemical compounds to increase the voltage.” By quite literally breaking the mold, the study opens the door to a whole new realm of design possibilities for battery-powered devices. batteriesEnergy Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "The Director of ‘USS Callister: Into Infinity’ Says a Black Mirror Trilogy Could Happen",
    "article_text": "As soon as we streamed “USS Callister: Into Infinity” in the just-released new season ofBlack Mirror, we wonderedwhen the next installment would be coming. The Netflix series’ first sequel episode isa highlightof season season, and creator Charlie Brookerâwhohad long wantedto continue the “Callister” story after the 2017 original episodeâhas said he’d be open to doing more sequels. Or maybe…Black Mirror‘s first three-quel? More hopeful crumbs for fans: director Toby Haynes, who helmed both “Callister” entries, isn’t ruling out another return to the “Callister” world. As Brooker has said, the idea of a “Callister” spin-off series was floated until it was decided to make it part ofBlack Mirror‘s seventh season. And like the original episode, it’s an extra-long entry; “Into Infinity” runs just under 90 minutes. “One film is a sequel. Itâs not a series, and it kind of elevates the whole thing into the perfect format for a sci-fi adventure,” Haynes toldthe Hollywood Reporter. “We could be making our own, Iâd like to say, iconic sci-fi trilogy within theBlack Mirrorworld. And what could be better? Itâs so exciting. If we do another one! Iâd like to make good on the trilogy.” He continued. “This was our chance to doEmpire Strikes BackÂ orÂAliensÂ or evenÂTerminator 2. If we were going to come back, how do we upgrade? There are so many sequels that miss the mark in sci-fi, but there are a few that really hit the mark. How do we be the ones that really justify a sequel by making it bigger, better, more exciting, funnier, more emotional, upgrade the effects. Everything was a huge amount of pressure to try to deliver something special.” Head toTHRto read the full interview with Haynes, which digs more into why the series was scrapped, as well as the production of “Into Infinity” (with spoilers, so be careful if you haven’t watched yet). He also talks about his forays into both the realms ofStar Wars(he directed several episodes ofAndorseason one) andStar Trek(he’s actively involved in a prequel project).

    "title": "Redwood Materials Will Recycle Lime’s Batteries as China Withholds Key Metals",
    "article_text": "Lime ispartneringwith Redwood Materials to recycle batteries from its fleet of shared electric bikes and scooters. Redwood was founded in 2007 by JB Straubel, a co-founder of Tesla and close confidant to CEO Elon Musk, with an aim to address the anticipated soaring demand for materials needed to produce electric car batteries. As part of the deal, Lime will send batteries that have reached their end of life to Redwood’s facilities in Nevada, where it will determine how much of the batteryâfrom cabling to plastics and metalsâis reusable. The batteries in its bikes and scooters typically last five to seven years or 500 charge cycles, according to Lime. Though the shared mobility space is agraveyard of failed companies, Lime managed to survive and now operates the world’s largest fleet of shared micromobility vehicles with more than 270,000 vehicles across 30 countries. Many companies in the space failed because the scooters fell apart quickly, and hiring a fleet of gig workers to collect and charge the vehicles was costly. Lime is rumored to beheading for an IPOafter posting 30% growth in bookings for 2024. For Lime, the deal with Redwood makes a lot of sense. Companies in the space for years marketed themselves as a more efficient and environmentally friendly mode of transportation than others like private passenger vehicles. But those claims were somewhat undermined by pictures spread online of scooters littering streets and winding up in rivers. Lime says it agreed to a deal because it was impressed by Redwood’s high recovery rate. The company says that once batteries are stripped apart for relevant elements, they are then used to produce new “high quality” batteries that can be integrated into everything from cars to phones. Because these new batteries are of higher quality, they in turn can be recovered and returned to the supply chain 95-98% of the time, Redwood claims. Batteries often represent the biggest cost in an electric vehicleâsome reports suggest they account forupwards of 40%of the purchased priceâand the materials are typically sourced from countries including China, which is the world’s largest source of rare earth metals used in electric vehicles. Over the weekend, China announced it wouldrestrict export of certain rare earth metalsin retaliation to President Trump’s 125% tariff on most of the country’s exports. If the U.S. wants to reduce dependence on adversaries for products crucial to national security, being able to recycle metals and expand their usable lifespan is a start. President Trump has sought to increase the mining of minerals in the United States (and pressured Ukraine tohand over mining rightswithin its borders to pay back war costs), but doing so is expected to take many years, and some key elements are not found in large deposits within the United States. If the U.S. is only able to source metals from areas with smaller deposits, being able to recycle everything could alleviate shortages. Redwood claims that in 2024, it managed to recycle enough material from old cars, scooters, and other products to produce quite a few EV batteries. âWe recycled 20 gigawatt-hours worth of material just in 2024,â a spokesperson toldThe Verge. âThatâs enough to produce another 250,000 EVs. And that was spread across production scrap from the gigafactories to small consumer electronic devices, medium formats like these bikes and scooters, and then large-form EV packs and stationary storage.â Household recycling of materials like plastic has never quite worked out the way it was hoped because virgin plastic is incredibly cheap, and recycling plastic is difficult and complicated. Consumers might say they care about buying products that use recycled material, but at the end of the day, they are price-conscious at the store and will choose the best value for their dollar. Electric vehicles are quite a bit more expensive and the value of the metals contained within an EV battery couldoffset the cost of the recycling process. Besides addressing the crucial need for rare earth metals, that would also help address critics who say the batteries inside electric cars undermine their environmental sustainability (studies have found EVs still producematerially less lifetime emissionsthan combustion engine cars, even when accounting for mineral extraction). batteriesElectric VehiclesRecyclingTESLA Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "A Double Sunblast Could Mean Auroras Over the U.S. This Week",
    "article_text": "According to the experts atNOAAâs Space Weather Prediction Center, two coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are en route to Earth, and they could be bringing a glowing gift: a potential auroral display reaching farther south than usualâpossibly lighting up skies over parts of the northern U.S., like New York and Idaho. This space weather alert is tied to a rare solar double feature: two magnetic filament eruptions that launched CMEs from the Sun over the weekend. If both CMEs arrive on Earth close together, as forecast, we could be looking at G2-class (moderate) geomagnetic storm conditions on Wednesday. The Sun undergoes an 11-year cycle during which its magnetic field flips direction, triggering changes on its surface. This cycle leads to the formation of sunspotsâregions on the solar surface where magnetic field lines are especially intense. These sunspots often become hotspots for powerful solar activity, like flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). When these energetic outbursts send charged particles toward Earth, they can disrupt radio signals, affect power grids, and create stunning auroras as the particles collide with Earthâs atmosphere. According to the NOAA bulletin, the two CMEs that left the Sun on April 13 are expected to reach our planet’s outer atmosphere on April 16, with effects from the blasts lasting through April 17. Shawn Dahl, a service coordinator for the Space Weather Prediction Center,told Gizmodolast year that: âBottom line is, weâre going to be under the influence of increased activity all of this year, all of next year, and even in 2026 where weâll continue to have higher chances this type of activity to continue to happen from time to time over the remainder of this solar cycle maximum that weâre experiencing.” In other words, more geomagnetic storms can be expected as the Sun goes through its cycle. With rare exceptionâlook at the Carrington Event of 1859âthe events wonât disrupt your daily life. But if we’re lucky, we could catch a brilliant glimpse of how our Sun generates natural light shows high in our planet’s skies. aurora borealiscmesSolar flaresthe Sun Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

The rare event revealed never-before-seen behaviors of a planetary atmosphere. The ESA/NASA Solar Orbiter's instruments captured an extreme stream of wind from our host star. Captured by Webb, it's the first direct evidence of auroras on the most distant planet from the Sun. NASA's flagship space telescope captured flares from the disk of superheated material around the black hole, revealing the dynamicâand explosiveâphysics at our galaxy's core. The jets were first discovered in 2023, and new evidence reveals they drive both fast and slow solar wind. Flickering coronal loops in the Sun's outer atmosphere could act as an early warning system for solar flares, according to new research.

    "title": "Donkey Kong Bananza Made Me Want to Buy a Nintendo Switch 2",
    "article_text": "I’ve never owned a Sega. From a very early age,I’ve just always been been a Nintendo fan. I had the NES. I had the Super Nintendo. And starting with Nintendo 64 back in 1996, I began buying each new console right after it launched. Buying those consoles was never about having the latest, greatest video game system, though. It was about the games. Specifically, thefirst-party Nintendo gamesavailable at launch and soon thereafter.Mario,Zelda,Metroidâthese areamong my favorite thingsin the entire world. So if there is a promise of new games in those franchises coming out, and I need to buy a new system to play them, that’s what I’ll do. So, when Nintendo Switch 2 wasfinally made officiala few weeks back, I was a little let down.Metroid Prime 4, which was first announced in 2017, was coming but didn’t have a release date.A newMario Kartgame was exciting, but I’ve always been more of a MariosansKart guy. And then there was thisDonkey Konggame,Bananza, that sort of looked like aMariogame, but with Donkey Kong. Each one was intriguing, but nothing screamed to me, “Get a Switch 2 asap.” So when Nintendo reached out about attending a demo event, that was my goal. Play some games and decide if any of them were worth the hassle of once again trying to get a system at launch. (Plus, my colleagues on the tech side already didso muchgreat coverageabout everyother little thingSwitch-related. Clickall those links.) So did any of the games make it seem worth it? Yes, of course. The headline already spoiled the answer.Donkey Kong Bananzais, from the 20 minutes we played on the first two levels, a potential classic. It’s the new, open world (inside a level)Mariogame I’ve been waiting years for. It just happens to star Donkey Kong which, it turns out, makes things even more exciting. That’s because not only are you fully able to explore each level however you want, Donkey Kong smashes everything. And I do meaneverything. See a wall? Smash it and see how deep it goes. Standing on the ground? Not anymore. Smash it and see how far down it goes. You can grab rocks out of the side of a mountain and throw them. Climb walls and smash while you do that. And these mechanics mean that every level is exponentially bigger than what it looks like on the surface because you can also explore inside and under all of it. Basically, in the 20 minutes I played I barely got beyond the first few platforms because I was having so much fun breaking shit. With each new piece of destruction, new rooms or items would emerge. It made me feel like the possibilities were endless and, when I had to stop playing, I knew I was sold. I’d be buying a Switch 2 ASAP to play this game from beginning to end. Of course,Donkey Kong Bananzawill not be available when Switch 2 is released June 5. It comes out a month later, on July 17. The same goes forMetroid Prime 4: Beyond, which was playable at the event, but still doesn’t have a release date. Thankfully, whenever that date is, I’ll be grabbing it immediately. The game puts you back behind the visor of Samus Aran as you blast away bad guys, roll around as a ball, and pump missiles into metroids. We played the first 10 minutes or so of the game and it was like visiting an old friend. Nothing too surprising but just plain great. Which I can also say aboutMario Kart World. This was the big showcase at the event since it’s the only official launch title, and thoughMario Kartisn’t my favoriteMariofranchise, I’ve been known to drift boost from time to time. And that’s back with so much more inWorld. The game is massive, and that goes for the tracks you drive through as well as the vast variety of characters, karts, outfits, and power-ups available. Things then get taken up another notch in knockout mode, as you race to stay above a certain place in the race as the number of races dwindles with each lap. It’s very intense and very fun. The best part, though, was the free roam. InMario Kart World, you don’t have to race, you can just drive around and this to me felt like an old schoolMariogame. There are power-ups to be found, new and different terrains to explore, and even super cool jumps to do if you just drive around off track. I especially liked just turning around and going backwards to see what else was happening in the world. LikeMetroid, I foundMario Kart Worldto be exactly what I was expecting. An awesomeMario Kartgame with a bunch of new bells and whistles. Nothing groundbreaking, but super cool and fun nonetheless. By this point, I was sold. A Switch 2 will be mine. But then, just to add to it, I had to play the sequel to another one of my favorite games:Hades II.This, of course, has been available on PC for a while but has yet to make an official console port.That’ll happen with Switch 2at some point, and after dying twice on my latest quest, I put the controller down. I wanted to keep going. Wanted to beat the game 100 times like I did the original. But I had to restrain myself and say, “I’ll do this later.” There were other games at the event too, but these were the ones I most wanted to dive into. I’m glad I did. Each game left me more and more convinced that the Switch 2 may sound like a sequel, but its games will make it a star. The Nintendo Switch 2 will be out June 5. Want more io9 news?

She’s played in the show byKaitlyn Dever(No One Will Save You, Booksmart, Dopesick), who despite being just 28 has over a decade of credits to her nameâbut she’s never played a character as notorious as Abby, something she was well aware of when she took the role. No spoilers as to why Abby’s spoken of in such hushed terms amongThe Last of Usgame fansâthe TV show will catch up soon enough, presumably. But if you watched the season premiere, you know that this is a young woman with one of the oldest motivations in storytelling: revenge. âThe way into Abby is knowing how grief feels and how loss affects you, especially in the immediate aftermath,” Dever toldthe Hollywood Reporterin a new interview. “Thereâs just this shock and this desire to make it all go away.” Calling the character “a chilly ice queen,” Dever also noted there’s a vulnerability lurking beneath Abby’s urge for violence. “She just needs something to make it all better … the only thing she can think about is revenge. Sheâs heartbroken, sheâs sad, sheâs lost and sheâs trying to pick up the pieces.” However, she also knew a big part of nailing Abby was nailing her commanding presence: “When she walks into a room, she comes through with this intense strength.

    "title": "Sick of Pesky IP Laws Slowing AI Growth, Tech Titans Think Everything Should be Public Now",
    "article_text": "If you live in the European Union, your posts on Meta platforms will now help to feed its extremely hungry AI models. In ablog posttitled “Making AI Work Harder for Europeans” (please hold your eye roll), the company announced that it will start to use public-facing interactions across its platforms like Facebook and Instagram to train large language models, in the latest of Big Tech players declaring that your content should belong to them. According to the post, posts and comments made by adult users will be fed into the machine, as will questions and queries that people submit in interactions with Meta AI. According to Meta, scraping all these interactions and using them as training data “will better support millions of people and businesses in the EU by teaching AI at Meta to better understand and reflect their cultures, languages and history.” Just as a quick aside: we have anthropologists and ethnographers, and linguists who specialize not only in preserving culture, language, and history but also help to contextualize it so we understand why something mattersâsomething that AI can’t do because it doesn’t understand what you are feeding it. But sure, we can pour all of our posts into these black boxes and assume that what it’s spitting back is a true and accurate replicationdespite its tendency to hallucinateno matter how good the data isâall while funding for actual preservation work evaporates. Anyway. Starting next week, Meta will send notifications to EU users that their posts may be used to train AI. The notifications will include a link to a form where users can object to their data being used for these purposes. The company also reiterated that it will not use private messages to train AI. Meta’s decision to put posts through the content grinder and turn it into LLM feed is just the latest example of AI Big Tech players putting their finger on the scale to say your content is not yours. Over the weekend, Block CEO and Twitter founder Jack Dorsey posted “delete all IP law“âa comment that Elon Muskreplied to in agreement. It’s hard not to read that statement in the context of the ongoing lawsuits between AI companies and IP and copyright holders who are trying to keep their information out of training models (at least without getting paid for it). And, indeed, Dorsey basically confirmed it was at least partially on his mind in the replies, in which he took on several people who pointed out that IP helps protect the work of creators from getting swallowed by AI without compensation. Dorseyinsisted“there are much greater models to pay creators” and “all people should have 100% agency over their data and permission in/out services that want to use it,” which heclaimedwas “a very simple model to build and enforce.” Seems like maybe he should build that, then! Both Musk and Dorsey, of course, have used IP law to protect their own projects. Dorseyinsistedthat it’s just defense against trolls and not something he believes inâand look, there is no question that the current IP system has problems and is abused by big players. And Musk haspledgedthat Tesla won’t go after companies who want to use its technology in good faithâthough it didsue a companyfor infringing on the company’s battery patents, but hey, good faith is in the eye of the patent holder. It just seems mighty convenient that two guysheavily investedin AI suddenly seem to think the system that they used to protect and build their own empires is no longer needed now that it restricts their access to the lifeblood of AI training.

    "title": "Visitors to U.S. Take Extreme Precautions as Trump Continues March of Fascism",
    "article_text": "The European Commission has started issuing burner phones and stripped-down laptops to staff visiting the U.S. over concerns that the treatment of visitors to the country has become a security risk, according to a new report from theFinancial Times. And it’s just the latest news that America’s slide into fascism under Donald Trump is having severe consequences for the United States’ standing in the world, all while the president announced Monday that he has no plans to obey a U.S. Supreme Court order to bring back a man wrongly sent to a prison in El Salvador. Officials who spoke with the Financial Times said that new guidance for EU staff traveling to the U.S. included recommendations they not carry personal phones, turn off their burner phones when entering the country, and have “special sleeves” (presumably Faraday cages), that can protect from electronic snooping. U.S. border agents often confiscate phones and claim the right to look through anyone’s personal devices before they can be allowed to enter the U.S. There have been several reports of researchers denied access to the U.S., including a French scientist who was reportedly stoppedlast monthfor having text messages that were critical of Trump. Other travelers from countries like Australia and Canada have reported being detained in horrendous conditions. President Trump has been in office for less than three months but has already managed to alienate all of America’s closest allies. Sometimes that alienation has come in the form of threats to invade sovereign territory, like in Canada, Greenland, and Panama. Other times, it’s more of a blanket “fuck you” to America’s geopolitical allies with threats of tariffs. And at the border, horror stories emerge daily of people trying to enter the U.S. and being abused in ways they hadn’t been before Trump took power again in January. All of that turmoil and uncertainty has forced people who previously would’ve welcomed a trip to the U.S. into rethinking their plans. Many researchers in Australia have decided it’s no longer smart to travel to the U.S., given the rise of fascism that could endanger their own health and well-being. The Society for Social Studies of Science decided to turn its own conference into a hybrid in-person and remote event, according to theGuardian, given the threat Trump poses to personal liberty. People are being monitored for their disabilities at the U.S. border, according to the Guardian, and border agents are checking medications, ostensibly to see if they match a given disability. The way that Trump and Elon Musk are currently destroying the U.S. government is also playing into the calculations foreign researchers are making about their interactions with Americans. Countless research grants have been canceled, making a trip to the U.S. unnecessary even for people who may be willing to risk traveling to the country. Even researchers with strong ties to the U.S. are opting to look to other countries for jobs, asReutersreports, because work is simply drying up. There are also reports of people outside the U.S. deciding to look elsewhere for vacation opportunities, as the number of flights to the U.S. from places like Europe and Canada plummet. And theWall Street Journalhas a new report about Canadians who are selling their vacation homes in the U.S. as they become “scared of what might happen.” The U.S. is also trying to deport people in a white nationalist scheme to purge the country of any dissent. Several international students have been kidnapped by masked secret police in recent weeks, including people like Mahmoud Khalil and Rumeysa Ozturk, pro-Palestine protesters who are currently sitting in ICE detention facilities. Ozturk’s only “crime” was writing an op-ed for her student newspaper opposing Israel’s war on Gaza and she was picked up off the street near her home outside Boston and flown to Louisiana. The Trump regime has said it locked up Ozturk and is preparing to deport her for “antisemitism,” and supporting Hamas, but the Washington Post reported Sunday that the State Department’s investigation found she didno such thing. Trump appeared for apress availabilityin the White House with El Salvador’s president Nayib Bukele on Monday, where he made it clear that he’s going tocontinue shippingpeople who’ve committed no crime out of the country to El Salvador’s torture prisons. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled last week that the U.S. government needs to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who Trump falsely accuses of being a member of the MS-13 gang, but the U.S. president made it clear he has no plans to bring Garcia back. Trump insisted that he couldn’t tell Bukele what to do by asking him to return Garcia from the CECOT prison in El Salvador, and Bukele was asked directly whether he would do that. Bukele falsely accused Garcia of being a “terrorist” and said he wouldn’t return the innocent man. COLLINS: Can President Bukele weigh in on this? Do you plan to return Garcia? BUKELE: How can I smuggle a terrorist into the United States? Of course I’m not going to do it. The question is preposterous TRUMP: These are sick people [image or embed] â Aaron Rupar (@atrupar.com)April 14, 2025 at 9:02 AM Trump also said Monday that he’d like to deport American citizens toEl Salvador, insisting that he actually wants Bukele to buildfive more prisonswhere the U.S. could disappear more people. The U.S. is in an extremely dangerous place as a country, given the history of how fascist leaders often progress. American citizens face being disappeared for advocating on issues that were previously considered protected speech under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. And visitors to the U.S. have even fewer rights than Americans. It makes a lot of sense that people with any choice in the matter would avoid traveling to the U.S., given its decline. And with all of the guardrails that were keeping Trump in check during his first term now long gone, it’s going to be a very difficult situation in the days, weeks, months, and years ahead. Many people need to travel to the U.S. for work or family obligations. But it seems anyone who can help it should steer clear of the country for the foreseeable future.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. 2023'sLunacidis one of my favorite indies, dungeon crawlers, and just games, period of the last few years. It's a first person RPG taking afterFromSoftware's King's Field series, set in an unforgettable subterranean world festooned with secrets. Creator Kira LLC has just released their next project, a follow-up to Lunacid, but there are more than a few twists to it. Lunacid: Tears of the Moonis a prequel set thousands of years before the main game, and it was made with appropriately primeval tools:Sword of Moonlight, a game making toolset based on King's Field, released by FromSoft in 2000, and maintained by a dedicated community ever since. It allowed for a small but noteworthycatalogue of user-made dungeon crawlersin King's Field's distinctive style to accumulate over the years, a scene that reminds me of theThief fan mission communityor the huge collection ofcustom Neverwinter Nights campaigns. Tears of the Moon is also completely free, even though the permissive EULA for Sword of Moonlight does seem to allow for commercial works. You can just grab Tears of the Moon offSteam, with only a separate download of the game's soundtrack costing four bucks. Pre-launch, I thought Tears of the Moon looked sick, and I loved the concept of returning to the actual King's Field engine in a series inspired by those games in the first place, but I wondered if it might wind up feeling toocrusty. You know what I mean: The weirdness, clunkiness, and opacity of an older game that just leads you to bounce off sometimes, no matter how good it allegedly is. It's certainly got jank: Keyboard only controls with no mouse look, borked in-game controller support that demands going through Steam input to set up a pad, and a game over screen that boots you back to the desktop each time you die. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. But I'll be damned if that just didn't matter to me: I'm loving this game, and I would have been fine spending money on it. Tears of the Moon has that truly wonderful, isolating quality of sparse, atmospheric, exploration-heavy first person games like Thief, System Shock, or Metroid Prime. After an hour of exploring its hub area and twisty first dungeon, all I've thought about is getting back in for more. The combat has that same acquired taste crappiness (that I do happen to love) of so many older first person games centered on melee combat. You're always doing the Ultima Underworld/Elder Scrolls Shuffle: Bop enemies at close range and either back away or circle strafe to avoid their counterattacks, here with no blocking, dodging, parrying, or alternate attacks to speak of. But I find that simple loop provides a nice, meditative task to break up the exploration, and the combined simplicity of both the combat and the character building⁠—your stats just increase automatically on level-up, no \"oh god am I building my guy wrong\" old RPG anxiety⁠—means Tears of the Moon is not as challenging as I might have feared. It's actually pretty forgiving: Landing melee attacks slowly regenerates your mana to fire off big damage spells or heal yourself, and traveling back to home base fully heals you. The biggest difficulty is how it withholds knowledge, particularly if you lack hands-on experience with the original King's Fields. In lieu of a tutorial, Tears of the Moon has a classic-style manual in .pdf form, and you likely will need to reference it at least once. 2025 games: Upcoming releasesBest PC games: All-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together After a brief, narrated intro, the opening of the game is cold and abrupt in a way that reminded me of the original Legend of Zelda: There are five shards of a legendary sword and a poison mist ring out in this strange world, go find them. That's not necessarily a bad thing⁠—I quite like the sense of mystery and discovery it lends Tears of the Moon. I have had one, wonderful moment of old-school trolling so far: I thought I was real clever for noticing a secret door hidden in the starting zone, and it contained a treasure chest to boot. Naturally, it turned into a super tanky skeleton capable of two-shotting me when I tried to open it. Leveling and gearing up enough to handily take him on was the perfect full-circle triumph to end my first play session on. I think what I've learned is that it's about time I gave the OG King's Field games a proper go, since they inspired so many games I love and seem much more approachable than I assumed. Until that point, Tears of the Moon has me plenty satisfied on the dungeon crawling front. Lunacid proper is definitely still the best starting point for a total newcomer to the series, but this substantial little free RPG is probably the most pleasant surprise I've had so far this year.

    "title": "'Oh god': There's a buried Steam help page that shows how much money you've ever spent on the platform, and you may not want to know",
    "article_text": "Our champion Steam spender has dropped a new car's worth of cash into Gabe's yacht fund. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. There's a web tool thatestimates the value of your Steam accountby looking at all the games you own, but it can't tell you how precisely much you've actually spent on Valve's wallet-plundering platform, microtransactions and all. That potentially startling number is buried in Steam's help menus. The relevant Steam help page waspointed out recently on Reddit by user trotski94. You can find it in the Steam client by navigating to:Help > Steam support > My account > Data related to your Steam account > External funds used. Once we'd been clued in to this feature, we of course all went off and looked at our own totals, some of us with Steam accounts that date back to the debut of the Source engine. Our lifetime Steam receipts ranged from a few hundred dollars to, and this was an outlier, over $16,000 at the top. (\"Oh god,\" said the owner of that account before sharing his number.) Most of our totals fell somewhere between $2K and $10K, and our $16,000 team leader is a small fry next to the truly big spenders. Aposter in that Reddit threadshared a total over $26,000, and there'll be people who've put far more than that into Counter-Strike skins alone. (Last year,a Counter-Strike streamer estimatedthat the person who currently has the highest Steam account level spent $500,000 to get there.) My total is in the thousands, but the number itself doesn't communicate the real shame of it, which is how much of that total was spent opening Rocket League loot boxes before they were retired. If you want that kind of detail, you can get your entire Steam purchase history here:Help > Steam support > My account > Data related to your Steam account > Purchase history. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. PC gaming isn't the cheapest activity in the world (especially when you factor in hardware), but despite our appalled reactions to our own spending histories, I don't think any of us areactuallyregretting our relatively small contributions to Gabe Newell's yacht fund. Add up any category of non-essential spending over a long enough period of time and you'll always get a number that gives you a jolt. I guarantee I've spent more money on Red Bulls than on videogames in my lifetime. I think we're just staggered by our own numbers because we're imagining what it would be like to suddenly receive that sum of money, and it would always be good to suddenly have more money. But it's harder to imagine a hypothetical version of yourself who has never spent any money on PC gaming, and there's no reason to believe they'd be more financially secure than you. Maybe they blew that money at the horse track, who knows? And when you consider your total playtime, games usually turn out to be pretty cost efficient as far as entertainment goes. There have been long periods when I didn't watch anything on Netflix while stupidly paying for a monthly subscription anyway, and I'd really rather not know whatthatcost-per-minute calculation comes to—I could've spent $20 per Squid Game episode for all I know.

    "article_text": "Is it, though? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Nvidia says it's joining with \"leading manufacturing partners\" to design and build factories that will enable it to build and test NvidiaBlackwellchip and AI supercomputers entirely in the US for the first time ever, an initiative it says will produce up to $500 billion in \"AI infrastructure.\" \"Nvidia Blackwell chips have started production at TSMC’s chip plants in Phoenix, Arizona,\" the company said in today'sannouncement. \"Nvidia is building supercomputer manufacturing plants in Texas, with Foxconn in Houston and with Wistron in Dallas. Mass production at both plants is expected to ramp up in the next 12-15 months. \"The AI chip and supercomputer supply chain is complex and demands the most advanced manufacturing, packaging, assembly and test technologies. Nvidia is partnering with Amkor and SPIL for packaging and testing operations in Arizona.\" Nvidia said its AI supercomputers \"are the engines of a new type of data center created for the sole purpose of processing artificial intelligence,\" and regardless of what AI ultimately delivers there's no question it's the thing of the moment and Nvidia clearly has high hopes for its made-in-America plan: The company said manufacturing all these chips and supercomputers \"is expected to create hundreds of thousands of jobs and drive trillions of dollars in economic security over the coming decades.\" “The engines of the world’s AI infrastructure are being built in the United States for the first time,” Huang said in the statement. \"Adding American manufacturing helps us better meet the incredible and growing demand for AI chips and supercomputers, strengthens our supply chain and boosts our resiliency.\" The Trump administration was quick to take credit for Nvidia's announcement, calling it \"the Trump Effect in action.\" But others have said the move is not the result of current policies but rather theCHIPS Act, signed into law in 2022 during the Biden administration: TSMC, one of the manufacturing partners named in the Nvidia announcement, receivednearly $12 billionin direct funding and loans as a result of the CHIPS Act. Ironically, Trump has previously expressed a desire to kill the act, calling it a \"horrible, horrible thing\" in March and saying the same results could be achieved through the imposition of tariffs. Nvidia's announcement comes amidst the chaos of US president Donald Trump's on-again, off-again tariffs against the rest of the world, primarily China: On Friday, the Trump administration exempted phones and computer hardware from the massive 145% tariffs being applied to goods made in China, but by Sunday Trump said there wasno exemption, and that those products are simply \"moving to a different tariff 'bucket',\" which may or may not be announced this week. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The announcement of new US-based manufacturing comes just days after after Nvidia reportedly managed to avoid the imposition of export controls on its H20 chip, the most powerful chip it produces that can belegally exported to China: Two sources toldNPRthat the H20 walkback followed Huang's attendance at a $1 million-per-person dinner at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Andy has been gaming on PCs from the very beginning, starting as a youngster with text adventures and primitive action games on a cassette-based TRS80.

    "title": "Former Concord dev says 'it was gut wrenching to see our project fail' but urges players not to judge Marathon too soon:  'To call this game a failure before it’s even out is wild to me'",
    "article_text": "The long-awaited reveal of Marathon over the weekend has drawn comparisons to the online service shooter which Sony shut down last October. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Gameplay of Bungie's extraction shooterMarathonwas finally revealed over the weekend, and while there's plenty of excitement for it, a not-negligible number of gamers have jumped into the conversation to make unflattering comparisons to Concord. Spurred by those reactions, a former Concord developer has taken toReddit(viaVG247) to encourage everyone to give the game a chance—and, maybe more importantly, to show some empathy for the people working on it. \"After reading the comments about Marathon being Concord 2.0 on Reddit, YouTube, and Twitch, I just wanted to share a little insight into what a forty year old man is feeling after dedicating a large portion of his life to making videogames,\" MrSpug—former Firewalk Studios senior VFX artistStephan Williams—wrote in the Marathon subreddit. \"Concord failed to inspire players, and the message was heard loud and clear. It was gut wrenching to see our project fail, and be the laughing stock of many online. I have learned that failure is what drives me to succeed. No one feels as bad as the people who put their time on the line, hoping it will entertain the masses of gamers across the globe.\" Concord failed to inspire players, and the message was heard loud and clear. It was gut wrenching to see our project fail, and be the laughing stock of many online Concord, you'll recall, wasn't just a failure, it was a spectacular flameout: It launched to virtually zero interest and waspulled offlineless than two weeks later. The initial plan, at least as publicly presented, was to figure out what went wrong and try again, but in the end Sony decided to put it down for good andpulled the plug on Firewalktoo—an especially ugly outcome given that Sony hadacquired Firewalkless than two years earlier. One of the drivers of the Concord comparisons is confirmation that Marathon will be a premium-priced game rather than free to play. Sony had huge success withHelldivers 2, also a premium-priced online game, but it's really the exception to the rule, and its $40 price tag was abig knockagainst Concord. Some people are clearly expecting the same from Marathon: It's not a massive backlash, but there is a strain of persistent negativity out there, which is what prompted Williams to post his message. He acknowledged that talking about his work at Firewalk exposed him to being \"roasted\" for Concord, but said he hopes that instead of going after him for it, readers \"see that people create these projects, and work very hard to be the next big thing.\" \"Seeing the faces of the developers on the Bungie stream gave me hope, and excitement for what is to come for Marathon,\" Williams wrote. \"I commend them for taking a chance, trying something foreign to them, that isn't proven, nor guaranteed to succeed. It takes a lot of courage.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. In response to one of the replies to his message—which, happily, have been almost exclusively positive—Williams said he didn't want to call attention to himself with the message, because he doesn't have a horse in the race at all. \"But to call this game a failure before it’s even out, is wild to me,\" he wrote. In another, he expressed confidence that Bungie will get it right. \"I am stoked to see the fully polished product,\" he wrote. \"Bungie will cook.

    "article_text": "Pseudodog's gotta eat. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The Zone might always be a place where stepping a few feet in the wrong direction will leave you compressed into a wet mess by a gravitational anomaly, but you can't say it's not improving. After completing months ofmajor patchesthat smoothed out some of the rougher jank in the Stalker 2 experience since its November release, developer GSC Game World just released its Q2 2025 update roadmap to sketch out its plans for post-release support as it moves from fixes to new additions. \"The Zone is evolving and will continue to,\" GSC Game World said inan accompanying news poston Steam. \"Throughout the year, we will be delivering updates and hotfixes dedicated to making the game better in every aspect. With proper planning, double testing (internal and closed beta for big updates) of all features and fixes, and your feedback, Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl will become the game we imagined—and you deserve.\" First on the Q2 docket is an initial beta deployment of an official Stalker 2 modding SDK. GSC Game World says it will be inviting modders to a closed modkit beta before eventually releasing the SDK with an accompanying mod guide. The studio also intends to support Mod.io and Steam Workshop integration. Next, work will continue on polishing Stalker 2's \"A-Life\" system. At Stalker 2's launch, the A-Life system—which produced all kinds of emergent fun and/or anguish in previous Stalker games by simulating NPC behavior and events independently of the player's actions throughout the Zone—was pretty busted. Stalker 2's early patches did somemajor workto get A-Life's basic functionality up and running, and now GSC Game World will be adding \"persistent A-Life improvements\" to bring additional depth to those simulated behaviors. Likewise, the studio says it's adding combat AI updates, giving human NPCs \"better cover/flanking use\" and limited grenades. The Zone's gnarlier inhabitants will enjoy some tune-ups, too. In addition to an ominous roadmap line that just reads \"mutants react to threats,\" the studio says mutants will soon be able to eat corpses. Lovely. But they'll also be dropping loot eventually, so it's not all horrific. Rounding out the roadmap is the planned addition of two new, unspecified weapons, an option to skip shader compilation at startup (which I'm surprised to hear is a thing that you can skip, frankly), a size increase for the stash window, and—as is obligatory for even hypothetical update notes—further stability and optimization improvements. Some things never change. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. After a reminder that work is continuing on the\"next-gen update\" for the original Stalker trilogy, GSC Game World added one last note to the roadmap that \"mission targets may be moved from Q2 to later dates in case of Zone instability.\" After all, game development has its own reality-warping anomalies to contend with. Thankfully, if the studio's plans change, we should find out before too long. GSC Game world says that it will \"keep things clear and on track\" by offering additional quarterly roadmap updates every three months.

    "article_text": "Small but mighty. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Today, we got a small look atOverwatch 2'supcoming Stadium mode. While only a few minutes long, thegameplay trailerhas a ton of stuff packed into it, including a snapshot of some unique hero abilities and how teams will have to band together to be competitive in this new mode. Stadium is a new third-person mode (but you can pick first-person if you want) that Blizzard announced a couple of months ago. It subverts the usual Overwatch 2 format in favour of a best-of-seven round-based mode, which has random shortened objectives to make fights even quicker and, as a byproduct, likely more chaotic. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together From what we saw in this little gameplay snippet, it seems like teams are going to need a level of coordination not yet seen in Overwatch 2, which is really saying something as I've always thought Blizzard has demanded too much organisation from complete randoms. The trailer shows a team of five fighting in the Stadium mode, and between rounds, discussing what's going right and wrong, and how they can improve for the next match point. The team agrees that their biggest issue is the enemy Zarya, who is \"frying\" them. In response to this, another player suggests building \"the inflection for Zarya\", hinting at the fact that players can create counter-builds against heroes. You'll be able to do this in the buy menu, where you can purchase upgrades with cash you earn during the game. The cheapest of which just buff your stats like attack speed, ability power, or cooldown. The trailer also shows the final stage of one hero: Ana. Another team member says they've specced into nano boost, with the ultimate upgrade allowing Ana to nano any allies within your line of sight, but with a 50% reduced duration. Other wacky features displayed in the trailer include a triple damage orb for Moira, a self-nano for Ana, Reinhardt's lava fire strike, and a tiny B.O.B. for Ashe. But if all of this seems a tad too confusing, then worry not, the Stadium mode will also have a few pre-builds to make the first few rounds slightly easier to grasp. There'll also be new ranks with different shiny emblems for you to grind towards and some rewards which look like skins for Genji, Moira, Orisa, Soldier 76, and Juno. You'll be able to try all of this out for yourself next Tuesday, April 22. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. It's a surprisingly quick turnaround considering this mode was only announced in February, but it looks like a really exciting new chapter for Overwatch 2, and probably the adrenaline rush that has been needed for a while.

    "article_text": "Until then, here's a look at the crew. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The Star Wars tactics game that wasrevealedby developer Bit Reactor in 2024 now has a title—Star Wars Zero Company—and while virtually nothing else about the game has been revealed at this point, Electronic Arts says we'll get a proper look this coming weekend as part of the Star Wars Celebration in Japan. We have had something of a look at Star Wars Zero Company already thanks to screens thatleaked in March, revealing what looked very much like a Star Wars XCOM game. No surprise there, really: A significant portion of Bit Reactor is made up of former Firaxis developers, including co-founder, CEO, and creative director Greg Foertsch and lead animator Hector Antunez. Foertsch left no doubt that he and the team weren't looking to move on to other things in a 2024 interview, telling PC Gamer that the tactical strategy \"has the most room of any genre to grow,\" and that Bit Reactor is eager to pursue it. The promo image is very grim and gritty, as Star Wars has become, but more notable to me is its greatest-hits lineup of characters: A clone trooper, a mandalorian, an alien weirdo with a lightsaber, R2D2's googly-eyed cousin, and of course Rock Starhunk, a rugged ne'er-do-well in a cool coat—military-ish, of course, because you just know he's a disaffected formersomething—who's clearly in charge of the whole thing. Engage in turn-based tactical combat - STAR WARS Zero Company. Join us at #StarWars celebration on April 19 for a panel with @BitReactor, @Respawn, and @LucasfilmGames where we’ll share a world-exclusive first look at our new game. #SWZeroCoLearn more: https://t.co/B4Ky371FaA pic.twitter.com/xhM4btVXeLApril 14, 2025 No, it doesn't knock my socks off at all: If you told me these guys had won the Ebon Hawk in a game of space poker I'd just shrug and say 'okay.' It's a minor criticism as these things go, and it's also still early days: Even if Star Wars Zero Company leans into well-worn tropes for its cast, the bigger question will be how it plays, and on that front I do hope (with all reasonable cautions in place, of course) that it will deliver. If you're going to make a Star Wars XCOM game, after all, you could do a lot worse than hiring a bunch of ex-XCOM developers to make it happen.

    "article_text": "Counting down the hours until the new subclasses and photo mode. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's time to think about opening up your save file again because theBaldur’s Gate 3Patch 8 release date is almost upon us with another beefy update. Patch 8 is apparently amongLarian’s biggest BG3 updates, too. Harvey did the math, and at least in terms of its patch note length, it’s gotta land somewhere within the top three. The upcoming changes include 12 new subclasses and a photo mode, so hopefully I can finally retire some of the camera mods I use for Karlach smooch shots and twirling my Tav around like a runway model. We don’t have an exact timing on the update, but pulling some historical data can at least give us a rough window for likely times we’ll see BG3 Patch 8 go live. Baldur’s Gate 3 Patch 8 releases on Tuesday, April 15, 2025.After the Patch 8 launch, don’t expect another big update like a Patch 9. According to Larian, this is their last big BG3 update outside of the usual bug fixes. No, Larian hasn’t specified an exact release time for BG3 Patch 8. It’s a bummer if you’re trying to plan the day around scouring any romance changes or hours in photo mode, but historically, Larian is pretty good about getting patches out earlier in the day for folks in North American time zones. Historically, BG3 patch release times are a little all over the place, but some excessiveSteamDBsnooping offers a window of about 11:00-17:00 UTC. Patch 6 last year launched at around 10:46 UTC while Patch 7 later in the year was at around 16:20 UTC with patches from past years typically falling between those hours. That’s around normal working hours for anyone based in Larian’s European offices, which makes sense. If we want to estimate around 15:00 UTC, then it puts us around 8 am PST / 11 am EST / 4 pm BST as a likely release time for Patch 8.

    "article_text": "It's time to fall down the rabbit hole. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Disney Dreamlight Valleyhas announced the details of its next update, Wonderland Whimsy, including the release date: April 23. This update will open up the Alice in Wonderland realm, which means two new characters will be available to unlock and invite to our valley, Alice and the Cheshire Cat. Although no specific details on what needs to be done before Alice and the Cheshire Cat can move in were shared, the developer update does show a few features of the Wonderland realm, which I can only imagine will play into the quests themselves. These include navigating the Queen of Hearts labyrinth, and hosting a tea party. You know, very stereotypical Alice in Wonderland-esque features. Outside of welcoming these new friends, a few quality of life changes are being made to Disney Dreamlight Valley within the update too. The first is the introduction of the \"uncrafting station\". This seems to be a machine you unlock through developing a friendship with the Cheshire Cat, but given how useful I know it will be, I will happily spend hours on hours trying to boost my friendship to get a hold of one. The Uncrafting Station lets you take any item you've crafted in the past and change it back into its original crafting materials. Any accidental crafts you've made in the past will finally have a purpose again. Other quality of life improvements include the ability to spend Dreamlight on purchasing storage upgrades for small and medium chests, alongside reworked placement grids for the top of furniture. As someone who is always desperately looking for a way to put all the meals I've meticulously cooked on a single table, I will happily embrace this addition of more space. The new Star Path, Garden of Whimsy, has also been revealed, and features a mixture of Alice in Wonderland and Disney Fairies themed items. While it's active, you'll be able to host a tea party in your valley, and unlock an Absolem butterfly animal companion. More adorable decor and furniture for the valley will be available too, such as huge flower gazebos and mushroom tables, but the full details are for us to discover when the update rolls out next week. Finally, new premium shop content is being added, and it's good news for any Star Wars lover. With this shop update, you'll be able to purchase an R2D2 companion, and a Lightsaber hand accessory (which yes, comes with a new photo pose) alongside numerous other goodies from a \"galaxy far, far away.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "How Bethesda turned the radioactive lemon that was Fallout 76 into endless lemonade: 'It taught me a lot, as pain does'",
    "article_text": "Almost hell, West Virginia. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. When Fallout 76 was hated, Jeff Gardiner—the man responsible for eventually turning it around—felt more than a little déjà vu. \"It reminded me a lot of Fallout 3,\" he says. \"We made a decision that was controversial, and we thought it was for the best of the game. We got buy-in from everyone, we executed on it. It proved to be the incorrect decision.\" You likely don't even remember the Fallout 3 debacle Gardiner's referring to, so thorough and decisive was Bethesda's course correction at the time. But back in 2008, when the studio's reboot of the beloved RPG series first launched, the main questline finished with a full stop. Fallout 3's core theme was sacrifice, and that meant leaving it behind. \"People forget,\" says Gardiner. \"You hit a 'The End' screen, right? That was hugely controversial. In the first DLC launch, we pulled that out.\" This was the rumble before the earthquake that wasMass Effect 3's ending controversy. You could characterise both events as capitulations, worrying precedents in which artists backtracked on the thesis of their work and handed over the reins to the audience. Yet in Fallout 3's case, the flaws in the original ending are obvious in retrospect. For many years, in The Elder Scrolls, Bethesda had promised players they could live another life, in another world. With Fallout 3, the studio was cutting that life short. \"I think we had established a pattern in our games, with Morrowind and Oblivion,\" Gardiner says. \"We set an expectation that we failed to deliver on. And also we had trouble with the DLC too. If your story arc is over, and then you put in DLC and you're asking players to go back to an earlier save game state, it feels weird.\" Finish Fallout 3 today, and you'll wake up two weeks after the events of the ending, ready to mop up Enclave loyalists alongside the Brotherhood of Steel. The original conclusion is a historical footnote. \"Only people who played it at the time remember,\" Gardiner says. \"For anyone who played after that patch came out, it isn't a thing for them.\" There was a lot of behind-the-scenes fighting, I will be honest, about the PvP in particular. Much later, after a long Bethesda career which includedpersonally rebalancing Skyrim two weeks before it came out, Gardiner became project lead on Fallout 76. \"It was weird,\" he says. \"The project lead title didn't come until much later in the process. So I was still operating a large part of the time as lead producer.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The game's most infamous early design calls—namely, the decision to rid the West Virginia wasteland of living NPCs, and to splice Fallout with elements of the multiplayer survival genre—were mandated by Bethesda leadership. Gardiner's team had to make them happen. \"The original vision of Fallout 76 was a very unique and neat idea,\" he says. \"But people forget it had a lot of PvP in it. There was a lot of behind-the-scenes fighting, I will be honest, about the PvP in particular.\" Gardiner was personally wary of the potential for griefing. \"At first it was going to have everyone in PvP all the time,\" he says. \"And I was like, 'It's great in theory, but in practice, there's going to be a bunch of angry 10-year-olds that are coming into this game, and their fun is ruining your day.'\" Ultimately, Bethesda made scuffles with fellow players an opt-in activity. But PvP was far from the only issue the Fallout 76 team had to figure out. Another was base building—a system already established inFallout 4, which had to be reimagined for MMO servers. \"We were always like, 'Which player is going to host this? Because eventually they're going to stop playing, and then I'm going to have to just redo this somewhere else,'\" Gardiner says. \"And so that's why I really liked the camp system. That's still one of my favourite things I had influence on.\" As any Fallout 76 fan knows, your base travels with you between servers, appearing wherever you last constructed it. It's one of the game's great strengths, allowing you to make a corner of the wilderness your home. Yet camps were also marred by compromise. \"It was very hard technologically to figure out, because whenever you drop complex structures randomly in an environment, that can affect rendering,\" Gardiner says. \"You can affect somebody else's game.\" In Fallout 4, Bethesda's philosophy had been to let players trash their framerate with overambitious builds, if they wanted to. \"But in 76 you're breaking everyone's game, right? Everyone who's with you.\" The solution was to place a hard limit on how much a player could plonk down, via a \"weird\" budgeting system. Not ideal. More painfully, if a player logged in and found that somebody else had taken their usual spot, their camp was stored as a 'blueprint'. Hypothetically, these could be used to instantly rebuild a base somewhere else. Practically speaking, the uneven nature of West Virginia's terrain made that extremely difficult. \"It sucked, because your camp wasn't there, and the blueprint system wasn't that great,\" Gardiner says. \"And I'm putting it mildly. This is the danger of being both the producer and the creative lead, because you don't want a creative person thinking too much about budgets and schedules. Then they'll make decisions that aren't the best decisions.\" In hindsight, Gardiner wishes he'd focused purely on leading the project creatively, and handed production duties off to someone else. But there were other challenges that extended beyond Bethesda's Maryland HQ. Fallout 76 was developed in large part by Bethesda Austin, the new Texas team which had joined the company after the cancellation of theirViktor Antonov arena fighter, Battlecry. \"It's difficult to establish trust,\" Gardiner says. \"They were all new. And then we had the distance thing. So it was a very difficult project in a lot of ways. It was difficult because I had a lot of learning curves I wasn't familiar with at the time, like remote work.\" It deserved all the criticism that it got, for sure. In 2022, Kotaku published adamning reportthat detailed the human cost of Fallout 76. Sources alleged the project had been severely mismanaged, and that the existing multiplayer expertise of Bethesda Austin hadn't been fully utilised until after launch. Certainly, Fallout 76 released in a sorry state, with much of the public's unhappiness directed at bugs and the main questline—which told its story through holotapes and notes on corpses. \"You're asking players to either listen to things or read, neither of which they're really doing because they're running and shooting,\" Gardiner says. \"The game had balance issues when we launched it too, bullet sponging problems. It deserved all the criticism that it got, for sure. It taught me a lot, as pain does.\" The overwhelmingly negative feedback had a deleterious effect on Bethesda's staff. \"When you put a game out that's maligned, especially on a team that has had such success, the morale is doubly bad internally,\" Gardiner says. \"I got yelled at in an Apple Store, I'll never forget.\" After launch, he considered it his job to ensure that the developers working on Fallout 76 liked the game themselves. He asked them for solutions, and tried to empower them to make those changes. \"I thought that was really important.\" The new approach—which contrasts notably with the mandates from on-high that had characterised early development—culminated in Wastelanders. The transformative update populated West Virginia with living NPCs and dialogue-driven questlines, in recognition of the fact that Bethesda had made a mistake. \"We didn't have the simulation elements at launch, because it was all other players,\" Gardiner says. \"And we didn't have the story. So you took out two elements of Bethesda games that made them Bethesda games.\" Reversing the flow of Fallout 76 was no small feat. \"The team in Austin and Rockville did such a good job with that,\" Gardiner says. \"It wasn't just like dusting off the old tools from Morrowind and using them in 76, because we had torn it all out. It was a Herculean lift.\" At stake was not only the future of Fallout 76, but that of Fallout as a whole. \"The negative sentiment was hurting the brand,\" Gardiner says. \"There was a lot of pressure at that time, because it was the last thing we tried. I mean, we put a battle royale in. We made a lot of probably incorrect decisions in the year previous to Wastelanders, that actually continued to hurt it.\" Mercifully, it was Wastelanders that marked the beginning of Fallout 76's turnaround. It restored confidence to a development team who, as Gardiner tells it, finally felt they could wear their Bethesda gear in public again. \"That's what you finally saw in Wastelanders and then beyond: 'I am now proud that I'm working on this game. I don't have to hide the fact that I worked on it.'\" Gardiner has since left Bethesda to work onWyrdsong, a new fantasy RPGthat draws on all of his experience at Bethesda. Yet, despite the pain of Fallout 76's inception, he's proud too. \"People always ask, 'What's your favourite game you've worked on?' Because 76 was such a difficult game and then it turned around to a successful game, it's actually probably my favourite.\" Jeremy Peel is an award-nominated freelance journalist who has been writing and editing for PC Gamer over the past several years.

    "article_text": "Now sit down and eat your dinner, and stop touching things. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The internet was mystified earlier this month by... okay, let me start this again.Very specific partsof the internet were mystified earlier this month byan empty folder labelled \"inetpub\"turning up among system files after the Windows 11 April 2025 Update. Some took to deleting it, which on the surface caused no issues at all. However, Microsoft has now updated a support document instructing users to leave it alone, as it's tied to a security update. The inetpub folder is used to store and manage Internet Information Services (ISS) logs, but even users who did not have the service enabled saw it appear after theKB5055523Windows update (viaWindows Central). There it sat, as if it had always been there, but curious users were left none the wiser as to why it blinked into existence on their machines. Microsoft has now confirmed in anupdated support documentfor vulnerability CVE-2025-21204 that the folder is part of \"changes that increase protection\" and that \"this folder should not be deleted regardless of whether Internet Information Services (IIS) is active on the target device.\" The text is highlighted in bold, so you know it's serious. However, Microsoft has still not explained why the empty folder is so vital to its security fixes, leaving us no more enlightened as to what it actually does. CVE-2025-21204 is related to an elevation of privilege vulnerability that allows would-be-attackers to modify system files and folders, so perhaps MS is adding the folder to all installs whether it's needed or not to create a standardised system that is less vulnerable to this particular exploit. Pure speculation, that. I honestly have no idea, and Microsoft doesn't seem to feel the need to explain any further. A folder it is, and a folder it must remain. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Microsoft has reportedly told Windows Central that Windows 11 users who deleted the folder must reinstate it by turning Internet Information Services on in the Control Panel. Then the folder can go back to doing... whatever it's supposed to do, I presume. The mystery continues. I for one shall be keeping an eye on my personal intepub folder to see if it does anything interesting, like populating itself with logs of my recent spelling mistakes or keeping track of my shopping habits.

    "title": "If you thought USB naming was nonsense, allow this professional furry engineer to explain the total nightmare that is the underlying hardware complexity of USB-C",
    "article_text": "Oh, and it's all Apple's fault. Well, possibly... When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Question. What's the difference between USB 3.1, USB 3.1 Gen 2, and USB 3.2 Gen 2? Answer, they're all exactly the same, they're just different iterations of thetotally bananas naming schemes that have been cooked up for USB over recent years. But if you thought USBbrandingwas a mess, well, you really don't want to know about the catastrophic mess that are the underlying hardware complexities. And guess what, it's all Apple's fault. Well, it's partially Apple's fault according to an anonymous USB engineer who gave aremarkably entertaining talk on the history of USB and the USB-C standard posing as a fox. Yes, really. To be more specific, the talk was held on theDegenTech YouTube channel, self-described as, \"a network of working professional furries interested in STEMM. We host open meets and presentations on VRchat and hangout on discord.\" The talk was held by a DegenTech member going by the name of Temporel and with a history of USB engineering for various large outfits including Siemens. According to Temporel, the answer to the question of of USB-C got so complicated and over-engineered is Apple. Kind of. \"If someone wants to hate on Apple, this is the time because partially this is Apple's fault,\" Temporel says. To cut a long and surprisingly fascinating story short, the problem comes down to charging. The original USB-A standard was never intended to support device charging. It was about hooking up devices like keyboards and mice with very low power requirements, along with reliable data transfer. And it was very good at that, enabling 480 MB/s of data over just two wires. Indeed, as Temporel says, USB Type-A did a stellar good job of killing off legacy interfaces like Firewire and parallel. \"It was cheaper, more convenient. It was very scalable,\" Temporel says. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. But it didn't support much by way of power output, just 0.5 A and 5 V. So, the problems all started in 2007 when Apple launched the iPhone and wanted to use USB to charge the device. Apple cooked up its own out-of-spec USB interface with 2.4 A of charging power. That could damage a computer, so Apple devised a method where the iPhone would only charge at the higher speed when it detected a power supply as opposed to a standard USB port. Pretty quickly, lots of other companies copied this approach, resulting in as many as 20 different standards based on USB but not actually compliant with the USB spec. In 2012, the USB standards body added support for 1.5 A, but this wasn't enough. The upshot was that all USB chargers and sockets ended up having integrated circuits and current sensing hardware that would figure out what the maximum charging capability was in any given device-and-charger scenario, but it was all outside the official USB spec. China then implemented a standard that combined Apple's charging standard with one from Huawei and made it compulsory. And since so many devices are made in China, that went a long way to creating a de facto standard for USB devices. When USB Type-C came along, it was a chance to start anew. But the problem was then backwards compatibility. As Temporel explains, \"all of the mayhem that is on the old spec is now added on top of the USB-C because you still have to support USB-A. \"You have standard USB. On top of that you have 15 independent standards from manufacturers. Then on top of that you have whatever six standards USB wanted to implement that didn't help and just made it worse. That was slightly patch fixed by bloody China to force everyone to use at least two of them. And then on top of all this, they're now going to start piling the USB-C protocols.\" Anyway, if you've ever wondered why something didn't just work based on the assumption that USB is USB, now you know. USB is rarely, if ever, just USB. You can find out more from the full video, which is well worth a watch.

    "article_text": "\"It was a complete win for everyone involved.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A Minecraft Movie has proven to be a barnstorming success, thanks in no small part to an all-out marketing blitz focused around the film's winning aesthetic. It's already had the best opening weekend ofany videogame adaptation in the US, inspired aviral craze around chicken jockey, and now it seems like the sky's the limit. Director Jared Hess has already said \"it'd be amazing\" to make a sequel, but now the Warner Bros suits are on their victory lap and have officially confirmed that there will be Another Minecraft Movie.Asked by Deadlinewhether sequels for A Minecraft Movie and Beetlejuice Beetlejuice were in development, Warner Bros Pictures co-chairman and CEOs Mike De Luca and Pam Abdy didn't hesitate. \"Imminently,\" said De Luca. \"The ink might not be dry on the deals yet, but imminently.\" \"Adding to things we’re excited about, Andy Serkis doing the Gollum film, Drew Goddard writing a new Matrix,\" adds Abdy. \"We’re super excited about Amblin developing with Chris Columbus new entries in the Gremlins and Goonies franchises.\" So that's pretty unsurprising, but definitive. The executives also arguably deserve their moment in the sun here, because the Minecraft movie has been a long-term project with several false starts: it may well have turned out a big success, but the road here clearly wasn't without twists and turns. \"No matter what version of the story is written, there’s no bad news here,\" says De Luca. \"Everybody did their jobs incredibly well. The project was here for 12 years, and had trouble getting made. I think Pam and I did our jobs well, recognizing that it should be fast tracked. I think Jesse Ehrman is an unsung hero here. That should be hung from the rafters, how he kept this thing alive for those 12 years, through multiple regimes. That is hard to do. He never didn’t believe in it, and he kept the faith. You could not ask for a better performance from a key executive and a champion of his project. \"And then the final puzzle piece was attaching Legendary, where Mary Parent and Cale Boyter brought it home by folding in Jared Hess and producing the result that we have. Everybody did their jobs. There are many things to celebrate, many people to celebrate. Pam and I will always credit everyone who contributes, including a recently reorganized marketing and distribution team. This was their maiden tentpole voyage, wiping out any doubt that we might miss a step in our ability to mount and deploy a global tentpole. There are heroes all through this story, and all of them should get the credit they deserve. It was a complete win for everyone involved.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. I'm not sure what deploying a global tentpole means, but presumably it's something to do with those McDonalds meals. There are no details yet on when to expect the next Minecraft movie, though it will presumably stick to the same crowd-pleasing template and cast that's proven so successful (and feature an extended chicken jockey sequence). The cast and crew will also, presumably, be returning to their own private Minecraft server, where Jack Black got \"super weirdly method\"and built a fancy mansion. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Rich is a games journalist with 15 years' experience, beginning his career on Edge magazine before working for a wide range of outlets, including Ars Technica, Eurogamer, GamesRadar+, Gamespot, the Guardian, IGN, the New Statesman, Polygon, and Vice.

    "article_text": "The power of a button or in this instance, several hundred people pressing other buttons. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In the world of technology, exaggerating the capabilities of a product is pretty much the norm. But when one app company managed to raise millions of dollars in investments on the promise that it would be fully automated via AI, the US Department of Justice charged its former CEO with fraud because it turns out that the actual 'AI' was in fact several hundred call centre workers instead. The company in question is Nate, which started in 2018 and rapidly amassed over $50 million in investments, according toTechCrunch. It did this because the company's product, a universal shopping phone app, was claimed to use AI to fully automate the whole buying process. Nate's gist is that you would see a product you like, click a button, and machine learning will then sort out the transaction for you—including picking the right version of the product, payment details, and shipping. However, an investigation byThe Information(viaTechSpot) showed that AI wasn't used at all—in fact, it was just call centre workers in countries such as Romania and the Philippines that would be furiously clicking away behind the scenes. While there is an element of comedy to all of this, the law in many countries around the world has a word for this sort of thing, and the founder of Nate has indeed now been charged with fraud. The US Department of Justice was less than amused by the actions of Nate and its founder and CEO at the time, Albert Saniger, last weekcharging himfor \"making false claims about his company’s artificial intelligence technology.\" Specifically, the FBI's Christopher G. Raia had this to say about the former CEO: \"Albert Saniger allegedly defrauded investors with fabrications of his company's purported artificial intelligence capabilities while covertly employing personnel to satisfy the illusion of technological automation. Saniger allegedly abused the integrity associated with his former position as the CEO to perpetuate a scheme filled with smoke and mirrors.\" Saniger has been charged with one count of securities fraud and one of wire fraud, both of which carry maximum penalties of up to 20 years in prison. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Along with The Information's investigation of Nate, the fact the company ran out of money a few years ago, requiring it to sell off most of its assets, leaving investors high-and-dry, was probably what brought the app company into the gaze of the Department of Justice and FBI. This isn't the first use of a claimed AI technology being nothing more than real humans beavering away behind the scenes and it certainly won't be the last. But it's a cautionary tale that, like with all things technology-wise, any marketing claims should be viewed with a wary eye unless indisputable evidence of it working as promised is handed over.

    "title": "Baldur's Gate 3's Patch 8 is among its biggest, holding 48 pages (approx. 19,000-20,000 words) of patch notes in its vast and bountiful form",
    "article_text": "Goodbye, free time. I hardly knew ye. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Patch 8 of Baldur's Gate 3 releases tomorrow, April 15. And while I'm already scheming to build my gang of build-broken nightmare people to tackle Honour Mode with for a second time, I'm also wondering how I'm going to break it to my friends, family, and loved ones that they will not see me for the next two weeks. Maybe three, actually, since Larian bossSwen Vincke's assertionafterthe announcement last weekthat Patch 8 of Baldur's Gate 3 has, uh, alotof notes to get through. Vincke writes on X: \"I just read the 48 pages of patch notes on this. If there were a Michelin guide to patches, I’d give this one 3 stars.\" 48 pages is alot.However, if you go on any of the patch notes on the Larian website, you'll notice that they aren't actually divided up into pages. So how big is Patch 8, really? Well, I spent a not-insignificant amount of my work day copying and pasting patch notes into google docs to craft a rough guestimate. In 11-point Arial text on an A4 document with Google doc's default of 2.54 cm margins, Larian's average patch notes are around 500 words a page. This is when I've pasted them completely unformatted, stripped of bullet points and sundry that would likely take up more space, so let's shave down that number to a conservative estimate of 400 words. I hence predict that Baldur's Gate 3's Patch 8 notes will have a rough, approximate, kitchen-nap length word count of around 19,000 to 20,000. Give or take. Out of curiosity, I decided to go ahead and share my word-count findings from the other patch notes for comparison's sake. Keep in mind, some of these patches have lengthy pre-ambles explaining certain features or giving status updates, while others don't: If my calculations are accurate, this could potentially make Patch 8 the second biggest (based on raw word count) patch the game's received, which… entirely tracks, if I'm being honest. While other patches have added major new features, Patch 8 will be giving us 12 entirely new subclasses, and that'll need a lot of explaining. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Mind, given the patch itself is coming outafterLarian decided hey,what's one more major update, just for good luck?

    "title": "EarFun Air Pro 4 earbuds review",
    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. These earphones offer an incredible all-round experience and tons of features at a very competitive price point. Although they require a little EQing to get things sounding right, once that's done you get a lively, clear, and relatively punchy listening experience. The only real downsides are middling mic quality and lack of 2.4G connectivity. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. There are tons of $50-$100 earbuds on the market these days, and many of these are at least half-decent picks for gaming, thanks to their dedicated 'game modes'. But despite this crowded market, and after using them for a while, I reckon the EarFun Air Pro 4 earbuds stand out from the crowd enough to be worthy of consideration. That's primarily because they offer a very well-rounded feature set plus a lovely sound profile for $60–$90. And I'd bet that this price point is exactly where many people are looking towards when considering new earphones. So, down to brass tacks. The first thing to note is that the Air Pro 4 is Bluetooth-only, offering no wireless 2.4 GHz connection. That's not so much of a downside for latency because the Air Pro 4's low-latency Game Mode works great. It is, however, a downside for those of you looking to do gaming while using in-game voice chat or speaking to Discord friends, because Bluetooth simply cannot properly handle voice and stereo audio at the same time. Spotify music sounded dreadful after I started recording my voice via the earphones' onboard mic, but it returned to normalcy once I stopped. It's also a downside for those of you who want never-fiddly audio (a technical term, I assure you). I've found these earbuds to bealmostnever-fiddly, but there have been a couple of occasions where I've had to disconnect and reconnect to the Bluetooth on my laptop, probably because of some shenanigans with Dual Device Connection, which I always keep enabled. I doubt you'd get that problem with a dedicated 2.4 GHz dongle—I never had the problem with the expensive 2.4 GHz SteelSeries buds. Drivers:10 mm dynamicFrequency response:22 kHzConnection:Bluetooth 5.4Battery life:52 hours (11 from earphones, 41 from case)Extras:Charging case, USB-C connector, 5x different-sized tipsPrice:$90/£80 Still, that's happened to me only once in a blue moon and the fix is easy. But it does give me a nice segue into its dual-mode functionality, which is one of many well-implemented features these earphones offer. Dual Device Connection allows you to connect to two devices at once, and it'll play audio from whichever device you're playing something from (it won't do both sources at once, of course). I've found this really useful as it means I can game on my handheld and still have it connected to my phone to answer calls or easily switch over when I want to listen to some music or an audiobook while I'm on the move. While Dual Device Connection can be set up using the button inside the case while the earphones are sat snugly inside it, it's much easier to do in the app, as are most things. That's because the app is fantastic—I much prefer it to others I've used, both for its extensiveness and simplicity, which is a hard balance to strike. At the top of the app, you're greeted with a very clear battery indicator for both earphones and charging case. Below that, you can fiddle with Ambient Sound (transparency), Active Noise Cancelling (ANC), Game Mode, In-Ear Detection, EQ, Dual Device Connection, touch controls, left- or right-side mic, LE audio, and voice prompts. You can also install firmware updates super easily from in-app. That's a ton of features, and all of them work surprisingly well (though I'm not sure about LE audio—a low-power Bluetooth addition—since it doesn't work with iOS and I am, sad to say it, one ofthosepeople). I was particularly impressed with the EQ, especially after being a little disappointed with the EQ options on the competing Nothing Ear (a) earbuds. EarFun not only gives you tons of presets to try (including profiles for different genres of music) but it also has a 10-point parametric curve that you can fiddle with. The sound profile is by default a little boring and slightly mushy, to my ears. But with a little fiddling, these earbuds can sound fantastic. I ended up taking another user's EQ numbers and then adjusting things slightly from there. For those interested, I settled on the following EQ numbers: 9, 7, 3, 4, 3, 1, 2, 3, 10, 10. Changing to this made a massive difference, and the earphones went from okay to really quite lovely. Admittedly that's not quite as spectacular as what you'll find in some audiophile IEMs or even theSteelSeries Arctis GameBuds, but for this price range, it's great. After my EQ fix, I'd describe the sound profile as crisp and lively, with tons of separation and a decent amount of punch, but still not quite as full and present as some higher-end options. It's certainly not adullaudio experience, and I'm thoroughly enjoying listening to both music and games through the Air Pro 4's 10 mm drivers. Yes, I'm reminded it's notquitethere whenever I put the Arctis GameBuds back in, but it's damn close for quite a lot less money. I haven't noticed any drop in quality when switching to Game Mode, either, though I do notice the drop in latency. With Game Mode disabled there really is quite a lot of noticeable lag, but when it's enabled I don't notice any lag at all—gunshot sounds seem to ring in my ears the moment I press the handheld's trigger and make sparks fly on-screen. These buds are also great in ANC and transparency modes (or 'Ambient Sound' mode, as EarFun calls it). ANC adaptively cancels up to 50dB and I found that while it struggles to block out dynamic noises (as most earbuds do), it does a really good job of keeping out fans, wind, and other such rumbles and grumbles. I've found this really useful when travelling on public transport, and I tend to just keep it on its 'Strong' setting as I've found that to work best. I've also found its Ambient Sound setting to work a charm, preventing me from being struck down by reversing cars and so on. One area that's very middling is the onboard mic. It's not bad, it's just not great—you can definitely tell it's an earphone mic rather than a headset one, as it makes your voice sound a little fuzzy and tinny. Credit where credit's due, though, it does at least get rid of static background noises such as rumbles or wind relatively well. The on-ear controls are fine, but as with other touch-capacitive earphones, you have to be careful not to press anything by accident. I didn't have more of a problem with this than I do with any other earbuds with touch controls, but it's something to note regardless. You do get a lot of control over what different left/right presses do, too. For each ear, you can set different functions to a long press or a single-, double-, or triple-tap. You can choose between the following functions: I've left things as their defaults purely because I'm lazy—no, really, that's the reason—but at some point I might switch pause/play to single-tap and previous/next track to double-tap given I rarely change volume with the touch controls anyway. ✅You want sharp audio:While they might not be capable of the fullest sound, once you fiddle around with the EQ and push up the treble, games and music sound crystal clear.✅You want ease of use:From the intuitive app to battery life LEDs and wireless case charging, these earphones are incredibly simple and easy to use. ❌ You want to use the mic while listening:These earbuds only connect over Bluetooth, which means audio quality drops drastically if you try to use the built-in mic at the same time as listening to something.❌ You want the absolute best audio quality:The Air Pro 4 sounds great for earbuds under $100, but you can get a whole other level of audio quality if you're willing to spend a lot more. The icing on the cake is battery life. These are rated to 11 hours of life in the earbuds themselves, plus another 41 hours from the charging case, for 52 hours total.Andthe case has both (relatively slow) wireless charging compatibility as well as fast charging if you plug it in via USB-C. One of the things that's pleased me most about these earbuds, in fact, is how easy managing battery life is. That's not just because there's a lot of juice in them, but also because it's just so simple to see how much is left. Three little LEDs on the front of the case tell the battery life tale on the front of the case whenever you open and close it, and the app shows how much is left incredibly quickly, clearly, and easily. Having all thisplusthe ability to charge the earbuds wirelessly or via USB-C is fantastic for this price point. And that's the main deal, I think: You're simply getting a heck of a lot for the price. MSRP is $90 but at the time of writing the Air Pro 4 earbuds have tended to be on sale for far less than this relatively consistently. Even at full price, I'd say they're more than worthy of consideration, and definitely so when they're on sale. They might not offer the most absolutely refined, well-rounded sound of audiophile earbuds, but they can sound very lively and crisp after some EQ tinkering, and they scoop over bucket-loads of features and deliver on them incredibly well. 2.4 GHz connectivity and a better mic would be nice, as would some physical rather than touch controls, but we can't expect perfection for this price. But as for what wecanexpect in this price bracket, the EarFun Air Pro 4 earbuds deliver all that and more. These earphones offer an incredible all-round experience and tons of features at a very competitive price point. Although they require a little EQing to get things sounding right, once that's done you get a lively, clear, and relatively punchy listening experience.

    "article_text": "\"I agree,\" notes Musk, kinda saying the quiet part out loud. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Jack Dorsey, the ex-CEO and co-founder of Twitter, has taken to his... X account to post a debate-sparking statement:\"Delete all IP law.\" Elon Musk responded to the tweet/xeet with a similarly brief\"I agree\", as the thread descended into a full on internet slappy fight between intellectual property defenders and those that seem to feel that IP law is a barrier to progress in the modern age. delete all IP lawApril 11, 2025 \"Agreed. Burn the entire regime,\" posted one user, while others pointed out examples of intellectual property belonging toBlock, Inc(formerly Square, Inc), a company co-founded by Dorsey. Dorsey appeared to double-down on his argument (viaTechcrunch). In response to a post arguing that IP law is the only thing separating human creations from AI creations,he responded: \"Creativity is what currently separates us, and the current system is limiting that, and putting the payments (sic) disbursement into the hands of gatekeepers who aren't paying out fairly.\" Which sounds like a call for IP law reform, not its removal, to me. Quite what has caused Dorsey to openly call for IP law to be \"deleted\" is unclear. However, Dorsey-created X competitor, BlueSky, was created on an open source protocol, and his newest AI venture,an AI assistant called \"Goose\", uses an open source model. Dorsey appears to be a fan of the open use of information, and not, it seems, legally-protected IP rights, at least under the current system. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Musk, meanwhile, has previously stated that\"patents are for the weak\", despite having a total of25 of themcredited to his name. The world's richest man has previously pledged he would not enforce legal action against other companies that used Tesla's patents in good faith. Intellectual property rights are a hot topic in the modern age of AI, as it's been repeatedly claimed that various tech companies have beenillegally scraping copyrighted datato train their AI models. OpenAI has recentlyset out a number of proposalsfor the US government, encouraging it to enact a copyright strategy that \"promotes the freedom to learn\" in the face of Chinese competition, specifically to \"avoid forfeiting our AI lead to the [People's Republic of China] by preserving American AI models.\" Best CPU for gaming: The top chips from Intel and AMD.Best gaming motherboard: The right boards.Best graphics card: Your perfect pixel-pusher awaits.Best SSD for gaming: Get into the game ahead of the rest. Both Dorsey and Musk are heavily entrenched in AI development—and AI, it appears, has an intellectual rights problem. Musk's position as a man with the ear of President Trump makes his comments particularly concerning, although IP law reform (or \"deletion\") doesn't appear to be high on the current US government's agenda—which instead seems to be focussed onchanging its mind regarding tariff rateson an almost daily basis. Still, both Dorsey and Musk have a significant voice in the tech industry—and serious financial power—and these comments feel like a potential escalation in the ongoing debate around who (if anyone) should own the rights to intellectual works, with some incredibly wealthy and influential players throwing their hats into the ring. As to whether this is indicative of potential sweeping changes to intellectual property rights in years to come? Your guess is as good as mine. Still, as X user@poordartputs it (quite succinctly, in my opinion): \"Everybody becomes a free-market libertarian once they make their bag.\" Andy built his first gaming PC at the tender age of 12, when IDE cables were a thing and high resolution wasn't—and he hasn't stopped since.

    "title": "'Trust continues to be tampered with': A thread about SBMM in the upcoming Battlefield game is the final straw as an EA community manager lets loose on leakers",
    "article_text": "\"It's only official when we share it.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The next Battlefield gamehas been in an early playtest for a while now, with EA deciding to take a new angle on community testing by introducing itsBattlefield Labs initiative, a new way for players to test out potential features for the upcoming game. The only problem being that, despite an NDA, participants have beenleaking footage of the untitled gameall over the place, to the disdain of EA. This has been a recurring problem, but it seems like we found the final straw: Players openly discussing potential SBMM features. Rumours about the next Battlefield having SBMM started to spread like wildfire, with most players responding negatively, saying that it's either not needed or it makes matches worse. In a Reddit post, one player shares aPSA from David Sirland, Battlefield's lead producer, trying to calm tensions by effectively saying that all of this is temporary and being done with a light touch. But when grumpy commenters take to the replies to complain, the community manager steps in. 2025 games: Upcoming releasesBest PC games: All-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together \"Okay enough,\" community managerT0TALfps says. \"Battlefield Labs is about building and collaborating on the future of Battlefield, and we want to do that in the correct way. I want to remind everyone that things that are taking place in Battlefield Labs may or may not make their way to the final finish line. This is the greatest thing about this program. \"It allows us the ability to get creative, see what works with those involved, gain educated and informed feedback from those who are participating and potentially spot bugs around the features too. We've long wanted to implement this program, responding to your requests for greater involvement and a return to this type of reactivity around all things Battlefield.\" They also inflict a light telling off, highlighting how \"there is a specific time and place for the wider community to learn about new features and functionalities, and this is not it.\" All these leaks accomplish is stirring up unnecessary unrest and arguments as people debate features that may not even make it into the final game. \"Information and content that gets shared is out of context and often with a narrative wrapped around it that is doing damage to the trust and transparency we want to establish,\" T0TALfps continues. \"Things simply are not the same when it comes to hearing about something out of context versus actually experiencing it, or reading about it in detail with the correct descriptions around it. \"While the allure of brief internet fame might be tempting, it undermines our efforts to remain open and communicative. And quite honestly, if that is your intention, then I question where this aligns with the interests of our, THIS, community.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. It is only official when we share it and we are comfortable with the topic at hand. All we really know about the next Battlefield so far is that it's set in the modern day, it'll bring back traditional classes and focused maps, andit'll release before April 2026. That's not a lot to go off of, but alongside a shortgameplay trailer, the only other thing of note is thatit looks a bit like Battlefield 3. So with the lack of information going around at the moment about the next game, it may seem tempting to search for leaks or rise to temporary internet fame for providing new information, but that's not what's best for the game's development or the devs working hard on it. \"We all can agree that we wanted to have an environment that allowed for testing and collaborating once again,\" T0TALfps says. \"We want to be as transparent as we can be. You have seen us return to the values you once recognised in us. We all want to make Battlefield play like Battlefield, but we cannot do it if the trust continues to be tampered with. We must be allowed the ability to do it right, alongside you all and in the correct way.\" So in the future, before getting mad or excited at Battlefield leaks, it's probably best to keep this little titbit from T0TALfps in mind: \"When it comes to features, content, functionality, and more, it is only official when we share it and we are comfortable with the topic at hand.\" Elie is a news writer with an unhealthy love of horror games—even though their greatest fear is being chased.

    "title": "The first leaked GPU specs for AMD's RX 9060 XT appear and it's pretty much an RX 9070 XT chopped in two",
    "article_text": "Named and specced to meet Nvidia's RTX 5060 Ti head-on. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. With AMD's launch of itsRDNA 4 graphics architectureand the Radeon RX 9070 graphics cards at the end of February, we were hoping to learn more about the mainstream models fairly quickly. Officially nothing has been said yet but the first detailed specs leak has reached the interwebs, with the RX 9060 XT claimed to sport 2,048 shaders, a 3.2 GHz boost clock, and up to 16 GB of VRAM. That's according toVideocardzwhich cites no sources for the information, other than \"recent information from AMD board partners\", but I don't think they're too outlandish. After all, the full Navi 48 GPU in theRadeon RX 9070 XTsports 4,096 shaders so the smaller chip in the 9060 XT is unlikely to have anywhere near as many. If what is being claimed is correct, then the 9060 XT will essentially be a 9070 XT hacked in two—you're getting half the number of shaders and a memory bus that's half as wide. Or to put it into numbers: 2,048 Stream Processors (with 128 TMUs and 64 ROPs) and a 128-bit memory bus. That's exactly the same as aRadeon RX 7600 XTbut the 9060 XT gains ground by virtue of its 3.2 GHz boost clock, 16% higher than the 7600 XT's. Regardless of what the final specs are like, AMD is going to be pitching the RX 7600 XT against Nvidia's RTX 5060 Ti, which is looking increasingly likely to come in two VRAM configurations: 8 GB and 16 GB. We've already seen claims that theRX 9060 XT will also have the same optionbut the one thing it doesn't have is super-fast VRAM. As AMD still uses GDDR6 for price reasons, you'll only be getting a total of 320 GB/s or so of memory bandwidth. While we don't know what RAM speed the RTX 5060 Ti will use, one can hazard a guess at the minimum, given that the slowest GDDR7 used so far in the RTX 50-series has been 28 Gbps (RTX 5070andRTX 5090). If the 5060 Ti uses that, it'll boast 448 MB/s of bandwidth—a hefty 40% more than the RX 9060 XT. To counter this, AMD uses a complex but powerful cache system in its RDNA graphics chips, and like the 7600 XT, I expect the RX 9060 XT will have 32 MB of L3 Infinity Cache to make up for the relatively narrow memory bandwidth. Of course, what PC gamers are going to care about is the price, availability, and for some, how much power it'll use. If I pop on my wizard hat and stare into my crystal ball, I can take a wild stab in the dark at all of this. Let's say Nvidia launches the RTX 5060 Ti at $375 for an 8 GB version: AMD will almost certainly pitch the RX 9060 XT at less than this, perhaps by as much as $50, but whatever it does, it'll probably be quite close to the 7600 XT's launch price of $329. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Back then MSRPs made sense, but these days I wouldn't be surprised if very few board partners offered anything at sub-$350 and I should imagine there will be a few 9060 XT models reaching close to $499. Best CPU for gaming: The top chips from Intel and AMD.Best gaming motherboard: The right boards.Best graphics card: Your perfect pixel-pusher awaits.Best SSD for gaming: Get into the game ahead of the rest. Hopefully, there will be a decent supply of all these cards, especially the more affordable ones. But even if there is, the demand for GPUs is sky-high at the moment so stocks will probably disappear very rapidly for the first few weeks or even months. As to the power consumption, I reckon it will be north of 230 W. The 7600 XT is a 190 W graphics card but the 9060 XT is clocked much higher and the GPU housed dedicated matrix units for accelerating the AI-powered FSR 4 upscaling system. The 4,096 shader 9070 XT uses up to 304 W so it's clear that RDNA 4 loves a decent amount of power. Until AMD officially launches the Radeon RX 9060 XT, all of this is guesswork and rumour. Whether it has the measure of the RTX 5060 Ti won't be certain until we've run both cards through our full benchmark suite, but I suspect the Nvidia card will be the faster of the two, albeit with a higher price tag. Throw in DLSS 4 and it becomes trickier still, as AMD doesn't have anything yet to counter Nvidia's Multi Frame Generation. But the way things are at the moment, any semi-decent GPU with a price tag that doesn't require the selling of an organ or three on the black market is going to sell well.

    "article_text": "That melted cable looks awfully familiar... When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. An X user has posted videos of anRTX 5070that has suffered anall-too-familiar case of cable meltage. Reportedly, an updated 12V-2×6 power cable is implicated, as opposed to the older but closely related 12VHPWR cable, which is a worry. For the record, the card in question was a ZotacRTX 5070model paired with a Seasonic Focus GX-750 power supply. It's worth noting that it was the cable that suffered unambiguous damage here, not the graphics card or even, seemingly, the power connector or socket. PCから煙が出てきたΣ(ﾟдﾟ；)人生初経験...正直ネットニュースとかで見たことあるけど超低確率だと思ってた。。電源つけて直ぐ2秒後すごい煙の量でびっくり！コンセント抜いて換気扇回してる😭端子の接続も何度見直しても、しっかりしてるし、奥までちゃんと刺さってる（続きの動画あります pic.twitter.com/EX1pP5yKFFApril 10, 2025 That's eerily familiar from investigations madeearlier this year by YouTube creator Der8auer, where it was found that the power across the multiple cables in both 12V-2×6 and 12VHPWR connectors attached to the Nvidia RTX-50 series was highly imbalanced. Der8auer tested the six live cables on these connectors hooked up to anRTX 5090and found that the power isn't evenly balanced across all six wires. In fact, just one wire was loaded with 250 W and thus roughly half the load generated by the 5090. Consequently, that heavily loaded wire was getting dangerously hot. An RTX 5070 is clearly a much lower-power GPU, rated at 250 W TDP versus the 5090's 575 W. But if a 5070 is pulling all of that 250 W or something close to that over a single wire, well, you get the idea. As for why this happens at all, in other words why the power isn't more evenly distributed over the cables, I explained back in February, \"some AIBRTX 5090designs include per-pin power sensing, which would presumably stop this kind of power imbalance from happening. But, surprisingly, Nvidia's own FE design apparently does not. Instead, it essentially amalgamates all six live pins into a single power source as soon as it arrives on the GPU's PCB.\" If RTX 5070 typically have the same engineering approach, it's possible some 5070 cards could also be pushing excessive power through a single cable, leading that cable to overheat. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Frankly, none of this seems to make much sense. The whole point of having multiple wires, surely, is to spread the load. To then engineer the connection in a manner that undermines that built-in safety factor seems pretty odd, to say the least. It's also a bit of a worry that it's a 12V-2×6 power cable implicated here with its updates designed to address all those stories ofmelting 12VHPWR connectors on Nvidia graphics cards that date back to 2022. This is the latest power supply hardware applies to the latest GPU technology. Of course, this could well be a very isolated incident that doesn't imply a broader problem. But where there's smoke in a high-performance gaming PC, the immediate culprit is not necessarily an Nvidia GPU fire, but those power cables and sockets are certainly suspect.

    "article_text": "Which object will you go for? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Dating simDate Everything, the game where you can literally date everything, has finally received a release date after it was delayed at the start of this year. Officially slated for a June 17 launch, it's finally time to mark our calendars for the release of what could become one of the best, most obscure, dating simulators of all time. In aSteam page update last week, developer Sassy Chap Games shared the good news that the game had finally been tagged with a release date, alongside some all-important details on the content itself. You can expect 100 fully voiced characters to choose from, all offering multiple endings depending on your dialogue choices. A selection of these voices come from Matt Mercer, Ben Starr, Laura Bailey, Neil Newbon, and Troy Baker too, giving you even more reason to play if you ask me. I mean, who doesn't want to date a humanoid D20, or perhaps a treadmill? No? If that's the case, I guarantee you that Date Everything is home to at least one character that floats your boat. After all, the world is literally your oyster. Date Everything was originally supposed to release on February 14, but at the end of January an update was shared on the Steam page stating that the game needed additional testing before it could release, and the team was still \"too confident that we could properly test ALL the wild amount of content and pathing that exists in this massive game.\" As a result, Date Everything was given a June release window, but no specific date was given. Until now, of course. To coincide with the release date, anew trailer was sharedintroducing the game's \"host\" Skylar, who explains exactly how the game works. You're given a pair of \"dateviators\" which have the ability to bring your household objects to life, such as Harper the laundry hamper, Winnifred the boiler, and Front Dorian, the front door. It's not just about love either. As Skylar explains within the release date trailer, you have three potential relationships to develop with the inhabitants of Date Everything: love, friendship, and hate. As you can imagine, whichever path you choose to follow will affect how characters interact with you too. I'm no stranger to obscure dating simulators, so when I first discovered Date Everything and was promised that almost every household object would become a dateable entity, my interests were immediately piqued. It's definitely going to be one of those games I decide to play ironically and then inevitably become obsessed with, but I'm not convinced I'll be able to persuade my friends to jump in this time around.

    "title": "'EA always preferred Mass Effect, straight up': Dragon Age creator reveals that his and Mass Effect's team 'didn't get along' at BioWare, as EA played favourites with its children",
    "article_text": "Two households, both alike in development (in fair BioWare, where we lay our scene). When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It sure seems like the sun is setting on Dragon Age—with Veilguard falling short of expectations after years in development,EA seemingly learning exactly the wrong lessons, andsweeping layoffs including senior talent, I'm not holding my breath for the future. In my view, Veilguard was asemi-decent action RPG with a fumbled story, which just wasn't enough. David Gaider, who authored the series but left Bioware in 2016 after Dragon Age: Inquisition, has revealed two truths. The first, not-so-shocking one, is that EA didn't really know what to do with Dragon Age (something you could glean from context)—the second, more shocking one is that BioWare was completely split down the middle circa 2010-2016, divided into two studios. Studios that, according to him, kinda resented each other. In a Bluesky post, Gaider explains that after Dragon Age: Inquisition left him feeling exhausted, he \"joined the new project that the former Mass Effect team in Edmonton was cooking up—the one that became Anthem … That was a mistake\"—not Anthem, but rather, going from a Dragon Age to a Mass Effect team at BioWare. \"The thing you need to know about BioWare is that for a long time it was basically two teams under one roof: the Dragon Age team and the Mass Effect team. Run differently, very different cultures, may as well have been two separate studios. And they didn't get along. \"The company was aware of the friction and attempts to fix it had been ongoing for years, mainly by shuffling staff between the teams more often. Yet this didn't really solve things, and I had no idea until I got to the [Anthem] team,\" he adds: \"The team didn't want me there. At all.\" The difference, Gaider explains, seems to me almosthigh schoolin nature. Like BioWare had its own coterie of nerds and jocks, Montagues and Capulets, Jets and Sharks—you get the idea. He explains that Anthem had initially been conceptualised as grungy, Aliens-esque science fiction—and that he'd been given marching orders to turn it into a science fantasy romp. This met the existing team like oil on water. \"I don't think anyone told the team this. So they thought this change was MY doing. I kept getting feedback about how it was 'too Dragon Age' and how everything I wrote or planned was 'too Dragon Age' … Yet this was a team where I was required to accept and act on all feedback, so I ended up iterating CONSTANTLY.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. He says that \"it became clear this was a team that didn't want to make an RPG … yet they wanted me to wave my magic writing wand and create a BioWare quality story without giving me any of the tools I'd need to actually do that.\" This illuminates some of Gaider's prior words about BioWare's shifting team culture. Back in 2023, he wrote that the studiohad come to \"quietly resent\" writers. Arriving in a new team only to be forced to \"accept and act\" on all feedback, be given orders contrary to their vision, andthenmade to be the fall-guy for those orders? Sure sounds like quiet resentment to me. Gaider did consider a world where he'd \"stick it out and try my best, but only if there was SOMETHING waiting on the other side, where I could have more say as Creative Director. I wanted to move up. I was turned down flat, no hesitation … Even more when I was told that, while I could leave the company if I wanted to, I wouldn't have any success outside of BioWare. But in blunter words.\" Yikes. In aquote to a reply, Gaider theorises that this disdain for Dragon Age wasn't just silo'd into the Mass Effect (ME) team, but a general distaste from EA on high: \"While I was at BioWare, EA always preferred Mass Effect, straight up. Their Marketing team liked it more. It was modern. It had action. They never quite knew what to do with DA, and whenever DA outperformed ME, ME got the excuses. If you ask me, it was always just shy of the axe since DA Origins.\" If you ask me, it was always just shy of the axe since DA Origins.\" Now, this is to be taken with a bit of salt. Gaider is a fantastic writer known for authoring one of gaming's best RPG worlds—but he was also severely burned by EA and BioWare, so there's some (understandable) subjectivity surrounding his words here. However, his description here does pass muster. Namely, if writing teams were made to act on feedback no matter what, in a studio leaning towards Mass Effect and away from its gritty RPG roots? That sure explains why a group of people who have done great work on Dragon Age in the past somehow produced something I actively couldn'tstand.It sure explains why Veilguardplays more like a Mass Effect game, too. EA very much hasn't given me faith that it even understands why things didn't shake out. In the aftermath of Veilguard's lukewarm reception, CEO Andrew WIlson pretty much chalked its failure up to alack of live service features. Which is so laughably, indescribably far from any of the criticisms I had for Veilguard that it's not even funny. If executives just listened to the people who are responsible for their successes… well, we'd live in a very different world, I suppose.

    "article_text": "Grow the barn into a massive, automated base of operations. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. So you've gone from a motel room to an apartment and a bungalow, and now it's time for thebarn. This building finally gives you enough space to properly play around with fully automated production lines inSchedule 1, letting you make heaps of cash without lifting a finger. You'll still have to take the product to your dealers, but that's it. After experimenting with various layouts and employee routes, I've concocted the best Schedule 1 barn setup. Below, I'll go over what you need to get and how to lay it out for maximum efficiency. If you're yet to get the barn, you can buy it from Ray's Real Estate for $25,000. Remember, they'll only accept money in your online account, not cash, so you'll likely need to knowhow to launder money in Schedule 1if you haven't been maxing out your deposit limit regularly. This is a guide for Schedule 1, a satirical videogame about the drug trade, and does not contain any real information about illicit drugs. Do not try anything in this guide. (Except in the videogame Schedule 1, then it's fine.) The best barn setup in Schedule 1 needs: The barn is a massive upgrade over the bungalow simply due to the space you have to mess around with; you've even got an upstairs! This means you can hire tons of employees to do your work for you. First off, buy a bed for each employee from Oscar in the warehouse and place them in your barn. I recommend putting them in the upstairs area since it's an awkward spot to place anything else.. Otherwise, everything goes downstairs, and I've separated the area into separate sections to keep things organised. This also means it's easy enough to expand your operations once you've recouped some of the costs of the barn itself. Don't worry, I'll go over future upgrades you can make later. You can place these however you want, but I've got the grow pots on the left, the chemist stations near the entrance on the right, the mixers along the right wall, and the packing stations in the back right. The middle section is pretty open since there's a lot of traffic with all these employees, but you can easily add shelves and drying racks here. The basic idea is to daisychain mixing stations so that drugs are mixed several times, adding more effects to them and increasing their value. You'll need to use themanagement clipboardon each mixer and set its output destination as the next mixer in the chain. Once a drug has been mixed, the chemist will then place it in the next mixer, where it should be mixed with another additive if you've got your handlers and shelves set up correctly. Assign your botanists to take supplies (soil, seeds, and additives like fertiliser) from a nearby large shelf and plant them in pots. I recommend moving on from the basic grow tents in favour of the separate pots and lighting racks you can buy from Oscar. Just buy pots as well as a rack and light for each of them, as these bring handy bonuses over the grow tents. Have your botanists deliver the finished product to drying racks to improve the buds' quality, or just drop them off on a large shelf. Handlers are the most complicated of the employees, as they don't just work a station. Sure, they'll automate the packing process for you, but you can also assign them individual tasks like moving product to different stations. It's important to set this up right, otherwise you'll halt your entire production process and have a hard time figuring out where it all went wrong. Here's how I assigned each handler in the barn: Handler 1: Mover(don't assign to a packing station) Handler 2: Packager(assigned to one of the packing stations) Handler 3: Packager(assigned to one of the packing stations) Packing takes the longest time, so setting up your handlers in this way avoids running into issues where someone is already occupied, halting the entire process. All you'll need to do is restock the mixing ingredients and the plastic bags, each of which is pulled from a specific shelf, making it quick and easy to keep track of. Take the mixed and packaged drugs to your dealers regularly so they can sell them all on your behalf. Despite having arguably the most important job in your business, the chemists are really easy to set up. Since you'll have two chemists, assign one to the chemistry station and lab oven, as well as the first mixer in the daisy-chain. The second chemist should be assigned to the final three mixers. Cleaners don't add too much to your setup, but they keep it nice and tidy so you're not tripping over yourself. Just place one bin by the crops, one by the meth stations, and another by the mixing stations. Assign them to the cleaner and they'll automatically pick up any rubbish and bin it for you. Now you've got a simple automated process going, I recommend tailoring it a little more by creating specific weed strains. Since you can't specify mixing recipes in the same way you can when planting weed or making meth, you'll need to get creative. Instead of two large shelves for mixing ingredients assigned to two mixers each with a handler moving the items, you could use one shelf per mixer. This would require another handler, but it will let you control which strains get mixed much better. You can also expand this setup easily by adding more mixers into the…mix. Four mixers let you create some pretty valuable strains, but the more the merrier. Just squeeze new mixers in the middle of the chain and remember to set the output of each mixer to the next one along to keep the items moving. Of course, you'll also need to stock up your shelves more regularly. Lastly, you can buy a brick press for $800 once you reach Bagman V. Handlers can use this to pack stacks of 20 weed or meth into a single brick. The best news is that these bricks can be stacked to 20, effectively letting you double the amount of drugs you can pass on to your dealers.

    "article_text": "A beast of a board, but holy moly that price. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Our newsfeeds have been dominated by one word over the past few weeks, and that word is \"tariff\". President Trump's favourite word, apparently. His administration's international trade policies have thrown markets the world over into something of a loop. Still, even among all this pricing turmoil, there's really no excuse for a $1,371 motherboard, is there? As reported byBenchlife, that's the dollar equivalent price for theAsus ROG Crosshair X870E ExtremeAM5 motherboard. It's suggested retail price in China is said to be RMB 9,999, which works out to some $1,371 at the time of writing. So what do you get for all that cash? Well, to be fair, a serious slab of electronics. The AM5 socket mobo supports up to 256 GB of 9000 MT/s DDR5 across four DIMM slots, up to five M.2 drives, four USB-C ports, and WiFi 7. Plus you get two PCIe 5.0 slots withQ-Release Slimmechanisms (both of which look to be the updated version of the socket after a kerfuffle overpotential GPU damagefrom the previous version earlier this year) and whatAsuscalls an Extreme OC kit—with a host of extra buttons, modes and component upgrades to facilitate mega CPU clocks. That's quite the impressive specs sheet, and worthy of the Extreme moniker. As is the price, which is truly monstrous. Of course, components are priced differently for different markets—and given the yo-yo-like nature of thecurrent US tariff situation, it's entirely possible the suggested price may change over the coming weeks, or even minutes at this rate. Should the price stick around, however, or work out to the equivalent when it eventually reaches western shores, it would easily be the most expensive consumer-gradeAM5 motherboardwe've seen to date. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. That's for a component that many system builders choose to overlook when pricing out a new build. Still, given the high-speed memory support and the wealth of overclocking-friendly components, this motherboard seems destined for the enthusiasts market no matter what price it eventually ends up receiving. I'd class myself as something of an enthusiast, but I would absolutely baulk at spending that sort of figure on a motherboard, of all things. Still, I'm not an extreme digit-chasing overclocker, and by the looks of it this mobo is built for those who desire the very tippity-top in AM5 motherboard tech. So, if that's you, it looks like you're going to need some deep pockets if you plan on picking up one of these in the near future. I'd rather drop that sort of cash on a GPU, if I really had to—but you do you, my overclocking friends.

    "title": "MSI will switch to AMD chips for its high-end Claw handheld PC if the rumour mill is to be believed",
    "article_text": "The current version uses an Intel Lunar Lake chip, which is potent but pricey. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. All of us in the hardware team at PC Gamer love a good handheld gaming PC, be it a Valve Steam Deck,AsusROG Ally X, or an MSI Claw 8 AI. Whether you want long-life portable playability or outright performance, there's something for everyone in the market. Nearly all of them use an AMD processor, but the Claw 8 AI stands out for using an Intel Lunar Lake chip. But if rumours are to be believed, its next iteration will join the crowd and sport an AMD Z2 Extreme. While this news has just popped up viaIgor's Lab, the first suggestion of this happening appeared back in January, from X userCodeCommando. The current version of MSI's Claw 8 AI+ handheld sports anIntel Core Ultra 7 258Vprocessor—better known by its architecture name, Lunar Lake, this is an eight-core, eight-thread chip with a Battlemage integrated GPU. It's one of thebest little laptop/handheld chipswe've seen in a long time and it gives theMSI Claw 8 AI+plenty of punch for gaming, easily beating theAsus ROG Ally X. It's not thebest gaming handheld PCyou can buy, though, partly because it's so darn big but mostly because it's pretty expensive. At $900, the Claw 8 is a fair bit pricier than the Ally X and way more than the Steam Deck. Most of that is down to the Intel Lunar Lake processor, as it sports on-package RAM chips. Most laptops and handheld manufacturers source the cheapest possible memory modules to improve the profit margin but that's not possible with the Core Ultra 200V range. And it's possibly why MSI is considering switching to an AMD processor for the next version of the Claw. Specifically, it's being claimed that MSI will use the forthcomingRyzen Z2 Extreme APU. AMD announced this chip at this year's CES event in January and this might be the original source of the claim that MSI will use it. We've not seen one in the flesh just yet, but like the originalRyzenZ1 Extreme, it has eight cores, 16 threads, and a boost clock of 5.0 GHz. Handling graphics are 16 RDNA 3.5 compute units, 33% more than in the Z1. That will probably give it the edge over the Lunar Lake chip in the current Claw 8 but not by a huge margin, as the Z2 Extreme will still be limited to 35 W. Not that it really matters as the main reason why MSI would want to change the processor is to earn more money from each unit it sells, even accounting for the fact that it will need to completely redesign the motherboard and cooling system. Naturally, we'd just prefer to have a cheaper Claw 8 but I suspect MSI will want to stick to the same price point, as it already markets its handheld as being a high-end model. Obviously, we'll just have to wait and see what MSI eventually releases but I'll be a little sad to see Lunar Lake disappear. It's a brilliant little chip, with far more poke than you'd think but it's also a bit too expensive for the market it's intended for.

    "title": "After 6 years of hype, can Hollow Knight: Silksong really live up to the sky-high expectations?",
    "article_text": "As the community grows increasingly rabid, I'm left wondering what players are actually expecting the game to be when it (hopefully) launches later this year. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Witha whole three seconds of footage, this month's Nintendo Direct put a new release window onHollow Knight: Silksong: 2025. The game has blown past announced release windows before, of course, but this does feel a bit more concrete—brief though the appearance was, this was still Nintendo announcing the lineup for its brand new console. There's some weight to that. But as the Silksong community once again goes wild with rapture, I'm left troubled by a question that's been floating around this game for a while now: after this long of a wait, what are we actually expecting Silksong to be? As originally conceived, Silksong was just an expansion forHollow Knight. If it had released as a relatively substantial DLC in 2019, I'm sure it would have been well received. Instead, that year it was announced as a full sequel, far expanded in scope from the original idea. And if that sequel had come out in 2020 and turned out to just be a new slice of good Hollow Knight content, we'd have probably all been happy with that too. Six years on from that initial reveal, however—during which the hype has only grown exponentially—the bar feels like it's set rather a lot higher. Dip into the Silksong subreddit and you'll find fanspraying for the game's release like it's the second coming. There's a comparable, arguably even greater fervor than the one we saw aroundElden Ring. How industry-shaking and genre-defining is Silksong going to have to be to live up to that? The original Hollow Knight was brilliant. Combining elements of Soulslikes with metroidvania in a unique and beautifully illustrated setting, it made exploration and discovery the focus, pushing you into frightening, uncertain, and deeply rewarding adventures beyond the borders of your map. But that was 2017—eight years ago. In the time since, the metroidvania genre has only continued to grow exponentially. Particularly 2D metroidvanias of the same style as Hollow Knight have absolutely flooded Steam. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Developers have pushed that Soulslike connection further and further forward, in games likeBlasphemousandDead Cells. They've taken the genre in strange and experimental new directions inRain WorldandAnimal Well. Major publishers have continued to imbue the genre with polish and spectacle, with entries likeUbisoft's slickPrince of Persia: The Lost Crown, or Moon Studios' gorgeousOri and the Will of the Wisps. An awful lot of ground has been covered, and there's an incredible amount of choice available to genre fans. Hollow Knight was excellent, and rightly lauded, but it didn't reinvent the genre or even kick off any of those trends.Salt and Sanctuarywas doing Soulslike-meets-metroidvania a year earlier, andthe first Ori gamewas a year before that. It's been influential, no doubt, but it was primarily just an exciting and creative take on a trend that was already well in motion. A standout in a crowd. After six years of hype and speculation, I can't help but feel Silksong will have to be a lot more than that to satisfy its rabid fanbase. Surely just another good slice of Hollow Knight won't suffice? It will need to be revolutionary, ground-breaking, and wildly ambitious, or else be deemed an underwhelming climax to over half a decade of build up. It's the same problem that trapped Duke Nukem Forever in development for 14 years. I suspect that in itself is a huge part of why it's taken so long to reach us in the first place. It's the same problem that trapped Duke Nukem Forever in development for 14 years. After a massive success, the resources are there to really take your time on the follow-up, but the more time that passes, the more the pressure grows. That leads to the developer constantly expanding the scope or reinventing the game, which takes up yet more time, during which expectations continue to grow, and plans must be scaled up all the more to keep pace with them. In Duke Nukem's case, that vicious circle ended in disaster, with the studio dissolved and its work left to rot until it was salvaged into a sorry but at least releasable form by Gearbox Software. And in many ways, Team Cherry's task has only been harder—similarly unwieldy levels of hype, but with a team of only three still relatively inexperienced developers trying to meet them. Hollow Knight was an incredible debut, but it was still a debut—Silksong will only be their second ever full game release, remember. I don't say any of this to wish doom on Team Cherry—far from it. I loved Hollow Knight and I'm rooting for the team 100%. I just worry that developer and fans together may have created an impossible situation for this game to launch into—and if it does end up struggling to match the version people have created in their heads, I dread to think how a community this invested will react.

    "title": "Trump administration exempts phones and most computing hardware from tariffs and then says they're not really exempt, just being lined up for a very special tariff 'bucket' of their own",
    "article_text": "This really isn't my kind of bucket list... When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. On Friday, the Trump administration exempted smartphones and a load of other computing related hardware from themonstrous 145% tariffsbeing applied to goods from China. But by Sunday, the President already seemed to be winding back on the winding back, explaining on Truth Social that there were no exemptions, it's just those product classes were beingmoved to a new tariff \"bucket\". Sorry, what? In short, it's pretty much impossible to keep up with the tariff chaos of late. But here's how things stand in the very moment these words are being written and how it all applies to the PC, at least as much as anyone can say. On Friday, the Trump administration announced exemptions from the full 145% tariff on goods being imported into the US from China. Among other device and product types, those exemptions covered smartphones, laptop computers, hard drives, CPUs, memory chips as well as flat-screen displays. 20 entries are listed in the exemptions posted on the US Customs and Border Protection website and it seems like the PC and all the components that go into it are largely and perhaps entirely covered off. The catch is that by Sunday, it emerged that the Trump Administration didn't view this set of explicit exemptions as, well, exemptions. Instead,U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told TV network ABCthat these devices and products would instead be subject to separate tariffs that would also broadly include computer chips and would be imposed \"in a month or so\". Then President Trump told reporters travelling with him on Air Force One that he would beannouncing new tariffs on semiconductors in the coming week. When asked whether some products such as smartphones and computing hardware might be exempted, Trump implied they may be. \"You have to show a certain flexibility. Nobody should be so rigid,\" he said. After that, he posted on Truth Social, saying, \"There was no Tariff 'exception' announced on Friday. These products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff 'bucket.'\" As if that wasn't enough, Reuters claims that Trump also indicated that specific US companies might enjoy exemptions, though no specifics were mentioned. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. To recap then, the Trump administration ratcheted up tariffs on most goods from China to 125% on top of a minimum 20% tariff making for a total of 145%, issued an exemption from the 125% rate for a tranche of computing and electronics products, and then announced plans to reapply a new set of tariffs to those exemption classes at the same time as implying some tech companies might get special treatment. In short, at the current time it is absolutely impossible to say what tariffs will apply to computing goods and how long they will last. However, given the administration's seeming unwillingness to stick with really punitive tariffs on goods that consumers buy, it's seems unlikely that the very highest tariff rates will apply to PC hardware. So, something in the 10%-20% range seems likely. Not a total disaster, but still far from welcome, especially for the likes of, say, graphics cards, which are already extremely expensive. Were we guessing, we'd also expect that prices to end users may be pushed up more than the headline tariff rates. Given the sheer quantity of chaos around tariffs, there are bound to be costs that go beyond that simple tariff rate that will likely be passed on to consumers, eventually. All of which means that even if the most catastrophic scenarios involving the prices of computing hardware doubling or more now seem unlikely, we should all probably brace for higher prices in the short to medium term.

    "article_text": "\"And I just want to assure you, you don't need to worry because there's absolutely nothing you can do to stop it.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Citizens from several Silicon Valley communities have been capturing videos of crosswalk buttons that appear to have been hacked in an unusual way. Rather than the usual messages warning about traffic safety, the buttons instead appear to play satirical messages from Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg soundalikes. One Zuckerberg-a-like infected crosswalk reportedly told would-be traffic crossers \"it’s normal to feel uncomfortable or even violated as we forcefully insert AI into every facet of your conscious experience. And I just want to assure you, you don’t need to worry because there’s absolutely nothing you can do to stop it.\" Another, this time impersonating the vocal stylings of one Elon Musk, appears to say \"Okay, look, you don't know the level of depravity I would stoop to just for a crumb of approval.\" It's unclear if the messages have been created byAI voice generation, or whether actual impersonators have been employed to record the satirical messages. Regardless, local news outletPalo Alto Online(viaTom's Hardware) reports that city employees have identified 12 downtown intersections that appear to have been tampered with, and have disabled the voice announcement feature until \"repairs can be made.\" In Menlo Park, the location ofMeta's global headquarters, another crosswalk button played a message from someone identifying themselves as \"Zuck\", who goes on to say: \"I just wanted to tell you how very proud I am of everything we've been building together. From undermining democracy to cooking our grandparents' brains with AI slop, to making the world less safe for trans people, nobody does it better than us. And I think that's pretty neat.\" A local resident reports that some of the impacted buttons were no longer playing the messages on Saturday morning. Officials from Menlo Park and Redwood City have also confirmed they are aware of the hacks, and are working on a fix. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. City of Palo Alto spokesperson Meghan Horrigan Taylor told Palo Alto Online: \"Other traffic signals in the city were checked and the impact is isolated. Signal operations are otherwise unaffected, and motorists are reminded to always exercise caution around pedestrians.\" For now, it appears no hacking group has claimed responsibility for the amus… I mean, public-safety-endangering messages, nor is it clear how each of the traffic signals were compromised. Still, it seems to have given several video-submitting residents a chuckle, and city officials something of a puzzle to solve over the weekend.

There's been a ton of updates forMarvel Rivals Season 2.Emma Frostis the new Vanguard, there arenew team-up abilities, and there's anew experimental featureto help ease performance issues. But it seems like there are more enhancements going around, as players have now fixated on Magik and Psylocke's new costumes, which have changed their character models slightly. \"Am I going crazy or did NetEase have the X-suit skins make their assets even bigger?\" oneplayer asked. The costumes may be comic-book accurate, but it really does look like the devs have taken some artistic liberties when it comes to the design of the character model. Not only do Psylocke and Magik look different in the X-suit than they do in other costumes, but their model now looks slightly ridiculous. \"Magik got caked up, ain't no way her default ass is that huge,\" anotherplayer says. \"Leaving this here and resting my case. Y'all can stop trying to gaslight me now.\" Meanwhile, other players are just sending out jokes about how funny this change is—the one comparing them to SpongeBob made me laugh, but it's actually surprisingly accurate. While I think these allegations definitely have a point, this witch hunt could've also been triggered by a recent discovery inMarvel Rivals. Some players recently noticed that most of the men in Marvel Rivals had their assets updated to make them slightly bigger. It's only a small change, but eagle-eyed fans managed to spot it within a couple of days of the new season launching. But all jokes aside, there's been a ton of gooner updates to Marvel Rivals recently. It's always been on the cusp of what's appropriate for a game which is rated 12 and over, but with these new updates to character models and the addition of Emma Frost, I'd be remiss if I didn't even question whether the rating needs another pass.

    "title": "Microsoft tweaks Edge to give it \"significant performance improvements\" though you're only getting up to 9% more oomph",
    "article_text": "While Chrome be all \"you're getting performance improvements?\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Web browsers aren't the most exciting pieces of software we use on a daily basis but if you use one for work, how fast and snappy they are makes the difference between a stress-free day and one that results in a foot through a monitor. So it's good news that Microsoft has given its Edge browser a handy performance bump, though you're only looking at 9% at best. Microsoft announced the success of its coding efforts via ashort blog, with the performance claim being ratified via theSpeedometer 3.0web benchmark. Confusingly, though, the reported speeds actually show a 10.5% improvement between Edge v134 and v133 and though the blog is dated 10 April, the latest version of Edge is v135. Given that Edge, like most browsers, automatically updates itself when you open it, I can't easily verify Microsoft's improvement claims. However, I can say that Edgeisnoticeably snappier than Chrome, the browser I have to use for work. Across an average of three runs of Speedometer 3.0, I get a score of 24.3 in Chrome and 27.8 in Edge. That said, the test is very sensitive to all kinds of things, such as how many active extensions you have running, what background applications you have enabled, and how clean your Windows installation is. My main PC gets used for work and gaming, so it's pretty cluttered with all kinds of junk. I had various programs running while carrying out the test, so my scores were much lower than Microsoft's. To be honest, though, I appreciateanyperformance uplift in a browser, especially since these days Chrome feels like a three-legged wombat wading through treacle. And don't get me started on its memory consumption. Sure, I have 48 GB of RAM and there's nothing wrong with using all of that, but even so, the number of times I've had a Chrome tab balloon to over 4 GB because of an iffy script running somewhere is quite alarming. This is especially alarming when Edge doesn't do the same thing. Of course, a faster browser isn't going to make your PC any better at gaming, even if you only play browser-based games (for some odd reason), but I wish more software developers would focus on improving performance rather than adding ever more features—I'm looking at you right now, Adobe. The days of Microsoft having the worst browser on the market are long gone and I have to say, I much prefer Edge over anything else. Sure, there are lots of elements about it that I really dislike but most of those can be bypassed by twiddling with the settings. And now that it's a wee bit faster, I'm even happier with it. I wonder if Microsoft can give Windows a 10% performance boost while it's on a roll. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "According to David Fincher's new Xbox ad with an extremely late '90s/early 2000s vibe, you can escape capitalism by buying Xbox games",
    "article_text": "Do not underestimate the power of Xbox, I guess. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. David Fincher was a music video director with clips like Madonna's Vogue to his name before he became a feature film director in the 1990s, responsible for movies like Seven, Fight Club, and The Social Network. His new commercial for Xbox and Samsung called Wake Up, co-directed with Romain Chassaing, will probably end up somewhere on the lower end of his filmography. It depicts a society of rats living and working bleak urban lives right out of Terry Gilliam's Brazil, or perhaps more blatantlySteve Cutts' similarly rat-themed short film Happiness. Only some of the rats aren't rats at all. Some of them escape the rat race by transforming into humans for the brief moments they spend playing Microsoft-published videogames. The funny thing is, only the protagonist playing Valorant on his Samsung OLED TV at the end actually seems to be playing an Xbox. The other humans are all playing Xbox Games, but on other devices—South of Midnight on a phone, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on a PC, and Avowed on a handheld that I assume is an Xbox-branded ROG Ally. The ad's trite in a way that harks back to Fincher's music video beginnings, like the kind of clip where office workers break out of their doldrums thanks to the transformative power of guitar music or whatever. It's even more reminiscent of an era of videogame advertising begun by Sony in 1999 with its Do Not Underestimate the Power of PlayStation campaign, wilfully weird ads likeDouble Lifein particular. Microsoft got in on the trend with its 2002 adLife is Short, which I think got its point across a lot better than this one does. It just feels a bit weird to have the corporationfiring employees who publicly criticize it for supplying AI technology to the Israeli militaryout here pretending it's some kind of cool subcultural alternative to the drudgery of a workaday life. The people responsible for Microsoft Teams should not be allowed to get away with this.

    "article_text": "Get all the help you need with today's Wordle. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Give your puzzle solving week a perfect start with our hint for today'sWordle. Take a look at it any time you need a bit of a push, it'll definitely help you out. Same goes for our more general tips too. And if all else fails or you're just not in the mood for some serious word-wrestling, the April 14 (1395) answer is here if you need it. One, two,threeyellow letters…anda green as well? On my first go? It isn't even my birthday. Wordle made up for it on the next guess though. I thought I was about to enjoy the easiest win I'd have all month, only to find myself a single letter off. I felt like a betrayal. Still, a quick win in three is still a good win. You'll always find these at the top of something. Maybe a wave or a hill, or perhaps on a bird or lizard's head. No, there is not a double letter in today's puzzle. A good starting word can be the difference between victory and defeat with the daily puzzle, but once you've got the basics, it's much easier to nail down those Wordle wins. And as there's nothing quite like a small victory to set you up for the rest of the day, here are a few tips to help set you on the right path: There's no racing against the clock with Wordle so you don't need to rush for the answer. Treating the game like a casual newspaper crossword can be a good tactic; that way, you can come back to it later if you're coming up blank. Stepping away for a while might mean the difference between a win and a line of grey squares. Get the week going. The answer to the April 14 (1395) Wordle isCREST. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Past Wordle answers can give you some excellent ideas for fun starting words that keep your daily puzzle-solving fresh. They are also a good way to eliminate guesses for today's Wordle, as the answer is unlikely to be repeated. Here are some recent Wordle answers: Wordle gives you six rows of five boxes each day, and you'll need to work out which secret five-letter word is hiding inside them to keep up your winning streak. You shouldstart with a strong wordlike ARISE, or any other word that contains a good mix of common consonants and multiple vowels. You'll also want to avoid starting words with repeating letters, as you're wasting the chance to potentially eliminate or confirm an extra letter. Once you hit Enter, you'll see which ones you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second guess should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. With a bit of luck, you should have some coloured squares to work with and set you on the right path. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it wassold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes. When baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do. She's now PC Gamer's word game expert, taking on the dailyWordlepuzzle to give readers a hint each and every day. Her Wordle streak is truly mighty.

    "title": "Five new Steam games you probably missed (April 14, 2025)",
    "article_text": "Sorting through every new game on Steam so you don't have to. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. 2025 games: Upcoming releasesBest PC games: All-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest MMOs: Massive worldsBest RPGs: Grand adventures On an average day about a dozen new games are released on Steam. And while we think that's a good thing, it can be understandably hard to keep up with. Potentially exciting gems are sure to be lost in the deluge of new things to play unless you sort through every single game that is released on Steam. So that’s exactly what we’ve done. If nothing catches your fancy this week, we've gathered thebest PC gamesyou can play right now and a running list of the2025 gamesthat are launching this year. Steam ‌page‌‌Release:‌ April 9Developer:‌ Green Tile Digital Locomoto is a cute lil' cosy game about conducting a train full of cute lil' animals. That means tending to your passengers' moment-to-moment needs while also making sure your train presents well. In other words, expect lots of whimsical conversations and tasks, intermingled with resource acquisition towards better and fancier furniture. While the art style looks like standard cosy fare from afar, the characters themselves have loads of character, and the quaint lil' villages you'll visit are full of carefully applied detail. Steam‌ ‌page‌Release:‌ April 8Developer:‌ Ubik Studios Leila is a narrative puzzle game which seems heavily inspired by the brilliant Amanita Design games (think Samorost, Creaks, Chuchel). It explores the life of Leila, whose confusing life decisions are rendered more fathomable via the solving of puzzles. What follows is an impressively varied set of puzzles set in beautiful—and occasionally disturbing—hand-drawn dioramas. Steam‌ ‌page‌‌Release:‌ April 11Developers:‌ Butterscotch ShenanigansHere's the sequel to one of the better-received crafting and building RPGs of late. This follow-up is very promising (to me) chiefly because the world isn't procedurally-generated like its predecessor: it's all handmade, which plays to the strengths of Butterscotch Shenanigans' colorful art sensibilities. All manner of weapons and traps can be crafted, all the better to gather the stuff you need to build a sprawling home base that will help expedite the process ofgathering more stuff. Looks like a perfect Steam Deck game: it's not verified but the studio says it works fine. Steam pageRelease:‌ April 8Developer:‌ BenBonk Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Slimekeep is a Game Boy-styled roguelike starring a cheerful little blot of slime who must stamp out the wrath of the \"evil Slime King\". With twin-stick shooter combat and light creature collecting elements, it's a pretty straightforward affair, elevated by smooth more-ish combat and a good sense of humor. There are over 80 weapons and upgrades, and the ability to cultivate a fierce slime pet, who you can command to do your dirty work for you. Steam‌ ‌page‌‌Release:‌ April 8Developer:‌ Christopher Bowes This \"simulator\" is both dumber and smarter than it first appears. It's basically a parkour game set in an endless, procedurally generated J D Wetherspoons, which is a UK chain of mostly-identical pubs. Pub Toilet Simulator 25 is all about navigating these labyrinthine identikit hellscapes in search of the lav. If you run too recklessly you'll spill your beer, but if you take too long you'll micturate in your trackies. PC gaming, folks. Shaun Prescott is the Australian editor of PC Gamer.

    "title": "Eli Roth on why the Borderlands movie sucked: 'You can’t prep a movie on that scale over Zoom'",
    "article_text": "You could probably pull together a better script, though. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The Borderlands movie was bad in a way videogame movies rarely are these days. In an era when Hollywood hears the phrase \"existing fandom\" and their eyes roll around and come up dollar signs, the idea of an adaptation casually disrespecting the original seems almost nostalgic. But that's exactly what the 2024 Borderlands movie did. It made Tiny Tina a genetically engineered part-alien \"chosen one\", turned Claptrap a kind of budget Bender who wants to kill all the humans but is programmed not to, and treated the fact Lilith is a siren as a twist to reveal at the end rather than a baseline aspect of her character you might know before walking into the cinema. Respecting the source material isn't the only way to make a good adaptation, of course. Netflix's Castlevania series had a subset of the fandom up in arms, but it was great. Borderlands blithely changed the core of every character it put on screen, but only to replace them with cliches like \"world-weary bounty hunter\" rather than anything interesting. Talking to podcastThe Town, viaDark Horizons, director Eli Roth tried to explain exactly what went wrong. He started by discussing the oddity of watching a movie he didn't have final cut on, and which was completed without him—Tim Miller, director of Deadpool, having taken over while Roth moved on to slasher film Thanksgiving—and asking, \"am I at the point of my career where I'm going to sit down to watch my own movie that says I wrote and directed it, and I really genuinely don't know what’s going to happen?\" Roth said he's still friends with many of the people involved, but also sounds aware of what a disaster the movie was, saying that he'd only work with the Lionsgate studio again if the circumstances were different. \"I think none of us, none of us anticipated how complicated things were gonna be with COVID,\" Roth said. \"Not just in terms of what we're shooting, but then you have to do pick-up shots or reshoots and you have six people that are all on different sets and every one of those sets is getting shut down because the cities have opened up, and now there's a COVID outbreak and it was just like… we couldn't prep in a room together, I couldn't be with my stunt people, I couldn't do pre-vis, everyone's spread all over the place. You can't prep a movie on that scale over Zoom and I think we all thought we could pull it off and we got our asses handed to us a bit.\" Which maybe does explain some of the nonsensical action scenes, but not the rest of the many issues Borderlands had. As Joshua Wolens said in ourreview, it's not even bad in a fun way. \"This is not a film you should ever queue up alongside infamous masterpieces like The Room and Manos: The Hands of Fate. It's just uninspired scene after loosely connected uninspired scene, each populated by a cast of actors who also seem kind of upset about experiencing the Borderlands movie.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "OpenAI promises new ChatGPT features this week – all the latest as Sam Altman says ‘we've got a lot of good stuff for you’",
    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Another week, anotherOpenAIannouncement. Just last week the company announcedChatGPTwould get amajor memory upgrade, and now CEO, Sam Altman, is hinting at more upgrades coming this week. On X (formerly Twitter),Altman wrote last night, \"We've got a lot of good stuff for you this coming week! Kicking it off tomorrow.\" Well, tomorrow has arrived, and we're very excited to see what the world's leading AI company has up its sleeve. We're not sure when to expect the first announcement, but we'll be live blogging throughout the next week as OpenAI showcases what it's been working on. Could we finally see the next major ChatGPT AI model? Sam Altman, OpenAI's CEO, wasn't on the livestream today but still took to X (formerly Twitter) to discuss the updates. He later retweeted a few others, including one user who said GPT-4.1 has already helped with workflows. Again, it's not available to the general consumer, but it is out in the API already with major enhancements promised. So, while you might not encounter it, some websites or services you use might be employing it. GPT-4.1 (and -mini and -nano) are now available in the API!these models are great at coding, instruction following, and long context (1 million tokens).benchmarks are strong, but we focused on real-world utility, and developers seem very happy.GPT-4.1 family is API-only.April 14, 2025 On the live stream, the OpenAI team walks through several demos that show how GPT-4.1 focuses on its three specialties – coding, following instructions, and long-context understanding – and that it's less degenerate and less verbose. OpenAI says these models are the fastest and cheapest models it has ever built, and all three are out now in the API. And if you have access to the API, these are available right now. It seems that with the instruction following, the focus is on letting the models understand the prompt as intended. I've experienced this in the standard GPT-4o mini with ChatGPT Plus, but it seems that with the evaluation metrics, the GPT-4.1 in the API is much better at following instructions since it's trained for it. And the ideal result will be a much more straightforward experience, where you might need to converse further to get the results you were after. This one is for developers, that is unless OpenAI has something else up its sleeve for later today. The AI giant has just unveiled GPT-4.1 in the API, a model purpose-built for developers. It's a family consisting of these models: GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and GPT-4.1 nano. While Sam Altman is not on the live stream for this unveiling, the OpenAI team – Michelle Pokrass, Ishaan Singal, and Kevin Weil – is walking through the news. GPT-4.1 is specifically designed for coding, following instructions, and long-context understanding. Hello, Jacob Krol – TechRadar's US Managing Editor News – stepping in here as we await whatever OpenAI has in store for us today. As my colleague John-Anthony has explained thus far, CEO Sam Altman teased, \"We've got a lot of good stuff for you\" this week, and it's a waiting game now. Around an hour to go until the expected OpenAI announcement. What will it be? Could we see GPT-4.1? Or will we see some new agentic AI capabilities that take OpenAI's offerings to a whole new level?Last week's memory upgrade was a huge deal, will today's announcement top that, or are we getting excited over a fairly minimal update? Stay tuned to find out! There's no information on when to expect OpenAI's announcement today, but based off of previous announcements we should get something around 6 PM BST / 1 PM ET / 11 AM PT. Your guess is as good as mine on whether we'll get daily announcements this week like the 12 days of OpenAI announcements in December. We'll be running this live blog over the next few days so as soon as Altman and Co makes an announcement you'll get it here. Stay tuned! Speaking of thepet-to-human trend, I tried it earlier, and I was horrified by the results. If you've not been on social media over the weekend, you may have missed thousands of people sharing images of what their dogs or cats would like as humans.This morning I decided to give it a go, and then I went even further and converted an image of myself into a dog. Let's just say this is one of my least favorite AI trends of 2025 so far, and I don't want to think about my French Bulldog as a human ever again! ChatGPT was the most downloaded app in the world for March, surpassing Instagram and TikTok to take the crown. That's an impressive feet for OpenAI's chatbot which has become the go-to AI offering for most people. The recently released native 4o image generation has definitely helped increase the user count, as I've started to see more and more of my friends and family jump on the latest trends. Whether that's creating a Studio Ghibli-esque image, an action figure of yourself, or turning your pet into a human, ChatGPT is thriving thanks to its image generation tools. One of the announcements I expect to see this week isChatGPT 4.1,the successor to 4o. Just last week, a report from The Verge said the new AI model was imminent, and considering Altman's tweet, it very well could arrive today. GPT-4.1 will be the successor to 4o, and while we're not sure what it will be called, it could set a new standard for general use AI models as OpenAI's competitors like Google Gemini and DeepSeek continue to catch up, and sometimes surpass ChatGPT. Let's get started by looking at what Sam Altman said on X yesterday. The OpenAI CEO hinted at a big week for the company, and it's all \"kicking off\" today! we've got a lot of good stuff for you this coming week!kicking it off tomorrow.April 13, 2025 Good afternoon everyone, TechRadar's Senior AI Writer, John-Anthony Disotto, here to take you through the next few hours in the lead up to OpenAI's first announcement of the week.

    "title": "AMD squares up to Intel and Nvidia in the budget GPU arena, as leaked Radeon RX 9060 XT specs and price show a potentially mighty affordable graphics card",
    "article_text": "An easy win for AMD? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. We might finally have a proper idea of whatAMD's long-awaited Radeon RX 9060 XT GPU is going to be capable of - and it's looking like it could be worthy of induction into thebest graphics cardhall of fame. Thanks to leaked information shared byMoore's Law Is Dead(MLID) onYouTube, we now know that the RX 9060 XT could be shipping with 32 compute units, a 128-bit memory bus with both 8GB and 16GB VRAM models available, and a TDP between 150W and 200W. Now, that's not a whole lot to go off at this point, but MLID's leak also notes that performance is 'aboveRTX 4060 Ti, but likely belowRX 7700 XT'. Okay, so that doesn't soundthatimpressive, but here's the thing: the leak also includes pricing details, and it's looking very attractive on that front. The 8GB model will reportedly cost between $269 and $299, while the 16GB version is claimed to be priced at $329-379. It's unclear whether these are potential price ranges AMD itself is still contemplating, or projected price ranges for AIB partner cards. For reference, the RTX 4060 Ti - which it supposedly outperforms - originally retailed at $399, and that was almost two full years' worth of GPU price inflation ago. Even if AMD hits us with the high end of these price estimates, it'll be a seriously competitively priced desktop GPU. AlthoughNvidiahas been dominating the high-performance end of the market with its RTX 5000 cards, there's no denying that AMD's biggest rival has been fumbling its budget game lately, leavingIntel(isn't that weird) as one of the best options in the affordable PC gaming space thanks to its excellentArc B580card. If Team Red can deliver RXT 4060 Ti-beating performance at a $269 price point, well, it's game set and match for the budget GPU market - at least, for the time being. It's worth noting, though, that MLID's source does say 'original plan as of a month ago' regarding these projected prices, likely in reference to the recent tech pricing carnage caused byDonald Trump's tariff war. So... watch this space, I guess. Another interesting point raised by the leaker was that the RX 9060 XT might lack hardware encoders - it's possible that to keep the price down, AMD has opted to include only the free-to-implement AV1 video encoder, not the (arguably better) H.264 and H.265 encode functions, since those require a licencing fee. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. The leaker claims there are no plans for a 'non-XT' RX 9060 card, which tracks given the two different VRAM versions and the suggested $269 base price. Additionally, AMD might be considering a Radeon RX 9050 XT, presumably priced somewhere in the $200-250 range. Christian is TechRadar’s UK-based Computing Editor.

    "title": "Apple has a plan for improving Apple Intelligence, but it needs your help – and your data",
    "article_text": "Still anonymous When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. AppleIntelligence hasnot had the best year so far,but if you think Apple is giving up, you're wrong. It has big plans and is moving forward with new model training strategies that could vastly improve its AI performance. However, the changes do involve a closer look at your data – if you opt-in. In a new technical paper from Apple's Machine Learning Research, \"Understanding Aggregate Trends for Apple Intelligence Using Differential Privacy,\" Apple outlined new plans for combining data analytics with user data and synthetic data generation to better train the models behind many of Apple Intelligence features. Up to now, Apple's been training its models on purely synthetic data, which tries to mimic what real data might be like, but there are limitations. In Genmoji's, for instance, Apple's use of synthetic data doesn't always point to how real users engage with the system. From the paper: \"For example, understanding how our models perform when a user requests Genmoji that contain multiple entities (like “dinosaur in a cowboy hat”) helps us improve the responses to those kinds of requests.\" Essentially, if users opt-in, the system can poll the device to see if it has seen a data segment. However, your phone doesn't respond with the data; instead, it sends back a noisy and anonymized signal, which is apparently enough for Apple's model to learn. The process is somewhat different for models that work with longer texts like Writing tools and Summarizations. In this case, Apple uses synthetic models, and then they send a representation of these synthetic models to users who have opted into data analytics. On the device, the system then performs a comparison that seems to compare these representations against samples of recent emails. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. \"These most-frequently selected synthetic embeddings can then be used to generate training or testing data, or we can run additional curation steps to further refine the dataset.\" It's complicated stuff. The key, though, is that Apple applies differential privacy to all the user data, which is the process of adding noise that makes it impossible to connect that data to a real user. Still, none of this works if you don't opt into Apple's Data Analytics, which usually happens when you first set up your iPhone, iPad, or MacBook. Doing so does not put your data or privacy at risk, but that training should lead to better models and, hopefully, a better Apple Intelligence experience on your iPhone and other Apple devices.

    "title": "\"Slopsquatting\" attacks are using AI-hallucinated names resembling popular libraries to spread malware",
    "article_text": "AI doesn't always hallucinate a different open source package, and this error can be mapped out When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Security researchers have warned of a new method by which Generative AI (GenAI) can be abused in cybercrime, known as 'slopsquatting'. It starts with the fact that different GenAI tools, such as Chat-GPT, Copilot, and others, hallucinate. In the context of AI, “hallucination” is when the AI simply makes things up. It can make up a quote that a person never said, an event that never happened, or - in software development - an open-source software package that was never created. Now, according to Sarah Gooding fromSocket, many software developers rely heavily on GenAI when writing code. The tool could write the lines itself, or it could suggest the developer different packages to download and include in the product.

Preferred partner (What does this mean?) The report adds the AI doesn’t always hallucinate a different name or a different package - some things repeat. “When re-running the same hallucination-triggering prompt ten times, 43% of hallucinated packages were repeated every time, while 39% never reappeared at all,” it says. “Overall, 58% of hallucinated packages were repeated more than once across ten runs, indicating that a majority of hallucinations are not just random noise, but repeatable artifacts of how the models respond to certain prompts.” This is purely theoretical at this point, but apparently, cybercriminals could map out the different packages AI is hallucinating and - register them on open-source platforms.

Therefore, when a developer gets a suggestion and visits GitHub, PyPI, or similar - they will find the package and happily install it, without knowing that it’s malicious. Luckily enough, there are no confirmed cases of slopsquatting in the wild at press time, but it’s safe to say it is only a matter of time. Given that the hallucinated names can be mapped out, we can assume security researchers will discover them eventually. The best way to protect against these attacks is to be careful when accepting suggestions from anyone, living or otherwise.

    "article_text": "UnitedHealth is now “aggressively” chasing borrowers When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. UnitedHealth Group is “aggressively” going after small healthcare organizations that borrowed money following a huge cyberattack on its subsidy Change Healthcare. Theattack is said to have affected almost 190 million Americans, and was the largest US healthcare data breach ever, and was incredibly disruptive, with systems only fully restored 9 months later, costing over $2 billion to recover from. After the attack, interest-free loans were offered by Change to help medical practices with short-term cash flow needs. The firm is now demanding these funds be “immediately” repaid, with some organizations asked to repay hundreds of thousands of dollars in just a few days.

Preferred partner (What does this mean?) Optum, UnitedHealth’s financialarm, has now confirmed it will withhold separate funds until these loans are repaid. Doctors with their own private practices used these loans to cover losses from the disruption following the cyber incident, which cost some hundreds of thousands - and some reportedly used personal savings to keep practices afloat. It’s worth noting UnitedHealth has a net worth of over $470 billion (at the time of writing), and CEO Andrew Witty made over $23 million in compensation in 2023. Optum has collected over $4.5 billion of the $9 billion debt, but since many practices lost so much in downtime thanks to the disruption, many will struggle to repay the money owed in the just 5 day timeframe Optum have imposed, with one doctor describing it as a “shakedown.” Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! UnitedHealth paid the ransomware attackers $22 million in cryptocurrency to recover its data - but the operation was still shut down in its entirety, and Change never got its data back.

    "article_text": "Host of agent-themed launches and upgrades steal the show at Cloud Next 25 When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. With AI agents becoming an increasingly common sight in businesses everywhere,GoogleCloud has become the latest major company to ramp up its efforts in the space. At itsGoogle Cloud Next 25event, the company unveiled several upgrades to its Agentspace platform to make agent discovery and adoption easier. Just to give things an extra boost, Google Cloud also announced a new partnership withNvidiadesigned at making its offerings even more intuitive. Following the initial launch ofGoogle Agentspace in December 2024, the updates were mainly aimed at making creating and deploying AI agents easier This includes giving employees access to Agentspace search and analysis tools directly from the search box in Google Chrome. The multimodal search capabilities can help track down exactly the data needed within your business, or give customers access to the answers they need. The search results can cover content from the web, or from your business' most commonly-used apps and software, including the likes of Google Workspace,Microsoft365, and apps like Jira,Salesforce, or ServiceNow. Elsewhere, workers can also use a new Agent Gallery to find and deploy new agents quickly as well as creating their own agents with the new no-code Agent Designer platform - or launch some of Google's latest own-brand offerings, Idea Generation agent and Deep Research agent. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! In order to make sure all these new agents co-exist effectively, Google Cloud has also launched a new interoperability protocol called Agent2Agent, which it says, \"will allow AI agents to communicate with each other, securely exchange information, and coordinate actions on top of various enterprise platforms or applications.\" Built on existing standards to allow easier integration, the company has already signed up more than 50 partners for the launch, including enterprise heavyweights such as Salesforce, PayPal, Box, Atlassian and more. Finally, to harness the power of some of the most powerful computing hardware around today, Google Cloud and Nvidia have signed a collaboration bring the former's AI models to Nvidia Blackwell HGX and DGX platforms, as well as Nvidia Confidential Computing. “By bringing our Gemini models on premises with Nvidia Blackwell’s breakthrough performance and confidential computing capabilities, we’re enabling enterprises to unlock the full potential of agentic AI,” said Sachin Gupta, vice president and general manager of infrastructure and solutions at Google Cloud. “This collaboration helps ensure customers can innovate securely without compromising on performance or operational ease.” Mike Moore is Deputy Editor at TechRadar Pro.

    "title": "My favorite iOS 18 app is a tool you're probably not using – and I suggest you try it right away",
    "article_text": "Oh so simple, oh so slick When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Even though we live in a world festooned with smart stuff, from slick ways to monitor your activity to generative AI and other such opinion-dividing tools, sometimes it’s the simple things that really feel special. And for me, it’s theiPhone’s Passwords app. Introduced withiOS 18, the Passwords app effectively builds out onApple’siCloud Keychainsystem, which allows passwords and login credentials to be saved in the cloud and automatically fill in said credentials once a security check via the likes of Face ID has been carried out. What the Passwords app does is build in a slicker interface on this functionality to facilitate easier password management. There's also support for third-party browsers, the ability to share passwords with trusted groups of people and get alerts of potential security issues. Naturally, there are third-party password management services that do all this too, but if you forget your master password – something I may have done in the past – you can be a little screwed. So having a native password manager baked into iOS is neat. And it’s a rather slick app; one that despite getting shown off atWWDC 2024, I sort of forgot about. So going by that, the app may have slipped your mind too, given how easily it integrates with daily iPhone life. But more recently, I’ve been finding out how handy it is. The biggest benefit of the app is for when a freeloading family member requests the password to one of the most popular streaming series that rhymes with 'transfix', and I can’t remember it off by heart or have the patience to dig it out of the reams of nonsense that make up the family’s WhatApp chat. Instead, I simply head over to the Passwords app, let Face ID do its thing, then navigate to one of the services or accounts I use, then tap on the passwords field to reveal the collection of numbers and letters I’ve used to secure the account. From there it’s easy to copy the password and send it to the requesting party, either in a separate message, via AirDrop or set up a ‘Shared Group’ in which select passwords can be shared with select people. It’s so easy to use but also feels secure too, arguably more so than theGooglepassword manager function in Chrome. On top of this easy password access, the app will also note which passwords may have been compromised via a leak. It then lets you trigger the process of changing them; though really that function just pushes you towards the service’s website to login and change your password there. So whileApple Intelligencetools might grab the headlines, and the Photos app has more interesting functions in iOS 18, it’s this simple Passwords app that’s grabbed my attention lately. Thebest Android phoneshave similar functionality, but in my experience it feels like the iOS 18 Passwords app… well… just works; yes, I hate myself for saying that, but that’s just how I feel. To use the app, simply search ‘Passwords’ in the drop-down menu in iOS 18. And do make sure youriCloudKeychain is synced with your iPhone to get the most out of the app. It's also worth noting the Passwords app is on macOS too, which is handy if you want to dive into your saved passwords, and discover accounts you may have forgotten about, on a larger display.

    "title": "Chipolo's Pop item tracker upgrades the AirTag in nearly every way I wanted, and it works with Android too",
    "article_text": "Six colors to pick from and a key ring hole built-in When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Sure,Apple’s AirTagmight be the top dog in the world of iPhone item trackers, thanks to an exclusive feature or two. But what if I told you there is another item tracker that is just as compact, has a built-in key ring for easy attachment, and comes in several vibrant colors? Sold, right? Well, the Chipolo Pop is precisely that and is simply the colorful AirTag that I’ve always wanted. I bet a few of you've wanted that as well. Chipolo, withseveral other models, is not a brand-new entrant into item trackers either. Further, the Chipolo Pop supportsApple’s FindMy standard, so it will fast-pair with an iPhone and live within the FindMy app, but it’s also fully compatible with Android andGoogle’s network. If you’re already sold,it’s up for order now at $29 / £30 from Chipolo for oneor $89 / £90 for four of them.And if you prefer Amazon, it's also up for order there. Just like an AirTag or even theMotoTag– a Motorola-made item tracker that looks like Apple’s – the Chipolo Pop is a circular item tracker just 38.8 millimeters in diameter. It’s about the size of an AirTag nut and levels up the experience in two key ways. First, it comes in six colors: blue, yellow, red, green, black, and white. Second, it has a built-in key ring hole so that you can easily attach it to a set of keys, a bag, or really anything else. Chipolo ships it with a color-matched key ring as well. It’s also powered by a commonly found battery, the CR2032 – just like the AirTag. Chipolo says the Pop should last for up to a year of use. With the IP55 resistance, it can also handle a bit of water and dust. That’s handy for an item tracker that could get left outdoors. Maybe the single biggest advantage of the Chipolo Pop is that it integrates with Apple’s or Google’s FindMy device networks. This means that the tracker's location will ping off thousands of these devices to help give an accurate location. Apple’s network is made up of iPhones, iPads, and Macs. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. That also means that after you get the Chipolo Pop and are ready to set the item tracker up, you’ll need to hold it next to your Android phone or iPhone and follow the splash screen that appears on the device. During this, it will also link with your Google or Apple account. You can also stretch the mileage of the Pop and get more features with the Chipolo app for Android or iOS – here, you can set a custom alert and even have it ring your device if you click the button on the Pop in. That’s a trick even Apple’s AirTag can’t do. On Android, you can also set up alerts to notify you if you leave the Pop behind. While we haven’t tested it yet, there is a speaker integrated within the Pop – so you can ping it and hear your selected chime – and Chipolo promises it offers a “seriously loud ring.” So, for those with an iPhone, minus the AirTag’s Precision Finding, the Chipolo Pop is basically the colorful AirTag I’ve always wanted. It nearly checks off all the boxes, doesn’t raise the price, and stretches the value further. Case in point, if I get a Chipolo Pop, I don’t need to buy an additional accessory to attach it to my keys or a backpack. That isn’t the case with an AirTag. If you’re eager to add the Chipolo Pop to your keys, backpack, or other items, you can order it right now fromChipolo’s online storeor onAmazon.

    "article_text": "Former CEO Jeff Bezos is still costing Amazon millions When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Amazonpaid out more to Jeff Bezos than its current CEO, Andy Jassy in 2024, but this doesn’t mean the founder had a higher salary to live off. In fact, Jassy’s salary amassed to around 4.5x more than Bezos’ - $365,000 compared with $81,840 - but where the two leaders differed was in other allowable expenses and costs. Bezos had been awarded $1.6 million in security costs in 2024, with the company defending high security expenses due to the former CEO’s low salary and company benefits. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, together with CFO Brian Olsavsky, Amazon Stores CEO Douglas Herrington and Chief Global Affairs & Legal Officer David Zapolsky received $365,000 in salary, a figure unchanged from the year before. AWS CEO Matt Garman received a slightly smaller $358,750 package. Defending its decision to compensate Jassy a further $1.2 million, plus tens of thousands for other C-suite execs, the company noted: “We believe that all Company-incurred security costs are reasonable and necessary and for the Company’s benefit.” “The 2024 annual total compensation of our median compensated employee (identified from all full- and part-time permanent and temporary employees worldwide, excluding our CEO) was $37,181,” Amazon also noted.

The answers to today's Connections, game #674, are… I failed completely again, wasting a lot of time barking up the wrong trees. After getting DESIST fairly easily I struggled with the remaining 12 words. I was convinced there was a group about songwriting with BRIDGE, HOOK and CHORUS all being key elements of a hit tune. Scrambling for the fourth word I included BELL and got the dreaded “groups of four” pop-up. After another mistake, I switched to collecting a group associated with Peter Pan – PAN and HOOK were locks but I went down a dead-end route and thought we were looking for elements of a particular scene, so I included BELL and BRIDGE, all very tenuous. With “one away” I really should have got the purple group, but I made the wrong choices and went for HERO and TRAGEDY. Two defeats in a row is not a good look. How did you do today? Let me know in the comments below. NYT Connections is one of several increasingly popular word games made by the New York Times. It challenges you to find groups of four items that share something in common, and each group has a different difficulty level: green is easy, yellow a little harder, blue often quite tough and purple usually very difficult. On the plus side, you don't technically need to solve the final one, as you'll be able to answer that one by a process of elimination. What's more, you can make up to four mistakes, which gives you a little bit of breathing room. It's a little more involved than something like Wordle, however, and there are plenty of opportunities for the game to trip you up with tricks.

    "title": "5 reasons why Apple making iPadOS 19 more like macOS is a great idea – and 3 reasons why it could be a disaster",
    "article_text": "The iPad Pro is great hardware that’s held back by software When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. NotoriousAppleleaker Mark Gurman has reported that Apple is planning a major overhaul of iPadOS (theoperating systemiPads use) to make it work a lot like macOS – and I think this could be a great move, though one that also comes with plenty of danger. Gurman is very well respected when it comes to Apple leaks, so while we probably won’t get any official idea of howiPadOS 19is shaping up untilApple’s WWDC event in June, this could still be a big hint at the direction Apple is planning to take its tablet operating system. In his weeklyPower On newsletter for Bloomberg, Gurman claims that “this year’s upgrade will focus on productivity, multitasking and app window management — with an eye on the device operating more like a Mac,” and that Apple is keen to make its operating systems (macOS, iPadOS, iOS and visionOS primarily) more consistent. As someone who uses theM4-powered iPad Pro, this is music to my ears. Ever since I reviewed it last year, I’ve been confused by the iPad Pro. It was Apple’s first product to come with theM4 chip, a powerful bit of hardware that is now more commonly found in Macs and MacBooks (previous M-class chips were only used in Apple’s Mac computers, rather than iPad tablets). However, despite offering the kind of performance you’d expect from a MacBook, I found the power of the M4 chip largely went to waste with the iPad Pro due to it still using iPadOS, and was confined to running simplified iPad apps, rather than full desktop applications. Even if this move still means you can’t run macOS apps on the iPad Pro, it could still make a massive difference, especially when it comes to multitasking (running multiple apps at the same time and switching between them). If Apple nails this, it would go a long way to making the iPad Pro a true MacBook alternative. But, making iPadOS more like macOS could bring downsides as well, so I’ve listed five reasons why this could be a great move – and three reasons why it could all go wrong. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. The biggest win when it comes to making iPadOS more like macOS is with the powerful iPad Pro. Hardware-wise, the iPad Pro is hard to fault, with a stunning screen, thin and light design, and powerful components. However, despite its cutting-edge hardware, it can only runiPad apps. These are generally simple and straightforward apps that have been designed to be used with a touchscreen. These apps also need to be able to be run on less powerful iPads as well. This means advanced features are often left for the desktop version of the app, and any performance improvement owners of the iPad Pro get over people using, say, the iPad mini will be modest. Certainly, when I use the iPad Pro, it feels like a lot of its power and potential is limited by this – so a lot of the expensive hardware is going to waste. Making iPadOS more like macOS could – in an ideal world – lead to the ability to run Mac applications on the iPad Pro. At the very least, it could mean some app designers make their iPad apps come with a Mac-like option. If it means multitasking is easier, then that will be welcome as well. One of the things I struggled with when I triedusing the iPad Pro for work instead of my MacBookwas having multiple apps open at once and quickly moving between them. Cutting and pasting content between apps was particularly cumbersome, not helped by the web browser I was using (Chrome) being the mobile version that doesn’t support extensions. It made tasks that would take seconds on a MacBook a lot more hassle – a critical problem that meant I swiftly moved back to my MacBook Pro for work. If, as rumored, this major change to iPadOS will be announced at Apple’sWWDC2025 event, then it could nicely coincide with therumored reveal of a new iPad Pro powered by the M5 chip. While I’m not 100% convinced about an M5 iPad Pro, seeing as Apple is still releasing M4 devices, the timing would make sense. If Apple does indeed announce an even more powerful iPad Pro, then iPadOS, in its current form, would feel even more limiting. However, if Apple announces both a new M5 iPad Proandan overhaul of iPadOS to make use of this power, then that could be very exciting indeed. And, with WWDC being an event primarily aimed at developers, it could be a great opportunity for Apple to show off the new-look iPadOS and encourage those developers to start making apps that take full advantage of the new and improved operating system. Gurman’s mention of Apple wanting to make its operating systems more consistent is very interesting. One of Apple’s great strengths is in its ecosystem. If you have an iPhone, it’s more likely that you’ll get anApple Watchover a different smartwatch, and it means you might also have an Apple Music subscription and AirPods as well. Making iPadOS more like macOS (and iOS and other Apple operating systems) can benefit both Apple and its customers. If a MacBook owner decides to buy an iPad (Apple’s dream scenario) and the software looks and works in a similar way, then they’ll likely be very happy as it means their new device is familiar and easy to use. And that could mean they buy even more products, which will again be just what Apple wants. I don’t know about you, but I just think of iPadOS as just iOS (the operating system for iPhones) with larger icons. Maybe that’s unfair, butwhen the iPad first launched, it was running iOS, and even with the launch of iPadOS in 2019, there are only a handful of features and apps that don’t work on both operating systems. By making iPadOS a combination of iOS and macOS, it would ironically mean that iPadOS would feel like a more unique operating system, and it could finally step out of the shadow cast by iOS while still benefitting from being able to run almost all apps found in the iPhone’s massive app library. iPadOS getting macOS features could work both ways – so could we get some iPad-like features on a Mac or MacBook? There are things that iPadOS does better, such as being more user-friendly for beginners and turning an iPad into a second display for a nearby MacBook. All this would be great to see in macOS. Having the choice of a larger interface that works well with touchscreens could even pave the way for one of the devices people most request from Apple: atouchscreen MacBook. One of iPadOS’ best features is its simplicity, and while I feel that simplicity holds back a device like the iPad Pro, for more casual users on their iPad, iPad mini, or iPad Air, that ease-of-use is a huge bonus. If iPadOS were to become more like macOS, that could delight iPad Pro owners, but let’s not lose sight of the fact that the iPad Pro is a niche device that’s too expensive for most people. macOS-like features on an iPad mini, for example, just doesn’t make sense, and Apple would be silly to make a major change that annoys the majority of its customers to please just a few. The iPad initially launching with iOS was an excellent decision by Apple, as it meant that people who had bought the new product had instant access to thousands of iPhone apps. While it wasn’t perfect at first – some apps didn’t work well with the iPad’s larger screen- it was likely much easier than if the iPad had launched with a completely new operating system that then needed developers to create bespoke applications for it. Think of it this way: if you were an app developer with limited resources (both time and money), would you make an app for a system that already had millions of users or risk making an app for a new product with a tiny user base? The answer is simple – you’d go for the large user base (almost) every time, so if it hadn’t launched with iOS and access to the App Store, then the original iPad could have been a flop. Just look atMicrosoft’s attempts with the Windows Phone – it needed developers to create a third version of their apps, alongside iOS and Android versions. Very few developers wanted to do that, which meant Windows Phone devices launched with far fewer apps than Android and iPhone rivals. If iPadOS moves closer to macOS, could we see fewer apps make it to iPad? While iPads are incredibly popular, they are still nowhere near as popular as iPhones, so if devs have to choose between which audience to make an app for, you can bet it’ll be for the iPhone. However, if future iPadOS apps will remain essentially iOS apps but with an optional macOS-like interface, that could still mean the new look is dead on arrival, as developers will prefer to concentrate on the interface that can be used by the widest audience rather than just iPad Pro users. iPadOS works so well because it’s been designed from the ground up to be used on a touchscreen device. You can buy a new iPad, and all you need to do is jab the screen to get going. However, macOS is designed for keyboard and mouse/trackpad, so if you want to make the most out of a future version of iPadOS that works like macOS, you’re going to need to invest in peripherals – and some of them can be very expensive. TheMagic Keyboard for iPad Prois a brilliant bit of kit that quickly attaches to the iPad and turns it into a laptop-like device with a physical keyboard and touchpad, but it also costs $299 / £299 / AU$499 – a hefty additional expense, and I can almost guarantee that to use any macOS-like features in iPadOS, you’ll really need some sort of peripherals. This will either make things too expensive for a lot of people, or if you choose a cheaper alternative such as a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, it then takes away from the simplicity of using an iPad. This could mean fewer people actually use the macOS-like elements, which in turn would mean there’s less incentive for app developers to implement features and designs that only a small proportion of iPad users will use. So, I’m all for more macOS features for my iPad Pro – but I am also very aware that I am in the minority when it comes to iPad owners, and Apple needs to be careful not to lose what made the iPad so successful in the first place just to placate people (like me) who moan about iPads being too much like iPads. Maybe it would just be better if I stuck with my MacBook instead. Matt is TechRadar's Managing Editor for Core Tech, looking after computing and mobile technology.

    "title": "Bad news, the Fujifilm X100VI may now be impossible to buy in the US –here's what to get instead",
    "article_text": "But could it be good news for other countries? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. TheFujifilm X100VIhasn't been easy to find at the best of times since it launched just over a year ago – but the compact camera could soon become genuinely impossible to buy new in the US, according to new rumors. An anonymous source has apparently toldFuji RumorsthatFujifilmrecently \"contacted retailers about the suspension of orders\" for the X100VI, alongside the newFujifilm GFX100RFand the black version of theFujifilm X-M5. If that's true, it means backorders for the Fujifilm X100VI may now be suspended in the US, which means not being able to join the queue of people waiting for one. It'd also mean that pre-orders for the GFX100RF, which was announced less than a month ago, may be suspended in the US before it's even got started. The little Fujifilm X-M5 seemingly hasn't been as badly affected, with the suspension of pre-orders apparently only affecting the black version. But it's possible that stock of the silver version, which is already shipping, could also run dry. We've contacted Fujifilm for a response to these rumors and will update this story if we hear back. The problem is seemingly that, as Fuji Rumors claims, the X100VI and X-M5 are both made in China, which the US has subjected to a 145% tariff. The GFX100RF is made in Japan, so the reasons for its apparent issues in the US are less obvious. Something that also isn't clear is whether or not the knock-on effect could be the greater availability of these three cameras in other regions. In the UK, for example, theFujifilm X100VI is still largely on backorder, but it may also not be possible to divert stock to different regions due to variations in accessories and warranties. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. We don't yet know how accurate these reports of Fujifilm suspending retailer orders for the X100VI in the US are. But either way, it's already very difficult to buy the camera new, with the X100VI listed as 'out of stock' on Fujifilm's store and backordered at retailers. The trade war certainly isn't going to ease that situation. Fortunately, the X100VI isn't your only option. I've previously written about how that camera hashelped raise second-hand compact camera pricesdue to its popularity, but that effect started to wane in early 2025 as the stock issues eased. If you want a powerful compact camera that's genuinely pocketable (and smaller than the X100VI), then theRicoh GR IIIandGR IIIx(which I'd go for due to its 40mm lens) both remain good options. We've also recentlynoted the availability of the Leica D-Lux 8,while other solid second-hand options include thePanasonic Lumix LX100 IIandFujifilm X-Pro 2.But my choice would be either theFujifilm X-T30 IIorX-T50– in fact, I bought the latter when it dropped to a new record-low price recently. Neither X-T models are as small or as desirable as the rangefinder-style X100VI, but they do come with the considerable benefit of being able to change lenses. That makes them potentially better long-term buys, and certainly superior short-term ones – given they're actually available to buy both new and used. Mark is TechRadar's Senior news editor.

    "article_text": "Countries aspiring to join the European Union must avoid participating in the 80th anniversary celebrations of Russia’s victory in World War II, the bloc’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, has said. Victory Day, one of Russia’s most important public holidays, is marked by a large military parade on Red Square and a moment of silence to honor the estimated 26.6 million Soviet lives lost during the war against Nazi Germany and its allies. Some EU officials argue that attending celebrations in Moscow would be inappropriate given the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. “Any participation in the May 9th parades – or celebrations – in Moscow will not [be] taken lightly on the European side, considering that Russia is waging a full-scale war in Europe,”Kallas said following a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg on Monday. When asked whether the bloc is monitoring which countries plan to attend the event in Moscow, Kallas responded that candidate nations should also refrain from participating. “We made it very clear that we do not want any candidate country to take part in the May 9 events in Moscow,”she said. Instead, Kallas urged leaders of EU member states and officials to visit Kiev“as much as possible, to really show our solidarity and that we are with Ukraine.” According to Euractiv, Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico is currently the only leader of an EU nation who has confirmed plans to attend the celebrations in Moscow.“It is natural that as Prime Minister of the Slovak Republic, I have a strong interest in participating in the official celebrations of the victory over fascism,”he said last year. The leaders of Serbia and Armenia, both EU candidate countries, have also indicated they will attend. Russian President Vladimir Putin said earlier this month that Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to Moscow on May 9. Earlier this month, German media reported that Berlin advised local institutions not to invite Russian or Belarusian officials to events commemorating World War II. Moscow responded by calling the move a“blatant insult”to the memory of Nazi victims and fallen Soviet soldiers.",

    "title": "Russia ‘not chasing anyone’ for sanctions relief – Lavrov",
    "article_text": "Trade between Russia and the US has seen a major downturn as a result of Washington’s“illegal sanctions,”Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said. However, Moscow is“not chasing after anyone”to lift the restrictions, according to the top diplomat. Washington and its allies placed punitive restrictions on Moscow after Crimea’s reunification with Russia in 2014, and later over Moscow’s alleged meddling in American elections. The sanctions were drastically expanded by the former US President Joe Biden’s administration following the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022. Speaking to Kommersant on Monday, Lavrov said the globalization of the world economy had been destroyed after sanctions became“the only tool of [Biden’s] foreign policy.” He noted that the administration of President Donald Trump had begun discussing trade and economic cooperation with Moscow already during initial contacts, but made no secret of pursuing material gain in its foreign policy decisions. According to Lavrov, economic cooperation between the countries has dropped“by about 95% compared to the peak of around $30 billion ten years ago, mostly due to illegal sanctions.” Future cooperation would depend entirely on Washington, Lavrov said, stressing“We are not chasing anyone or asking for sanctions to be lifted.” Russia has repeatedly condemned the Western sanctions as illegal and ineffective, saying they have failed to destabilize its economy or isolate it from the global financial system. Sanctions have instead backfired on the countries that imposed them, while Russia has focused on shifting trade to Asia and the Global South, primarily China and India. In March, Trump said Washington might consider lifting certain sanctions on Russia in order to advance the Black Sea Grain Initiative – key maritime agreement that ensures the safety of navigation in the Black Sea – as a step towards settling the Ukraine conflict. On Saturday, Trump prolonged the restrictions for another year, based on the supposition that Moscow still poses a serious threat to American national security. Lavrov said Russia had to avoid relying on foreign partners in critical sectors even if sanctions are lifted, echoing President Vladimir Putin’s calls to preserve economic sovereignty.",

    "title": "Fyodor Lukyanov: Here’s what Trump really wants from his trade war",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump wasn’t joking. As promised, he has launched a dramatic overhaul of his country’s trade policy, introducing sweeping tariffs to force what he calls a rebalancing of imports and exports with key partners. The move has shaken markets and triggered warnings of a looming global recession – or even a depression. Trump, known for his aggressive, high-stakes tactics, has left little doubt that his strategy is deliberate and flexible only on his terms. Yet the outcome remains uncertain, and most experts predict the US will suffer alongside everyone else, if not more. Economists are largely in agreement: any gains from this approach, if they come, will be long-term. In the short term, Americans can expect higher inflation, struggling manufacturers, weakened consumer power, and declining market capitalization. But Trump is not concerned with consensus. He is a political brawler, and his goal is not simply economic reform, but to fundamentally reshape the global system that, in his view, is dragging America toward decline. To understand Trump’s mindset, it is worth recalling the now-infamous 2016 essay“The Flight 93 Election,”written by conservative thinker Michael Anton. In it, Anton compared Trump voters to the passengers of the hijacked plane on 9/11 who charged the cockpit, sacrificing their lives to stop disaster. The metaphor was stark: America, hijacked by liberal globalists, was on a suicidal course. Trump, in this framing, was the last-ditch response to avert collapse. Anton went on to serve in Trump’s first administration, grew disillusioned, but has returned to prominence in the second. He now reportedly heads policy planning at the State Department and is involved in talks with Russia. It is as if the logic of Flight 93, once applied to US domestic politics, has now expanded to the entire world. The Trump administration sees the current global order as unsustainable and even dangerous to American power. In their view, if the system isn’t smashed now, the US will soon be unable to fix it at all. Trump believes he can strongarm countries into renegotiating trade deals by leveraging America’s market power. For some, this may work. Many nations simply cannot afford a full-blown trade war with the US. But the two key targets of Trump’s economic offensive – China and the European Union – are not so easily bullied. In China’s case, the country is close to parity with the US in global economic weight and influence. While it is not a hegemon, China sees itself as a peer, a necessary pole in a multipolar world. That self-image makes capitulation to US demands unthinkable. Beijing is confident it can weather the storm and perhaps even outlast Washington. It may be underestimating its opponent, but it will not back down without a fight. The EU, meanwhile, presents a different challenge. Its trade policy is controlled by the European Commission, not individual member states. This centralization limits flexibility and slows response times, especially in crises. While countries like Germany, Europe’s top exporter, are directly impacted by US tariffs, they cannot negotiate alone. Coordination within the EU has always been difficult, and in moments of real pressure, national interests often override collective ones. Moreover, the EU is militarily and politically dependent on the United States, a dependency that has long complicated its ability to assert itself. While Trump views Western Europe increasingly as an adversary, particularly on trade and even in security, the bloc still sees the US as a vital ally. It cannot, for now, imagine a future without the American security umbrella. This imbalance gives Washington leverage that it doesn’t have with China. Paradoxically, Western Europe is now caught between the rhetoric of defiance and the instinct to comply. Trump appears to believe that, unlike China, the EU will eventually fold. And traditionally, it has done just that. But this time, submission would come at the cost of significant ambitions and without any clear reward. While the US-China standoff is entering a phase of public defiance followed by expected negotiations, the trajectory of US-EU relations is murkier. Trump seems to expect full capitulation from Brussels, and soon. This expectation may be misguided. Western European governments are under internal economic pressure, especially with growing protests from industry and agriculture, which bear the brunt of rising costs and lost export markets. Yet Brussels remains ideologically committed to the transatlantic alliance and the liberal economic order, even as that order is being rewritten from Washington. Trump’s ambitions are vast and immediate: to restructure world trade, settle the conflict in Ukraine, and contain Iran – all simultaneously, and all in his second term. He sees no need to wait, compromise, or follow established diplomatic pacing. This is the Flight 93 strategy applied to geopolitics: crash the system before it crashes you. It remains to be seen how much of this the rest of the world will tolerate. China won’t yield easily. The EU may grumble, delay, and attempt to negotiate – but if pushed far enough, it may also split internally under the strain. What is clear is that the US, under Trump, is no longer trying to lead the world. It is trying to reset it – on its own terms.

    "title": "EU country enshrines two genders in constitution",
    "article_text": "Hungary’s parliament has passed a constitutional amendment recognizing only two genders, male and female. The move runs counter to a broader EU policy on LGBTQ rights. The amendment to the Basic Law, proposed by the ruling Fidesz-KDNP coalition, was adopted on Monday with 140 votes in favor and 21 against, with no abstentions. Under the changes, the constitution now states that Hungary shall protect the institution of marriage as the voluntary“union of one man and one woman”and the family as the basis of the survival of the nation. Family ties should be based on marriage or the relationship between parents and children.“The mother shall be a woman; the father shall be a man,”the text reads. The amendment also codifies a ban on public LGBTQ+ events and declares that children’s rights to moral, physical, and spiritual development supersede any other fundamental rights, except the right to life. In 2020, Hungary abolished the legal recognition of transgender people, and in 2021 amended its child protection laws to prohibit the promotion of LGBTQ topics in media, advertising, and educational materials accessible to minors. The measures sparked a backlash in Brussels, with the European Commission launching legal action against Budapest, referring the case to the European Court of Justice, and freezing billions in EU funds over alleged violations of fundamental rights. Ahead of Monday’s vote, opposition politicians and other protesters attempted to block the entrance to the parliamentary parking garage to prevent ruling party lawmakers from entering. During the session, opposition lawmakers used air horns in an attempt to disrupt the proceedings. They have denounced the changes as a retreat from democracy and an assault on the core values of the EU, of which Hungary has been a member since 2004. Commenting on the amendment, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said the international gender network“must take its hands off our children.” He added, referring to US President Donald Trump’s ending of Washington’s long-standing promotion of diversity and inclusion:“Now, with the change in America, the winds have shifted in our favor.” In December, Orban declared that the West’s 500-year hegemony was over and the“coming century will be the century of Eurasia,”saying the strategy of ‘westernizing’ the world had failed and that countries able to defend their values would come out ahead. Last week in Slovakia, another EU member, a draft constitutional law aimed at enshrining two genders passed its second reading.",

    "title": "Gulf benefactor may settle some of Syria’s foreign debt – Reuters",
    "article_text": "Saudi Arabia plans to pay off Syria’s debt to the World Bank, Reuters reported on Monday, citing sources. The move could unlock international financing for the reconstruction of the war-torn country, the agency noted. Syria saw a change of power late last year, when jihadist group Hayat Tahrir-al-Sham (HTS) launched a surprise offensive that took Damascus and ousted long-time President Bashar Assad. HTS leader Ahmed al-Sharaa became president and formed a new transitional government in March. The World Bank is an international financial institution headquartered in Washington. However, as Syria remains under US sanctions, it is difficult to conduct international transactions. The $15 million arrears must be paid off before the institution can issue grants and other forms of assistance. Al-Sharaa visited Saudi Arabia in February in his first official foreign trip since assuming office. However, an official from the Saudi Finance Ministry declined to confirm to Reuters plans by Riyadh to pay off Syria’s debt. World Bank officials have discussed providing financing to help rebuild Syria’s power grid and to support public sector pay, two of the sources told Reuters. According to Washington-based think-tank The Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE), Syria’s reconstruction costs are likely to exceed $250 billion. Moscow has remained engaged with Syria’s new leadership, even though it granted Assad asylum after his ouster. Russian President Vladimir Putin said in February that Moscow was determined to“contribute to the improvement of the social and economic situation in Syria, including through providing humanitarian assistance.”The new government in Damascus has also expressed its desire to maintain good relations with Russia. Syria has been under US sanctions since 2004, with the restrictions targeting individuals and entities that supported Bashar Assad. Despite his fall from power, the restrictions remain largely in place, potentially hindering Syria’s reconstruction efforts.",

    "title": "Zelensky started the war then begged for missiles – Trump",
    "article_text": "Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky should never have started a war with Russia, US President Donald Trump has said. In a press conference alongside El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele in the Oval Office on Monday, Trump commented on Zelensky’s recent offer to finance $15 billion worth of Patriot air defense batteries with the aid of Kiev’s European backers. “He’s always looking to purchase missiles,”the US presided noted. “When you start a war, you got to know that you can win the war,”he said of Zelensky.“You don’t start a war against somebody that’s 20 times your size and then hope that people give you some missiles.” Trump added that he gave Kiev American-made Javelin man-portable anti-tank missiles during his first presidency. In an interview with CBS News on Sunday, Zelensky called on the US to supply Ukraine with more air defenses. Kiev is ready to buy or lease up to ten Patriot air defense systems, and some European backers have offered to help with the money, he claimed. During the interview, the network suggested that Trump tried to cut Kiev out of peace talks with Russia, and that he lied in his statements about the conflict. Trump allegedly“rewrote history, saying, falsely, that Ukraine had started the war and calling… Zelensky ‘a dictator without elections’,”according to CBS. The US president lashed out at the news network on Truth Social on Monday, calling the interview inaccurate and fraudulent. Trump has repeatedly claimed that the Ukraine conflict would never have escalated had he been in the White House, rather than his predecessor Joe Biden. According to the US president, the previous administration invested more than $300 billion into supporting Kiev. Trump has promised to“get back”the money, entering talks with Ukraine about jointly exploiting its mineral resources. He also suggested taking over Ukrainian nuclear power plants. The Kremlin has hailed the Trump administration’s peace efforts, but cautioned that resolving long-standing issues will take time and“painstaking work.”",

    "title": "Trump calls for CBS to lose its broadcasting licence",
    "article_text": "CBS News must have its broadcasting license revoked, US President Donald Trump has said. He has accused the network of spreading politically biased misinformation in its coverage of the Ukraine conflict and Washington’s push to acquire Greenland. In a Truth Socialposton Monday, Trump lashed out at the broadcaster after it aired an interview with Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky and a segment revisiting the US president’s controversial idea to purchase Greenland. In the Zelensky interview, the network suggested that Trump had sought to exclude Kiev from peace talks with Russia and that he“rewrote history, saying, falsely, that Ukraine had started the war and calling… Zelensky ‘a dictator without elections.’” The US president’s“dictator”comment in February was referring to the fact that Zelensky’s presidential term expired last year and that he has refused to call a new vote, citing martial law. Trump has since softened his rhetoric about the Ukrainian leader. The CBS report on Greenland focused on the island’s residents’ purported reluctance to become part of the US. “Almost every week, 60 Minutes… mentions the name ‘TRUMP’ in a derogatory and defamatory way, but this Weekend’s ‘BROADCAST’ tops them all,”Trump wrote. “They did not one, but TWO, major stories on ‘TRUMP,’ one having to do with Ukraine, which I say is a War that would never have happened if the 2020 Election had not been RIGGED… and, the other story was having to do with Greenland, casting our Country, as led by me, falsely, inaccurately, and fraudulently,”he added. “They are not a ‘News Show,’ but a dishonest Political Operative simply disguised as ‘News,’ and must be responsible for what they have done, and are doing,”Trump suggested.“They should lose their license!” The US leader stressed that CBS“should pay a big price”for being“out of control,”recalling his previous stand-off with the network over a heavily edited interview with Kamala Harris, his main Democratic rival prior to the November election. The controversy over the Harris interview erupted in October when CBS aired two versions of an interview with the then-vice president. In one, she gave a long and convoluted answer about the Middle East conflict, but in the other, she gave a much clearer and more concise answer. Trump subsequently lodged a $10 billion lawsuit against CBS, calling the interview“word salad”and accusing the network of“deceitful, deceptive manipulation of news”and favoritism to the Democratic Party. CBS has admitted to editing the interview but rejected allegations that it attempted to doctor it.",

    "title": "EU industry bosses want Russian gas supplies restored – Reuters",
    "article_text": "Germany’s chemical industry is in a“severe crisis”and in dire need of a return to cheap Russian gas, Reuters reported on Monday, citing executives in the sector. French energy majors Engie and Total have also told the agency that they could see a restart of imports of  hydrocarbon from Russia. With a turnover of €225.5 billion in 2023, chemicals and pharmaceuticals are Germany’s third-largest industry, behind automotive and machinery and equipment, according to the European Chemical Industry Council. The EU committed to eliminating Russian gas imports by 2027, following the escalation of conflict between Kiev and Moscow three years ago. Brussels aimed  to replace them with more expensive  liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar and the United States. Talks with Qatar have stalled however, and Washington’s shift away from the EU under US President Donald Trump, along with his tariff campaign, have left bloc chiefs concerned about the reliability of American supplies. “We are in a severe crisis and can’t wait,”Christof Guenther, managing director of InfraLeuna told Reuters. InfraLeuna hosts Dow Chemical and Shell plants and is one of Germany’s biggest chemical manufacturing clusters. “It’s a taboo topic,”Guenther added, saying that many of his colleagues have agreed on the need to go back to Russian gas. Before 2022, Russia met up to 60% of Germany’s demand for natural gas. The loss of an affordable supply has led to increased energy costs, resulting in production cuts and job losses across the country’s industrial sector. “We need Russian gas, we need cheap energy - no matter where it comes from,”said Klaus Paur, managing director of Leuna-Harze, a petrochemical maker at Leuna Park. French energy firms Engie and Total have also spoken out in favor of resuming gas purchases from Russia. “If there is a reasonable peace in Ukraine, we could go back to flows of 60 billion cubic meters (bcm), maybe 70, annually…”Didier Holleaux, executive vice-president at Engie, told Reuters. The EU used to import 150 bcm of pipeline gas from Russia every year, which covered 40% of its needs. After the Ukraine conflict is settled, the country could account for 20-25%, Holleaux said. ”Europe will never go back to importing 150 bcm…but I would bet maybe 70 bcm,”Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne suggested. Russia has long reiterated that it is a reliable energy supplier, with the Kremlin saying in January that Moscow would resume gas deliveries to the EU, provided that there are buyers. Russian gas reached Germany and on to the wider EU via the Nord Stream undersea pipelines, which were damaged in a sabotage attack in 2022.  However, one string of Nord Stream 2, remains intact. The EU still receives Russian gas via the TurkStream pipeline, which runs through Turkey and the Balkans. A key pipeline that delivered gas to Italy, Slovakia and Hungary via Ukraine was closed after Kiev refused to extend a transit agreement in January, and blew up a gas metering station on the border.",

    "article_text": "Scottish authorities have determined that a major fire at a battery recycling plant in the west of the country was not the result of arson, according to reports. The blaze in the town of Kilwinning last Wednesday forced nearby residents to evacuate their homes. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) deployed almost a dozen fire engines to tackle the blaze at the Fenix Battery Recycling, located on the Byrehill Industrial Estate in North Ayrshire. The fire broke out almost exactly one year after the same site was severely damaged by a blaze that raged for two days. Witnesses said the fire last Wednesday was accompanied by a series of loud explosions, and reported large plumes of smoke rising from the scene. The SFRS advised that windows and doors be kept closed and for residents not to pick up any debris in the surrounding area. The police and emergency services determined on Friday that the blaze was not started deliberately, according to local media. The very eco-friendly, anti-global warming North Ayrshire Battery Recycling Plant---just blew up.The amount of toxins released are equivalent to 1,000 trucks with poorly tuned diesels driving nonstop for over 10 years, according to reports.The planet laughs at our stupidity.pic.twitter.com/M3fP9MkKtG “The amount of toxins released are equivalent to 1,000 trucks with poorly tuned diesels driving nonstop for over 10 years, according to reports,”one user commented on X. In September last year, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) revoked Fenix’s waste management license as part of an“enhanced package of enforcement action.” The company was ordered to transfer any waste in breach of the license to an approved facility. As part of the enforcement measures, Fenix was given a deadline of June to comply with several requirements, including removing fire debris, repairing damaged infrastructure, and implementing a comprehensive fire prevention and mitigation plan. The agency stated that its officers had visited the site to collect samples from nearby watercourses and would continue to monitor the situation.",

    "title": "Trump statue erected at his golf club (VIDEO)",
    "article_text": "A statue of Donald Trump has been erected at his Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida. The artwork, titled the ‘The Defiance Monument’, depicts the US president pumping his fist in the air in an apparent reference to the gesture he made after facing an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania last July. Moments after a bullet grazed his ear, Trump stood up, raised his fist, and shouted,“Fight! Fight! Fight!” The attack, in which several shots were fired, left one person dead and two others severely wounded, with the gunman being killed on the spot by US Secret Service snipers. Trump himself took part in the unveiling of the statue on Saturday, posing for photos with the CEO of Sticker Mule company, Anthony Constantino, who gifted him the monument. “The Defiance Monument” The presentation of the statue to President Trump at his West Palm Beach Golf Course is absolutely incredible and exciting.pic.twitter.com/qIClnGgTvh According to a statement by Sticker Mule’s press service, the president“gleamed with pride after seeing the seven-foot (2.13-meter) bronze monument for the first time.” “The president was in a happy, joking mood which was great to see,”Constantino said. BREAKING 🚨 President Trump unveiled an iconic Statue of himself “Fight Fight Fight” LET’S GO🔥 Nobody can match Trump’s Aura ❤️pic.twitter.com/N7NO7UZqpF The monument stands between the clubhouse and the first hole of the 27-hole golf course and is“prominently visible for all of the members to see,”the statement added. Constantino, who has been a Trump supporter since his first presidential term, commissioned the statue from LA-based filmmaker and sculptor, Steven Barber, in the fall for $275,000. The entrepreneur earlier said that presenting the monument to Trump had turned out to be challenging from a legal point of view.“It is complicated with presidents and gifts and all that, so I guess technically I am loaning it to [Trump],”he said. In February, US sculptor Alan Cottrill unveiled a 15-foot (4.6-meter) bronze statue of Trump, called ‘Don Colossus’, which also pictured him with his first in the air. The piece is expected to tour the country before being permanently placed at the planned Donald J. Trump Presidential Library. Several other statues of Trump have been made in the US and elsewhere since 2016, including one in Slovenia and one in China. However, some such as ‘Dump Trump’ and ‘The Emperor Has No Balls’ have depicted the president in an unfavorable light.",

    "title": "Ukraine conflict is ‘Biden’s war’ – Trump",
    "article_text": "Former US President Joe Biden is directly responsible for allowing the Ukraine crisis to escalate into hostilities between Moscow and Kiev, his successor Donald Trump has said. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday, Trump argued that if he had won the 2020 election, the US would not be dealing with the Ukraine conflict and the Middle East crisis, and would have avoided an“embarrassing”withdrawal from Afghanistan. Trump described the conflict between Russia and Ukraine as“Biden’s war.”“This is not my war. I’ve been here for a very short period of time... He gave them billions and billions of dollars. He should have never allowed – If he had any brain, which he didn’t have and doesn’t have… – that war to start.” “I think frankly he [Russian President Vladimir Putin] had so little respect for Biden that he started it for that reason. And obviously, he didn't get along very well with [Ukraine’s Vladimir] Zelensky or anybody else. And now you have millions of dead people, and those people – every one of them – should be alive right now,”Trump added. The US president reiterated that settling the conflict remains a top priority but acknowledged the challenges involved, describing it as“a deeply seated war.” The US committed around $175 billion in aid to Ukraine under the Biden administration, including advanced weapons systems, ammunition, and direct financial assistance. Biden pledged to support Ukraine“for as long as it takes,”while consistently refusing to engage in direct top-level talks with the Kremlin. In contrast, Trump has resumed dialogue with Moscow since returning to office in January. Russian and US delegations have held several rounds of high-level talks in recent months on settling the Ukraine conflict and restoring bilateral relations. While Russia has welcomed the renewed contact and described the engagement as productive, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has warned that resolving long-standing issues in US-Russia relations will take time. “We are now walking down this road together, very patiently. We have many more steps to take, but one just needs to understand how serious the damage is that was done to bilateral Russia-US relations under the previous administration,”Peskov said on Sunday.“Painstaking work is now being done to eliminate these consequences.”",

    "title": "UK chief constable accused of ‘anti-white discrimination’",
    "article_text": "West Yorkshire Police in the UK has come under scrutiny for its recruitment practices after its chief said he wants to“discriminate”against white job applicants and hire more ethnic minority officers, The Telegraph has reported. The recruitment practice seeks to increase diversity in the police by prioritizing applications from ethnic minority candidates, the outlet said on Friday. The force allows individuals from underrepresented groups to submit applications year-round, while white British applicants must wait for specific recruitment windows. The approach reportedly aims to address the disparity between the 9% of officers from minority backgrounds and the 23% representation of these communities in the West Yorkshire population. Chief Constable John Robins of West Yorkshire Police has been pushing for changes to British laws in a bid to increase the number of officers from ethnic minorities in his force. “It worked in terms of religion in Northern Ireland. We’ve tried really, really hard over many decades, especially in the last five to 10 years, but there’s just systemic issues around applications. I think the time has now come that legislation should change so that we should [use] positive discrimination,”the outlet quoted him as saying. West Yorkshire Police is pausing applications from white British candidates while allowing year-round applications from under-represented groups such as Black and Asian people. According to the article, applicants were ranked in tiers, with Black and South Asian candidates in the ‘gold’ tier and East Asians in the ‘silver’ tier. Meanwhile, applicants classed as ‘white others’ — including those from Britain, Ireland, and Eastern Europe — were placed in the lowest ‘bronze’ tier. The recruitment policy has raised concerns about so-called positive discrimination, which is considered illegal in the UK, and has drawn sharp criticism, with Conservative MP Neil O’Brien labeling it as“racist.” “What West Yorkshire police are doing with their racist hiring policies and division of different ethnic groups is skirting the edge of the law,”he told The Telegraph. “With gun crime in West Yorkshire at a record high, many people might think local police might have more important things to be focusing on.” Former Prime Minister Liz Truss has also criticized the approach, saying that Britain has a“serious problem”with“anti-white discrimination.” “It cannot stand that a police chief is openly pursuing racist hiring policies and making political statements,”she wrote on X on Saturday.“Decisions are being made by unaccountable people who have been captured by woke ideology.” The policy follows reports that West Yorkshire Police spent £1.4 million ($1.8 million)“patronizing”the public with diversity staff. The force reportedly employs 19 diversity, equality, and inclusion (DEI) officers and spends £361,000 ($476,000) on their training.",

    "title": "White House doctor assesses Trump’s health",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump remains in“excellent cognitive and physical health,”White House physician Captain Sean Barbabella has said. On Friday, Trump underwent the first physical of his second presidential term at a hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, which included a five-hour medical examination, blood work and a cognitive test. The results of the check-up have shown the 78-year-old president to be“fully fit”for the job, Barbabella said in a memorandum on Sunday. ”President Trump remains in excellent health, exhibiting robust cardiac, pulmonary, neurological, and general physical function,” the memo read. The US leader’s“active lifestyle,”which includes meetings, public appearances and“frequent victories in golf events,”has contributed significantly to his well-being, the doctor stressed. Trump currently weighs 224 pounds (101.6kg) and is 75 inches (190cm) tall. His resting heart rate is 62 beats per minute and his blood pressure is 128/74 mmHg, the memo said. During the examination, he was also found to have scarring“on the right ear from a gunshot wound”as a result of an attempt on his life last July, it added. According to Barbabella, the president had“minor sun damage”and several“benign skin lesions.” Trump scored 30 out of 30 in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), which is commonly used to detect cognitive decline and early signs of dementia, the memo said. The 10-minute test contains such tasks as drawing a clock, naming animals, recalling words after a delay of five minutes, and others. Speaking to journalists aboard Air Force One on Saturday, Trump insisted that he“got every answer right”on the cognitive test. “Overall, I felt I was in very good shape. A good heart, a good soul, a very good soul,”he said. The president added that he had received“a little bit”of advice from the doctor on lifestyle changes to improve his health, but did not reveal any further details. Trump had repeatedly questioned the cognitive and physical health of previous US President Joe Biden, who left the White House at age 82. Biden had refused to undergo a cognitive test after his poor performance in a debate last June. A month later, he withdrew from the presidential race, and was replaced by his Vice President Kamala Harris, whom Trump had defeated.",

    "title": "Incoming chancellor warns Germans of falling income",
    "article_text": "Germany’s incoming chancellor Friedrich Merz has acknowledged that many citizens could see their net wages decline during his government’s term due to rising social security contributions and uncertain tax relief. In an interview with the tabloid Bild on Sunday, Merz addressed concerns that rising costs in Germany’s pension, health and long-term care systems are outpacing reforms and eating into household incomes. “Unfortunately, that’s exactly the trend,”Merz said.“We’ve failed to implement the necessary reforms over the past 30 years.” When pressed on whether citizens could end up with less disposable income, Merz responded,“From today's perspective, these fears are certainly not unfounded. But it will be our task to dispel these fears and do the right thing so that at the end of this electoral term, people say: We are better off than at the beginning.” According to Merz, the coalition agreement between his Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) and the Social Democrats (SPD) includes a decision to maintain the pension guarantee – which ensures that a citizen’s pension cannot fall below a fixed threshold – until 2031. Merz signaled, however, that the coalition would seek to implement health and long-term care reforms in the coming years, which are expected to lead to higher costs for households. Meanwhile, Merz confirmed that the CDU/CSU and the SPD have so far failed to agree on an income tax relief package for workers, but noted that the coalition has committed to reducing corporate taxes. When asked whether his party had broken promises made during the election campaign regarding the“debt brake,”Merz acknowledged the criticism. While the CDU had previously advocated maintaining a constitutional rule limiting government borrowing, after the election, Merz’s bloc and the SPD proposed a €1 trillion debt-financed spending package to invest in defense and infrastructure. “I understand that. This [debt package] can only be justified if we combine it with the reforms we really need in Germany. And I think we’ve written the right things in the coalition agreement,”he said. Merz is expected to be formally confirmed as chancellor in the coming weeks as negotiations with the SPD to form a coalition government continue. His comments come as a recent Ipsos poll put public support for his CDU/CSU bloc at 24%, with the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) overtaking it by 1%.",

    "article_text": "A Wisconsin teenager accused of murdering his parents had also plotted to assassinate US President Donald Trump and flee overseas while framing Russia for the crime, according to an unsealed FBI affidavit. Nikita Casap, 17, was charged last month with first-degree murder after police found the bodies of his mother and stepfather, both shot in the head, inside their Waukesha home. He was arrested in Kansas after fleeing in a stolen vehicle with $14,000 in cash, passports, and the family dog. Officers also recovered an unloaded revolver, boxes of ammunition, and two cell phones during the traffic stop. “Casap appears to have written a manifesto calling for the assassination of the President of the United States. He was in touch with other parties about his plan to kill the President and overthrow the government of the United States,”the warrantunsealedon Friday stated. “The killing of his parents appeared to be an effort to obtain the financial means and autonomy necessary to carry out his plan,”it added. The FBI alleges that Casap paid, at least in part, for a drone and explosives intended for use as a“weapon of mass destruction.”The affidavit states the equipment was meant to support the planned attack. Messages uncovered on his phone showed Casap discussing the plot with an unidentified user on Telegram. On January 21, he asked,“What country will be blamed for the crime?”The user replied,“Russia will be blamed for it, this is the goal.” Casap’s phone also contained conversations with a user using a Ukrainian phone number, appearing to discuss a post-attack escape plan.“How long will I need to hide before I will be moved to Ukraine? 1-2 months?”he asked.“So while in Ukraine, I’ll be able to get a normal job and have a normal life? Even if when it’s found out I did it?”he added. Agents also found screenshots of a three-page document titled“Accelerate the Collapse,”created on February 28. The manifesto called for political violence, including the assassination of the president, to spark societal chaos and“protect the white race.” It argued that it was“necessary to accelerate the collapse”of what it called“Jewish-occupied governments,”beginning with the United States.“The white race cannot survive unless America collapses,”Casap claimed. “As to why, specifically Trump, I think it’s obvious. By getting rid of the president and perhaps the vice president, that is guaranteed to bring in some chaos — and not only that, but it will further bring into the public the idea that assassinations and accelerating the collapse are possible things to do,”another excerpt read. Casap is being held on $1 million bail and faces two counts of first-degree intentional homicide, along with seven other felony charges, including hiding a corpse and identity theft. He is due back in court on May 7.",

Everything from balance issues with the setup on Red Bull cars to pit stops and Friday practice sessions all have come into focus. \"The concern is great,\" Red Bull adviser Helmut Marko told Sky Germany, per The Athletic. \"Improvements must come in the near future so that he has a car with which he can win again. We need to create a foundation with a car so that he can fight for the world championship.\" Verstappen had a dominant 2023 season, winning 19 of the 22 Grand Prix races and finishing on the podium 21 times. Last season, he won nine times but Red Bull relinquished the team Constructors' Championship to McLaren. That came, according to The Athletic, as Red Bull developed troubles with balance issues with the cars that are continuing this season. The fix, reportedly, is a long-term one. F1 analysts like Sky's Ralf Schumacher, who won six races across 11 F1 seasons, believe Verstappen could go as far as to leave Red Bull if improvements are not forthcoming. After the race Sunday, Verstappen posted this to X: \"Difficult weekend. Struggled with the balance and overall pace. We move forward and keep pushing.\" Verstappen is third in the drivers standings after four races, eight points behind leader Lando Norris and five behind Oscar Piastri, both of McLaren. In the Constructors' Championship standings, McLaren has 151 points, Mercedes has 93 and Red Bull is next at 71. While the 27-year-old Verstappen is under contract through 2028 with Red Bull, Marko has said there are out clauses. -Field Level Media Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2025.

    "article_text": "World World Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg departs E Barrett Prettyman United States Court House on Apr 14, 2025 in Washington, DC. (Photo: AFP/Getty Images/Andrew Harnik) WASHINGTON: Meta chief and co-founder Mark Zuckerberg took the stand on Monday (Apr 14) in alandmark US antitrust trialin which his social media juggernaut stands accused of abusing its market power to acquire Instagram and WhatsApp before they could become competitors. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) attorneys argue that Facebook, since renamed Meta, devoured what it saw as competitive threats. Zuckerberg was shown an internal Facebook email from 2011 that warned Instagram was a hit on smartphones and could easily copy what his social network offered. Another 2012 email regarding acquiring Instagram suggested simply keeping the app running without any improvements while Facebook developed its own products, and in doing so avoid upsetting users by shutting it down. Zuckerberg downplayed those exchanges as early talk before plans for Instagram came together. The start of the trial in a Washington federal court dashed the hopes of Zuckerberg that thereturn of President Donald Trump to the White Housewould see the government let up on the enforcement of antitrust law against Big Tech. The Meta case could see the owner of Facebook forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp, which have grown into global powerhouses since their buyout. \"They decided that competition is too hard and it would be easier to buy out their rivals than to compete with them,\" FTC attorney Daniel Matheson said in opening remarks at the trial. Meta attorney Mark Hansen countered in his first salvo that \"acquisitions to improve and grow an acquired firm\" are not unlawful in the United States and that is what Facebook did. The case against Meta was originally filed in December 2020, during the first Trump administration, and all eyes were on whether he would ask the FTC to stand down. Zuckerberg, the world's third-richest person, has made repeated visits to the White House as he tried to persuade the US leader to choose settlement instead of fighting the trial. As part of his lobbying efforts, Zuckerberg contributed to Trump's inauguration fund and overhauled content moderation policies. He also purchased a US$23 million mansion in Washington in what was seen as a bid to spend more time close to the center of political power. Zuckerberg's former lieutenant Sheryl Sandberg and a long line of executives from rival companies are scheduled to testify at a trial expected to last at least eight weeks. Central to the case is Facebook's 2012 billion-dollar purchase of Instagram – then a small but promising photo-sharing app that now boasts two billion active users. An email from Zuckerberg cited by the FTC showed him depicting Instagram's emergence as \"really scary\", adding that is \"why we might want to consider paying a lot of money for this\". The FTC argues that Meta's US$19 billion WhatsApp acquisition in 2014 followed the same pattern, with Zuckerberg fearing the messaging app could either transform into a social network or be purchased by a competitor. Meta's defense attorneys counter that substantial investments transformed these acquisitions into the blockbusters they are today. They also highlight that Meta's apps are free for users and face fierce competition. The FTC argues that Meta's monopoly power is demonstrated by a severely downgraded user experience – with too many ads and product changes. A key courtroom battleground will be how the FTC defines Meta's market. The US government argues that Facebook and Instagram are dominant players in apps that provide a way to connect with family and friends, a category that does not include TikTok and YouTube. But Meta disagrees. \"The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others,\" a spokesperson said. \"The bigger that Meta can make the relevant market ... the more likely it is to defeat the FTC's case,\" said lawyer Brendan Benedict on Substack.

    "title": "WNBA announces program to combat growing harassment in women's sport",
    "article_text": "Sport Sport Apr 14, 2025; New York, New York, USA; WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert talks to the media before the 2025 WNBA Draft at The Shed at Hudson Yards. Mandatory Credit: Vincent Carchietta-Imagn Images NEW YORK :     WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert announced a new program to ensure player safety on Monday, combating online hate and in-person vitriol, as athletes across all women's sport say a surge in popularity has made them more vulnerable. The WNBA welcomed an influx of new fans last year with the runaway popularity of then-rookie Caitlin Clark and her charismatic draft class, spiking ratings and in-person attendance across the league. But with the increase in attention came an uptick in racist and sexist abuse, players said, demanding last year that the league do more to address the issue. The league assembled an off-season task force to address the problem, Engelbert told reporters ahead of Monday's WNBA Draft in New York City, creating a \"multi-dimensional approach to combating hate and vitriol.\" \"(It) will include, one, monitoring of social media and other digital platforms using an advanced technology solution to detect and monitor comments and threats. Two, strengthening our conduct standards across all WNBA platforms, including in the arena,\" she said. \"There will be added security measures put in place at the league and team levels. And four, there'll be continued services of dedicated mental health clinicians.\" Stalking, threats and harassment have been an unwanted byproduct of the growing popularity and media exposure for women's sport, with 2021 U.S. Open winner Emma Raducanu spotting a stalker during a match at the Dubai Championships this year. Indianapolis police arrested a Texas man earlier this year on stalking charges after he allegedly sent threats and sexually violent messages to the Indiana Fever star Clark. Another man reportedly pleaded guilty to a stalking charge late last year after police arrested him for harassing UConn star Paige Bueckers, the presumed first overall pick in Monday's WNBA Draft. \"We want to ensure that the WNBA remains a space where everyone, players, fans and corporate partners feel safe, valued, and empowered,\" said Engelbert.

    "title": "Kendall Jenner and Hailey Bieber have been spotted wearing this Singaporean jewellery designer’s pieces",
    "article_text": "Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Women Women Women Women Wellness Women Wellness Wellness People Living Living Living Style & Beauty Obsessions Style & Beauty Obsessions Dining Experiences Travel Dining Singapore Travel Experiences Living Style & Beauty Style & Beauty With fluid, sculptural forms and unexpected silhouettes, Thing In Itself crafts statement-making jewellery that has captured the eye of Hollywood’s most influential stylists. Hailey Bieber is a fan of Singaporean jewellery label Thing In Itself. (Art: Chern Ling, photos: Thing In Itself) This audio is generated by an AI tool. When Kendall Jenner and Hailey Bieber posted photos wearing abstract earrings from an under-the-radar jewellery brand, it marked a defining moment for Singaporean labelThing In Itself. Founded in 2019 by Xin Chua, 37, the brand crafts strikingly organic forms in rhodium-finished recycled sterling silver and 18K gold vermeil – a high-quality gilding process where gold is layered over sterling silver for durability and a rich, luminous finish, with prices starting at US$125 (S$166). “It was surreal to see celebrities wearing something that I designed,”recalled the soft-spoken Chua.“[American country singer] Maren Morris even performed in our earrings, which felt like a stamp of approval – it meant the piece had to be both well-crafted and well-designed.” A trained graphic designer, Chua started dabbling in jewellery design as she was drawn to the idea of shifting from the flatness of digital visuals to something tactile – an object that could be worn, felt and experienced in motion.“I wanted to create something that I could wear,”she said simply. “As a graphic designer, I gravitated towards crafting 3D objects digitally,” she shared. This fascination sparked her earliest jewellery experiments – pieces she uploaded to social media. The response was encouraging, compelling her and her husband, Aaron Wong, 40, to formally launch Thing In Itself in 2019. Wong assists in operations and logistics for the brand, allowing Chua to immerse herself fully in the creative process. The couple also run a design studio – a business that they refer to as their “bread and butter”. Unlike many jewellery designers who begin with hand-drawn sketches, Chua conceptualises her pieces directly in 3D modelling software.“It’s just a different way of putting ideas on paper,”she explained.The brand also leverages3D printing for prototyping, enabling precise refinements before moving into metal casting. Her aesthetic leans into biomorphic and amorphous forms, drawing from a vast mental archive of inspirations.“Back in school, I’d spend hours at Kinokuniya flipping through design books – I couldn’t afford them, so I just committed the images to memory,”she said. Playfulness is intrinsic to her process.“I try not to take it too seriously. If I think, ‘this has to turn into something,’it would hinder my creativity.” Even the way she names her pieces reflects this philosophy.“I don’t name jewellery according to a vibe or mood. I want the person wearing it to form their own interpretation.”Chua’s designs are coined after plain descriptors of their form, such as Blob, Spiral and Gather. This ethos ties back to the name of her label, Thing In Itself – an allusion to the philosophical concept that objects exist beyond human perception, allowing wearers to ascribe their own meaning to each piece. “Every piece of my jewellery is inspired by the last,” explained Chua. “It’s always morphing. It starts with a form, like a blob, a spiral or a gather – and transforms into something new.” The first piece she designed, the Blob Hoop Earrings, introduced the brand’s signature aesthetic – fluid, exaggerated curves that mimic molten metal. This later evolved into the Blob Chain Necklace, an unconventional take on classic chain-link structures. “Usually, chain designs are more structured. When it drapes, it forms a certain shape, but this one is quite organic – it doesn’t sit in just one position, it’ll look different with different angles.” Some designs carry deeper personal meaning. The Indent Ball series, featuring spherical forms punctuated by subtle concave impressions, was inspired by suan pan zi(abacus seeds), a traditional Hakka dish that Chua remembers from childhood. “My mother is of Hakka heritage,” she revealed with a smile. Chua said her jewellery is made for “anyone looking for something unique – something they’d be happy to hand down to their child.” Despite her intuitive approach to design, turning her artistic vision into wearable jewellery wasn’t easy.“The whole process of getting the idea from a sketch to an end product took me through a lot of hurdles,”she admitted. The jewellery industry, she soon discovered, was a closed-door world where manufacturers were hesitant to work with an unknown,female Asian designer. A post shared by THING IN ITSELF (@thinginitself) “The designs aren’t conventional, so a lot of foundries didn’t have faith in producing them,” added Wong. Casting houses were wary of Thing In Itself’s complex, organic silhouettes, fearing they would be technically challenging to execute. It took persistence, countlessrejections, and finally, a stroke of luck – an introduction to Italian foundries through people they knew, to finally bring her designs to life. “We paid a lot of ‘tuition fees’ along the way,” Wong joked, estimating that their initial investment was close to six figures. Despite its niche, independent roots, Thing In Itself has quietly garnered an international following. While the label doesn’t have a brick-and-mortar presence yet, its pieces are stocked in curated boutiques across Australia, China and Japan. Pop-up events, likeBoutiques Singapore, offer rare in-person experiences with the brand. “Two years ago, a Japanese lady specially came to our booth to tell us that she bought one of our piecesin Aoyama,”saidWong.“She wanted us to know how much she loved it.” For Chua, the moment was deeply meaningful. “It made me very happy to know that something we created resonated with someone enough for them to seek us out.” The brand’s breakthrough came in 2023, when celebrity stylist Dani Michelle – whose roster includes Kendall Jennerand Hailey Bieber– discovered their designs on Instagram. “She reached out via email, asking if we were interested in loaning some pieces for styling,” Chua recounted. “Of course, we happily sent them some.” Soon after, Bieber wore the Small Blob Earrings in a campaign for her beauty brand Rhode, while Kendall flaunted hers in a swimsuit photo posted on Instagram. “It was quite funny, because Kendall and Hailey are BFFs and they wore the same piece!” Alexandra and Mackenzie Grandquist, sister stylists for Kylie Jenner, have also contacted the brand. When asked who she’d love to see wearing her jewellery next, Chua didn’thesitate.“G-Dragon,”she saidshyly.“I like the way he can pull off different vibes.” For now, expanding brand presence remains the priority.“I want our pieces to be more accessible worldwide,”saidChua.“I hope to connect more with our audience in person as well.” Does she envision pivoting away from her design studio to focus solely on Thing In Itself?“No, the agency is my baby too,”she said firmly. Before she could elaborate, Wong interjected with a teasing grin,“I’d love to kick her out of it – that would mean the brand has really made it.” Chua laughed, but explained that she thrives on the creative balance between the two.“I enjoy switching between different modes of design. It keeps things fresh, and sometimes one discipline informs the other in unexpected ways.” As for future designs, she hinted at incorporating more gems next.“I’m considering working with more sparkly stuff,”she teased.“But I’ll need to experiment first.” Copyright© Mediacorp 2025.

    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. The best men’s spring sweaters prove the colder months don't have a monopoly onstylish knitwear.Sure, fall and winter offer ample opportunity to layer up in cashmere crewnecks and hefty lambswool, but the lightweight sweaters we’re talking about here play a different role entirely—as the centerpiece of your whole outfit. With no topcoat or puffer to obscure their shine, the right spring-ready sweater can, should, andwillbe all the outerwear you need from now untilT-shirt time. Their appeal boils down to more than just looks. Spring sweaters also skew more comfortable than the stuff made from wool, mohair, or alpaca—heat-preserving fabrics that, for a sizable chunk of people, mean nothing but off-the-charts itch factor. Instead, they’re usually made from easy-going, low-maintenance cotton; you can toss most of the options below in the washing machine right with your hoodies and tees. (The fact they’re cotton also means they’re a great opportunity to purchase some usually more-expensive labels for a much lower price.) All of which is to say, if you prize your cold-weather knits for their unrivaled ability to bring the heat, their springtime counterparts are decidedly more chill. Which is exactly the point. Wear 'em now with somelight wash jeans, and then leave one in your tote when the mercury really skyrockets—y’know, just in case. J. Crew J.Crew The platonic ideal of a spring sweater—quality cotton, a close but comfortable fit, and a more-than-acceptable price point. Madewell Madewell One of many Shaker stitch sweaters on this list—a style of sweater that's naturally stretchy, softer than a Fisherman knit, and flattering thanks to its strong vertical lines. Which begs the question: Why isn't every sweater one? Anglo-Italian Anglo-Italian Anglo-Italian's signature cotton sweater is distinguished by its slightly higher neckline. Once you see it… Noah Noah This winter, crewneck cardigansinfiltrated menswear—and thanks to Noah, that can continue into the warmer months. Banana Republic Banana Republic The good folks at Banana Republic have chopped this sweater all the way down to $19.99. (You'll see that final price once you've thrown it in your basket.) Mfpen Farfetch Not every item of clothing tells you how it wants to make you feel, but this one is called the “Leisure” sweater for a reason. Faherty Huckberry Want to get a jump on that perfect, three-summers deep sweater fading? This Faherty joint has you well on your way. Flint and Tinder Huckberry Substantial, never scratchy, and drowning in five-star reviews—this sweater would be a useful pick-up even without the current $30 discount. Knickerbocker Huckberry Our Legacy SSENSE We've had a full zip already, but for one with the heft and snug comfort of a classic hoodie, Our Legacy's is the best of the current crop. 3Sixteen 3Sixteen This is our first phenomenal discount of the spring sweater season—over $150 off a sweater made with the painstaking attention to detail 3Sixteen gives everything it makes. Auralee Mr. Porter Auralee's momenthas lasted so long it's become a movement—and pieces in colors and cuts like this are exactly why. Acne Studios Mr. Porter Living thatcropped life, are you? Acne's got you covered. Well, sort of covered. Drake's Drake's Drake's intentionally designed this sweater to be the warm-weather replacement for its popular Shetland sweaters—and April's the month for the hand-off. Stone Island Mr. Porter There's a reason you still see the Stoney arm patch everywhere, even decades into the brand's history—the clothes are just that well-made and comfortable. (Truthfully, few brands score higher on theCost-Per-Wear scale.) Barena SSENSE Venice's Barena is quietly earning a devout following, not least for its crispy, lightweight cotton that can be worn on even that balmiest day. All that to say: You could still be wearing this V-neck in August. Howlin' Mr. Porter Yes, I've been focused on cotton so far. But if you're living in a colder clime, brushed wool like Howlin's will keep you a little warmer, while still feeling light overall. And just look at those flecks. Amomento SSENSE South Korea's Amomento operates with a less-is-more mindset: In this case, less fabric, way more vibes. Lady White Co. Lady White Co. Finally, a glimmer of shimmer from the often-cropped California casual brand. Camiel Fortgens SSENSE While we're talking rising independents, Camiel Fortgens makes loose, comfortable pieces with a sense of humor: Case in point, the intentional thread hanging down, a CF signature of sorts.

    "title": "5 Best Purple Shampoo for Keeping Bleached Hair Pristine",
    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. The best purple shampoo can prolong the brightness ofbleached hairfor months after the fact. If you’ve ever professionally bleached your hair, then you know how hard it can be to preserve the hair’s blonde or platinum color. (I say “professionally bleached” because many of those at-home dye jobs are probably already yellowish from the start, so there isn’t much color preservation needed.) Things likehard water,hair products,sun exposure, chlorinated water, and hot-tool styling (likeblow dryersand straighteners) can significantly diminish your expensive dye job. They can turn hair a sad, dull, brassy yellowish color. The same goes for people with naturally blonde or gray hair, as well as silver-dyed hair; these tones can grow dull without some kind of brightening solution. Because purple is opposite on the color wheel from yellow, the best shampoo for fighting brassiness ispurple. These shampoos use a crushed violet pigment in order to get this brass-toning color. You can also get a purple conditioner, as well as some purple hair treatment masks. However, you don't want to double-up on purple products—and that's just one of the rules of using this stuff correctly. Clairol Amazon No matter if yourhairis color-treated, naturally blonde, or gray, you'll be happy with Clairol's Professional Shimmer Lights.Sarah Conner, a celebrity hair color expert, calls it one of her favorites for its ability to keep brassiness at bay. It works quickly after one use, while simultaneously toning andconditioning your hair. Conner recommends that you don't use this too often, only \"when your icy blonde starts turning yellow.” Redken Amazon Redken's purple shampoo is beloved by natural blondes and those who've tipped their toes in living that blondes-do-it-better lifestyle. The shampoo has ultra violet pigment to help fight brassiness, leaving hair brighter with each wash. Because of its triple acid protein complex, Blondage also tones and strengthens your locks, which is atypical of the purple shampoos of yore that would dry out hair with prolonged use. Paul Mitchell Amazon People with color-treated hair will appreciate this Paul Mitchell purpleshampoofor helping to keep them out of the salon chair for a couple extra weeks in between appointments. It immediately, and effectively combats brassiness, warming up your hair tone to what it's supposed to look like. And while it's supposedly gentle enough for daily use, we would still recommend you use this more infrequently just to give your strands a break from any over-drying. Sachajuan Amazon To avoid your hair from getting too yellow (or looking too much like a golden retriever), this Sachajuan purple shampoo will keep your hair looking brighter for those with blonde or silver. Plus, it acts like a regular shampoo, too, adding volume and sheen to hair. And with the added benefit of UV-protection, this shampoo will prevent any negative effects from spending too much time in the sun. Pantene Amazon Pantene's purple shampoo is designed for those who are specifically looking to become silver foxes by reducing dullness in gray hair, making more of a sleek silver. Gray hair can tend to yellow because of natural factors, and this shampoo helps to prevent and counteract that so that grays appear more vibrant. Here are a few tips for using purple shampoos as effectively as possible: What are purple shampoos? Purple shampoos are violet-hued toning shampoos that are designed for folks with blonde, silver, or bleached hair. It's used to avoid getting brassy or yellow tones in the hair, but should not be replacing your usual shampoo (which you use for cleansing purposes). How often should I use purple shampoo? Purple shampoo is a treatment and not a daily-use product. Conner recommends that you use purple shampoo just once or twice a week. What is the best purple shampoo? The best purple shampoo overall is Clairol Professional Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo.",

    "title": "Rory McIlroy Wore One of the Most Fun Speedmasters in Existence With His New Green Jacket",
    "article_text": "Yesterday,Rory McIlroybecame just the sixth golfer in history to complete a career Grand Slam. His victory at the 89th Masters at Augusta National means McIlroy has now won all four major championships. Eagle- (or birdie) eyed watch addicts, however, will have been just as interested in the timepiece poking out from his newly received green jacket: theOmega Speedmaster 50th Anniversary Silver Snoopy. Omegaisn’t a brand that one finds on the fairway too often. It’sRolexthat has a longstanding relationship with golf going back all the way to the late 1960s. (Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, and Gary Player were, or are, all Rolex men.) When we do see a watch on the green, we thus almost reflexively expect a goldDay-Dateon a jangly President bracelet (or, if you’re Jack Nicklaus, a surprising rubber bracelet, aswatch spotter Nick Gould pointed out this weekend). However, McIlroy is a longtime Omega ambassador, and even has his own signature Speedmaster ’57. Thus he chose to wear not only a hand-woundchronographon a leather strap, but one with a…cartoon character on the dial! There’s a perfectly good explanation for this, of course: The Silver Snoopy Award (which features the cartoon beagle created by Charles M. Schultz) was created to honor NASA employees who contribute significantly to mission safety and success. Presented byNASAastronauts to their coworkers, it largely consists of a flight-worn Snoopy lapel pin as well as a certificate. In 1970, Omega—whoseSpeedmasteris the longtime flight-certified watch worn by NASA astronauts—received the Silver Snoopy Award in recognition of the crucial part it played in getting theApollo 13astronauts safely back to Earth. In 2003, Omega first made good on this honor with a special Speedy, ref. 3578.51, featuring Snoopy in the small seconds register and on the caseback. A white-dialed edition followed in 2015 in time for the 45th anniversary of theApollo 13mission. Finally, in 2020, the mission’s 50th anniversary saw the creation of a new execution: A 42-mm steel case is ringed by a blue ceramic tachymeter bezel with “dot over 90” insert in white enamel. The laser-engraved silver dial once again features Snoopy in the blue running seconds register, this time with the words “50th Anniversary” proudly displayed above him. Flip it over and the moon’s surface is depicted with Snoopy traveling in the Command and Service Module (CSM)—whichactually rotates around the dialwhen the chronograph is in use. (The Earth likewise rotates once a minute.) The $10,600 special Speedy—which is still available on Omega’s website—seems a far cry from modern sport watch fare. That’s what makes McIlroy’s choice all the more exciting. After cementing the greatest achievement of his career, McIlroy still didn’t take himself so seriously. It is meant to be a celebration after all. And in a world in which one brand largely dominates the game, it was fun to see some variety—especially at the conclusion of such a nail-biter of a match.",

    "title": "13 Best Ringer Tees for Men in 2025: Colorful, Cropped, and Everything in Between",
    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. If you took a walk through San Francisco’s Haight-Ashbury neighborhood today, you’d think the hippie era never ended. The neighborhood remains rife with free-spirited, wandering souls, straight out of the grooviest decade. But increasingly, various other remnants of the late 1960s and '70s are surging back into vogue, and showing up far outside S.F.’s city’s limits. Trucker hats and flared jeans come to mind (thanks Kendrick), but perhaps the coolest thing to resurface—with help from the likes of Paul Mescal—is the ringer tee. With its contrasting collars and sleeve hems, tinted in a variety of splashy colors, the style first took off with the youth and countercultural movements of that time. (Whether or not your shirt had a graphic or pattern on it, those little hits of color gave the ringer tee a playful, subversive quality that icons like John Lennon seized upon.) Today, the ringer tee has re-emerged—thanks to assists from Kapital, Bode, Celine Homme, and other leading designers—as a strong and simple route to upping your style while still keeping your look under control. Where to start? Any of the ringer tees below are worthy pick-ups, but a simple white ringer tee is probably the perfect place to begin—dip your cautious toes and add just a touch of visual interest to an otherwise dusty outfit. To start, rock the ringer solo with a pair of your best-fitting jeans. Then, once you’re ready to level up, take it a step further and layer it under acasual button-up shirt, maybe even one with dizzying patterns or funky graphics. Go ahead: Your fit-pic mirror awaits. ERL Nordstrom Vintage fiends would kill to find a tee like this at the flea market. With its teenage aura, ERL's ringer feels like it came straight out of an Abercrombie & Fitch campaign circa 1998. Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Speaking of, Abercrombie's shrunken ringer tee fits close to the body and short, making it one of the most on-trend tees you could wear right now. Zara Zara Big, boxy, and an earthy shade of brown to cleanse the palate. Wythe Huckberry Vintage-inspired graphics and old-school tubular construction make Wythe's ringer a true blast from the past. Rhythm Huckberry It feels like this is something one of the kids fromThe Sandlotwould wear, and we're totally here for it. J.Crew J.Crew J.Crew's preppy, nautical-leaning ringer feels like it strolled straight off an East Coast schooner and into a quaint little cafe. Adidas Adidas Okay, so this may be more of a jersey, but the ringer DNA is definitely there. Kapital Mr Porter Referencing the iconic Woodstock music festival, Kapital's riff on the ringer tee is a cute addition to any closet. Bode Mr Porter Bode doesn't often do T-shirts, but when they do, it's a really good one. Everybody World Everybody World Made entirely of recycled and waste cotton, this ringer could be made from a bunch of other ringers and we think that's beautiful. Puma Nordstrom Tap into the sportier side of the ringer tee with this football-inspired rendition courtesy of Puma and Kidsuper. Joe's Amazon Collegiate-coded, minus the actual degree. Celine Homme Mr Porter Ah yes, my alma mater, University of Celine. More From GQ Connect ©2025Condé Nast.

    "title": "Bernie Sanders’s Coachella Cameo Was a Master Class in Personal Style",
    "article_text": "The annual Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival—which wrapped its first of two weekends yesterday—is a reliable place to get a preview of what thissummer’s festival-style moodboard has in store. Amid the many cowboy hats, ’90s jeans, andhead-to-toe steampunk getups, however, one of the most stylish people on the grounds on Saturday night wasn’t on the bill or in the crowd. It was Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, who openedClairo’s set with an impromptu speech while dressed in agold-buttoned blazer, darktrousers, and a blueoxford cloth button-down shirt. In addition to a call to action against theTrump administration’s ongoingchaos, the 83-year-old independent delivered another, subtler message about personal style that we’d all be wise to heed. Sanders took to the Coachella stage in his ever-reliable uniform. Sanders, somewhat famously, has little interest in fashion. He’llshake his head at your $225Nikes and attend the presidential inaugurationwearing a pair of chunky homemade mittens, a surgical mask, and a Burton snowboarding jacket. Elsewhere, his regular uniform of a navy blazer, an OCBD, and a rotation of repp and micro-dot ties gives him all the hypebeast clout of a middle school vice principal. Which is exactly the point. Sanders’ style, whether he’sgrilling RFK Jr. about his anti-vax merchor kicking back in the green room with Charli XCX, is as unmistakable and unchanging as his gravelly Brooklyn twang—give or take the occasional LA Dodgers cap, which he sported earlier on Saturday during his Los Angeles rally alongsidecongresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. As NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdanirecently told GQ, “I gotta shout out Bernie. His style is very much his politics, and I love that consistency about him. He's definitely a style icon.” Sanders in a Dodgers cap during his rally in Los Angeles with congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, which drew a crowd of 36,000. In his devotion to a uniform that’s as steadfast as his stand on universal healthcare, Bernie Sanders embodies the essence of personal style. No matter where you are, what the fashion world is doing, or what the people around you think is cool, personal style is all about figuring out what you like and what works for you and committing to it. Sanders, who was assuredly the only guy wearing a gold-buttoned blazer in Indio’s 90-degree heat (looking completely at ease nonetheless), does that as well as anyone.",

    "title": "14 Best Body Hair Trimmers for Men in 2025: Manscape with Ease",
    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. The best body hair trimmers are some of the most important grooming tools in your medicine cabinet. Whether you’re looking totrim your down-there hair,corral your pits,deforest your back, shave your ass, or all of the above, it’s good to know your options. And, becausedealing with body hairdoesn’t always meanshaving it all off, the best body hair trimmer foryouis the one that gives you the results you want. You don’t get to choose where your body hair sprouts or how aggressively it grows, but you do get to choose what to do about it—so long as you have the right tools for the job (a.k.a. top-tier manscaping groomers). You might want amulti-purpose manscaperfor hitting all points north, south, east, and chest. You might want askin-so-smoothshaver that leaves you more hydrodynamic than an Olympic swimmer. You might need something that’s body-part specific. (\"Best trimmer for balls\" is a perennially popular search for a reason.) The point is: No two men will take the same path on their body hair journey. This is why we’ve done the work, testing every body hair trimmer we can get our hands on. We’ve considered ergonomics, versatility, build quality, power (we see you, thick-pubed gents), and design details. In doing so, we’ve found the best body hair trimmers on the market for just about every guy who needs one. Read on for the best body trimmers, and to find out why they’re a cut above the rest. Panasonic Amazon Walmart Run time:50 minutes |Charge time:1 hour |Trimming lengths:0.1-12mm |Attachments:Buffer guard, adjustable 3-12mm trimming guard |Waterproof:Yes Why we like it:If you’re in a rush, it’s okay to stop reading and buy the Panasonic Body Groomer. I can handle anything from rogue sprouts to thick thatch, anywhere on your body, and handle it with ease because of the brilliant design decision that led to the trimming blade being set vertically. It frees up your wrist to treat the device like a paintbrush as you move it all around. Over your shoulder for a self-administered back trim, down the back of your arms, across your Hobbit feet, gently along your balls—control is the name of the game with the Panasonic. That V-shaped angled head also makes it easy to navigate nooks and crannies, like the under-butt and the sides of your armpits. (Like we’ve said, thebest way to trim armpit hairis to cut off whatever sticks out when your arms are down.) The hardest part of using the Panasonic Body Groomer is making sure you don’t cut too much off, because this thoughtfully designed wand can magically mow away hair without much thought or physical strain. (Seriously, once you master the behind-the-back glide across with this one, it'soverfor the other devices.) Two attachment guards make sure you’re not free-handing things when you want to leave some length: larger guard that goes up to 12mm (you’re probably using scissors for anything longer), and a mini buffer designed to protect loose skin (you can imagine where) from the kind of nicks and cuts that can come from a bare blade. It’s also handy for a quick facial hair or neckline cleanup, since the bare blade can leave one or two momentary teeth marks on sensitive areas like the neck. Because neck hair is body hair, too. Wahl Walmart Run time:3.5 hours|Charge time:1 hour|Trimming lengths:1.5mm–13mm| Attachments:8 trimming guards, adjustable guide comb|Waterproof:Yes Why we like it:Any time there’s a blade this close to your important bits, there’s a degree of trust involved. So it’s reassuring that Wahl has been a household name for over a hundred years. I’ve always been a fan of the quality of Wahl products, and our testing revealed the Wahl Manscaper Black Ops to be a consistent and dependable trimmer, equipped to handle all manner of manscaping. Right out of the box, the Black Ops inspires confidence with its well-weighted, stainless-steel build—wrapped in a grippy rubber handle to eliminate any chance of a slip. While it may sound like something you’d download for your PS5, the Manscaper Black Ops isn’t playing any games when it comes to getting the job done. The trimmer arrives with eight guards ranging from 1.5–13 millimeters, as well as an adjustable guide comb to give you more options for your hair down there. And, like its amphibious namesake, the Manscaper Black Ops is fully waterproof. Manscaped Amazon Run time:1 hour|Charge time:3 hours|Trimming lengths:1.4mm–12mm|Attachments:1.4mm trimming guard, 2 adjustable trimming guards (2–6mm, 8–12mm), foil-head shaver|Waterproof:Yes Why we like it:While you might be able to get away with leaving your trimmer at home for a weekend by the shore, things have a way of unraveling fast overlonger trips and vacations. For extended stays, you’ll want to pack a handy grooming companion to keep you tuned up from head to toe. The Lawn Mower 5.0 Ultra is designed to cross state lines and beyond: from the handy travel lock to keep the trimmer from powering on in your carry-on to the high-quality travel case to keep its attachments and charging cable organized. The unique design of two adjustable trimming guards allows each to be used to achieve three different lengths, which makes for easy transitioning and also saves space in the carry case. In our testing, the trimmer performed with reassuring power and accuracy. While 60 minutes is not the longest battery life, the trimmer’s constant RPM motor ensures the blade won’t slow down as battery levels dip. In any case, when it is time to charge, the Lawn Mower 5.0 Ultra supports USB-Candwireless charging. Remington Amazon Run time:70 minutes |Charge time:1.5 hours |Trimming lengths:1mm–20mm |Attachments:4 trimming guards, 10-length adjustable comb guard, detail trimmer, nose and ear trimmer |Waterproof:No Why we like it:If you’re ballin’ on a budget, Remington’s All-in-One Groomer is a capable, familiar trimmer that shouldn’t set off any fraud alerts on your credit card. Out of the box, this lightweight grooming tool is comfortable to hold, and the blade head twists into place with a satisfying click. The trimmer’s three fixed guards offer a standard spread of lengths, ranging from 3–9mm; and, for anything in between or beyond, the adjustable comb guard unlocks 10 additional length settings between 2–20mm. We were particularly impressed by the adjustable guard, which proved to be a handy tool for safely fine-tuning short to medium-length body hair with confidence. With additional attachments including a nose and ear trimmer, as well as a refined detail trimmer, the All-in-One Groomer lives up to its name, providing full-body coverage at an affordable price. Philips Norelco Amazon Walmart Best Buy Run time:1 hour| Charge time:1 hour| Trimming lengths:0mm, 3mm, 5mm, 7mm| Attachments:Back-trimming handle, 3 trim guards| Waterproof:Yes Why we like it:I’d consider this the very close runner-up to the Panasonic Body Groomer above, with the differentiator being that it’s not as good as a straight-up trimmer—the central task when manscaping—but itdoesbring a Swiss Army skillset. To wit: the head is both a guarded trimmer (though with only three more lengths: 3mm, 5mm, and 7mm) and a foil shaver in one, and you can attach the over-the-back handle attachment for a radically easier time eradicating your sasquatch situation. Back to the Bodygroom’s unique dual-mode trimming head: two rows of trimming teeth clip longer hairs while the foil shaver at the center mows over the stubble. If you want a smooth finish on your chest, shoulders, groin, or anywhere else without the risk of in-growns and skin irritation that can come with razors, the Philips Norelco is the hybrid of your hair-free dreams. Plus, I like the angled trimming guards, too—they make it easy to cradle the skin no matter what angle you’re mowing. The Panasonic’s genius blade design makes it a better body hair trimmer, but for a full-body smoothness, the Philips Norelco Bodygroom Series 5000 has the edge. Happy Nuts Amazon Happy Nuts Run time:90 minutes| Charge time:2 hours| Trimming lengths:0.5-11 mm| Attachments:2 trimming guards (1-5mm + 7-11mm), nose hair trimmer| Waterproof:Yes Why we like it:Happy Nuts is an aptly-named personal care brand with products that range from anti-chafe lotions to, well, the Lumberjack—a body hair trimmer that’s priced nice and does the job well if you don’t need to do too much. Its bare blade will shave hair down to the industry-standard half millimeter, while two guard attachments let you manage length fairly easily (plus a completely functional and fine nose hair trimmer). That makes the Lumberjack a well-priced tuner-upper for anyone whose sole manscaping needs are the chest and pubes. I keep it in the drawer for those quick-hit cleanups, though I’ve also used it to take my chest hair down considerably for a beach weekend. The two accessory guards (1-5mm and 7-11mm) are a bit fiddly, but the longer one let me cut my chest hair to 7mm—short, but not stubbly—with no pulling or pain. The Lumberjack is also fully waterproof; I wouldn’t suggest shaving your pubes in the shower, but it’s nice to just rinse the trimmer under the faucet and move on. Mangroomer Amazon Mangroomer Run time:80 minutes| Charge time:2.5 hours| Trimming lengths:0mm shave, 0.5mm trim| Attachments:Trimming head, foil-head shaver with trimmer| Waterproof:Yes Why we like it:Shaving your own back is a time-honored chore for the hairiest among us, and the Mangroomer Intellimax Pro brings a home-inventor level of crazy brilliance to a job that otherwise requires extreme contortions. You just unfold it, power it on, drop it over the first shoulder, and get to mowing. The trimming head doesn’t bite or leave marks, but will take hair down to the normal .5mm, while the foil-head shaver attachment will get you smooth-skinned (for maybe a day or two). You can even adjust the length of the Mangroomer’s handle for taller torsos or to get better angles on tricky spots. It was a lifesaver for me when I was single (before I could sweetly ask my partner to do the job)—and so simple that shaving my back almost became fun. I would use it directly in the shower, making for easy cleanup. (Though never with the shower running; it's waterproof, but I didn't want the handle getting slippery enough that I’d drop it.) I never had any issues with nicking orrazor burnwith the Intellimax Pro’s main trimming head, though it was trickier to get a uniform shave using the foil shaving head. Frankly, it was easier to just use the .5mm trimming head every day if I wanted to stay stubble-free. Balls Amazon BALLS Run time:1 hour| Charge time:40 minutes| Trimming lengths:3mm, 4.5mm, 6mm| Attachments:One guard with 3 trimming lengths| Waterproof:Yes Why we like it:Subtlety isn’t exactly the forté of BALLS (note the price), but this simple little trimmer really does excel at the daunting task of trimming your coin purse with ease and precision. A lot of that comes down not so much to the blade-and guard-situation—which I’ll get to in a moment—but the design of the body. The Archibald has a reinforced matte grip to prevent it from slipping, plus a silicone wrist strap to keep it from hitting the floor (or your feet) if you drop the trimmer. For both reasons, this is the only device here that I felt comfortable using in theshower. At least, if you’re just going to trim the bush, why not make clean-up easier? Ball-work still deserves to be done while sitting, though, but all that grip makes the Archibald feel more secure in your hands when you’re doing your best impression of an arthroscopic surgeon, trying not to make a nick. Its 3-step buffer guard stays snug on the tool's head so that it doesn't snag any loose skin, which is one reason I never pulled the goalie and trimmed without it. I'm more than content with a 3mm finish if it means no yelping. The Archibald is a superb body trimmer in its own right, too—but if you're church-and-state about these things, it’s the most sure-handed ball-hair destroyer on this list. Braun Braun The Art of Shaving Run time:3 hours| Charge time:2.5 hours| Trimming lengths:0.5-20mm| Attachments:13 trimming functions including a mini foil shaver, body trimmer, T-blade, and adjustable beard comb| Waterproof:Yes Why we like it:If you want an all-in-one device for hair, body, and face (or some combo of the three), this Braun has you covered. Or, well, trimmed. As a high-end beard trimmer first and foremost, it has a high-powered motor with the oomph to cut through thick patches anywhere else with ease. Meanwhile, itsfortydifferent trimming settings, all in 0.5-millimeter increments controlled by the dial, ensure you’re not stuck making your sideburns the same length as your chest hair. Of the Series 9’s myriad attachments, the fine-toothed body-buffer head is a godsend for body hair trimming, letting you mow through thick hair quickly. Not only does it provide a slight buffer between skin and teeth, but since those strands each get combed before the cut, there’s a lot less tugging and clogging than with other multitool-style trimmers. There are some obvious caveats. For one, the Braun’s not ergonomically designed to be a great back hair trimmer unless you have a very friendly roommate or a very kind partner. And you’ll need to step up your rinsing and disinfecting game if you’re planning on going face-to-balls with the same trimmer. (At the very least, maybe hit the pubesafteryou’ve hit the shower.) Philips Norelco Amazon Walmart Philips Norelco Run time:30 minutes| Charge time:8 hours| Trimming lengths:0.5mm, 3mm| Attachments:3mm guard| Waterproof:Yes Why we like it:The OneBlade arrived on the scene years back as a hybrid between an electric trimmer/shaverand amanual razor, with replaceable cartridges ensuring you always had the sharpest cutting surface. (And, let’s be honest, a reason to keep spending money.). The Intimate SkinProtect version steps up the game with coated teeth that protect against bites without compromising on stubble maintenance. For truly sensitive areas—a.k.a., where theskin’sloose and the danger’s high—I’d still recommend using the low-profile buffer guard to prevent friction or snips. Best of all, if you’re already a OneBlade owner, you can justbuy the Intimate SkinProtect cartridges, and swap them on when you start working below the neck. Wahl Amazon Wahl is a permanent fixture in many of our grooming electrical pieces for good reason: They make great trimmers. This one features detachable Safetouch ballpoint stainless-steel blades, which are gentle on your skin and easy to clean. Philips Norelco Amazon You might recognize this trimmer from ourbest beard trimmer piece, where we crowned the Multigroom Series 9000 our top overall pick. However, it's also a seriously high-quality body hair trimmer, too. With a body shave attachment and two body guards, you'll have your body hair exactly where you want it. Marlowe Amazon This trimmer from Marlowe is a go-to piece forGQsenior commerce editor Ian Burke. It's waterproof and safe to use in the shower—though if you're using it in the shower, expect to have to make a few more passes—and the ceramic trimming blade helps prevent nicks and cuts from head to toe. Meridian Amazon This no-nonsense trimmer from Meridian comes with five guards, and the company boasts that “You won't be able to cut yourself if you try.” (Probably don't try, though.) This trimmer is about as straightforward as you can get, so if you're not worried about bells and whistles, this is for you. For a professional opinion on what to prioritize when buying a body trimmer, we sought out the expertise of celebrity groomerDan Perri, who keeps A-list clients like Post Malone, Gerard Butler, and Brendan Fraser looking tidy. Here are the key attributes of a good body hair trimmer, says Perri: I’m as fuzzy as a teddy bear, so in my decade-plus as a grooming editor I’ve tested plenty of body-hair-trimming, manscaping products. I know the woes of needing a back trim without having anyone around to help, as well as the desire to look my best for a beach weekend. I’m somebody who embraces body hair, but likes to manage it—so I look for that versatility and customization in all of the devices I test. As a result of my long-standing grooming review career andGQ, I’m usually one of the first to test products as they hit the market (and sometimes before). All the body hair trimmers chosen here—and those that didn’t make the cut—were tested multiple times to determine their ability to handle different types of body hair from head to toe. I’m judging based on the obvious factors: the power to handle thick hair, good ergonomics, versatility (or, in certain cases, being extremely good at managing one tricky body part), a usable battery life, useful attachments, and precise control. How do you maintain a body hair trimmer? “If you want the best performance out of your trimmer, keeping the blade clean and lubricated is key,” says Perri. “Oiling the trimmer every few weeks will keep the blade running smooth, prevent any pulling of the hair, and keep the blade temperature down.” He adds that most trimmers come with a small supply of mineral oil—use it. (Wahl sells agreat 4-oz clipper oilfor cheap, too.) Be sure to use a machine-safedisinfectant sprayto help keep the blade sanitized, which will prevent breakouts, Perri adds. Can you use a beard trimmer for manscaping? Some beard trimmers are designed for use on the body, but only if they have attachments designed to keep skin from being pulled into the blade. Keep in mind that the ergonomics of a great beard trimmer doesn’t necessarily align with the ergonomics you’ll want for shaving body parts. You’ll have a harder time hitting hard to reach places, like the back. And beyond that, you’ll want to aggressively sanitize any trimming heads and guards that touch both your face and your…[looks down]. What is the best body hair trimmer for men? AsGQ's lead grooming product reviewer, I firmly believe that best body hair trimmer for most people is the Panasonic ER-GK-80S, with it’s innovative vertical blade that allows for easier maneuvering. You can read more about it in the review above. Dan Perriis a celebrity groomer based between NYC, LA, and Florida. His A-list clients include Post Malone, Gerard Butler, and Brendan Fraser.",

    "title": "Why the Masters Really Is the Greatest Live Sporting Event on Earth",
    "article_text": "I have attended two Super Bowls. I have been to theWorld Seriesand theWNBA Finals. I have seen a Copa America semifinal game featuring Lionel Messi, and aKnicks playoff game at the Garden. I was there when Liverpool beat Manchester United 7-0 at Anfield. I have been in the building for three MLB no-hitters. As a kid, my dad brought me to the Rose Bowl and NCAA Tournament games. But I have never experienced anything like the Masters. Everything that people say about Augusta National—the sanctified golf course, shrouded by forest in Augusta, Georgia—is true. You’ve never seen shades of green quite like the ones you see there. The club’s insistence on banning cell phones from the premises during the Masters makes it feel frozen in time, like you could be in 1975 or 2025. It is surely the only place in the world that can make thousands of straight men care about azaleas this much. But above all that, the uniqueness lies in one pretty undeniable fact: Everyone at the Masters is in a great mood. Particularly for the midweek crowd, who are watching the most prestigiousgolftournament in the world rather than sending emails or attending Zoom meetings, there’s a collective sense that, outside these 365 acres, nothing else matters or even exists. For Wednesday’s practice sessions and par-3 exhibition, plus Thursday’s opening round, the seismic pressure and swarming crowds of the weekend haven’t yet arrived. Everything’s pretty blissed out—the social acceptability of a 10 a.m. vodka lemonade certainly helps in that regard, as does being able to stroll aroundpuffing a cigar—and it’s not just the patrons who feel that way. “I’m glad to be here. It’s really cool,” golfer Ludvig Åberg told me on Wednesday. The 25-year-oldSwedeentered his second Masters ranked fifth in the world—and finished the tournament on Sunday with a respectable seventh-place finish. “It gives you some nice little feelings and makes you feel good. There’s so many stories about Augusta, like myths.Is this really true? Is this how it is? Is this what they do?There’s so many things that we don’t really know!” While walking the grounds last week—blessed with the type of Goldilocks sunshine that puts a smile on your face, but not an overwhelming layer of sweat—my mind kept returning to that tweet that called the eventCoachella for dads. That really is an apt comparison: As someone who’s been to both, I think the Masters really is much more similar to Coachella (or even Disneyland) than it is to any other sporting event. Also, I was literally there with my dad, an avid golfer who wriggled out of his own work obligations, dropped everything, and happily flew across the country to experience the mecca of golf for himself. Rather than braving the sea of Vineyard Vines,Zyn-poppingbros, and Southern belles in their best floral dresses by myself, I got to do it with the man who raised me, returning the favor for all those games he took me to when I was younger. Photo courtesy of Anne Highsmith As guests of Mercedes-Benz, we did admittedly get a different taste of Augusta than most fans. After flying into Atlanta on Tuesday evening—me from New York, my dad fromSeattle—we were greeted at the airport with an AMG GT 63, the type of machine capable of turning an auto agnostic like me into something resembling a gearhead. Cruising thestreets of Atlantato get to our hotel was one thing, but the next morning—when we set out for the two-and-a-half-hour drive on eastbound I-20 toward Augusta—I suddenly understood the appeal of serious horsepower like never before. The car came with plenty of bells and whistles, of course, from massage chairs to a button that sprays air-freshening perfume throughout the cabin. But at the end of the day, the objective is still to get from point A to point B, and there are very few ways to legally do that faster than in the GT 63. Driving through the Georgia pines, soaring past various creeks while listening to Al Green and Creedence Clearwater Revival, I felt the marriage of luxury and power that makes the model so special. Before moving to New York and giving up on driving, I used to whip around the Pacific Northwest in outdated cars that had been scratched by parking-lot bumps and bruises, or were literally stapled together by our resident family car guy. But this Wednesday morning on a trafficless interstate, turning heads with our Arabian grey exterior and easy pickup, perfectly demonstrated why people fall in love with the open road, and why a Mercedes performance car is the ideal place to do that. After arriving at our Augusta lodging and changing into country-club-approved attire, we were driven to a Mercedes-sponsored hospitality cabin right off the 10th fairway, kicking off our first day inside the fabled course. While my dad has had the golf bug since before I was born, I’ve somehow avoided getting bitten. Still, seeing the Masters from the inside gave me whatever the opposite ofParis syndromeis called. As a sensory experience, it exceeds your expectations right away. I promise you have never set foot on softer grass, or been in a place astechnologically-baresince the smartphone was invented. (By the way, if you are planning on making the trip at some point, make sure tobring a watchor risk never knowing what time it is—ever.) Everything is so well manicured and particular that it forces you to consider your every move, from the volume of your voice to the speed of your footsteps. To that point, when I tried to make a quick bathroom break and return to my seat before anyone snatched it, one of the attendants hit me with the universal, palms down motion toslow down.And he was right: what’s the rush anyway? Being at Augusta National breeds a sense of reverence, not unlike seeing a beautiful piece of art in an opulent museum. Why wouldn’t you want to indulge, take in the sights, and be as present as you can? “I think you should allow yourself to enjoy it and soak it in,” Åberg said. “Not necessarily when you’re hitting the shots or when you’re over a putt. But when you’re walking, take an extra look up at the view around yourself. I think that’s very important. The golf fan inside of me loves it.” Wednesday is the silliest, loosest day of Masters week, during which you can hear players openly talk smack during their practice rounds and watch their preschool-aged children caddy during the par-3 contest. There’s a lot of laughs, is what I’m saying, and immersing in the par-3 course felt akin to the smaller stages at Coachella where you enjoy a more downbeat 4 p.m. set before the headliners get going. Dad and I were lucky enough to be standing right behind the fourth tee box forTom Hoge’s silky hole-in-one. Again, as someone who doesn’t follow, play, or think much about golf, I was captivated by the natural ease with which the professionals swing an iron. Golf is a legendarily difficult game, but you’d never know it from watching these guys—even the ones who ended the weekend nowhere near the leaderboard. I can only hope to one day make blogging look as effortless as Åberg’s drives. On Thursday, when the real tournament got underway, Mercedes gave my pops and I the chance to begin the morning by doing something straight out of anAction Bronsonsong: We drove a Maybach EQS down Magnolia Lane. Making that sort of entrance really set the tone for the day, and undoubtedly gave me the confidence to pull off my next move. Outside the Mercedes cabin—home to the friendliest bartenders I’ve ever encountered, and some truly impeccablefried chicken—there is also a replica of the putting green on the 18th hole. For those courageous enough to attempt, a steward is there to guide you through a trio of putts, explaining how to read the twisting, turning bends for each one. The first one was maybe eight to ten feet with a left-to-right break. When Dad’s putt went begging, he joked to our temporary caddy that I, the non-golfer, would probably have beginner’s luck on his side. And wouldn’t you know it: I stepped right up and gave my ball a little tap, knowing almost right away that it had the correct pace.Draino. The golf gods gave us several other strokes of good fortune. One first-time Masters participant, the 24-year-old, bucket-hatted lefty Joe Highsmith, just so happens to be a member of the same club in Tacoma as my dad, giving us an obvious person to follow on Thursday. We watched him tackle Amen Corner, navigate the narrow fairways and impossibly deep sand traps, and deal with an understandable case of nerves that sent one shot into the gallery. But the personal connection—what a miraculous circumstance that someone my dad knew qualified for the Masters the same year I was able to bring him—gave this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity even more sentimental value. Highsmith shot four over par on Thursday and rebounded nicely with an even round on Friday, which wasn’t enough to keep him from missing the cut. But scanning the full list of players who didn’t make it to the weekend—including past champions Phil Mickelson and Dustin Johnson, along with big names likeBrooks KoepkaandTony Finau—you’re reminded that while the Masters is a literal walk in the park for the spectators, it’s a real beast for anyone holding a club. “I’ve gotten more familiar with the golf course,” Åberg told me. “But it’s still sort of hollowed ground. You almost tiptoe around.” I could go on and on about the two days I was granted access to golf heaven, both on an individual level and the privilege of doing it with my golf-obsessed father. I flew back to LaGuardia on Friday with a full mental scrapbook, a fuller heart, and the lingering question of whether this will be the thing that finally gets me into this sport. (I did watch a bit of it on Saturday and Sunday, but I still think one cannot fully lock in to a golf tournament on TV unless they play themselves or are a tad older than me.) That being said, there were a handful of moments that I will never forget, and can now be immortalized for as long as the internet exists.",

    "title": "11 Best Water Bottles of 2025 for Staying Hydrated All Day, Every Day",
    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. Shopping for the best water bottles used to be easy, but between TikTok water bottle cults and emotional support Hydro Flasks (okay, we’ve been there), hydration has gotten weirdly complicated. Sure, some of today’s most buzzy water bottles live up to the hype—but a lot of them are overbuilt, overly complicated, or just plain annoying to use. A good water bottle should make your lifeeasier, not harder. We’ve tested dozens of water bottles over the years. Some bottles are built like tanks but weigh a ton. Others look great but leak the second you toss them in abag. For this list, we looked for the ones that hit the right middle ground: easy to drink from,easy to clean, keep your water cold, durable enough to survive getting knocked around, and good-looking enough that you’ll actually want to use them. Hydro Flask Amazon Capacity:32 ozWeight:1.03 poundsMaterial:Stainless SteelDishwasher Safe:Yes Nearly every water bottle brand claims 24 hours of cold. And the reality is that if a company uses double-wall stainless steel, you’ll get pretty similar results across the board. But Hydro Flask has been the gold standard for a minute—and for good reason. Their smart designs and clean aesthetic set them apart from the pack. I’ve tested nearly every Hydro Flask bottle over the years, and their new travel bottle, which dropped last year, nails it: big enough that you’re not refilling constantly, but tapered at the bottom so it actually fits in a cup holder. It also comes with two cap options—a straw lid or a chug cap—and both are way easier to open than the standard twist-off (pretty much Hydro Flask’s only flaw). They're durable, too. The ones I’ve had for years are still kicking, with maybe a small dent or two where I’ve dropped them countless times. The only reason you’d need to buy another? Theirlimited-edition color drops, which are so good they make other brands seem slightly out of touch. Nalgene Nalgene Capacity:16 ozWeight:3.1 ozMaterial:BPA-Free plasticDishwasher Safe:Yes I used to leave my house sans water bottle because I couldn’t be bothered to carry around a sloshing 30+ ounces all day. But this mini bottle is the perfect fix. It weighs next to nothing and fits in any bag. It’s bare bones: just BPA-free plastic with a screw top lid, so don’t expect insulation or any fancy sipping mechanism. But it keeps me hydrated in ways fancier bottles don’t, simply because I actually bring it with me. Bonus points: It's the perfect size for tossing in someelectrolyteorpre-workout powder. Yeti Yeti Amazon Capacity:34 ozWeight:0.67 lbsMaterial:BPA-Free plasticDishwasher Safe:Yes Need a water bottle that’s light enough to haul up a mountain without cursing every step? The Yeti Yonder is just that. ​​Unlike their classic stainless steel Ramblers, the Yonder trades weight for portability—making it the perfect companion for long hikes or sweaty days when every ounce matters. The cap is smooth to drink from, easy to twist open, and, crucially, leakproof when you inevitably toss it in the back of your car. And it's surprisingly sleek—even though it’s made of plastic, it feels higher quality than that ol’ dingy water bottle hidden in the back of your cabinet. Brümate Brümate Amazon Capacity:25 ozWeight:1.28 lbsMaterial:Stainless steel and siliconeDishwasher Safe:Yes When I first heard of BruMate, I thought:Do we really need another water bottle company?But they’ve quietly hit their stride—and I’ve been thoroughly impressed with their latest lineup, especially the Resa straw bottle. It’s everything the Stanley isn’t: 100% leak-proof, easy to toss in a bag without second-guessing, and subtle enough that you don’t look like you’re heading to a suburban PTA meeting. When you do throw it in your gym bag, just remember to twist the top to lock it. For those trying to cut down on plastic exposure, the straw is made of stainless steel (one of the first of its kind), which also delivers icy cold water with every sip. LifeStraw Lifestraw Capacity:1LWeight:1.13 lbsMaterial:Stainless steelDishwasher Safe:Yes (without filter) When you’re bouncing between airports, hiking trails, and towns with questionable tap water, LifeStraw’s Go Series provides peace of mind. It filters out bacteria, parasites, and microplastics so you can sip worry-free, even if you’re filling up from the sink in your hotel or at a random gas station bathroom. I've brought mine on trips all over the world, and never had to think twice about filling up from wherever I could find a faucet. Fair warning, the flow is slower with the filter in, so you won’t exactly be chugging. When you’re back somewhere with reliable water, you can just pop out the filter and drink like normal. Although I have the one-liter version, learn from my mistake: Get the 24-ounce size unless you want to carry what feels like a smalldumbbellthrough the airport. Bink Bink Capacity:27 ozWeight:Not listedMaterial:Glass, food grade silicone rubberDishwasher Safe: If you hate drinking out of plastic but don’t trust yourself with anakedglass bottle, the Bink Day Bottle is a solid move. It’s wrapped in a soft silicone sleeve that makes it feel way sturdier than it looks—and saves you from cracking it the first time it slips out of your hand. What really sets it apart, though, is the hydration tracking printed on the side. Instead of another vibrating app notification yelling at you to drink more water, the Bink just quietly reminds you what you should’ve sipped by noon, 2 p.m., and so on. Follow along and you’ll hit a little over two liters by the end of the day without even thinking about it. If you do manage to break the bottle within the first year, Bink will send you a replacement—you just have to pay shipping, so maybe don’t start chucking it around for fun. LARQ LARQ Capacity:23 ozWeight:15.5 ozMaterial:Double-wall stainless steelDishwasher Safe:N/A Self-cleaning sounds like a scam until you try the LARQ. Tap the button on the lid and UVC light zaps away bacteria lurking in your bottle (or your water) in just 60 seconds. It’s sleek, minimal, and perfect for people who alwaysmeanto wash their bottle but...don’t. It also has a removable filter straw if you want to fill up from backcountry streams or sketchy taps. The tech doesn’t stop there: Sensors track your drinking habits through the app, sending you insights and reminders. The only real downside is that it’s one more thing you have to remember to plug in. But considering it saves you from funky smells and mystery floaties, it’s worth keeping the charger handy. Owala Amazon We couldn’t make a “best water bottles” list without the Owala FreeSip, because at this point it’s basically hydration royalty. It’s one of the few bottles that’s gone properly viralanddeserves it. The FreeSip’s big selling point is the lid: you can either sip through the built-in straw or tilt it back like a regular water bottle—no weird twisting, flipping, or leaking involved. And if the neon color combos aren’t your thing, don’t worry: It comes in a classic all-black version—you just won’t look like part of the cult. Kinto Kinto Most water bottles either look like they belong at the gym or like they belong on a preschool snack table. Kinto’s Trail Tumbler somehow looks goodeverywhere.It’s design-forward without being flashy, thanks to its clean lines, muted colors, and a double-walled build. It’s technically a tumbler, but it feels sturdy enough to handle light hikes, bike commutes, and anything else that requires a little more style than a standard water jug. Plus, it’s the kind of bottle you won’t feel weird setting down on the table in a meeting. Stanley Stanley It’s honestly a surprise that something so sophisticated and understated comes from the same brand that created the Quencher monstrosity. The All Day Slim cuts out the bulk and oversized handles for a bottle that’s actually easy to carry and leak proof enough to trust in your bag. You still get Stanley’s solid insulation, just without letting the entire world know you drink water. Fanhaw Amazon GQ's senior commerce editorIan Burkeloves this cheap water bottle. “It's actually got a pretty good chug cap,” he says. “While it doesn't keep my water as cold as, say, a YETI might, it's still pretty good—and for 12 bucks, it's hard to beat.” Pick the right bottle, and staying hydrated feels easy. Pick the wrong one, and it ends up rolling around in your backseat until next summer. Choose wisely, friends: What is the best water bottle? The Hydroflask 32oz Wide Mouth Travel Bottle is our top pick for the best water bottle, based on design, value, and looks. What is the best self-cleaning water bottle? The best self-cleaning water bottle is the Larq Self-Cleaning Bottle, in our opinion, since it's sleek and perfect for people who alwaysmeanto wash their bottle, but don’t.",

    "title": "The Best Coachella Experience Is Watching It From Your Couch",
    "article_text": "This is an edition of the newsletterPulling Weeds With Chris Black,in which the columnist weighs in on hot topics in culture.Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Thursday. If you are even marginally online, you are aware that the first weekend of Coachella just finished at the Empire Polo Club in Indio, California. I have been toCoachellaonce. We drove to Indio from Los Angeles and back on the same long day. We saw Spiritualized (my younger friend didn’t realize J. Spaceman sat down the whole time), Phoebe Bridgers at the height of her powers, and Harry Styles, a true headliner with hits and charisma. We got back to L.A. at 3 AM. I was glad I had gone, but I never need to go again. Luckily, Coachella is now livestreamed on YouTube,so this year I could watch it from my couch in New York Cityand not encounter sweaty teens on drugs looking for their campsite or a bathroom. This year’s headliners Lady Gaga, Green Day,Post Malone, and Travis Scott don’t get me going. That being said,Lady Gagais a true performer; even when it gets too theatrical for my tastes, it plays well on the big stage, and she has undeniable songs. Green Day is one of the most uncool bands ever to exist. Post Malone is beloved, has songs, and leans a little country, which plays well in 2025. Watching Travis Scott, even on YouTube, gives me brain damage. Charli XCX (who should’ve headlined, and was spotted at an afterparty wearing a beauty-pageant sash to that effect, causing Green Day fans to react like she’d burned an effigy of Tré Cool) brought out Lorde, Billie Eilish (this killed me), andTroye Sivan, for a performance that genuinely lit up social media. Before an excellent performance, Clairo was introduced by 83-year-old politician Bernie Sanders, which alsogot people talking. Benson Boone donned his sequins, did his little flips, and brought out Brian May from Queen, andno one cared. Missy Elliott and Jimmy Eat World were solid.Japanese Breakfast inexplicably covered the cartoon band, Gorillaz,Justin Bieber couldn’t keep his pants up, and most of the crowd woreheinous outfits. Before the weekend, I saw a story saying that over half of the general admission tickets to Coachella were purchased using a payment plan, which just cemented my thinking that Coachella, which hasn’t been cool in a decade, is now merely a rite of passage for young people.66% of people polled by Variety said they were there for the experience, not the music.If you grew up in the mid-aughts, Coachella was a glamorous weekend in the desert that produced countless iconic photos of celebrities in offensive outfits driving golf carts in various states of intoxication; it felt like something you needed to go to. But in 2025, the number of festivals is overwhelming, and ticket prices are only getting higher. None of them get the media attention, celebrity attendance, and brand dollars like Coachella, but they offer pretty good line-ups. The most significant trend in festival culture is going genre, leaving the poptimism in the desert and super-serving a thinner demographic slice. Goldenvoice, the promotion company behind Coachella, now puts on festivals for geriatric millennials (Just Like Heaven), elder goths (Cruel World), and people who somehow don’t get enough Jellyroll in their day-to-day lives (Stagecoach.) I am not sure you will catch Timothée Chalamet in the crowd in a Hysteric Glamor hat and a backpack holding hands with Kylie Jenner and watchinga reunited Rilo Kiley play the Rose Bowl, but you never know. The bottom line is that Coachella is for young people who want to dress like it’s Y2K, vape, and make TikToks. But if you are over 30 and need to experience a music festival, there are plenty of options—even if they don’t haveNobu omakase.",

    "title": "Bon Iver Threw a Basketball Tournament To Launch ‘SABLE, fABLE’",
    "article_text": "Saturday afternoon in downtown Los Angeles: a long line of Bon Iver fans, thickly bearded, wait patiently for a show. There will be no music, however—at least none played by Justin Vernon, who’s lacing up a fresh pair of salmon-coloredDevin Booker Nikes. He’s here to play pick-up basketball, like he often does, even though he’s nursing a recently rolled ankle. “It’s sore, but I’m gonna be aight,” he says about 15 minutes before game time, looking over the new shoes. His signature beanie has been swapped for a bandana sweatband. Vernon doesn’t want to tour anytime soon —perhaps ever againin the traditional sense, if you think he’s not bluffing. So the best bet for fans to see him perform in support ofSABLE, fABLE, the new,uncharacteristically buoyantBon Iver album, is to cram into the Terasaki Budokan gym in Little Tokyo and observe his jump shot. Why promote an album with a basketball game? “Well, the whole record is about steering to the sunlight or whatever, and being happy,” he considers. “So that’s what we’re doing.” It’s a celebrity tournament, but not in the truest sense. There are a few recognizable faces throwing on custom Sables or Fables jerseys, likeTravis Bennett, a.k.a. Taco from Odd Future, a.k.a. Elz fromDave(Fables; #69; confident and aggressive with the ball in his hands). But for the most part the four teams are made up of everyday people whom Vernon plays with at a gym in nearby Silver Lake. “When I moved to L.A.,” Vernon says, “my first real friends I made that weren’t in music were just friends I made at the coffee shop. And we just started playing hoops together.” At least one of the players getting ready on the sidelines, a lawyer named Ben Covington (Sables, #1984, strong outside shooter), doesn’t even know the host—this is more of a friend-of-a-friend type thing. “We play in a rec league,” Covington says, eyeing the crowd, “but there’s never people watching.” The setup is a four-team bracket, with the winners of the first two games then fighting for the championship. (The prize: bragging rights, and whatever beer is left in the VIP area after the losing teams are through with it.) The backboards have been updated with the black-and-salmon color scheme of the album, and a slightly alien-ish salmon basketball is used in the games. Outside, tinned Atlantic salmon from the Bon Iver x Fishwife collab —no,really—is being handed out. Vernon (Sables,#21) is one of the taller players on the floor for the first game—a hearty, Wisconsin-bred six-foot-three—and sets the tone on the first possession after the tip: a pump fake to draw the defender in, followed by a pass out to assist a teammate on a deep three. This is a good representation of Vernon’s game—turning down open shots to find better looks elsewhere on the floor. Getting everyone involved. Though he admits his vertical has shrunk “in half” in the last decade, he still has a knack for boxing out and grabbing boards. When Vernon shoots, it’s usually a Midwestern-worthy midrange turnaround; he hits one early on and then mimes a gun going back in its holster. Scouts looking for a player comp might do well with retired French power forward Boris Diaw. (Vernon, having grown up in the sports franchise no man’s land of Eau Claire, roots for the NBA’s Milwaukee Bucks and the WNBA’s Minnesota Lynx, for those keeping score.) Danielle Haim, who features on theSABLE, fABLEtrack“If Only I Could Wait,”is watching from the sidelines, and her sister Este sits down next to her in the second quarter. One of Vernon’s teammates ends up on the floor with no call, and Este seizes on it: “That’s a fouuuuuuulllll,” she yells. The refs appear to hear her and proceed to stop swallowing their whistle for the rest of the afternoon. Vernon says he thinks of basketball like jazz: “You’re improvising in a form, and you’re flowing, and you’re following momentum, and you’re retreating from momentum, you're following the lead energy. It’sexactlylike jazz.” Poetry in motion, but also notably a team sport—knowing how to guide while also getting others involved.There’s a rhythm. It’s the shots you don’t take. The first do-or-die game is surprisingly close and physical as the fourth quarter starts to wind down, and Vernon’s Sables are trying to close the gap. Down three with the clock about to expire, one of Vernon’s teammates heaves up a halfcourt Hail Mary. It’s a good look—but runs out of gas just before the basket. This was coming out of a timeout, meaning Vernon clearly didn’t ask for the ball. Bon Iver is a band now—not a solo project—for a reason. He doesn’t want to be on his own in the damn woods anymore. “That only happened once, and I gotFor Emmaout of it,” Vernon says. “But you’re never really on your own, even though you think you are.”",

    "title": "13 Best Swim Trunks for Men 2025: Tested by GQ",
    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. These days, the best swim trunks for men are more than just, well,swimtrunks—they’re justreally good shortsthat happen to know how to do the backstroke. Think of swim shorts like a certified lifeguard: They can handle all of the noble duties required of the beach (sunbathing, surfing, strolling to and from the boardwalk hot dog stand), but most of their time is spent away from their primary job. From the fit to the fabric to the details, the swim trunks below pair seamlessly with the rest of your wardrobe, and won't look a hair out of place whether you're hanging at home, heading out for a jog, or hitting the corner store down the street. And if the opportunity comes to take a dip in your buddy's pool, or spend the weekend at the sun-drenched locale of your choice? You'll be perfectly dressed and ready to go. So with all that in mind, here are 13 of the absolute finest multi-purpose, next-generation, and yes, all-around best men's swim trunks to buy right now—all tested and reviewed byGQeditors. Bather Bather Fabric:100% recycled nylon |Inseam:5.5 inches |Sizes:XS-XXL |Liner:Mesh liner There’s a reason why Bather tops this guide every summer. For years, the Toronto-based label has peddled the platonic ideal swim short, cut with the ideal inseam and in a silhouette that flatters every body type. It features a silky-soft mesh lining that’s comfortable and protective—and it’s made from 100% recycled quick-dry nylon that performs well in the water and won’t look out of place if you’re wearing it a few miles from the beach. In our testing, Bather trunks hold up like a champ through beach days, workouts, weekend hangs, and heavy wash cycles. “I only brought one pair of swim trunks with me on a recent trip, and I know swim trunks are supposed to dry fast, but damn, these were bone-dry faster than I could hop into the pool again,” says GQ associate commerce editor Tyler Chin. He also mentions that he loves the fit and that the inseam offers just enough thigh action without veering too close to X-rated content. They also come in dozens of solid colors and wild patterns—from plain Jane navy and white to trippy florals—so it’s damn-near impossible not to find one that works for you. For more water-ready goodness, check out our ode to theBather’s best-in-class trunks. Patagonia Huckberry Fabric:100% recycled nylon |Inseam:5 or 7 inches |Sizes:S-XXL |Liner:Mesh liner If any one pair was responsible for launching the swimwear-as-shorts movement, it’d bePatagonia Baggies. For close to 40 years now, they’ve been the signature warm-weather bottoms of hardcore mountaineers, deep sea fishers, camper van lifers, dedicated Deadheads, and backyard-grilling dads the world over. More recently—as the fashion world has gravitated toward practical, outdoorsy gear—they’ve also been adopted as the summer uniform for a certain strain of stylish young fella. It’s easy to see the appeal across all those demographics: they’re tough but lightweight, laidback but presentable, affordable as hell, trend-proof in fit and form and function. “You’ll spot these shorts equally around town than you will around the pool,” says GQ associate commerce director Michael Nolledo, who owns several pairs (“multiple colorways are a must”), adding they’re an “absolute essential” for travel because of their sheer versatility. Birdwell Birdwell Fabric:100% proprietary nylon fabric |Sizes:S-XXL| Liner:No liner Way back in 1961, Carrie Birdwell Mann started sewing heavyweight nylon shorts for surfing—\"beach britches,\" as she called them, the very first of their kind—from her living room in Southern California. Six decades later, her original two-ply, triple-stitched design is still as handsome, practical, and impossible to wear out as ever. Today, Birdwell’s flagship board shorts are available in two lengths depending on size:the 310s(short) and300s(medium length) and a bevy of classically tinged colorways. No matter what length you choose, if you're after some serious throwback, hang-ten, shaka-hand energy, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better pair of drawstring waist boardies than these. Sunspel Sunspel Fabric:70% Seaqual™ polyester, 30% recycled polyester |Sizes:XS-XXL| Liner:Mesh liner If you don’t think swim trunks have the sartorial range to be worn when there’s no water in sight, Sunspel’s Tailored Swim Short will make you a believer. The luxury British label’s classic trunk has a tailored fit with an adjustable waist and the same convenient pockets and zip fly as any regular short. Perhaps the best part is that the quick-dry fabric is made of all recycled material, the majority from upcycled marine plastic. “To call these trunks ‘rad’—orposh, in the parlance of our friends across the pond—is true, but it’s also woefully inadequate,” says GQ senior commerce editor Avidan Grossman. “I’m going to level with you: I’ve got zero ass to speak of and hips daintier thana ballet flat, and these flutter around my thighs with Baryshnikov-like grace.” Don’t let their tony pedigree fool you, either: Over the course of the last few months, Grossman has worn Sunspel’s swim shorts into the ground, with easy, breezy striped shirts andfisherman sandals—but also threadbarewhite teesand thrashed Vans. “I hate the beach,” Grossman adds. “These might be the only valid reason to go.” Stone Island Mr. Porter Fabric:100% recycled polyamide and nylon |Sizes:S-XXXL| Liner:Mesh liner We’ve tested our fair share of luxury swim trunks, and while we still stand by our past picks, which include handsome shorts fromFrescobol CariocaandOrlebar Brown, we are quite taken by the quiet flex that comes with sporting Stone Island’s Nylon Metal Swim Shorts. Everything about these shorts—in terms of colors, design, silhouette, and fabric—is subtle. But a closer inspection reveals a highly considered swim trunk cut from quick-dry recycled nylon fabric with an unmistakable iridescent crinkle texture. GQ commerce writer Gerald Ortiz, who believes many swim trunks suffer from garish colors and patterns, appreciates that Stone Island takes “the more difficult route of stripping away the extraneous details and focuses on materials.” The fabric is solid,” he says, “but far from boring thanks to the luxe feel and the mesmerizing metallic sheen.” Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Fabric:44% Polyamide, 25% Cotton, 25% Polyester, 6% Lyocell |Sizes:XS-XXL| Liner:Mesh liner Todd Snyder's pull-on surf short—like many things Todd Snyder—is a luxe upgrade on a classic, in this time, the regular board short or “baggie.” It's ideal for sweltering vacations, thanks to its quick-drying, lightweight Portuguese seersucker that also simply feels incredibly nice to run your hands over. Never one to scrimp on the details, Todd Snyder has also included an elastic drawstring waist, fine mesh liner, a self-draining back pocket, and a key holder to help you keep your car or room key secure even while hitting the surf. These 5-inch shorts hit around the mid-thigh, but Todd also makes them in alonger 7-inch. Outerknown Outerknown Fabric:89% recycled polyester, 6% recycled spandex, 5% spandex |Inseam:9 inches |Sizes:28-38| Liner:No liner The headline of Outerknown’s Apex trunk is right in its name: It was developed and tested by 11-time world surfing champ Kelly Slater. But you don’t have to be a wave enthusiast to appreciate the fact that the stretchy performance fabric is made from 100% post-consumer waste. Given that these linerless shorts are designed with water sports in mind, you also get stitch-free seams to reduce unnecessary chafing that would happen otherwise. “I didn’t do any extreme water sports in these, but I could see why a surfer would love them—they’re quite stretchy and don’t restrict your movement,” Chin says. He also adds that he prefers a shorter inseam on his swim trunks, but the overall look is perfectly fine. CDLP CDLP CDLP’s slinky skivvies are a mainstay ofour underwear coveragefor a few reasons, primary among them the brand’s uncanny ability to wrap a glut of next-gen flourishes in sleek, downrightsexyinteriors. In the case of the Swedish label’s signature swim shorts, those flourishes take the form of a planet-friendly Econyl satin twill fabric, and a silhouette designed to hit the thigh a little higher than you might be used to. (No bad thing.) Wellen Huckberry One for the comfort-heads, Wellen prides itself on having the softest linings on the market, in this case a boxer-brief plush performance mesh. Coupled with the brand's 4-way stretch fabric, and you've got yourself a short that will never chafe, twist, or rub. Nice going. Outlier Outlier Outlier’s New Way Shorts can truly do it all, and look good while doing it. These boxy, relaxed shorts are the epitome of a hybrid short, with drawstrings and a lightweight breathable fabric that’ll dry quickly. If you're looking for a longer inseam, Outlier also offers theNew Way Seven Fives. Noah Mr Porter New York City's Noah is no stranger to threads inspired by the sea, and the brand's swim trunks are cut generously and available in interesting colorways you won't quite find anywhere else. Vuori Vuori Vuori's status continues to rise, simply because very few guys who try their affordable, premium-feeling, fast drying swim shorts ever look back. The Core is the short the brand really pushes, but for a more water-based lifestyle, the slightly more retro-styled Banks short is the one to go for. Ten Thousand Ten Thousand A comfortable minimal waistband, compression liner, and bonded hems make Ten Thousand’s Set Short one of the best performance trunks on the market. Available in a 5-inch or 6.5-inch inseam, it’s designed to seamlessly transition between water and land, which is all you can really ask for in a swim trunk. Style is subjective, we know—that’s the fun of it. But we’re serious about helping our audience get dressed. Whether it’s thebest white sneakers, the flyest affordable suits, or the need-to-knowmenswear drops of the week, GQ Recommends’ perspective is built on years of hands-on experience, an insider awareness of what’s in and what’s next, and a mission to find the best version of everything out there, at every price point. Our staffers aren’t able to try on every single piece of clothing you read about on GQ.com (fashion moves fast these days), but we have an intimate knowledge of each brand’s strengths and know the hallmarks of quality clothing—from materials and sourcing, to craftsmanship, to sustainability efforts that aren’t just greenwashing. GQ Recommends heavily emphasizes our own editorial experience with those brands, how they make their clothes, and how those clothes have been reviewed by customers. Bottom line: GQ wouldn’t tell you to wear it if we wouldn’t. We make every effort to cast as wide of a net as possible, with an eye on identifying the best options across three key categories:quality,fit, andprice. To kick off the process, we enlist the GQ Recommends braintrust to vote on our contenders. Some of the folks involved have worked in retail, slinging clothes to the masses; others have toiled for small-batch menswear labels; all spend way too much time thinking about what hangs in their closets. We lean on that collective experience to guide our search, culling a mix of household names, indie favorites, and the artisanal imprints on the bleeding-edge of the genre. Then we narrow down the assortment to the picks that scored the highest across quality, fit, and price. Across the majority of our buying guides, our team boasts firsthand experience with the bulk of our selects, but a handful are totally new to us. So after several months of intense debate, we tally the votes, collate the anecdotal evidence, and emerge with a list of what we believe to be the absolute best of the category right now, from the tried-and-true stalwarts to the modern disruptors, the affordable beaters to the wildly expensive (but wildly worth-it) designer riffs. Whatever your preferences, whatever your style, there's bound to be a superlative version on this list for you. (Read more about GQ's testing processhere.)",

    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. Time has not been kind to Joel Miller. His hair is overgrown. His beard has more gray than usual. Hell, he needs reading glasses now. But his taste in outerwear? That remains unchanged. In the season two premiere ofThe Last of Us,we find our heroes Joel and Ellie, played byPedro PascalandBella Ramseyrespectively, five years after we left them back in season one. The zombies are still raging, people are still conspiring (hello, Catherine O'Hara), and Joel is still wearing his Flint and Tinderwaxed trucker jacket, presumably becauseeven SSENSE has shutteredin the wake of a fungal pandemic. Flint and Tinder Huckberry Flint and Tinder Huckberry We clocked Joel's go-to jacket throughout season one of the show (along with no shortage ofcovetable menswear), but few of his stylistic choices piqued our interests as much as his rugged trucker. Which makes a heckuva lot of sense: Flint and Tinder’s jacket isn’t one of Huckberry's most popular items—itisHuckberry's most popular item. Joel's particular version is cut from a hardy 7 oz. sailcloth cotton and equipped with a cozy flannel lining, and it's long been one ofGQ’s favorites. (And one of yours, too.) Will it keep you protected from the undead? Probably not. But short of an actual apocalypse, we can’t think of a cold-weather scenario where itwon’tcome in handy, on its own with a beefy cable-knit and somenew-age selvedge, or layered underneath a snazzy topcoat andfuzzy fleece pantson a blustery January morning. Flint and Tinder Huckberry Flint and Tinder Huckberry Even five fictional years later, the Flint and Tinder jacket still kills (metaphorically!). It wears its age gracefully, having looked like it's never been washed in the half-decade since we last saw it, ravaged by dust, debris, snow, rain, and—more than likely—its share of Clicker blood. Anyone who's played video games can probably guess what to expect next, but how this jacket factors intoTheLast of Usseason 2 action is still a mystery. Until then, stock up while inventory lasts and enjoy cosplaying as your favorite zombie-fighting zaddy.",

    "title": "The Assistant Who Turned Virgil Abloh’s DMs Into Culture-Altering Realities",
    "article_text": "Anyone who ever exchanged a FaceTime, DM, or WhatsApp message withVirgil Ablohknows Athi. That would be Athiththan Selvendran, Abloh’s first employee and dedicated right hand for over five years. No job title could capture just how critical Selvendran was to Abloh’sintensely prolific creative operation, which transcended time zones and spanned fashion, art, architecture, design, and music. Abloh used to call his iPhone his office, and Selvendran—first as his assistant and then as chief of staff—was the strategist who wrangled the ideas that erupted from the cloud and made them tangible. It was an intense gig—at the peak of Abloh’s productivity, when he was the creative director of Louis Vuitton Men’s, the designer was known to receive over 400 text messages a day. “We were just on our phones 24/7,” Selvendran says. Yet Selvendran, who joined Abloh in 2016 following a stint as a publicist at KCD, handled the pressure with grace, becoming something of an insider legend for his relentlessly cheerful communications that could make even the grimmest fashion busybody smile. (Instead of “thank you,” Athi might say “Sending a plethora of gratitude and sincere thanks!”) Now, Abloh’s former protégé is stepping into a leadership position as chief creative officer of theVirgil Abloh Foundation, the philanthropic organization established in 2021 followingAbloh’s passing. In his new role, Selvendran will be in charge of Abloh’s archives, and will also “spearhead the design and implementation of global initiatives, lead impact programming and brand collaborations as well as partnerships designed to break down barriers for aspiring creatives, cultural leaders and community builders,” per a press release by Virgil Abloh Securities, the creative corporation led by Shannon Abloh, where Selvendran also serves as chief operating officer. “Having spent years working alongside Virgil, Athi has developed a deep understanding of what it means to break barriers and redefine creative industries,” said Shannon Abloh in a statement. “His innate talent, sharp creative instincts, and ability to connect with people on a profound level make him the ideal person for this role.” In late March, Selvendran called me from London, where he was already making good on his new responsibilities. Along with Shannon, Selvendran was leading a group of 10 high schoolers from Chicago on the maiden voyage ofAbloh Air, a program designed to give disadvantaged students from Abloh’s hometown the field trip of a lifetime: a 10-day tour through London and Paris, where they were treated to workshops and panels hosted by some of Abloh’s many friends and former collaborators, including Tremaine Emory, Samuel Ross, and Sir Jony Ive. “It's carrying on his vision,” Selvendran says of the pilot program. “V believed in the younger generation. You often heard him speak about how young people are the ones whose ideas shift the world. And if we have the ability and the resources and the access to do so, I believe it's our duty to ensure that we create change in this world.” In a way, there’s a profound continuity in Selvendran’s new job, where he’s still helping make Abloh’s often lofty concepts real. In the archive, set to be located in Chicago, Selvendran is quite literally tracking down his old boss’s digital correspondence and cataloguing it alongside physical objects. Eventually, the idea is that the Virgil Abloh archive will be an educational space where visitors can examine exactlyhowhis sneaker designs and art projects came together by digging into his DMs. “Most people have iPhones,” Selvendran says, echoing Abloh’s legacy, which ultimately was to inspire creativity in other people: “If you have a tool like that, you can actually produce any idea you have in your mind. It’s about understanding how to go about it.” Athiththan “Athi” Selvendran: It was different every single day. I would be engaging with so many people at once trying to ensure that anything that V had on his mind—an idea thought or anything of that nature—came to life. I was only in my early 20s and I was just immersed in the work. I got the responsibility to manage big projects with big brands and big names. A huge component was connecting with other creatives and processing the concepts that would go back and forth on WhatsApp, iMessage, email, just being on top of everything. As the years progressed, so did the output. And our team was always lean. So it wasn't a job for me, it was my life. But I can say that I could be awake for 24 hours and I would never feel like I missed sleep. I was just excited and happy to make things come to life. There was one seminal moment in 2018 when we were working on a gallery exhibition in Tokyo, and we spontaneously flew to Tokyo and spent three days straight putting together the show from scratch. We were just on our phones 24/7. Any engagement that he had with someone, I would need to facilitate it. To be honest with you, I loved working in the background. I never wanted to be upfront, so I was always right behind him. For many years people didn’t really know what I looked like. For me, the work was most important. That’s from V, too. V treated everyone with respect. What's so powerful about him was the humanity factor. He gave everyone the time of day. Anyone who came up to him with a question, he would spend the time. It wasn't forced or conceived or anything, it was just how he interacted with and treated people. And that's why our whole ecosystem and thecommunity that we built, why everyone is so supportive of each other. Everyone was happy to be with each other in every single moment that we had. We were always together as a collective to accomplish whatever the output was. Shannon has built the Virgil Abloh Foundation to support V’s vision of producing a world where anyone who is creative and has an idea should be able to share their message. And I’ve invested my life proceeding in these roles or titles or whatever you may call them. It’s something that I’m going to do, I believe, for the rest of my life. I’m invested in Virgil Abloh's vision, Shannon Abloh's vision, and the foundation’s vision. Ultimately we’re trying to ensure that we're touching the spirits of so many people in the world and allowing them to become the people that they're dreaming to become. I think every single young person has a dream. They seek that dream and I believe that we can help them be a doer of their dream. With the Abloh Air pilot program, we’re producing workshops, panels, and conversations, creating opportunities for aspiring creatives from underrepresented communities to be a part of processes with people who are creatively resonant, people who have done the journey themselves. It's giving them support that's tangible. We all know the process of applying for schools, right? These kids might be competing for art or design school against contemporaries who already have the experiences and portfolios built to get through the door. So we're immersing them in the work and getting our community collaborators involved in the dialogue. And Virgil had so many friends and collaborators who are willing to come and help and be a part of the conversation. Ultimately, we want to be part of their lives. I think this is not a program that's one and done. We are trying to figure out ways to help them through their high school years, their college years, and even longer. At the end of the day, we want to see them succeed and evolve. So say they have an idea that they want to create and we know there's a person that can actually help them do it—we can connect the dots. We can facilitate the cross-pollination of ideas. It comes down to the fact that Shannon is deeply committed to removing all barriers in pursuit of limitless career futures. And at the end of the day, if you put the energy out there and you put that belief and the power in the work that you do, you are going to create change. And if not us, who will do it? To give you context, when we kicked off the project, Virgil's works were distributed globally. We had things in Paris, Italy, elsewhere in Europe and Asia as well. So it's a 10-year project and right now we’re in the third year of the process. V archived everything, from his high school and college years through Off-White, Nike, Louis Vuitton, and even things that were concepted but hadn’t been released yet. So we’re processing and cataloguing everything in a format so we can understand how we can bring it to the world so people can understand where his ideas came from. And we're going through all the objects and trying to find the synergy between the way that we worked, which of course was through WhatsApp and digital formats. We're trying to find the through lines and connect the tangible objects with the digital formats. At this moment in time we're focused on programming, but it is something that we're thinking of doing in the future. And think of it this way, with the archive, these tangible objects are going to be resources for people to reflect on. There will be activations with the archive, which we want to use as an educational resource, because there's a historical relevance to everything in there, and things happening in this day and age that were built off Virgil’s ideas and work. So for the younger generation who didn’t grow up with this, to be able to show them the through lines and connecting dots, I think that will be a beautiful thing. I mean, you have to see how these tools were used in order to create a final output and a final project. I think when you see a process occurring through something such as WhatsApp or even Instagram or any social media, it also gives you a belief system. Most people have iPhones. If you have a tool like that, you can actually produce any idea you have in your mind. It’s about understanding how to go about it. Yeah, there's a line he told me super early in my career: always listen. When you’re in a space, you don’t always have to talk. You can just listen to what’s happening, understand the communication, and learn from that. Just be present. And when the time comes, you’ll know what to say.",

    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. Let’s just say it here: thank god Timothée Chalamet is at Coachella. It’s no secret that America's biggest music festival haslost its way in the style realm. What was once the motherland of endearingly curated boho-rocker fits has, over the years, slowly devolved into unendearing and deeply contrivedensemblesmade for #streetstyle. And just when 2025 looked like it might be another year of fringed leather chaps, lace coordinates, and bad hats, along comes a true festival rat in Timothée Chalamet. The actor could have reached into his rolodex for something fromBottega Venetaor Haider Ackermann’sshiny new Tom Ford. But he did the right thing and dressed for the occasion: an actualfestival. For his traipse around the Indio valley, the 29-year-old wore a pair of baggy shin-length shorts, a vintage Nike tee clearly worn often and well, a vintage trucker cap, a backpack (!!), and sunglasses. The shorts are hard to make out in the photo, but appear to be the same pair of cargoes the Oscar nominee sported with hisWarped-Tour-esque coffee-run fitlast week. The two most identifiable things on his person are a pair of Dr. Martens ‘Tract Combs’ boots (from a 2018 collab with Atmos) and a goldCartierbangle. Thisis what Coachella style should be. He’s sun safe, he’s low-key, he’s comfortable, he’s wearing items he knows he can ruin in a moshpit if the need (and the bass drop) calls for it—likely because these are things he’s had for years. Festival clothes should take a beating. They're for laying around spilling a $17 margarita served in a Solo cup, for staining and sweating and not giving a shit. They are not for Instagram dumps captioned “Chella 💫.” You might not find this look on Timothée Chalamet’s IG. Or, maybe you will, in a blurry candid as he thrashes in the desert to a band he really likes with his friends. As it should be. This story originally appeared onBritish GQ.",

    "title": "The Cure to Male Loneliness Is Befriending Your Wife’s Friends’ Husbands",
    "article_text": "This story was featured in The Must Read, a newsletter in which our editors recommend one can’t-miss story every weekday.Sign up here to get it in your inbox. Back in March 2020,John Mulaneytold a jokeduring his SNL monologuethat I still think about all the time. “My dad has no friends, and your dad has no friends,” he quipped. “If you think your dad has friends, you’re wrong. Yourmomhas friends, and they have husbands. Those are not your dad’s friends.” A typically sniper-precise Mulaney observation, and about as succinct a synopsis of the male loneliness crisis as you’re ever likely to hear. That bit was especially top of mind a few weeks ago, when my wife Sumer told me she was planning to host a girls’ night at our place that Friday and I’d need to make myself scarce for a few hours. At first, this felt like a sublime opportunity to revisit some of my single-guy pastimes of yore: dining solo at the bar of some fancy restaurant, optimistically toting a book along before spending the entire meal watching NBA highlights on my phone; going to see the most brain-dead action movie possible, blowing the GDP of a small island nation on candy, and taking bathroom breaks during the boring parts to watch NBA highlights on my phone; aimlessly strolling the streets of Manhattan while watching NBA highlights on my phone. Then I realized that Sumer’s friends all being preoccupied on a Friday evening meant that their husbands were probably also gearing up for solitary,Anthony-Edwards-dunk-fillednights of their own. And, unlike John Mulaney’s dad, my wife’s friends’ husbandsare, in fact, my friends. In 2019, not long before Mulaney took the stage in Studio 8H, I moved to NYC from Toronto on the cusp of 30, leaving behind a tight-knit circle of pals in the process. The existing friends I had in New York, mainly from college, were largely in different stages of life than I was then—already married, having kids, preparing to move out to Jersey, Long Island, Westchester. I barely had time to get to know my new coworkers IRL, meanwhile, before the pandemic reduced them to just another set of distant faces on a Zoom call. All of which conspired to leave me, like many men in their thirties, struggling to forge meaningful new connections. Meeting my now-wife Sumer in 2021—genuinely the best friend I’ve ever had and the person I want to do most everything with—solved that problem in myriad ways. Among the biggest was that my new partner came complete with a fully-formed social scene of her own, one that I managed to slot into relatively seamlessly. Like her, Sumer’s friends were smart and funny and cool—and their partners were, too. Suddenly I had house parties to look forward to where I could reliably expect to talk at length about baseball, pro wrestling,Michael Mann movies, Larry McMurtry novels, and the relative merits of Mount Rushmore. You know, guy stuff. Eventually, many of those large-gathering conversations gave way to genuine friendships. These guys became, as an astute tweet once put it,the homies-in-law. So when I group-texted a few of those fellas about organizing a counter-hang for that Friday night—some of whom I now consider among my closest buds, some of whom I’d yet to hang out with partnerless—it hardly felt out of the ordinary. Four of us wound up going to seeMickey 17together (a movie well-paced enough to not require anySGA-assisted bathroom breaks). It was a blast, as good of a time as our wives all had goofing onMeghan Markle’s new Netflix showback at my apartment. That’s when I realized it: The homies-in-law had simply become the homies. I understand that mycure to male loneliness—finding the love of your life, lucking out when said love’s friends are supremely chill, and then becoming friends with those friends’ also-chill spouses—isn’t exactly an easy-to-replicate, one-size-fits-all solution. Take this more as a gentle suggestion that, the next time you dutifully attend a function with your partner, you give the teensiest bit more effort to push past themonotonous small talkand get somewhere real. Then, rather than waiting for thenextbirthday party or group date to crop up, take the initiative to reach out to your new bro(s) with concrete plans. Maybe it’s a movie or watching a big game, maybe it’s just a couple laidback Tuesday beers somewhere. It might just mean the difference between becoming a dad with no friends and becoming a dad with plenty of ‘em.",

    "title": "The ‘Eddington’ Trailer Is Here. Stop Doomscrolling and Watch Joaquin Phoenix Doomscroll Instead",
    "article_text": "What happens whenAri Aster, a director known for his nightmarish films, takes onCOVID-era America? From the looks of theEddingtonteaser, we're about to find out—and I, for one, am already scared. Last week A24 released the firstEddingtonposter, which features the tag line “Hindsight is 2020” (get it?) over a tweaked image of “Untitled (Falling Buffalo),\" artist David Wojnarowicz's photograph of a museum diorama depicting bison being herded off a cliff by Native American hunters—an image Wojnarowicz created amid amid the AIDS crisis of the 1980s, another public-health emergency exacerbated by government inaction. This morning we got the first teaser, which consists mostly of a tight shot of an Instagram feed. The setting: The (fictional) town of Eddington, New Mexico. The date is June 2, 2020. We see a Fox News clip of a sheriff, played by Joaquin Phoenix, saying, \"If you value your life, you should think twice, because the people of Eddington like guns\";Austin Butler, preaching about how \"we are not a coincidence\";Emma Stone, as a woman giving a direct-to-camera video denying her husband's \"announcement\"; and Pedro Pascal—ID'd as Mayor Ted Garcia—giving an impassioned speech about fighting the pandemic. The aura of all of this is tense and dark, but if you look closely you'll find some jokes. One features a girl dancing with the overlaid text: \"When you just finish reading James Baldwin's 'Giovanni's Room.'\" An account called \"bengazhi_dad\" posts a conspiracy theory about Michael Jackson and 9/11. Finally, we see who's scrolling—it's Phoenix, likely the man at the center of all of this chaos, which apparently is drawing national attention. So is this a relatively straightforward fable about the tensions that emerged five years ago? Honestly, with Aster behind the camera, who knows? His last film wasBeau Is Afraid, a surreal modern Greek tragedy about a man with thebiggest mommy issues known to man; judging by theEddingtonteaser, this one will be the most stressful experience imaginable (aside from, you know, actually living through the recent history it depicts.) Aster, meanwhile, has a personal connection to New Mexico, having grown up in Santa Fe. He'll show us his full vision whenEddingtonpremieres at Cannes this May.",

    "title": "NYC Mayoral Candidate Zohran Mamdani Explains His ‘Uniqlo Uncle’ Style",
    "article_text": "“I’m about to say something to you you’ve never heard a politician say,” New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani told his 131K followers overInstagram, “Please stop sending us money.” Fueled mostly by small donations, Mamdani had hit the June fundraising limit set by New York City’s Campaign Finance Board (quickerthan any mayoral candidate in NYC history, according to some reports), and decided he’d rather spend the rest of his campaign talking to voters. It was a sign that, even with a recession looming, working and middle-class New Yorkers were willing to invest in the newcomer. And that Mamdani, a 33-year-old socialist New York State assemblyman with a Colgate smile, aimed to differentiate himself from the establishment Democrats happy to stockpile donations for future races. Some other ways Mamdani stands out: He is a Ugandan-born, Manhattan-raised Muslim Indian man with the middle name Kwame (after the former president of Ghana, Kwame Nkrumah); he’s the son ofMississippi Masaladirector Mira Nair; and he has quintessentially city-kid style bona fides. Consider the fact that in 2008, he was so desperate not to crease his high-top brown Nike Dunks—purchased for $90 from the defunct East Village sneaker boutique Dave’s Quality Meat—that he played soccer on concrete in his socks. “I burned through the socks, burned through skin on the soles of my feet,” he tellsGQ. “And I was really proud that there wasn't a single scuff on my shoes at the end of that story, even though I had to use a wheelchair for a while.” These days, he gets his style advice from his wife, illustrator and ceramicistRama Duwaji, who advised him to ditch skinny jeans three years ago. On his left hand, he has on two items he never takes off: a Casio watch and a ring (both gifts from Duwaji, the latter of which she handmade). His right hand has two rings, one from his grandfather’s pilgrimage to Mecca and one from his wife’s trip to Tunisia. After a long day of campaigning in NYC and legislating in Albany, Mamdani walked GQ through his vision for disaffected men, who he lets cut his hair, and how he would address ICE raids as mayor. Zohran Mamdani:I would say my personal style is a reflection of who I am and myself as a New Yorker. It incorporates having grown up in this city. It also brings a lot of clothes from the places that I'm from, whether that's Uganda or India. And then, as a politician, there is also a specific formality to how I dress for a lot of days of the week. There's the suits that I bought in a store, and there's the suit that I bought on 31st Avenue, and a totally bootleg street sale, and they all work. There are many ways to convey formality, and it’s been exciting to explore every one of those avenues. And sometimes, as I'm dressed today, it's a suit and a button-down and a tie. And when I'm going to Eid prayers and I'm conveying a formality at that moment, it's through a completely different set of clothes and a shawl and a kurta. My parents have long given me that sense of confidence that to be one thing does not mean you cannot be another. I am the same person who's wearing a Kitenge suit that was tailored in Kansaga, Kampala, Uganda, and East Africa, and I am the same guy who's wearing a Bandhgala that was tailored in Delhi. And I am the same guy who's wearing the suit from 30th Avenue that I bought from Morgan. I gotta shout outBernie. His style is very much his politics, and I love that consistency about him. He's definitely a style icon. Much of my closet has also, over the years, been different forms ofBernie merch. I love allthevideosof him being like, \"How much are those sneakers?\" Oh, my God. [Ed. note: In these videos, Sanders is talking to sneakerheads who bought the new Nike SB x Air Jordan 4 ‘Navy’ shoes.] It's like, I'm [both] him and the guy he's critiquing at the same time. And I'm like, \"This is me and my life.\" Also, Jawaharlal Nehru—I’ve got to give it up for an Indian style icon. I would say Uniqlo. It's just so dependable. I've become like an uncle where my dream is to open up the closet and it's like 10 of the same shirt, 10 of the same pants. I'm like, \"Oh, I'm ready.\" There's this military store on 31st Street and Broadway in Astoria, where I've gotten a lot of my thermals because I spent a lot of the day outside. My mom definitely influenced my sense of style. I remember going to a middle school dance. I was about to head out the door, and she looked at me and said, \"That's what you're wearing?\" I was wearing plaid pants and a button-down shirt. It was just so devoid of any personality. She brings in a lot of these different influences from the parts of the world that she's from, and that’s also given me a lot of confidence. My dad is someone who spent much of his life in the post-colonial struggle in Uganda and East Africa and thinking about Pan-Africanism. The mix and match of Nehru collars and shirts that he bought in Dakar, Senegal, when he was there for an academic conference, has influenced my sense of what is of self and of clothing as a part of that. I get my hair cut by my man Nicholas in Astoria. I go to the barbershop, I'm not going to name it because I want to be able to make sure that I'm not contributing to losing my spot. But now, because of the nature of the campaign, I am getting haircuts and beard trims wherever I can get them sometimes. No. I get my hair cut by the same people that I'm fighting for, which is every single New Yorker! What I have long appreciated and admired about them is that they have supported me through the many different iterations of my life and through the many different pursuits that I've had, whether that has been when I wanted to be a journalist, when I wanted to study Arabic, when I wanted to be a rapper, when I wanted to be a screenwriter, when I wanted to be a campaign worker, and then even when I wanted to run for office. My mom has always said, \"If we don't tell our own stories, no one else will.\" And I've often thought of that as one of the commonalities between the very different paths I've taken is whether you're rapping or you're speaking to somebody on a subway platform about your vision for New York City, you are telling them a story of life, and your life and the lives of others. No bars! I'm trying to win the race. Through a politics that is direct to the anxieties and experiences of young men's lives. We must practice politics for everyone. Young men in New York City want an affordable life. This crisis of inequality is impacting young people, especially black and brown young people, in a way that is disproportionate. If you're looking at just the levels of out-migration from young people of color, and specifically if you're thinking of Black New Yorkers, we lost nearly 20% of black children and teenagers from 2010 to 2019. One in five black children and teenagers leaving our city is an erasure of an entire generation of young people and young men. The way we address this is through systemic solutions of affordability—freezing the rent, making buses fast and free, and delivering universal childcare. When you're trying to address this, you have to come to this conversation, understanding it as such, and not seeing it as an opportunity to lecture, but also an opportunity for you to listen. I'm going to be honest, I'm not that familiar. Somewhat. I mean, I thought I was, and then I was told about names. And then, I didn't know them. Well, the Dirtbag Left are my high school friends. I just meant dirtbags who believe in a better world but are not all that engaged all the time in the ways that we typically understand politics. New York City is one of the busiest cities in the world. People have so many things on their plates. It is your job as a politician to make it as easy as possible for people to see themselves in your fight and to take the action that's needed to make your fight and their fight the same fight to deliver a New York City that they can afford. There's long been too much of an instinct to judge and to shame for a lack of participation or a different disposition towards politics as opposed to a reflection of what drove people to make those decisions and what their lives are like when they make those kinds of decisions. I've been proud to be the first, and to my knowledge, the only mayoral candidate to have said that I would not have sent the police onto Columbia and CUNY's campus. In doing so, this mayor, especially when it came to Columbia's campus, had a police officer discharge their weapon, which was the least safe students had been over the last 16 months. We need to forever be focused on the delivery of safety to every New Yorker as opposed to the weaponization of it as a talking point to deprive other New Yorkers of it. It all stems from a politics of humanity, a politics that believes in universal human rights that refuses to draw a line in the sand when it comes to the applications of freedom and justice and safety, and instead applies it to all people. It plays a massive role in our politics. You have the Republicans who are defining masculinity almost exclusively through the prism of cruelty—that to be a man is to not only be strong but to use that strength to impose yourself upon others, to take from others, to establish dominance. To me, to be a man is something very different. I'm excited over the course of this campaign to offer an affirmative vision for what it looks like to be a man and have that masculinity be tied to empathy as well as strength. But that strength can be found in your willingness to take on those who are putting their boots on the necks of people across this country. It comes from my parents, the necessity of joy in one's life and mischief, the fun that comes from teasing and poking fun at oneself and never taking yourself too seriously. I often remember my grandmother, who told me that smiling was one way of following the words and the works of the Prophet—to smile is also to embody. I have a really hard time holding a grudge because it's exhausting. You're mad, and then okay, time passes, and then you have to remind yourself to be mad again. And it's just like, \"Oh, I really have to hold that?\"",

    "title": "The ‘Last of Us’ Season Two Premiere Departed From the Games’ Story In One Major Way",
    "article_text": "Tonight's season two premiere ofThe Last of Usmade its intentions clear right up front. After a reminder of the lie Joel (Pedro Pascal) tells Ellie (Bella Ramsey) at the end of the first season, theCraig Mazin-written and directed episode settles on a new face: Abby. Portrayed by Kaitlyn Dever, the character is one of the few remaining members of a revolutionary militia group called the Fireflies. You may also remember that Joel kind of, uh, wiped out an entire base’s worth of the group in the season one finale, saving Ellie’s life but preventing the Fireflies from using her to cure the mutant-Cordyceps pandemic, and setting up the events that unfold in this week’s premiere. Carnage begets carnage, and Abby makes her intentions clear about what she plans to do when she eventually finds Joel: “When we kill him, we kill him slowly.” Mazin's positioning of Dever's Abby at the top of the premiere is intentional, quickly establishing what appears to be the season’s most immediately pressing thread: an impending encounter between Abby and Joel over what he did to the Fireflies. It’s a bit of a departure fromThe Last of Us Part II, the 2020PlayStation4 game this season is drawing from; in that game, Abby’s introduction into the story comes without this context. This makes her much more of a cipher, a character whose motivations remain mysterious until later in the game, when audiences get a chance to play as Abby. In a press conference last month, Neil Druckmann, co-creator ofThe Last of Usgames as well as the series, said that the shift was intentional. “In the game... you play as Abby, so you immediately form an empathic connection with her because you're surviving as her,” he says. “We can withhold certain things and make it a mystery that will be revealed later in the story. We couldn't do that in the show because you're not playing as her, so we need other tools. And that context gave us that shortcut.” The shortcut makes her reappearance at the end of the episode feel like a five-alarm fire and provesThe Last of Usisn’t content to rest on its laurels. Judging by the wordlessly determined look that Dever gives the camera at the end of the episode, she intends to keep her promise. Combine that with a blossoming Cordyceps threat, and audiences are poised fora lotof action right out of the gate. IfThe Last of Usfollows through on Abby’s promise as it seems poised to do, we’re looking at a storytelling decision that could rivalthe Red Weddingor Ned Stark’s death onGame of Thronesin terms of Sunday-night shock factor—while establishing a deeply personal narrative for the rest of the season. In other words, strap in.",

    "title": "Democrats Should Seize Trump’s Tariff Flop",
    "article_text": "It’s been less than two weeks sinceDonald Trump’s “Liberation Day,” and the president has already literallymelted trillionsof dollars in American wealth. The majority of the countrybelievesTrump’s tariffs hurt the US economy, while his approval rating with hisownvoters iscratering. Even members of the president’s billionaire cabal are having second thoughts:Elon MuskrecentlycalledTrump trade adviserPeter Navarro“dumber than a sack of bricks,” and top Republican donorKen Griffinadmittedthe tariffs were a “huge policy mistake.” This is to say that public sentiment is clearly shifting—and quite a bit.That’s why Democrats, from political donors to red-state voters to government employees, need to seize themoment before it’s too late. “As severe as the decisions individuals and institutions are now facing are, they will only get more difficult going forward,” authoritarianism expertThomas Zimmertells me. “The best time to push back against an authoritarian assault on the democratic order is always as soon as possible, as forceful as possible.” Now, personally, I found the autocracyalonedisqualifying. But obviously, a lot of Americans didn’t seem to agree with me until the market tanked last week. Trump has already pumped the brakes on that downward slide with his 90-day tariff pause, which he’s sought to frame as part of a brilliantmaster plan. But make no mistake: The damage is done. The US economy has gone from being the envy of the world to one where the dollar mayno longer remainthe international reserve currency. That bitter reality has captured people’s attention all across the class spectrum, meaning that voters are primed for pushback. So Democrats should leap at the opportunity to hammer Trump over his chaotic agenda. Luckily for the opposition party, that agenda is only getting more chaotic by the day. Just last Friday, Trump suddenly announced carve-outs for technological products like the stuff his friend “Tim Apple” makes. But by Sunday afternoon, he wasTruthingthat there was “no tariff exception.” That was followed by Commerce SecretaryHoward Lutnicksayingthat the tariffs are coming back in a month or so. “Semiconductors and pharmaceuticals,” he said, “will have a tariff model in order to encourage them to reshore.” So, which is it? Are there carve-outs or not? Of course, it ultimately doesn’t matter much what Trumpworld says on Sunday, because it will absolutely be something completely different on Monday. What all this back-and-forth amounts to is a kind of Schrödinger’s tariffs; they’re both onandoff simultaneously. Which is probably not great if you’re, say, a manufacturing firm looking to make business decisions that project years into the future. Meanwhile, as the economic instability roils the markets, the autocracy bit I mentioned earlier is still in full force. Consider, for instance, how the Trump administration is still giving the middle finger to the judicial branch, as evidenced by their having “no updates” regarding the Supreme Court’s order to facilitate the return ofKilmar Abrego Garcia,an immigrant who it wrongfullysentto a draconian El Salvadoran prison due to an administrative “error.” Team Trump simply reiterated over the weekend that a judge, in 2019, baselessly clocked him as a gang member. In sum: Another norm crushed, another red line crossed. But, also, another opening for the opposition party to forcefully push back with the message that Trump is running roughshod over the law. In his first term, Trump was unable to permanently crush norms and institutions because some Republicans still had spines. People fromLiz CheneytoMike PencetoAlyssa Farah GriffinandAdam Kinzingeractually stood up to the president’s authoritarian tendencies, and tried to build a resistance movement within their party. Democrats and liberals also made a major impact.Cringeas they might have been, the pink hats, the marches, and the slogans helped create a permission structure for pushing back. Even corporate America, generally loath to wade into the public square,occasionallydrew a linein the sand. This time around, people don’t have the same appetite for insurgency. Billionaires, law firms, and university presidents (with some notable exceptions, like Wesleyan’sMichael Rothand Amherst’sMichael A. Elliott) appear largely to becavingto Trump. They’ve apparently made thecalculusthat protecting democracy just isn’t worth the trouble. Or perhaps they just think that caving to Trump is good for business. Whatever the reason, they’ve decided that they are more scared of Trump than they are of their consumers and the public writ large. But this calculus, I’d argue, is bearing out to be a bad one. Trump’s approval numbers are almost where they were in his first term. He’s gutted the government, spurned the courts, disappeared college students, and caused a near-global economic crisis. The president isn’t even 100 days into his second term, but one could argue that it’s already way more out of control than the entirety of his first. Donald Trump has no master plan. Perhaps, in this sense, the president’s plan—aside from accumulating as much power as possible—is simply to convince people that thereisone. But in recent weeks, it seems that more and more Americans who signed on to Trump 2.0 are seeing through the charade. Those who still believe in democracy need to keep peacefully telegraphing thatnone of this is okay.Our system of government is far too precious to lose to a reality-television host who somehow got cast as president. Correction: A previous version of this story claimed that Ken Griffin is a “Trump donor.” While Griffin is a prominent Republican donor, he did not contribute to Trump's most recent presidential campaign. This story has been updated to reflect that distinction.

    "title": "Democrats Are Getting Real About the New Anti-Trump Resistance: “The Final Check Is the People”",
    "article_text": "Tim Walztook the stage, with “I Won’t Back Down,” Tom Petty’s anthem of defiance, blaring over the speakers. “Hello again, Ohioans,” the Minnesota governor and former vice presidential candidate said, as the crowd greeted him with a standing ovation. It was a chilly April evening in Lorain, a manufacturing town outside Cleveland whose politics have shifted with the fading fortunes of the industries it once thrived on. The high school auditorium, set to host a drama club production ofTheWizin the coming weeks, was packed, and an overflow crowd gathered in the gym. In all, about 2,000 people turned out for what was billed as a “People’s Town Hall”—a series of events Democrats have been holding across the country in districts where GOP representatives, perhaps acting on theadviceof SpeakerMike Johnson,have avoided facing their constituents in person. “This is the major responsibility of a member of Congress, to be responsive to their constituents,” Walz, who served in the House from 2007 to 2019, told me and a few local reporters beforehand, in the ROTC classroom that was serving as our makeshift media center. “And I said, if they don’t want to do it, I’ll come out.” These kinds of town halls have been a way for Democrats to highlight Republicans’ reluctance to defendDonald Trump’s destructive agenda, after a number of GOP lawmakersstruggled to do soat fiery district events in February. But they have also been forums for voters to vent—especially at Democrats, who had played theirownrole in the hollowing out of Rust Belt cities like theirs, who had lost two out of the last three elections to a billionaire cosplaying as a populist, and who had struggled in the opening weeks of Trump’s second term to fulfill their role as a true opposition party. “Many of us here…feel left behind and blame not only the Republican Party but also Democrats,” as one resident told Walz, describing the “erosion” of industries that served as the backbone of places like Lorain and had left it a “shell of what it once was.” What I found here—and what others havesensedelsewhere—is that a movement seems to be building. The anti-Trump public, more demoralized by the opening weeks of his presidency than determined to fight, has begun showing some life. Nowhere was this clearer thanin Kenosha, Wisconsin, where IwatchedBernie Sanderselectrify a crowd of about 3,500 in March on an early stop of his Fighting Oligarchy Tour. “People are really, really concerned about what’s going on in Washington right now,” the senator told me then. Weeks later, the face of that oligarchy,Elon Musk,would be dealt a significant blow there, after votersconclusively electedliberalSusan Crawfordto the state supreme court—despite the millions of dollars the billionaire Trump allypoured into the April 1 raceon behalf of the conservative candidate. The anger seemed to be turning into action, withlarge-scale protestserupting in back-to-back weeks against Musk and Trump in cities across the country. Finally, it appeared “the Resistance” of the first Trump era—out of sight in the opening weeks of the second—wascoming out of the shadows. Yet it looksverydifferent this time: The indignation is generalized, trained not just on Trump, but on the creaky political system he exploited and a Democratic establishment that no longer seems capable of meeting the moment. Democrats have “signaled a resignation to the entire thing and…seem to be insufficiently clear on the risk and the threat,” asLeah Greenberg,cofounder of Indivisible, the influential progressive grassroots organization that formed in the wake of Trump’s first election, told me recently. “I think there’s just a lot of episodes over the last few months that have really soured people on whether the Democratic Party has a clear plan and a clear assessment of the danger it’s facing right now.” The Resistance of 2016 was also buoyed by a sense of hope—that Democrats, “reasonable” Republicans, or maybeRobert Muellerwould come to the rescue. By contrast, the protest movement against Trump’s second term is navigating a sense that we all might be helpless in the face of what's coming. “This DOGE business will get out of control,” as one sign put it at a Tesla Takedown protest I recently attended in Chicago. “It’ll get out of control and we’ll be lucky to live through it.” I had come to Lorain to see whether someone like Walz might be able to not only channel the movement’s righteous fury, but also convince a shaken public that resistance is not futile, as this rogue president would have it believe. “You’re deeply concerned about your country and you want to do something about it,” he said at the top of the town hall. “It might be a pain in the butt to park and get here and wait in line and come in here and sit in a chair or whatever,” he continued. But “it beats the hell out of doom-scrolling in a fetal position.” If anybody could rally Democrats out of that dejected posture, perhaps it was “Coach Walz”—who seemed to exude the same jocularity and charisma he had at the beginning ofKamala Harris’s campaign. Part of that was, of course, owing to the venue: “Thank you for doing this in a high school,” the former teacher said. “The only other place I’m more comfortable is my living room.” But more than that, he was no longer in the middle of a run for office, and could speak more freely than he could during last fall’s high-stakes campaign. As he spoke of the need for a more “positive, populist” agenda—like the one he has worked to implement in Minnesota—he acknowledged that RepublicanandDemocratic leadership had contributed to the precarity in places like Lorain: “It wasBill Clintonwho signed NAFTA,” noted Walz, who wore a United Auto Workers pin on the lapel of his navy suit. And while Democratic policiesdobetter serve the middle and working classes, he said, his party doesn’t move fast enough or decisively enough: “I believe that when you get power, you should wield it,” Walz said. “You win elections not tobankpolitical capital to win the next election—you win elections toburnpolitical capital to improve lives as quickly as you can.” But Democrats’ path to power has only gotten narrower in recent elections, as the national party relies on its urban centers of support and focuses its resources on a handful of swing states. Their 2024 defeat demonstrated, in stark terms, how flawed and unsustainable that strategy is: Harris lost every battleground, while Trump made gains in blue strongholds like New York, and among voting blocs that have traditionally favored Democrats. “We can’t expect to win presidential elections [when] we don’t show up places and then every four years we go to the same seven states that we were told [were] the ‘blue wall,’” Walz told the Ohio crowd. “It wasn’t a very good wall.” It was refreshing to hear such a blunt assessment of the Democrats’ strategic failures—and a reminder that things weren’t always this way.Barack Obamawon this state twice. In 2012, he defeatedMitt Romneyin Lorain County—once a Democratic stronghold—by more than 15 points. Four years later,Hillary Clintonwon it bya 10th of a percentage point. However, Trump has carried it the last two cycles: He beatJoe Biden—who campaigned as a strident “union man”—bymore than two pointshere in 2020, and expanded his support in 2024 tonearly six points. That’s been the story of politics in Lorain, but it’s also the story of Ohio—and America more broadly—over the last decade: Blue to purple to red. Places where Democrats could win or at least compete not so long ago—Florida, Indiana, North Carolina, Iowa—have been treated by the national party as lost causes, to the chagrin of local parties. “There’s real opportunity here,”Katie Seewer,press secretary of the Ohio Democratic Party, told me. “Ohio is very much worth investing in.” New Democratic National Committee chairKen Martin—a Walz ally and fellow Minnesotan—has promised to turn things around and reviveHoward Dean’s 50-state strategy. “If we’re going to turn red states to purple states to blue states,” Martintold mein December, “you can’t ignore them.” It won’t be easy for them to recapture the territory they’ve ceded to Republicans. It will require the party, which still suffers from abysmal approval ratings, to build political infrastructure in places where you might find a yard sign like the one I saw on a back road a couple hours west of Lorain, that read: “Are you an American or a Democrat?” It also demands that they meaningfully address the disillusionment that has set in over places like Lorain, which a friend of mine in Cleveland described as a “Springsteen song” of a town. Showing up, as Walz did, may at least be a start. At the bar of the hotel I stayed at—a 1925 restoration whose reopening in 2020, after more than a decade of disrepair, was cast as part of a downtown Lorain“rebirth”that has yet to fully materialize—a local Democrat told me the town hall had been a small taste of hope amid the relentless churn of Trumpian chaos. But there was still the question of what can be done more immediately, as Trump tramples over the separation of powers, lays waste to institutions, and threatens Americans’ rights and well-being. It was important to position the party for electoral resurgence. But “what is our recourse?” one questioner asked Walz, “what can we do now?” “The final check,” Walz answered, is “the people.” In other words: the Resistance, which is sometimes better remembered more for its corniness—thesafety pins,pink hats,keyboard activism,andpolitical prayer candles—than for its meaningful accomplishments. But that massive burst of activism spawned a new generation of political leaders, some of whom—likeAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez—have been among the handful of Democratic officials who are actually rising to this historic moment. And while that mobilization didn’t completely stop Trump from wreaking havoc in his first term, it surely helped mitigate the damage—forcing elected Democrats to fight, putting pressure on public and private institutions to take stands, and giving Republicans more to fear than a primary challenge from the MAGA right. Indeed, the power of that backstop has been apparent in its absence: Mobilization and fierce outcryhelped save the Affordable Care Actfrom Trump and his Republican majorities; this time, in a matter of weeks, he and his unelected billionaire ally have bypassed Congress to dismantle entire government agencies. Trump is aided by a far more loyal Republican Party now, of course—but also by the public mandate he was able to claim in the absence of tough, sustained pushback. That he’s facing some now has been heartening: It’s already taken some of the shine off Musk’s political brand, and perhaps factored into Trump backing down—for now—from some of his economy-rattling tariffs. Perhaps a second Resistance can go even bigger: Seeking not only to restore normalcy and common sense, but also tackle issues places that have long been overlooked by the political establishments. For now, though, there’s still “a lot of anxiety” about the future, one grandmother told me as we walked out of the Walz town hall into the cold April dusk. Would it all just come down to the public? “I guess it’s just us,” she said. “It’s scary.” Karen Read’s Second Murder Trial Is Already a Spectacle WhenThe SopranosTook Off, So DidJames Gandolfini Usha Vance’s “Very Lonely, Lonely World” Dying for Sex: The True Story of a Cancer Patient TurnedSexual Explorer Tom Hanks Is Supportive of HisDaughter’s Revealing MemoirAbout Her Troubled Childhood AsTwin PeaksTurns 35, theMystery Is Still the Message DidBiden’s AidesCover Up His Mental State—or Was It Group Delusion?

    "title": "Trump Brags That He's Got the “Best Relationship” With the “Coolest Dictator in the World”",
    "article_text": "During a friendly Oval Office meet-and-greet withDonald Trump, El Salvador leaderNayib Bukele, the self-described “coolest dictator in the world,” said he would not return the Maryland father the US regime mistakenly deported to his hellish prison. “Of course I’m not going to do it,” Bukele said, claiming without basis thatKilmar Abrego Garcia—who has no criminal record in the United States—is a “terrorist.” “The question is preposterous,” the strongman told reporters, as a smiling Trump nodded approvingly. “I don’t have the power to return him to the United States.” Abrego Garcia, who was picking up his five-year-old from the child’s grandmother’s house when he was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, was expelled through an “oversight,” the Trump administrationacknowledgedin court last month. Nevertheless, it has insisted it does not need to return him to the US: Trumpdefieda lower court order to bring Abrego Garcia back, and his Justice Department claimed that aSupreme Court decisionrequiring the administration to “effectuate” his release did not actually mean they were obligated to do so. “The federal courts have no authority to direct the Executive Branch to conduct foreign relations in a particular way,” DOJ lawyerssaidSunday. Trump and his administration officials maintained that posture Monday, as they hosted Bukele—El Salvador’s authoritarian leader who has become a darling of the MAGA right. “No version of this legally ends with [Abrego Garcia] ever living here,”Stephen MillersaidMonday, denying that the man was accidentally deported and insisting that he is a gang member. “The foreign policy of the United States is conducted by the president of the United States, not by a court,” Secretary of StateMarco Rubiosaid. The administration’s defiance in the face of court orders—including from the Supreme Court—further escalates Trump’s assault on the separation of powers, and underscores the authoritarian nature of his deportation program: Though he apparently committed no crime, and was arrested via “administrative error,” Abrego Garcia was sent to Bukele’s inhumane gulag—and both Bukele and the Trump administration are claiming that they can’t do anything about it. It’s an abuse of power, and Trump doesn’t just want to wield it against foreign nationals; during his meeting with Bukele, the presidentagaintold reporters that he would like to deport US citizens to El Salvador, as well. “We have millions of people that should not be in this country,” Trump said, asking Bukele to “build more” draconian jail complexes. “I’d like to go a step further,” the presidentadded. “We also have homegrown criminals…I’d like to include them in the group of people to get them out of the country.” It’s not just an idle suggestion; asRolling Stonereportedlast week, the administration has been seriously discussing how it could denaturalize and deport US citizens: “I hope Trump and his team are trailblazers on this,”Mike Davis, a close ally of the president, told the outlet. Such a plan would surely be brazenly illegal—and would, like Abrego Garcia’s expulsion, likely be rejected by federal courts. But it doesn’t seem like that would matter to this president, who sees in the authoritarian Bukele a kindred figure. “To liberate 350 million people,” Bukele said, “you have to imprison some.” “I have a great relationship with this man,” Trump said at one point, returning his praise. “I have the best relationship with him.” Karen Read’s Second Murder Trial Is Already a Spectacle WhenThe SopranosTook Off, So DidJames Gandolfini Usha Vance’s “Very Lonely, Lonely World” Dying for Sex: The True Story of a Cancer Patient TurnedSexual Explorer Tom Hanks Is Supportive of HisDaughter’s Revealing MemoirAbout Her Troubled Childhood AsTwin PeaksTurns 35, theMystery Is Still the Message DidBiden’s AidesCover Up His Mental State—or Was It Group Delusion?

Phillips and Sperling, a pediatric nurse and writer,debuted their relationshipat Wimbledon last summer. According toHello!,they were joined in Bahrain by Phillips’ daughters,IslaandSavannah,and Harriet’s daughter. Phillips, Zara, Eugenie, and Beatrice are all grandchildren of the late Queen Elizabeth II and her husband, Prince Philip.Back in 2022, Eugenie and Beatrice made another appearance at the Bahrain Grand Prix with Brooksbank and Mapelli Mozzi. Their cousinPrince Harryis also a fan of motorsport, and was last spotted at the F1 America Grand Prix in Austin, Texasin October 2023. The weekend marked one of Beatrice’s first public engagements since she welcomed her second child, a daughter namedAthena,in January. In a BritishVogueessay last month, the princess said that her daughter was born prematurely, and the experience prompted her to fundraise for medical advancement. “Maybe it’s something to do with my mother’s breast and skin cancer diagnosis last year—but for me, nothing feels more vital than facilitating the necessary research into the health challenges that women face daily,” Beatrice wrote. “My hope is that with more investment into medical research, and the dedication of healthcare professionals like Professor Johnson, my two daughters will not have to face these challenges when they grow up.” Karen Read’s Second Murder Trial Is Already a Spectacle WhenThe SopranosTook Off, So DidJames Gandolfini Usha Vance’s “Very Lonely, Lonely World” Dying for Sex: The True Story of a Cancer Patient TurnedSexual Explorer Tom Hanks Is Supportive of HisDaughter’s Revealing MemoirAbout Her Troubled Childhood AsTwin PeaksTurns 35, theMystery Is Still the Message DidBiden’s AidesCover Up His Mental State—or Was It Group Delusion?

    "article_text": "On Saturday night, Vermont senatorBernie Sanderstook his navy sport coat to a place where navy sport coats are rarely seen: The main stage at Coachella. The octogenarian independent made asurprise appearanceat the music festival this weekend, where he introduced the singer-songwriterClairoand implored the young audience of thousands not to disengage from the current political moment. “The future of what happens in America is dependent upon your generation,” Sanders said. “Now, you can turn away, and you can ignore what goes on, but if you do that, you’re doing it at your own peril.” The crowd booed at the mention of “the President of the United States,” to which Sanders quipped, “I agree.” WhileDonald Trump, who has falselyclaimedto have won the 2024 youth vote, could rightly write off this interaction as the grumbling of some hippy dippy liberals in the California desert, the Coachella appearance was but a pitstop for Sanders. Lately, he has been criss-crossing the country along with New York congresswomanAlexandria Ocasio-Cortezfor their so-called “fighting oligarchy”tour, drawing massive crowds—including in red states—along the way. And if there's one thing that gets Trump's attention, it'scrowd sizes. On Sunday, Sanders and Ocasio-Cortezfilleda 15,000-seat arena in Salt Lake City, Utah, with thousands more people watching on overflow screens outside the stadium. The Utah rally took place a day after Sanders and Ocasio-Cortezdrewa crowd of 36,000 in Los Angeles, whereNeil Young,Joan Baez, andMaggie Rogersheadlined, but Sanders said he believed the Utah turnout was \"in many ways...more impressive,” according to KSL.com. \"We are here in so-called conservative Utah, and tomorrow we are going to be in Idaho because we believe that in every state of this country, people are prepared to stand up and fight back,\" Sanders said.

    "article_text": "After winning two Oscars and making films with some of Hollywood’s foremost auteurs,Cate Blanchetthas already considered retirement from acting. “My family roll their eyes every time I say it, but I mean it: I am serious about giving up acting,” she recently told theRadio Times.“[There are] a lot of things I want to do with my life.” The 55-year-old actor, who picked up Academy Awards for 2013’sBlue Jasmineand 2004’sThe Aviator,said she has never outgrown the “feeling of being uncomfortable” with fame. “When you go on a talk show, or even here now, and then you see sound bites of things you’ve said, pulled out and italicized, they sound really loud,” Blanchett continued. “I’m not that person. I make more sense in motion—it’s been a long time to remotely get comfortable with the idea of being photographed.” Over the course of her three-plus-decade career, Blanchett has earned eight Oscar nominations, having worked with filmmakers includingMartin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, David Fincher, Ron Howard,andPeter Jackson.“As you get older, acting just gets more and more humiliating,” Blanchett toldJulia Robertsduring a conversation forInterviewmagazine in 2019. “When I was younger, I would wonder why the older actors I admired kept talking about quitting. Now I realize it’s because they want to maintain a connection to the last shreds of their sanity.” WhenVanity Fair’sDavid Canfieldasked about her apparent desire to quit acting during the 2023 awards campaign forTodd Field’sTár,Blanchett said: “It’s not occasional—it’s continual. On a daily or weekly basis, for sure. It’s a love affair, isn’t it? So you do fall in and out of love with it, and you have to be seduced back into it.” After production onTárwrapped, Field suggested that Blanchett take a hiatus from acting. “I just said no to a couple of things. I think it’s time to be quiet,” she toldVFat the time. But the Australian actor hasn’t slowed down much since then. Her recent credits includeAlfonso Cuarón’s Apple TV+ series,Disclaimer,Eli Roth’sBorderlands,andSteven Soderbergh’sBlack Bag.Blanchett is next set to star inJim Jarmusch’sFather, Mother, Sister, Brother.

    "title": "HBO’s Harry Potter TV Series: Everything We Know",
    "article_text": "The sorting hat ceremony for six key roles in HBO’s upcomingHarry Potterserieshas been completed. On Monday, April 14, it wasannouncedthat, aspreviously reported,John Lithgowwill play Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore in a TV reimagining ofJ.K. Rowling’sblockbuster novels. Joining him are Oscar-nominatedJanet McTeeras Minerva McGonagall, Emmy nomineePaapa Essieduas Severus Snape, andNick Frostas Rubeus Hagrid. Joining those series regulars in recurring roles areLuke ThallonandPaul Whitehouseas fellow wizarding school stalwarts Quirinus Quirrell and Argus Filch, respectively. “We’re delighted to have such extraordinary talent on board, and we can’t wait to see them bring these beloved characters to new life,” series showrunner and executive producerFrancesca Gardiner,and fellow EPMark Mylod,who also directs multiple episodes, said in a joint statement. HBO is describing the show as a “faithful adaptation” of the best-selling book series, which spawned eight hit films between 2001 and 2011, as well as a spin-off franchise,Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,and an ongoing Broadway play,Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.“Exploring every corner of the wizarding world, each season will bringHarry Potterand its incredible adventures to new and existing audiences,” the official series description continues. Despite hercontroversialremarks about trans people,Rowling will serve as an executive producer on the new project and is expected tocollaborate with Gardinerto adapt her books for TV. Ahead, everything we know about the upcomingHarry Potterseries—from who is playing the titular character to what Warner Bros. has said about Rowling’s involvement. John Lithgow, who starred in recent best-picture nomineeConclaveand won an Emmy for playing Winston Churchill onThe Crown, has been cast as Albus Dumbledore, headmaster of Hogwarts. The role was previously played by Irish actor Richard Harris, who died in 2002 after appearing in the first twoHarry Potterfilms and was replaced by Michael Gambon, who laterdied in 2023.Lithgowconfirmed his castingback in February: “It came as a total surprise to me,” the 79-year-old actor said at the time. “I just got the phone call up at the Sundance Film Festival for yet another film, and it was not an easy decision because it’s going to define me for the last chapter of my life, I’m afraid.” Janet McTeer, a two-time Oscar-nominated actor, will play no-nonsense transfiguration professor Minerva McGonagall, who was previously portrayed bythe late Maggie Smith.Paapa Essiedu, who earned an Emmy nomination for HBO’sI May Destroy Youhas been cast as enigmatic potions professor Severus Snape, a role originated by Alan Rickman, who died in 2016. AndShaun of the Deadstar Nick Frost rounds out the series-regular cast as beloved groundskeeper Rubeus Hagrid, played by Robbie Coltrane in the original movies beforehis 2022 death. Tapped for recurring roles in the series are West End theater actorLuke Thallonas defense against the dark arts professor Quirinus Quirrell (played byIan Hartin the films) and Welsh comedianPaul Whitehouseas Hogwarts caretaker Argus Filch (previously played byDavid Bradley). Last fall, HBO launched an open casting call for the main trio of young wizards—Harry, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger—that receivedover 30,000 submissions.But the powers that be have yet to make an announcement regarding those roles or that of the villainous Lord Voldemort. “We are still weighing a couple of different options there, so we’re not quite ready there yet,” Warner Bros. Television Group headChanning Dungeyrecently toldDeadline.“That’s an important role to get right.” The outletreportsthat other names circling major roles in the project areBad Sisters’Sharon Horgan,Ted Lasso’sBrett Goldstein,andThe Penguin’sMark Strong. So far,Daniel Radcliffeis the only main actor who has declared hewon’t returnas The Boy Who Lived in this iteration. “It seems to me that they are wanting to make a fresh series,” the actor toldEntertainment Tonightback in 2023, “which it feels like it’d be distracting to have old, haggard Harry also entering from stage left.” While Radcliffe is “certainly not seeking” a role in the show, he’s “very supportive” of those who will be passed the wizarding wand. “I wish particularly, obviously, the kids nothing but the best,” he said, adding, “I hope I get to meet them one day, I guess, and be, like, ‘Are you okay? How’s it going?’” Radcliffe’s reticence to board the new series may be partly owed to his now severed relationship withHarry Potterauthor J.K. Rowling. The actor has beenpublicly criticalof Rowling since hercontroversial remarks about trans peoplein 2020. “I’ve met so many queer and trans kids and young people who had a huge amount of identification with Potter,” he said in aninterview with IndieWire.“Seeing them hurt on that day, I was, like, I wanted them to know that not everybody in the franchise felt that way.” Rupert Grint,andEmma Watson,who played Ron and Hermione in the original films, have alsospoken out against Rowling,leading the author to make veiled jabs years later. Last month, sheseemingly addressed the tensionsbetween herself and that trio on social media in a response to a post that asked: “What actor/actress instantly ruins a movie for you?”Rowling wrote: “Three guesses. Sorry, but that was irresistible,” adding three laughing emojis. When plans for the new series wereunveiledin April 2023, Rowling said in a statement: “Max’s commitment to preserving the integrity of my books is important to me, and I’m looking forward to being part of this new adaptation which will allow for a degree of depth and detail only afforded by a long-form television series.” HBO CEOCasey Bloyswaved off Rowling’s off-screen reputation during the official announcement of the series. “That’s a very online conversation, very nuanced and complicated, and not something we’re going to get into,” he said. “Our priority is what’s onscreen. Obviously, the Harry Potter story is incredibly affirmative and positive and about love and self-acceptance.” Last November, Bloysconfirmedthat Rowling remained “fairly involved.” “I imagine she’ll have opinions on casting,” he added. “It hasn’t affected the casting or hiring of writers or production staff or anything, so we haven’t felt any impact from that.” An official release date has yet to be conjured, but the series isexpectedto begin filming this summer. Whileinitial reportssaid that each of the seven main books would be adapted into a season of the show, Bloyshas saidthat he envisions the project running “for 10 consecutive years.” That extended timeline is “why it’s been such a hard decision,” says Lithgow, who would be well in his octogenarian years at the show’s conclusion. “I’ll be about 87 years old at the wrap party. But I’ve said yes.” This post will be updated.

    "title": "Mark Zuckerberg’s Words Are About to Come Back to Bite Him",
    "article_text": "In a 2008 email,Mark Zuckerbergwrote that “it is better to buy than to compete.” Now, the Federal Trade Commission is trying to prove that Zuckerberg applied that same thinking when he acquired Instagram and WhatsApp, thereby snuffing out two emerging competitors to secure Facebook’s social networking supremacy. This argument is at the heart of the FTC's long-awaited legal showdown with Meta, which kicked off Monday. Thelawsuitwas filed during Trump’s first term before being refiled in 2021 under the Biden FTC. It hinges on whether the company violated antitrust law by scooping up companies that threatened its social networking monopoly in what the government calls a “buy or bury” scheme. The case, which is being tried in a Washington DC district court, is expected to last months and will feature testimony from Zuckerberg himself and other top officials, including former chief operating officerSheryl Sandberg. “For more than 100 years, American public policy has insisted firms must compete if they want to succeed,\" Daniel Matheson, the F.T.C.’s lead litigator, said Monday,accordingtoThe New York Times. “The reason we are here is that Meta broke the deal.” As the FTC makes its case, it will point to Zuckerberg’s words as a smoking gun. In emails throughout the years, Zuckerberg repeatedly referred to acquisitions as a way of buying Facebook a chance to catch up to what other social networks were doing. After the company’s failed attempt to acquire Twitter, for one, Zuckerberg wrote in an email in 2008, “I was looking forward to the extra time that would have given us to get our product in order.” Four years later, as he made the case for buying Instagram, he wrote, “[W]hat we’re really buying is time,” noting that buying Instagram would “give us a year or more to integrate their dynamics before anyone can get close to their scale again.” The FTC’s lawsuit points to other executives’ communications as well. After Facebook acquired Instagram for $1 billion, emails showed Instagram co-founderKevin Systromasking why Facebook was limiting promotion of his app. In response, another Facebook executive said that the company’s vice president of productChris Cox, was concerned “about Instagram’s feed cannibalizing our own.” All of this, the FTC argues in the suit, amounts to clear evidence that “Facebook neutralized Instagram as an independent competitor.” Zuckerberg’s emails suggest a similar strategy, the FTC argues, when it came to acquiring WhatsApp. Fresh off the Instagram purchase, Zuckerberg wrote in an email, “WhatsApp is already ahead of us in messaging in the same way Instagram was ‘ahead’ of us in photos” and said he would “pay $[1 billion] for them if we could get them.” Two years later, FacebookboughtWhatsApp for $19 billion. “For the second time in two years, Facebook employees celebrated the neutralization of an existential competitive threat,” the FTC’s complaint reads. The company now known as Meta has called the FTC’s case “weak.” In ablog postSunday, the company’s chief legal officerJennifer Newsteadwrote that both Instagram and WhatsApp have become “better, more reliable and more secure” under Meta’s ownership. Newstead also pointed to the challenges inherent to the FTC’s case. To prove that Meta harmed competition to protect its monopoly, the government must first define the market that Meta dominates. The FTC has tried to define that market narrowly so as not to include competitors like TikTok or YouTube because including those other giants would make it far more difficult for the FTC to argue that Meta controls a dominant share of the market. “They’ve gerrymandered a fictitious market in which Facebook and Instagram compete only with Snapchat and an app called MeWe,” Newstead wrote. “In reality, more time is spent on TikTok and YouTube than on either Facebook or Instagram.” For Meta, the stakes of the case couldn’t be higher, which might have something to do with Zuckerberg’s recent MAGAtransformation. A loss in court could mean the potential break up of the company, forcing Meta to divest from WhatsApp and Instagram. Earlier this month, Zuckerberg reportedly sought to avoid that possibility bylobbyingDonald Trumpto settle the case during a meeting at the Oval Office. But in an interview with Bloomberg last month, FTC chairAndrew Fergusonsaid, “We don’t intend to sort of take our foot off the gas.” Karen Read’s Second Murder Trial Is Already a Spectacle Usha Vance’s “Very Lonely, Lonely World” The WatchThat Links the Kennedys to Kim Kardashian—and a Real Housewife Dying for Sex: The True Story of a Cancer Patient TurnedSexual Explorer Tom Hanks Is Supportive of HisDaughter’s Revealing MemoirAbout Her Troubled Childhood AsTwin PeaksTurns 35, theMystery Is Still the Message DidBiden’s AidesCover Up His Mental State—or Was It Group Delusion?

    "title": "‘White Lotus’ Star Aimee Lou Wood Takes ‘SNL’ to Task for “Mean and Unfunny” Impression",
    "article_text": "If you can believe it,Aimee Lou Woodwasn’t a big fan ofSaturday Night Live’sWhite Lotus–inspired sketch. On Sunday,theWhite Lotusbreakouttook to social media to call outSNLfor its “mean and unfunny” impression of her appearance in the sketch, which was called “The White Potus” and featured in the most recent episode: “The rest of the skit was punching up and I/Chelsea was the only one punched down on.” “The White Potus” aired during theJon Hamm–hosted edition ofSNLon Saturday, April 12. In the sketch,Donald Trump,family members likeMelaniaandDonald Jr.,and key Cabinet members likeRobert F. Kennedy Jr.are depicted as cast members from the most recent season of HBO’sWhite Lotus,withJames Austin Johnson’s President Trump slotting in asJason Isaacs’s financially flailing father, Timothy Ratliff. The only season threeWhite Lotuscharacter who wasn’t given a political avatar in “The White Potus” was Wood’s Chelsea, spoofed bySarah Sherman,who wore large teeth meant tomimic Wood’s own. Some viewersenjoyed the sketch, but Wood was not one of them. “I did find theSNLthing mean and unfunny,” she postedon her Instagram Stories. “Such a shame cuz I had such a great time watching it a couple weeks ago. Yes, take the piss for sure - that’s what the show is about- but there must be a cleverer, more nuanced, less cheap way?” Woodalso postedthat she is not “thin skinned” and has no issue with being joked about when “it’s clever and in good spirits.” But when it comes at the expense of her personal appearance? “The joke was about fluoride,” she wrote, referencing Hamm’s impression of Kennedy Jr., who stood in as Chelsea’s elder American boyfriend, Rick, played onThe White LotusbyWalton Goggins.“I have big gap teeth not bad teeth.” Wood recentlytoldGQthat the discourse surrounding her teeth has been a bit disappointing. “It makes me really happy that it’s symbolizing rebellion and freedom, but there’s a limit,” she said. “The whole conversation is just about my teeth, and it makes me a bit sad because I’m not getting to talk about my work. They think it’s nice because they’re not criticizing…. If it was a man, would we be talking about it this much? It’s still going on about a woman’s appearance.” Wood ended her Instagram statement by clarifying that she has no ill will toward Sherman. “Not @sarahsquirm ‘s fault,” she wrote, tagging Sherman in a post in her Instagram Stories. “Not hating on her, hating on the concept.” According to Wood’s words on Instagram,SNLsent “apologies” for the sketch, and the actor has received “THOUSANDS of messages” in support of her stance. “On a positive note, everyone is agreeing with me about it so I’m glad I said something instead of going in on myself,” she wrote. While thingsdidn’t go Chelsea’s way onThe White Lotus,at least they seem to be going Wood’s way in regard to “The White Potus.” Vanity Fairhas reached out to Wood for comment.

    "title": "Olivia Colman and Benedict Cumberbatch Fight to the Finish in 'The Roses'",
    "article_text": "Olivia Colmanhas a friend who’s going through a horrible divorce. “She has a little victory every day by putting wee in her husband’s tea,” she tellsVanity Fair.“She pees in his tea every day.” It sounds like a detail out of the Oscar winner’s new filmThe Roses,a reimaging of the 1989 comedy directed byDanny DeVito. The original film starredMichael DouglasandKathleen Turneras a wealthy couple whose seemingly perfect marriage falls apart, leading to an increasingly outrageous divorce battle. “I love that you can see the journey of two people who adore each other and slowly, slowly, bit by bit start to try and tear each other apart,” Colman says. \"She’s brilliant at her job, so lovable and likable, very emotionally available and a real friend,\" says Cumberbatch of working with Colman for the first time. In this new take, Colman andBenedict Cumberbatchstar as a couple living on the California coast. Though they start out very much in love, as tension grows between them, they begin to wreak havoc on each other in increasingly chaotic ways. Directed byJay Roach,the movie, which Searchlight will release in theaters August 29, showcases two powerhouse actors joyously diving into smart, bold comedy. The central theme from the 1989 film—how a loving couple’s marriage can so intensely fall apart—remains intact while Colman and Cumberbatch introduce a more modern dynamic. “The film is a parable of two people who loved each other intensely, then ended up hating each other intensely and missing the middle ground,” Cumberbatch says. “Much of it is shockingly recognizable: how we struggle to show love toward the people we love the most, and how this can all go wrong very quickly if we're not careful about nurturing and nourishing the relationships at the center of our families.” Colman's Ivy is a chef whose career begins to take off. The War of the Roseswas both a critical hit and box-office smash. It was the 13th highest grossing film of 1989; it also earned three Golden Globes nominations, including for best comedy. Colman and Cumberbatch, who were fans of the original film, both signed on with their production companies early, eager to develop a new take on the story with Searchlight. But they wouldn’t call it a remake. “All art influences other art,” Colman says. “It’s very hard to find any story that hasn’t had beginnings in another story a year before or a thousand years before. And that’s part of the fun. Everything influences everything else.” In this new version, Colman plays Ivy, a chef whose career begins to eclipse that of her husband Theo, an architect. What at first comes off as witty banter between two British expats living in California soon transforms into sharp barbs and physical one-upmanship as their competitive natures get the best of them. Cumberbatch's Theo is struggling after he loses his job. ScreenwriterTony McNamara, who previously worked with Colman onThe Favourite,was also a fan of the 1989 film. He agreed to write the script forThe Roses, using the original and the book it’s based on—Warren Adler’s 1981 novel of the same name—as a jumping-off point. “I thought, Why don’t we make a movie that’s more focused on what we do to each other while we’re married, and still sort of pay homage to the original?” he says. McNamara, who also wrote the script for 2023’sPoor Thingsand created the Hulu comedy seriesThe Great, is known for his playful wit. “What Tony does so well is the element of comedy, absurdity, and excruciatingly well-observed humor. That’s really the key—the painfully acute observation of relationships,” Cumberbatch says. “What he really pins in this film is the emotional depth of the characters and the recognizability of their dynamics.” The Rosestraces the couple’s relationship over 20 years. It also changes the power dynamic from the original film, which centered on Douglas’s character as the family’s breadwinner. InThe Roses, it’s Ivy’s career that is taking off and Theo who loses his job. “That’s what so many couples understand now, how the balance between two careers is such a trick to solve in a marriage,” McNamara says. “These two people who are very creative, very ambitious—how are they going to balance staying married and staying in love?” Roach says McNamara is a master of tone, which allowed him to strike the right balance for this story. “There’s a reality to it and a groundedness to it and a very relatable predicament that I think this couple gets caught up in,” Roach says. “I just wanted to make sure it had that nice balance, and that we actually want to care about these people.” While they knew each other socially, Colman and Cumberbatch had never worked together on a film before. “Luckily, we’ve managed to stay friends even though we’ve now done our first job together,” Colman jokes. “That’s the fear: that you like each other, and what if you don’t get on when you’re actually on set? But it was lovely. I think we both supported each other.” Allison Janney plays an attorney inThe Roses. Colman admits that they maybe “mucked about too much. Poor Jay was probably saying ‘It’s like herding cats!’” But Roach disagrees, saying that he felt the actors had an easy rapport from the beginning of the 40-day, UK-based shoot. “There is a little bit of a joyful keeping the ball in the air,” he says. “I can always tell, much like the characters in the story, when they trust each other so much that they’re willing to go a little off the script or a little into dangerous territory. I feel the audience senses that high-wire act a little bit.” While both actors are known for dramatic work (Cumberbatch was nominated for an Oscar for 2014’sThe Imitation Gameand 2021’sThe Power of the Dog,while Colman was nominated for 2020’sThe Fatherand 2021’sThe Lost Daughter), they’ve both also showcased their playfulness and strong comedic timing. Colman started out on the sitcomPeep Show, starred inFleabag,and won an Oscar for her work in the dark comedyThe Favourite. Cumberbatch has often played his characters with a delightful, whimsical intelligence, including inSherlockand as Marvel’s Dr. Strange. InThe Roses,both actors get to embrace bold comedy and bring forth the sense of mischief that’s been central to much of their past work. “Olivia is as good on the first take as she would be on the 40th,” Cumberbatch says. “She’s great at taking direction and is such an acute instrument of joy and drama, as well as an immediate human mood enhancer. She has a lot of vulnerability for someone who’s the funniest person in the room.” Kate McKinnon plays a friend of the couple who has an eye on Cumberbatch's Theo. The film also features a strong lineup of talented comedic actors in supporting roles, includingAndy Samberg, Kate McKinnon, Allison Janney,andNcuti Gatwa.“I was working with such a fine company of comedy masters, so watching them improvise inspired me to do a little bit of my own as well,” Cumberbatch says. “The supportive nature of this group was incredible.” Cumberbatch, Colman, and Roach all agree that viewers don’t have to be familiar with the 1989 classic to enjoy their new take. After all, its themes remain universal. “We’re idiots. Humans are so flawed. We want so much to be our high selves, especially with each other, and the illusion and the miracle of love is what sometimes gets us through,” Roach says. “But when it turns, when it goes in the opposite direction, it can be extremely painful. And one enjoyable way to acknowledge that is through humor.” Roach (left) on set with Colman and Cumberbatch.",

    "title": "When ‘The Sopranos’ Took Off, James Gandolfini Took Off Too",
    "article_text": "InGandolfini: Jim, Tony and the Life of a Legend,Jason Bailey charts the life and work of James Gandolfini—a once-in-a-generation talent who found a lasting place in the cultural firmament with his Emmy-winning work onThe Sopranos.But like the conflicted mobster he so aptly played, Gandolfini was a complicated man—and partway through his HBO hit’s run, the pressure of his job and his personal demons threatened to stop the entire operation in its tracks. In this exclusive excerpt, costarsEdie Falco,Steven Van Zandt, andSteve Schirripa,as well as a variety ofSopranoscrew members, recall the drama’s most challenging era. The no-shows started during season 3. The stress ofThe Sopranoshad weighed on James Gandolfini from the beginning; his costar Steven Van Zandt recalls spending “most of my time talking him into coming back the next day. . . . We’d have the same conversation at least once a month.” Van Zandt would reaffirm how lucky they were to be on such an excellent show, how few comparable film roles there were out there, and then he’d deliver the clincher. “Come back and do us all a favor, because you’re helping to employ, I don’t know, sixty people here?” he’d remind him. “So think of them every time you want to quit. Think of the other fifty people that are trying to make a living, depending on you.” All products featured onVanity Fairare independently selected by our editors. However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission. “So he would sometimes take a few days off, whatever,” Van Zandt says. “But he always came back. He always came back, and he was the most generous guy in the world.” The reasons for Gandolfini’s “days off” varied. Sometimes he was avoiding a difficult or embarrassing scene. Sometimes the difficulties of line memorization would send him into a tailspin. Sometimes he wanted to get an early start on a weekend of partying, which was increasingly his coping mechanism for his unhappiness at home; sometimes he hadn’t quite recovered from one of those weekends. “He likes to have a good time,” explainsSopranosscript supervisorChristine Gee, “but sometimes, you know . . . some people don’t know when to stop.” Whatever prompted it, the outcome was the same. The production office would get a call from the transportation department; the driver who had gone to Jim’s apartment to pick him up reported that he was not answering his door or his phone. “So that could throw a day into a tizzy,” saysSteve Kornacki, then an assistant production coordinator, “because then you had to punt and you had to figure out what to do, until somebody got ahold of Jim.” As updates were relayed from his driver to the Teamsters co-captain to executive producerIlene Landress—he’s up and around, he’s in the shower, he’s coming out to the car—the crew would do what they could: establishing shots, maybe, or coverage of his scene partners over his stand-in’s shoulder, with Gee reading Jim’s lines. “Find something else to shoot or shoot what you can, as long as you hear he might be coming in,” explains location managerMark Kamine. “You pull up whatever work you can do without him until he gets in, or says he’s not coming in. And then the Teamster tells the other Teamster who tells the producer who tells me, if I’m the one on set, he’s not coming in. And then the first question is, what can you do instead? And if you can’t do anything, it’s like, OK, go home.” On the occasions when the driver could get him out of the apartment, albeit late and hung over, they would pour coffee into him to sober him up and get him camera ready, and take a shot at making their day (sometimes shooting his medium shots and close-ups simultaneously). “After the first time, there was a contingency plan,” Kornacki notes. “And I don’t think it happened a lot. But the producers were ready for it.” “Look, it was difficult on production, obviously,” says cinematographerPhil Abraham. “I don’t remember ever getting a phone call saying,Don’t come in to workI remember specifically, Jim even giving them advanced warnings, likeI’m not coming in tomorrow. And people would go,Ha, yeah, right. And he wouldn’t come in tomorrow! It wasn’t necessarily always like, he went out drinking that night and then disappeared. I mean, itwasthat a lot. But I know that playing this character was a huge burden on this guy. He was not this person. And yet he needed a release—it’s almost like the noise in his head was probably too much. Now, whether or not that’s the way one does it…” The absences became cyclical over the next couple of seasons. “Time would pass, and the crew would all get kind of a sense of,Oh, we’re due for a day of absenteeism,” Gee says. “You would just get a sense,Wow, he’s been pretty good. He’s been showing up and he’s been doing the right thing. Next thing you know, boom—that would happen.” “It’s a hard scheduling thing,” according to Landress. “The guy was working so hard, so much of the time, they were like,Okay, we’ll give them a three-day weekend.But I learned pretty quickly that he might go out on Thursday night. And so I’m not going to see him on Friday. So as much as I want to schedule to give them a break, you almost got to the point of not wanting to give them a break because you couldn’t know what would happen.” “I can’t say I’ve ever been on a show where something like that has gone on, but this was sort of a different beast,” Abraham says. “At a certain point, HBO was fining him 250 grand a day. And he would say,Fuck it. I can’t come in to work.So we knew then, it’s not just him doing a lot of blow and drinking, and he’s not getting up because he doesn’t want to get up. No, it was deeper than that.” “I’m not sane at all when I’m doing the show,” Gandolfini saidin a 2001 interview. It was a question of pressure—the pressure of maintaining the quality ofThe Sopranosand his performance on it. Some of that pressure was external; much of it was not. “The guy was such a workaholic and put so much pressure on himself,” Landress said. “Jimmy was never going to give you a B performance. He was always going to give you an A performance. And if he felt like he couldn’t give an A performance, he was so hard on himself.” Unsurprisingly, a perfectionist likeSopranoscreatorDavid Chasewas often exhausted as well. “I was concerned, but I was also so sick of his bullshit,” he recalled. “They flew me back from France and then back. It was crazy. He was sick of me, too. Let me just say that. It wasn’t a one-way street. He could always find something humiliating and mortifying so he wouldn’t have to show up for something.”Edie Falco,meanwhile, had been diagnosed with breast cancer midway through filming a season of the show, and would frequently come to the set after a morning of chemotherapy only to discover that her costar was MIA. “It was infuriating to her,” Gee says. “I remember her getting just really irate, and saying how she’s struggling so hard to do all the right things to save her life, while he’s pissing his away.” “Someone like Edie, or one of the other actors, who’s geared up and studied their lines, and maybe stayed up late to do that and gotten up early to go to hair and makeup,” Kamine says, “that’s not nice. And did he think about that? The night before when he was out partying? You know, but he couldn’t help it, obviously.” “As I remember it, the feeling I had, overall, was empathy, that he’s going through something,” Falco says. “And if he could do better, and be on set, he would be. Nobody wants to be holding up a production, and nobody goes out hoping someday they can screw up a very complicated schedule. He’s . . . the guy’s in trouble. And coming from a place where there are quite a few of those people in my family, or there were, I have a great deal of empathy, sympathy, compassion. You wouldn’t wish it on anybody.” When he’d blow a day, or come in late, he was overwhelmed with guilt; in fact, the famous Friday night food spreads—elaborate meals from the Tribeca sushi restaurant Nobu, which Gandolfini paid for every week—were initially “sort of like an apology to the crew,” Gee explains. “He knew we all traveled to get there, and that we’re not getting paid for the day if we’re not working.” But she says their resentments were outweighed by empathy. “The crew understood that this was an illness. It’s not a light switch that you could just shut off.” Gandolfini was grateful for the doors the show had opened for him, and the good work it allowed him to do, week after week. But by this point in the run, “there were regrets,” manager Mark Armstrong says. “A ‘be careful what you wish for’ kind of thing—as much as he loved the writing, and he really did, and he knew he was on a great show with great people—I think he wished it wasn’t as big as it was, and that people cared about him as much as they did.” The late days and absences continued through the run ofThe Sopranos, Gee says. “It kind of peaked and then it tapered off, but it never just went away completely.” The more the pressures of the show and the darkness of the character were rattling around inside Gandolfini, the smaller the chasm between Jim and Tony became, the more he would require an escape hatch. “I just think, when you feel the weight of that much responsibility, or that the onus is on you for everything, then there’s got to be a release,” says collaborator and producer Chiemi Karasawa. “I feel like he must have sought relief and respite from that kind of pressure.” “Jim did not spend a lot of time, I don’t think, attending to his own mental health,” Falco says. “I had a conversation with him once. I said, ‘Listen, no one’s gonna say,Jim’s probably tired. Let’s give him some time off.This is your job, to say,Guys, I need a month, we’ve got to shut down production for a month, I’ve got to take care of myself, or whatever.’ And he would never do that. The sense of obligation he felt, for a crew that would suddenly be out of work for a month? He was always looking at other people before himself, which I think he probably thought of as altruistic. But ultimately, it’s a form of suicide, you know.” Or, as another costar, Steve Schirripa, puts it: “Sweet guy. Listen, not perfect. Not perfect. By any means.” Excerpt from the new bookGANDOLFINIby Jason Bailey published by Abrams Press. © 2025 Jason Bailey Karen Read’s Second Murder Trial Is Already a Spectacle Usha Vance’s “Very Lonely, Lonely World” Dying for Sex: The True Story of a Cancer Patient TurnedSexual Explorer Tom Hanks Is Supportive of HisDaughter’s Revealing MemoirAbout Her Troubled Childhood AsTwin PeaksTurns 35, theMystery Is Still the Message DidBiden’s AidesCover Up His Mental State—or Was It Group Delusion?

    "title": "Lauren Sánchez, Katy Perry, Gayle King, and Their Historic All-Women Space Flight Lands Safely",
    "article_text": "The all-women crew ofBlue Origin’s NS-31made history Monday, April 14, when the six women on board—Aisha Bowe, Amanda Nguyễn, Gayle King, Katy Perry, Kerianne Flynn,andLauren Sánchez—successfully completed a brief venture to outer space on a privately owned rocket. The crew of the self-flying rocket,New Shepard,would have been notable even if the half dozen aboard weren’t recognizable names: Blue Origin tellsUSA Todaythat there hasn’t been an all-women space flight since Soviet Union cosmonautValentina Tereshkova’s 1963 solo mission. Blue Origin was founded in 2000 by Sánchez’s fiancé,Jeff Bezos.The mission was announced in late February, just days before an unmanned rocket from theElon Musk–owned competitor SpaceXexperienced a “rapid unscheduled disassembly” during a test launch. The planned journey was 11 minutes in total, launching from West Texas and taking the crew members past the Kármán line, the boundary that delineates space from Earth’s atmosphere. The crew members were allowed a few minutes to take in the views of the Earth and float weightlessly inside the rocket. Sánchez is not just a crew member on the flight, but was responsible for helping select her fellow space travelers. She chose them for their reach and creativity, she toldEllein anApril group interview of the crewahead of the mission. “All of these women are storytellers in their own right,” she said. “They’re going to go up to space and be able to spread what they felt in different ways.” Sánchez, 55, is a former broadcast journalist, author of the children’s bookThe Fly Who Flew to Space,pilot, and vice chair of the Bezos Earth Fund. She and Bezos are set to be married this summer. She admitted toEllethat she was “a little scared,” but enthused about expanding the image of who could go to space. “Who would not get glam before the flight?!” she said. “We’re going to have lash extensions flying in the capsule!” Sánchez has three children from prior relationships: sonNikko Gonzalez,24, withTony Gonzalez;and sonEvan Whitesell,18, and daughterElla Whitesell,17, with ex-husbandPatrick Whitesell. Perry, 40, is a music superstar and five-time American Music Award winner. She shares daughterDaisy,4, with fiancéOrlando Bloom.She toldEllethat going to space was a longtime dream of hers, and was stunned to get the call from Blue Origin asking her to be part of the flight. “They told me about it being the first all-female crew,” she said. “I take pause in those moments and ask the universe to give me confirmations. And I really felt very sure when they sent me the picture of the space pod, because on the front of the pod is a feather, and that’s my mom’s nickname for me. And so I was like, ‘Okay, I see it.’” Bowe, 38, is an award-winning STEM advocate and entrepreneur. She is the CEO and founder of tech company STEMBoard. She previously worked with NASA, and she and King will be the sixth and seventh Black women to ever travel to space. “This representation really matters,” she toldElle. “It’s people seeing themselves and being able to show up authentically in their careers in the future.” Due to a low high school GPA, she was once advised toconsider a career in cosmetologyinstead of the cosmos. “I wanted to go to space,” she toldElle,“but I didn’t think it was possible. I was afraid to do it. I was afraid to even dream about it.” Veteran journalist King, 70, however, admitted that she was “probably the only one at the table who wasn’t saying, ‘Put me in, Coach.’ When I got the call from Lauren and Jeff, my first reaction was a no.” What changed her mind, however, was that same hesitation. She recalled the feeling of being “terrified and excited at the same time” when she gave birth, another leap out of her comfort zone. “I like to think that for anybody who can look at me and say, ‘If she can do that, so can I,’” she said. “Anybody who knows me is stunned that I’m sitting at the table with this group of people. I’m kind of stunned myself. But I want people to know that you are far more capable of things than you realize. And I am a living example of that. So I’m dedicating this to showing people that number one, it’s okay to have dreams. Dreams do not have deadlines. And if you think that you’re afraid of something, release the fear and do things that you don’t think are possible.” Flynn, 57, is a film producer who has worked on multiple films exploring gender inequality. She has long had interest in going to space, and toldElleahead of the mission that she “can’t wait to touch down on Earth and share what we bring back with the world.” Her main motivation for the historic trip, however, is her family. “I’m doing this to leave a legacy for my family. I’m doing it for my son,” she said. “We are the future of space travel. Sending civilians to space will become something that everyone will have an opportunity to do one day. And I feel honored to be one of the pioneers among these women to make this possible for future generations.” Nguyễn, 33, is a Nobel Peace Prize nominee and civil rights activist who, as a Harvard student, had her sights set on working at NASA. When she was sexually assaulted before graduation, however, she founded the organization Rise and advocated for the creation of the Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights, which was signed into law by PresidentBarack Obamain 2016 after being passed unanimously in Congress. She is the first Vietnamese American woman to go to space, and toldElle,“My parents are boat refugees from Vietnam. We came on boats, and now we’re on spaceships.” She sees her participation in the flight as the fulfillment of “a dream deferred…. Gender-based violence is a big reason why so many women in STEM don’t continue on with their training, and I was one of those women. After I was sexually assaulted, I traded my telescope to fight for my rights as a sexual assault survivor. I drafted the Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights, passed it in Congress and at the United Nations. And then, after 10 years, I was like, ‘I want to honor the person that I was before I was hurt.’” Karen Read’s Second Murder Trial Is Already a Spectacle Usha Vance’s “Very Lonely, Lonely World” The WatchThat Links the Kennedys to Kim Kardashian—and a Real Housewife Dying for Sex: The True Story of a Cancer Patient TurnedSexual Explorer Tom Hanks Is Supportive of HisDaughter’s Revealing MemoirAbout Her Troubled Childhood AsTwin PeaksTurns 35, theMystery Is Still the Message DidBiden’s AidesCover Up His Mental State—or Was It Group Delusion?

    "title": "‘The Last of Us’ Season Two Premiere Recap: Ellie and Joel Grapple With Joel’s Big Lie",
    "article_text": "\"Okay.\" The second season ofThe Last of Usbegins withthe word that last season closed on—a heartbreaking moment of ambiguity between Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey), the girl he now sees as his surrogate daughter. As you may recall Joel lied to Ellie by saying that her immunity to the cordyceps infection that has turned much of humanity into shrieking zombies wasn't replicable, and that Ellie was now free to carve out whatever post-apocalyptic life she chose. The truth is much grimmer than that: Joel learned that making a potential cure would kill Ellie, and while she was unconscious in the operating room, he murdered the Firefly resistance movement to set Ellie free. \"Future Days,\" the show’s season two premiere, sets up that lie as the first small domino that will cascade into the central conflict of this season, and beyond. That \"okay,\" delivered wonderfully byBella Ramseyin the first season and replayed as the first moment in the premiere, leaves it up to the viewer to decide whether Ellie actually believed Joel. Picking up five years later,The Last of Usdoesn't yet give us a definitive answer. Whatisclear is that Ellie is chafing under Joel's overbearing and protective nature. Now a young adult, Ellie is relishing the work of keeping herself and others safe. She loves sparring practice, going on patrol, and her butterfly knife. Shehatesfeeling like anyone is treating her like a kid, and the confusing nature of her friend Dina's (Isabella Merced) mischievous advances—romance suits Ellie awkwardly, even as she begins to entertain the idea. The two share tremendous chemistry, fighting and flirting together in the show's most prolonged action sequence as they battle a new breed of infected that’s capable of stalking and deceiving them. Joel, meanwhile, is doing his best to be a pillar of the community. He and Ellie have set up shop in Jackson Hole, Wyoming—a populous community briefly visited last season, now thriving and approaching pre-zombie apocalypse normalcy. Joel's past life in construction has provided him with ample work in Jackson, as he works closely with his sister-in-law Maria (Rutina Wesley) and brother Tommy (GabrielLuna) to meet the rapidly growing community's needs. Maria and Joel pick up an argument they seem to have had many times already, about needing to balance welcoming refugees while making sure they take care of their own. Joel leans conservative, and Maria leads with compassion. There's a nice, lived-in feel to this scene, even though I'm not sureThe Last of Usis particularly interested in digging into this particular ideological argument. At the end of the day, the questions Joel asks his nephew—what's inside Jackson's borders? (People) What's outside? (Monsters)—seems to answer it clearly. Joel has it less easy in therapy—which is a thing he does now, in exchange for ziploc bags of sub-par weed. Gail (Catherine O'Hara, in a wonderful dramatic turn) has been harboring anger towards Joel—we learn he killed her husband Eugene in a moment of desperation. It's a bit jarring to hear about something so consequential that happened entirely off-screen, butCraig Mazin, who writes and directs this episode, is clearly setting up a thread he intends to revisit. We already know that Eugene will appear in an upcoming episodeplayed byJoe Pantaliano, and that knowledge is exciting. Like this scene, that one will not have originated in the game. Eugene is just someone mentioned in passing inThe Last of Us Part II, while Gail does not exist at all. This is where the TV version ofThe Last of Ussings: finding grace notes to expand upon, then rooting them back into the show's central relationship. Here, Gail brings up her ugly feelings towards Joel to make a point: You can't heal or fix something you refuse to talk about. She doesn't know about Joel's lie, but she does know that Joel is hidingsomething. And unless he can say it out loud, he can't expect to repair whatever afflicts his relationship with Ellie. That relationship is the inspiration for the episode's title. \"Future Days\" is a bit of an easter egg—it's a Pearl Jam song that Joel plays for Ellie when he gives her a guitar inThe Last of Us Part II. It's quite likely we'll see the same moment in the show—season onesets it upwhen Joel mentions fixing up a guitar for Ellie in passing, and he frets over the instrument’s condition when he pays Ellie a visit in this episode. That guitar is a big deal in the game, and Pearl Jam is a big deal forLast of Usco-creatorNeil Druckmann. Other nods to the source material give \"Future Days,\" the episode some extra flourish: Ellie's journaling; her horse, Shimmer; and the new tattoo she has covering her infection scar. Many ofThe Last of Us'best moments continue to be lifted directly from the games, too. In \"Future Days,\" that's the big dance in Jackson, where Dina and Ellie share a very public kiss. It's a gossip-worthy moment in the town for two reasons: The first is that Dina has just broken up with Jesse (Young Mazino), perhaps the most serious-minded and responsible of Jackson's young adult cohort. The other is that their budding queer romance attracts the ire of a local bigot named Seth, who tells the two that they're at \"a family event\" before tossing a slur their way. Ellie and Dina don't get to respond to the man because Joel intervenes on their behalf, shoving Seth to the ground and kicking him out. Ellie is furious at Joel for both making a scene and for continuing to treat her like a child—the rift between them getting deeper the longer they're unable to clear the air. A number of things threaten to interrupt the heart-to-heart Joel and Ellie need to have, however. There's an internal threat—cordyceps tendrils have infiltrated the community, growing through a rotting pipe that runs beneath everything—and an external one. In a small shift from the source material, the show immediately introduces viewers to its most consequential new player: Abby (Kaitlyn Dever), who leads a crew of young Firefly members who all want revenge for Joel's murderous rampage at the end of season 1. We don't know much about her yet, but she bookends the show with menace, vowing revenge in its opening moments and arriving outside of Jackson as it closes. That's the risk you run when you keep secrets from people you care about: someone else might beat you to the truth.

    "article_text": "Central, Mong Kok and Tai Po among areas reaching ‘serious’ levels as dusty northerly airstream brings pollutants to city for second day Air pollution indexes in more than 10 areas in Hong Kong reached the highest health risk levels on Monday evening, as a dusty northerly airstream brought pollutants to the city for a second day in a row. The government’s air quality health index (AQHI) had already reached “very high” levels in the morning, climbing to “serious” by late afternoon. As of 6pm, 14 out of 18 general and roadside stations had reached “serious” levels, including in Central, Causeway Bay, Mong Kok, Tuen Mun, Tai Po and North district. The remaining stations registered “very high” levels. Conditions remained largely unchanged two hours later. Meteorological experts said that due to the combined effect of a low-pressure system in mainland China and cold air, strong winds blew dust and other pollutants southward, resulting in serious air pollution in Hong Kong for consecutive days. As the northeastern monsoon carried particulate pollutants from the mainland, PM10 concentrations across multiple areas in Hong Kong began to surge from Saturday night.",

    "article_text": "The four pumping machines are capable of draining the equivalent of an Olympic-sized swimming pool every hour Four new robots will be deployed to severely flooded areas in Hong Kong to help cope with inclement weather. The Drainage Services Department said on Monday that it had invested about HK$3 million (US$386,844) to buy the four pumping robots with an aim to expedite its work in managing severe flooding incidents. Director of Drainage Services Ringo Mok Wing-cheong said that the most expensive robot acquired this year cost around HK$1 million, given its ability to operate for eight consecutive hours and pump 800 cubic metres of water per hour. Taking into account the other three robots, which have pumping capacities of 500 or 700 cubic metres per hour, the combined drainage capacity of all four machines is 2,500 cubic metres, equivalent to the volume of an Olympic-sized swimming pool. “Given the huge impact of extreme weather on Hong Kong, there is a need to acquire strong pumping robots,” he said. “When the water level reaches a certain level … we will take action and consider whether to deploy the robots.”",

    "article_text": "Many elderly residents are unclear about their inclusion under the new policy’s safety net, Kitson Yang says Hong Kong lawmakers have called for clearer information on medical fee waivers under a revamped public healthcare subsidy regime, while also pushing for more evening clinic quotas amid rising accident and emergency (A&E) charges. Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau said on Monday that the reform announced last month would also optimise a fee waiver mechanism to provide greater protection for low-income residents. “Eligible low-income residents who can receive partial or full medical fee reduction will triple from the current 300,000 to 1.4 million,” he said at a meeting of the Legislative Council’s health services panel. But lawmaker Kitson Yang Wing-kit said many elderly people were unclear about whether they would covered by the safety net under the new policy. He urged the government to explain the terms of eligibility more simply to residents, such as by making comparisons with the criteria for existing living allowances. “They are having trouble understanding the situation, even if we show them the mechanism,” he said.",

    "article_text": "The Post breaks down what’s behind the dusty, dry weather that triggered a health warning According to the Observatory, the city experienced its driest April morning since an automatic weather station was set up in 1984, with relative humidity falling to as low as 21 per cent. The Post examines the sudden arrival of severe air pollution and what precautions residents should take to minimise their exposure. Former Observatory assistant director Leung Wing-mo explained that both the low relative humidity and poor air quality were influenced by the weakened northeast monsoon. “The low relative humidity is likely due to continental airflow and sinking air, similar to the hot and dry conditions before a typhoon, while the poor air quality is due to high levels of both sandstorm-related particulate matter and an unusually high ozone level,” Leung said. He said the surging ozone level was likely caused by stratospheric ozone intrusion. “This occurs when ozone from the layer of the atmosphere about 10km [6.2 miles] to 30km high descends to the ground due to sinking air,” he said. “Ozone combined with some particulate matter like PM10 and PM2.5 makes the air quality even worse.” The Environmental Protection Department noted the airborne dust primarily consisted of PM10, or larger respirable suspended particulates. The level of PM2.5, the fine suspended particulates that pose a more direct threat to human health, was lower.",

    "title": "Sudan’s news blackout stokes fear and confusion after attack on Zamzam camp",
    "article_text": "Sudan’s information blackout has left relatives of those in Sudan’s Zamzam camp for those displaced by the war struggling for news of their safety after it was overrun by militiamen at the weekend. As leaders across the globe prepared to meet forpeace talks in Londonto pressure the backers of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and the Sudanese army to agree a ceasefire, the RSF launched a deadly assault, seizing Zamzam after weeks of tightening its siege. The UN’s migration agency, the IOM, said between 60,000 and 80,000 households had been displaced from Zamzam following the attacks. The medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières said its team at Tawila, another displacement camp near El Fasher inDarfur, had seen about 10,000 people arrive in 48 hours suffering from dehydration and exhaustion. Campaigners said the dearth of information on the violence, which hasreportedly killed hundreds of civilians,highlighted the need for the London talks to prioritise restoring communications to allow communities under attack to warn each other, to give better access to healthcare and to facilitate human rights documentation. Altahir Hashim, whose family was living in Zamzam, said: “Zamzam as an IDP [internally displaced persons] camp no longer exists. The RSF has completely overrun the camp – killing, raping, burning and committing all kinds of atrocities. The communications are really bad and I haven’t been able to speak to my family.” On Friday,nine medical workersfrom the aid organisation Relief International were killed when the RSF raided Zamzam, while the Sudanese American Physicians Association (Sapa), said the manager of a children’s health centrewas also killed. For two decades Zamzam has hosted people displaced during the 2000s in attacks by the army and the Janjaweed militias – who were later formalised into the RSF – but its population has grown to about 700,000 during the current civil war as people have fled other parts of the Darfur region. Hashim is part of a group of Darfuris abroad who have raised funds to buy and airdrop satellite phones into Darfur as well as walkie-talkies to allow local communication during emergencies. He said the communications blackout also made it difficult for people to receive money sent from relatives abroad through mobile banking systems. The limited information that has emerged from Zamzam has often relied on satellite communications – whether through imagery, phones or the Starlink service, which uses satellites rather than land-based communication towers to provide internet. But these services can be unreliable and are costly, meaning that while they are used by some activists in Darfur, others remain unable to be contacted. One video shared by the group North Darfur Observatory for Human Rights showed people fleeing Zamzam with theirbelongings strapped to camels and donkeys. Often the main source of information from Darfur has come from videosrecorded by RSF fighters themselvesof the atrocities and some have emerged showing their fightersentering Zamzam on pickup trucks mounted with heavy machine gunswith burning buildings in the background. Shayna Lewis, from the US-based organisationPreventing & Ending Mass Atrocities(Paema).“We have reports of civilians being hunted and executed in the streets of Zamzam, but we are unable to consistently communicate with people as the networks are off and the internet can only be accessed through Starlink access points. Starlink access is sporadic, expensive and can be turned off by the belligerents at will.” Paema said the talks in London should prioritise restoring communications as a way to quickly relieve suffering in Sudan. Sapa, which operates medical facilities in El Fasher, said the last message it received from its teams in Zamzam on Sunday afternoon was: “Zamzam under the control of the RSF.” Khalid Mishain, of the Sudanese human rights group Youth Citizens Observers Network, said they had lost contact with their observers in the area since the attack. He said the communications blackout had been a impediment to human rights documentation throughout the conflict. “People have to write the information down, keep it with them and then secretly move to areas where there is communications and send it to us,” said Mishain. “We have civilians suffering and no one knows about it, and those who report on it have to risk their life because of the communications blackout.”",
