    "title": "Shedeur Sanders opens up on historic NFL Draft slide, prank call and becoming a Brown",
    "article_text": "Craig Carton breaks down how Shedeur Sanders may have actually won big by avoiding the pressure of being drafted in the first round. Shedeur Sanders has a home in the NFL after a shocking,nearly three-day waitduring which he dramatically slid down the draft. TheCleveland Brownsended one of the most controversial NFL Draft slides in league history when they selected Sanders in the fifth round with the 144th overall pick Saturday. The NFL world had been locked in on the Sanders family home since Thursday night as Sanders experienced one of the most dramatic and shocking draft slides in league history. NFL DRAFT QUARTERBACK MISTAKES THAT SHAPED LEAGUE LANDSCAPE \"Nothing really affected me the last couple of days,\" Sanderstold reportersSaturday. \"I'm favored, I'm blessed. Besides that, it's not really anything that changed. The love of the game is still the love of the game. When you get on the field, there wasn't too much negativity being said. I know I gotta clean up some things in my game for me to be at my best, but that's what I take each offseason one at a time and fix it. \"The main thing, I'm just proving — coach (Kevin) Stefanski and (general manager Andrew) Berry — that they are right. That's it. They're right about picking me. I'm a good decision. I'm a good draft pick for them, to be able to come in there and do what I need to do.\" For Sanders, considered at one point to be a contender for theNo. 1 overall pick in the draft, the fall was historic. Top prospects like Sanders have had shocking slides in past NFL Drafts. Aaron Rodgers slipped down to the 25th overall pick in the 2005 NFL Draft and was passed over by the 49ers for Alex Smith. Patrick Mahomes wasn't taken until the 10th pick in the 2017 Draft and was passed over for Mitch Trubisky by the Bears. Still, at the time, Mahomes was less of a hyped prospect than Sanders. SHEDEUR SANDERS' HISTORIC NFL DRAFT DRAMA IGNITED HEATED RACIAL DEBATES Lamar Jackson fell all the way to the 32nd pick in the 2018 draft after four other quarterbacks were taken ahead of him. But Sanders had to wait well into the third day to hear his name called, with nearly all the event's national attention at that point squarely on him. Sanders also had to deal with a prank call by an imposter NFL GM in front of a Twitch livestream audience Friday night. \"Of course, I feel like it was a childish act, but everybody does childish things here and there,\" Sanders told reporters of the prank phone call, via Cleveland.com reporter Mary Kay Cabot. Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski addressed the prank call at a press conference Saturday. \"It's sad that these young men have to deal with this,\" Stefanski said. \"It's silly, but onward and upward.\" GET FULL 2025 NFL DRAFT COVERAGE WITH REAL-TIME PICKS, EXPERT ANALYSIS AND CAN'T-MISS MOMENTS Now, Sanders is focused on doing his best job with the Browns and showing everyone the \"real\" him. \"I know I'm going to fit in perfectly,\" Sanders said. \"I feel like it's first getting in, showing respect to the vets, showing them I'm here ready to work. Show the coaches and have them understand, I'm here ready to work. So, they could actually understand the real me. That's what I'm truly thankful to have, is the opportunity for people to actually see the real me and not be able to see stuff that could be true or not.\" Deion Sanders, right, with his son Shedeur Sanders on the red carpet before the Super Bowl LIX NFL Honors at Saenger Theatre in New Orleans Feb. 6, 2025.(Kirby Lee/Imagn Images) Sanders' father and college coach, Deion Sanders, sent a message of gratitude on X after his son was picked. \"My bible says God uses the foolish things to confound the wise & he chose the weak things of the world that he may put to shame the strong,\" Sanders said in a post on X. \"Please know God ain't done & God is just really getting started. Enjoy this lesson & stop stressing.\" God was a common theme throughout the draft experience for the entire Sanders family. Shedeur and Deion expressed thanks to God in several social media posts without any further context dozens of times since Thursday. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Deion's other son, Deion Sanders Jr., posted a frenzy of Bible verses on his X account, and then retweeted those same posts just hours later. Deion has been a devout Christian throughout his football career, and his sons leaned on that throughout the weekend during Shedeur's unprecedented experience. However, Shedeur is also different from Deion in other ways, according to Browns general manager Andrew Berry. \"Shedeur, he is probably a little bit opposite in terms of personality with his dad,\" Berry told reporters Saturday. \"A little bit quieter, a little bit more introverted, but we felt good with him as a person. He works hard. He's a really good kid. He wants to be great. His teammates loved him in Colorado. And I know he'll come in ready to work and ready to put his best foot forward.\" Deion Sanders, center, with his sons Shedeur Sanders, left, and Deion Sanders Jr. on the red carpet before Super Bowl LIX NFL Honors at Saenger Theatre.(Kirby Lee/Imagn Images) Several reports indicated Sanders may have interviewed poorly with multiple NFL general managers throughout the draft process. However, the Browns' Berry said his team's interview was a \"positive\" experience. Berry and Stefanski suggested Sanders will compete for the team's starting quarterback position in 2025. \"We don't care once they walk in the doors. Don't care first-round pick, seventh-round pick, undrafted. Once you're here and you're on this football team, you're a part of this culture, you're a part of this family, and we're just going to keep our heads down and go to work.\" Follow Fox News Digital’ssports coverage on X, and subscribe tothe Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter Jackson Thompson is a sports writer for Fox News Digital.

Amother in East Texaswas arrested after a child got sick from alleged vodka-laced Jell-O shots at a fifth grade school holiday party in December. Teresa Isabel Bernal, 33, is facing a felony count of injury to a child after multiple students consumed what officials allege were vodka-laced treats Dec. 20 at Jones Elementary School in Tyler. According toan arrest affidavit obtained by KETK,a Tyler Independent School District (ISD) police officer received a phone call from the Jones Elementary assistant principal that said she believed a parent had brought in Jell-O shots to a class Christmas party. One child threw up and another was unable to stand after consuming six shots, according to an arrest affidavit.

After returning from Christmas break, another student reported he had thrown up twice at school that day, according to the affidavit, while another student claimed he had \"passed out\" after school following the party.

PresidentDonald Trumpsaid he didn't believe in using \"loopholes\" to seek a third term in office during an interview with Time Magazine published Friday, although he still didn't shut down the idea entirely. Trump and some allies have floated the idea of seeking a third term in 2028, although the Constitution's 22nd Amendment prohibits presidents from serving more than two terms in office. \"You recently said you were \"not joking\" about seeking a third term and that there were methods to do it.

    "article_text": "Colin Cowherd reacts to Shedeur Sanders’ surprising slide out of the first round and what it means for his NFL future The Cleveland Browns pulled the trigger ontaking Shedeur Sandersafter his historic slide in the NFL Draft. But some fans are skeptical about the team's enthusiasm for the player based onthe reactionsof Browns leadership after the selection. ESPN footage of Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski and general manager Andrew Berry showed light golf claps with blank facial expressions in the team's war room after the pick of Sanders was announced. Berry slouched with a half frown. NFL DRAFT QUARTERBACK MISTAKES THAT SHAPED LEAGUE LANDSCAPE Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders speaks during a press conference at the NFL football scouting combine Feb. 28, 2025, in Indianapolis.(AP Photo/George Walker IV) Many fans on social media questioned how enthusiastic team brass actually was about taking the controversial prospect. \"They look thrilled. Did someone force their hand?\" one X user wrote in response to the footage. Another user expressed concern over Sanders possibly being on a team whose leadership doesn't value him. \"This is even more disrespectful than NOT drafting him. No way these guys treat Shedeur fairly,\" the user wrote. GET FULL 2025 NFL DRAFT COVERAGE WITH REAL-TIME PICKS, EXPERT ANALYSIS AND CAN'T-MISS MOMENTS On bold critic even suggested Berry and Stefanski gave a \"reaction of shame,\" while pushing a conspiracy theory involving NFL collusion. \"This is a reaction of shame, they are embarrassed that they decided to participate in this collusion, participated in knowingly and obviously screwing this kid yet end up drafting him,\" that user wrote. Berry and Stefanski later explained the selection of Sanders to reporters in a press conference. Berry suggested that drafting Sanders \"wasn't necessarily the plan\" after taking quarterback Dillon Gabriel in an earlier round, and he didn't think Sanders would be available in the fifth round. \"It wasn't necessarily the plan going into the weekend to select two quarterbacks, but, you know, as we talk about, we do believe in best player available. We do believe in positional value. And we didn't necessarily expect him to be available in the fifth round,\" Berry said. \"So, we love adding competition to every position room. So, adding him to compete with the other guys who are already in there, that was the appropriate thing to do.\" While discussing the strategy behind drafting Sanders, Berry said it was something Browns officials started to consider entering the third day of the draft. \"It was something, going into day three of the draft with him still on the board, it was a thought like, 'Well, you know, depending on how far he goes, that would be something that we would be interested in potentially taking him off the board,’\" Berry said.

    "title": "Teens' night of rock throwing leads to murder conviction for man, now 20",
    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. ThreeDenver-area teenagerscheered each other during a night of throwing rocks at cars — until one of the stones crashed through a windshield and killed a woman, leading to a murder conviction Friday after the trio turned on one another. Jurors found Joseph Koenig guilty of first-degree murder in the death of Alexa Bartell on April 19, 2023, after the other young men riding with him reached deals with prosecutors and testified against him. Koenig, now 20, was also convicted ofattempted murderand other less serious crimes for rocks and other objects thrown at vehicles the night Bartell was killed and in previous weeks. COLORADO TEENS ARRESTED IN ROCK-THROWING ATTACKS TOOK PHOTOS OF MURDERED WOMAN'S CAR AS 'MEMENTO': POLICE Bartell’s family and friends hugged and cried in court after the verdict. Her mother, Kelly Bartell, said later that justice had been done but she had mixed feelings, expressing some sympathy for Koenig and the other two young men, who were all 18 when her daughter was killed. \"It’s hard to be happy or feel satisfied that justice was served today, because I feel one amazing life was lost and three others are also lost and impacted,\" she said. Jurors had to consider shifting and competing versions of the truth offered by Koenig's former co-defendants during the two-week trial. Kelly Bartell, the mother of Alexa Bartell who died after a rock crashed through the windshield of her car, speaks at Jefferson Combined Court in Golden, Colo., on Friday.(AP Photo/Colleen Slevin) No one disputed that a 9-pound (4-kilogram) landscaping rock taken from a Walmart parking lot crashed through Bartell’s windshield, killing her instantly. The issue was who threw it. The only DNA found on the rock was Bartell’s, making the testimony from the other two, Zachary Kwak and Nicholas Karol-Chik, key to the prosecution. Lawyers for Koenig said Kwak threw the rock that killed Bartell. But Kwak and Karol-Chik, whose plea agreements on lesser charges could lead to shorter prison sentences, said Koenig threw it. Although Karol-Chik said they each threw about 10 rocks that night, Kwak testified that he did not throw any. Chief Deputy District Attorney Katharine Decker told jurors the damage to Bartell’s car was consistent with Koenig — who is left-handed and was driving — throwing the rock, shotput-style, out the driver’s-side window, as Karol-Chik testified. Even if jurors were unconvinced that Koenig threw it, she told them, they should still find him guilty of first-degree murder as a conspirator. Koenig’s attorneys said he did not know anyone had been hurt until Bartell’s car went off the road. They also argued that he had borderline personality disorder, affecting his impulse control and judgment. Defense lawyer Martin Stuart asked jurors to instead find Koenig guilty of manslaughter, the least serious charge he faced, saying he did not knowingly try to kill her. Jurors also had the option of finding him guilty of manslaughter as a conspirator. After seeing Bartell’s car leave the road, the three friends circled back a few times to look again, according to testimony. Kwak took a photo as a memento, but no one checked on the driver or called for help, according to their testimony. Bartell’s body would not be discovered until her girlfriend, Jenna Griggs, who was on a call with her when it abruptly cut out, tracked her phone to the field, she testified. The three agreed not to talk to anyone about what happened, but Kwak, the newest to the group of friends, later told investigators that Koenig threw the rock. Karol-Chik, who said Koenig was like a \"brother\" to him, initially pointed the finger at Kwak before changing his story and blaming Koenig. Karol-Chik testified that Koenig seemed \"excited\" as they drove by Bartell’s car and at one point made a \"whoop\" sound. \"It sounded like him celebrating,\" said Karol-Chik, who admitted placing the rock next to Koenig so he could grab it and throw it. Koenig’s lawyers tried to cast doubt on the reliability of the other men’s accounts but also stressed that none of the three intended to hurt anyone. The defense declined to comment on the conviction. Kwak entered into a plea deal first, pleading guilty in May 2024 to first-degree assault. In doing so he acknowledged acting in a way that created a grave risk of death. He also pleaded guilty to second-degree assault and attempted second-degree assault for rocks that were thrown earlier in the night. He faces between 20 and 32 years in prison, according to prosecutors. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP About a week later, Karol-Chik pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and committing acrime of violence. He also pleaded guilty to attempted first-degree murder for throwing rocks at a total of nine people that night and earlier in 2023. Under his agreement, Karol-Chik could be sent to prison for between 35 and 72 years when he is sentenced Thursday, a day before Kwak. Koenig is to be sentenced June 3 and faces a mandatory life term for the murder conviction.",

    "title": "USDA threatens to halt Mexican beef imports over flesh-eating fly crisis",
    "article_text": "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins shares how she worked with President Donald Trump to bring down the cost of eggs and more for Americans on ‘Hannity.’ In a dramatic move to protect America’s cattle industry, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins haswarned Mexicothat the U.S. will halt imports of live animals — including cattle and bison — if Mexico doesn’t step up efforts to combat a dangerous pest creeping northward. In a letter sent Saturday and obtained by Fox News, Secretary Rollins put the Mexican government on notice to act immediately to fight the spread of the New World screwworm or face serious economic consequences on the border. The USDA has set a firm deadline of April 30 for Mexico to address the growing crisis, orU.S. ports of entrywill slam the door on key animal commodities. FEDERAL DIETARY GUIDELINES WILL SOON CHANGE FOR AMERICANS, HHS AND USDA ANNOUNCE \"I must inform you that if these issues are not resolved by Wednesday, April 30, USDA will restrict the importation of animal commodities, which consist of live cattle, bison, and equine originating from or transporting to Mexico to protect the interest of the agriculture industry in the United States,\" Rollins wrote. The New World screwworm, a flesh-eating fly whose larvae can decimate livestock populations, has been spreading rapidly from Central America into southern Mexico. USDA officials have long relied on a sophisticated sterile insect technique (SIT) program — using specially equipped aircraft to release sterile flies — to keep the deadly pest in check. But that strategy is now in jeopardy. MAINE'S FEDERAL FUNDING FREEZE FROM TRUMP'S USDA REVERSED Brooke Rollins attends a Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee hearing on her nomination for Secretary of Agriculture Jan. 23, in Washington, D.C.(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) At the heart of the conflict is Dynamic Aviation, a U.S. government-contracted carrier tasked with aerial fly dispersals. According to the letter, Mexican aviation authorities are limiting Dynamic’s operations to just six days a week under a temporary 60-day permit, a move the USDA says undermines the urgent, around-the-clock response needed to stop the screwworm’s advance. Even more troubling, Rollins said Mexican customs officials are imposing hefty import duties on critical supplies like sterile flies, aviation parts and dispersal equipment — all fully funded by U.S. taxpayers to benefit both nations. These delays are expensive and threatening to cripple the campaign just when speed is most vital.

Every day lost, Rollins warned, gives the screwworm a bigger foothold and risks devastating American ranchers and the broader agricultural economy. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In a bid to salvage cooperation, Rollins also proposed an emergency U.S.-Mexico summit with government leaders, technical experts and operational partners to get back on track. The message from Washington is clear: Mexico must move — and fast — or face tough new trade restrictions designed to protectAmerica’s food supplyand farming communities.

    "title": "A massive explosion at an Iranian port linked to missile fuel shipment kills 5, injures over 700",
    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. A massive explosion and fire rocked a port Saturday in southern Iran purportedly linked to a shipment of a chemical ingredient used to make missile propellant, killing eight people and injuring around 750 others. Helicopters dumped water from the air on the raging fire hours after the initial explosion, which happened at the Shahid Rajaei port just as Iran andthe U.S.met Saturday in Oman for the third round of negotiations over Tehran’s rapidly advancing nuclear program. IRAN, US BEGIN NEGOTIATIONS OVER TEHRAN'S ADVANCING NUCLEAR PROGRAM No one in Iran outright suggested that the explosion came from an attack. However, even Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who led the talks, on Wednesday acknowledged that \"our security services are on high alert given past instances of attempted sabotage and assassination operations designed to provoke a legitimate response.\" Iranian Interior Minister Eskandar Momeni gave the casualty figure in an interview on state television. But there were few details on what sparked the blaze just outside of Bandar Abbas, which burned into Saturday night, causing other containers to reportedly explode. The port took in a shipment of \"sodium perchlorate rocket fuel\" in March, the private security firm Ambrey said. The fuel is part of a shipment from China by two vessels to Iran first reported in January by the Financial Times. The fuel was going to be used to replenish Iran's missile stocks, which had been depleted by its direct attacks on Israel during the war with Hamas in theGaza Strip. In this photo provided by Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) firefighters work as black smoke rises in the sky after a massive explosion rocked a port near the southern city of Bandar Abbas, Iran, Saturday.(Mohammad Rasoul Moradi/IRNA via AP) \"The fire was reportedly the result of improper handling of a shipment of solid fuel intended for use in Iranian ballistic missiles,\" Ambrey said. Ship-tracking data analyzed by The Associated Press put one of the vessels believed to be carrying the chemical in the vicinity in March, as Ambrey said. Iran hasn't acknowledged taking the shipment. The Iranian mission to the United Nations didn't respond to a request for comment on Saturday. It's unclear why Iran wouldn't have moved the chemicals from the port, particularly after the Beirut port blast in 2020. That explosion, caused by the ignition of hundreds of tons of highly explosive ammonium nitrate, killed more than 200 people and injured more than 6,000 others. However, Israel did target Iranian missile sites where Tehran uses industrial mixers to create solid fuel. Social media footage of the explosion on Saturday at Shahid Rajaei saw reddish-hued smoke rising from the fire just before the detonation. That suggests a chemical compound being involved in the blast — like in the Beirut explosion. \"Get back get back! Tell the gas (truck) to go!\" a man in one video shouted just before the blast. \"Tell him to go, it’s going to blow up! Oh God, this is blowing up! Everybody evacuate! Get back! Get back!\" On Saturday night, the state-run IRNA news agency said that the Customs Administration of Iran blamed a \"stockpile of hazardous goods and chemical materials stored in the port area\" for the blast, without elaborating. An aerial shot released by Iranian media after the blast showed fires burning at multiple locations in the port, with authorities later warning about air pollution from chemicals such as ammonia, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide in the air. Schools in Bandar Abbas will be closed on Sunday as well. Shahid Rajaei has been a target before. A 2020 cyberattack attributed to Israel targeted the port. It came after Israel said that it thwarted a cyberattack targeting its water infrastructure, which it attributedto Iran. Israeli officials didn't respond to requests for comment regarding Saturday's explosion. Social media videos showed black billowing smoke after the blast. Others showed glass blown out of buildings kilometers, or miles, away from the epicenter of the explosion. State media footage showed the injured crowding into at least one hospital, with ambulances arriving as medics rushed one person by on a stretcher. Hasanzadeh, the provincial disaster management official, earlier told state television that the blast came from containers at Shahid Rajaei port in the city, without elaborating. State TV also reported that there had been a building collapse caused by the explosion, though no further details were offered. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Interior Ministry said that it launched an investigation into the blast. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian also offered his condolences for those affected in the blast. Shahid Rajaei port in Hormozgan province is about 650 miles southeast of Iran's capital, Tehran, on the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which 20% of all oil traded passes.",

    "article_text": "Catholic Connection radio show host Teresa Tomeo describes the emotional reaction to Pope Francis' procession moving his casket to St. Peter's Basilica. As the world pays their final respects toPope Francis, men and women everywhere, including a new generation of faithful, wait in anticipation for the College of Cardinals to convene and select a new pope. A conclave, organized by the camerlengo, presently Cardinal Kevin Ferrell, begins 15 to 20 days after the pope’s death. \"Anything could happen,\" Tim Gabrielli, associate professor and Gudorf chair inCatholicintellectual traditions at the University of Dayton in Ohio, told Fox News Digital. POPE FRANCIS REVEALED BURIAL WISHES JUST DAYS AFTER BECOMING POPE IN 2013 Pope Francis was elected the 266th pope in 2013.(Gregorio Borgia/AP) Pope Francis, the 266th pontiff, born Jorge Mario Bergoglio, died on April 21, 2025, after 12 years as the Bishop of Rome. \"We really don’t have much of an idea,\" he said of Pope Francis’ successor. \"I think anybody who says otherwise is maybe posturing.\" Among the church leaders floated as the candidates-in-waiting are Italian Cardinal Pietro Parolin, Filipino Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle, Hungarian Cardinal Peter Erdo and American Cardinal Raymond Burke. \"It's helpful to remember that the cardinal electors are going to be, conclave means with key, locked away … away from media and influences,\" Gabrielli said. THEOLOGIAN ON ‘CONCLAVE’ ACCURACY, EXPECTATIONS FOR NEXT SECRETIVE EVENT AFTER POPE FRANCIS' DEATH The College of Cardinals will convene in order to vote and select the next leader of the Catholic Church.((Photo by Riccardo De Luca/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)) \"We've got a group of people who play important roles in the church throughout the world, and they're coming together, spending time together, and this group of cardinals hasn't spent a lot of time together,\" Gabrielli added. Pope Francis created over 100 cardinals, including those from developing countries. \"Christ is to be found at the margins,\" Gabrielli said. During a conclave, cardinals vote through a secret ballot. A two-thirds majority is required forthe election. After each round of submissions, ballots are read aloud and then burned. The ashes are used to notify audiences around the world and onlookers in St. Peter’s Square of the election’s status. POPE FRANCIS EMPHASIZED CATHOLICISM GLOBALLY, REACHED BEYOND US, EUROPE INTO IMPOVERISHED NATIONS The College of Cardinals meet at the Sistine Chapel in Rome to elect the next pope.(Arturo Mari, Vatican Pool) Black smoke from the Sistine Chapel atthe Vaticanindicates a new round of voting is set to happen. White smoke signals a new leader of the Roman Catholic Church is selected. The secret process, which takes as long as needed, is vastly different from U.S. presidential, local and even mayoral elections. However, the unique election process doesn’t prevent people from drawing comparisons between the most \"papabile\" cardinals and U.S. political parties–Republicanand Democrat. \"It's very tempting to map folks into our political categories,\" Gabrielli said. \"Those just don't work very well in the Church. There are different emphases and priorities.\" \"This is a very, very different process,\" he added. The College of Cardinals elected Pope Francis in 2013 when he was 76 years old. At the time, the former pontiff was not considered one of the top cardinal contenders. Some Catholics regarded the former leader of the Church as \"non-traditional\" and often criticized his sometimes progressive approach to world leadership. POPE FRANCIS TO LIE IN STATE, MOURNERS WELCOME: WHAT TO EXPECT FROM THE PONTIFF'S FUNERAL Pope Francis was 76 years old when he was elected.(AP Photo/Andrew Medichini) During his 12-year papacy, Pope Francis’ took affinity to the expansion of equality in the Catholic Church, which included pathways for divorced Catholics and blessings for same-sex couples. \"My read is that he had certain particular processes and structures that he was very interested in setting into motion, like the work on synodality more recently,\" Gabrielli said. Pope Francis also drove conversation aroundclimate change. His emphasis on environmental protection followed suit with Pope Benedict XVI and Pope John Paul II before him. \"He was kind of picking up that momentum,\" Gabrielli said. \"There's really a thread you see happening there.\" Pope Francis died on April 21, 2025.(Andrew Medichini/AP) CLICK HERE TO GET TO THE FOX NEWS APP Presently, there are 252 living cardinals. However, only top members of the church under the age of 80 are eligible to vote. A maximum of 120 cardinal electors make up the voting college. The limit was set by Pope John Paul VI in 1975. \"I think it's possible that someone could be seen as close to Pope Francis,\" Gabrielli said of the next pope. \"I think it's possible for someone to be elected who has a different set of priorities than Pope Francis.\" Gabriele Regalbuto is a Senior Editor of SEO at Fox News Digital.

    "article_text": "Fox News senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot breaks down world reactions to the death of Pope Francis on ‘The Faulkner Focus.’ Two popes . . . Francis and John Paul II . . . their deaths separated by almost exactly twenty years. Both world-renowned figures and similar in personal approach . . . but the two were different, as well. I had the honor of covering both. The news of the death ofPope Franciscame just as I was returning to London from a long Easter weekend in the States. While Francis had been seriously ill, he also seemed to be on the mend, so his quick and quiet death at his modest apartment in the Santa Marta guesthouse caught many by surprise. A planned \"catnap\" by me at home turned into a quick dash to our UK studio. In a series of \"live shots,\" I talked about a man who seemed so familiar to all. They called him the \"People’s Pope.\" And no wonder. The first from the Americas. For 12 years a champion of the downtrodden, victims of war, hunger and poverty. Taking on big global issues like inequality and global warming. Tangling, with degrees of success, with issues inside the Roman Catholic Church like sex abuse and the roles of women and gays. All with a personal, humble and humorous touch. FOX NEWS TO AIR SPECIAL LIVE COVERAGE OF POPE FRANCIS' FUNERAL ON SATURDAY A follower holds a portrait of the late Pope Francis at the Basílica de San José de Flores, where he worshipped as a youth, following the Vatican's announcement of his death in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Monday, April 21, 2025.(Gustavo Garello/AP) And at the same time, in my mind, there were memories of the passing of Pope John Paul II. I was there in Vatican City on a chilly night in April 2005, reporting with the Fox News team. The pope was literally on his deathbed in his Apostolic Palace apartment overlooking St. Peter’s Square, where tens of thousands had gathered in a mass vigil. And then the lights went out. Fox News Correspondent Greg Palkot reporting on the passing of Pope John Paul II at Vatican City, April 2005(Fox News) We detailed, too, that night, the life of this man who had captured the spirit of the world. A strong voice for freedom and democracy. Who had played a big role in bringing down communism in his homeland of Poland and elsewhere.John Paul IItried to bring the world together as he kept church rulings in line. I had covered him for 26 years, starting as a \"cub\" producer at his conclave in 1978. Greg Palkot, left, producing for WABC News during the conclave for John Paul II at Vatican City, October 1978.(Courtesy Greg Palkot) After both deaths, the same words were used by Vatican officials to describe the \"trip\" the Popes took on those fateful days: \"He has returned to the house of his father.\" The passing of a pope is just the beginning of a lengthy process when the Vatican turns over the keys to the church of 1.3 billion global followers to a new leader. A massive ceremony-laden funeral is then followed by the drama of the selection of a new pope, the conclave with its black smoke for no decision . . . white smoke for a new Pope. And then their inauguration. The cardinals who gathered in the wake of the passing of John Paul II chosePope Benedict XVIa more conservative and more elderly leader than they’d picked before. He would only serve for eight years. His resignation (he died in 2022) paved the way for another conclave, which chose the Argentinian Pope Francis. POPE FRANCIS REVEALED BURIAL WISHES JUST DAYS AFTER BECOMING POPE IN 2013 Fox News' Greg Palkot reported on both Pope Francis and Pope John Paul II.(Pope Francis AP Photo/Alessandra Tarantino | John Paul II: Getty Images) Both John Paul II and Francis were thought to be long-shot outsiders. Speculation is now building about the choice to be made in the upcoming papal \"election.\" Will it return the papacy to Italian dominance or spread its reach to a new country and continent? Will the new pope revive a more conservative approach to the church or stay in the modern spirit of Francis? The coming days will tell. Many of us carry our own reminders of those who have passed. In my case, literally. In 2005, a Vatican insider gave me rosary beads blessed by John Paul II. I’ve kept them with me on all my sometimes-rough travels since. From Afghanistan and Iraq . . . to the Mideast and Ukraine. Rosary beads blessed by Pope John Paul II, carried by Greg Palkot on his travels.(Greg Palkot) I also keep with me the memory of my late mother. She was a big fan of the Polish pontiff. She died of Lou Gehrig’s disease, or ALS, which ravages the body. Similar to some of the effects of Parkinson’s disease that contributed to John Paul II’s death. Born of humble stock, I know Mom would also have liked the simple faith ofPope Francis. And how he passed. There are some who say he held off his \"departure\" until the Monday after the events of Easter, so as not to spoil that most holy day in the Roman Catholic calendar. CLICK HERE TO GET TO THE FOX NEWS APP Just like some in my family think, my mother held off her passing until the day after my April birthday. Considerate of others to the end. Rest in Peace Francis.  Although I’m sure you’ll have a lot of catching up to do with all your friends \"upstairs\"!

Before he returned to office, Trump warned Hamas there would be \"hell to pay\" if the hostages were not released. In February, when Netanyahu visited the White House, Trump suggested that the U.S. take over the Strip and turn it into a \"riviera.\" A few days after Netanyahu’s visit to the White House, Trump said Israel should \"let all hell break out\" if Hamas failed to release all remaining hostages by the U.S. president’s noon deadline. Hamas did not free the hostages, but Israel held off on resuming the war until March 18. Before ground operations restarted, 33 hostages were freed.

While Trump is seemingly pushing Netanyahu to change his approach to Gaza, Israel has said it would not let aid enter the Strip until the remaining hostages are released. There is concern and frustration in Israel over allegations that aid has gone to Hamas terrorists instead of the people of Gaza. In November 2024, the Associated Press reported that prices in Gaza skyrocketed after nearly 100 trucks of food and humanitarian aid were looted by armed men.

    "article_text": "Fox News anchor Sandra Smith has the latest on the Catholic leader's medical condition on 'America Reports.' Pope Francis, 88, was recently diagnosed with bilateral pneumonia, and as concerned Catholics around the world pray for the Holy Father, the Vatican revealed last week that he will remain hospitalized for treatment. The popes of the last 100 years have seen their fair share of political divides and controversy, from pontiffs breaking centuries-old practices to backlash over the Vatican's response to Hilter's regime to the teachings of God's love and grace and traveling the world to reach the sick and lonely; Before Pope Francis was elected by the College of Cardinals in 2013, Pope Benedict XVI, born Joseph Ratzinger, led theCatholic Churchfrom 2005-2013. POPE FRANCIS GOT OUT OF BED TO EAT BREAKFAST ON 7TH DAY IN HOSPITAL: VATICAN Pope John Paul II, Pope Francis and Pope Benedict XVI(Getty Images) Ratzinger was born inBavaria, Germany. Upon witnessing horrific acts during the Nazi regime, he desired to commit to the church at a young age. Ratzinger and his family experienced abuse and punishment at the hands of the Nazi Party. Despite his resolute disdain for the regime, at 14 years old he was required by law to join the Hitler Youth, a paramilitary organization. During his enrollment in the seminary, Ratzinger was drafted into World War II, putting his theological teachings on hold. He was captured and held as a prisoner of war by Americans for several months. Upon his release, he left the military and was ordained in 1951 alongside his brother. Ratzinger was elected pope in 2005 and, during his papacy he preached a message of God's eternal love, encouraged Catholics to remain faithful to God, and implored the presence of love, joy and truth in life. Citing health concerns, Benedict, in 2013, was the first pontiff to resign the papacy in 600 years. He died at 95 years old in 2022.

He was the first Polish pontiff. Wojtyła took the regnal name after his predecessor, Pope John Paul I, who passed away only a month into his reign as the sovereign of Vatican City. Wojtyła's election by the College of Cardinals marked the first time a non-Italian would serve as pope in over 400 years. At 58 years old, Wojtyła was one of the youngest popes in history. Wojtyla studied theology in Rome and served as the archbishop of Krakow. Through his 26-year pontificate, John Paul II traveled to 129 countries, becoming the most traveled pope in history. POPE FRANCIS DIAGNOSED WITH BILATERAL PNEUMONIA, VATICAN SAYS Pope John Paul II was the first Polish pope in history.(Chuck Fishman/Getty Images) During his papacy, John Paul II preached service, the responsibility for peace and the protection of life. In 1981, a lone gunman, Mehmet Ali Ağca, attempted to assassinate the pope in St. Peter's Square inVatican City. He was struck twice while riding in an open car and seriously wounded. He was rushed to Gemelli Hospital in Rome and treated for his injuries. John Paul II later visited Ağca in prison and forgave the shooter in person. In 2005, John Paul died in his apartment in the Vatican at 84 years old. He was canonized as a saint in 2014. Pope John Paul I, born Albino Luciani, was elected as pope on Aug. 26, 1978. His reign as the sovereign of Vatican City was brief, as he died 33 days later. He was ordained in 1935, appointed bishop in 1958 and created archbishop of Venice in 1969. He is often referred to as \"the Smiling Pope.\" Pope Paul VI was born Giovanni Battista Montini inBrescia, Italy. He was elected as pontiff in 1963 after being appointed archbishop of Milan. During his papacy, Montini concluded three sessions of the Second Vatican Council, a significant renewal of the Catholic Church. The official documents marked a milestone in the church and condemned antisemitism.

In 2018, Pope Paul VI was canonized as a saint. He was recognized as a strong leader, and his efforts to build stronger bonds among other religions are cited as just one of the reasons for his canonization. Pope Paul VI died in 1978 at 80 years old. Pope John XXIII, born Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli, was born into a family of 13 children in Sotto il Monte, Italy. In 1892, Roncalli entered the seminary.

Pope John XXIII died of cancer in 1963 and was canonized as a saint along with John Paul II in 2014. Pope Pius XII, born Eugenio Pacelli, was an Italian cardinal before being elected pope on his 63rd birthday in 1939. Pope Pius XI named Pacelli a cardinal after a one-day conclave among the College of Cardinals in 1929. Pacelli was pope during World War II and throughthe Holocaust. Correspondence from Vatican archives shows Pacelli received word of the atrocities happening against Jewish people in Germany, and he often received pleas to help Jews.

His funeral took place in St. Peter's Square and around 50,000 people were in attendance.(AP Photo/Ben Curtis) Pope Pius XIIhas been intensely criticized for what has been called his lack of support for Jews during World War II, but the Vatican has remained steadfast in his defense.

    "title": "Church expert predicts election of next pope will feature ‘most diverse’ conclave in Church history",
    "article_text": "Fox News correspondent Alex Hogan has the latest on tributes to Pope Francis following his death on 'Special Report.' Pope Francis’ emphasis on reaching out to the \"peripheries\" of theCatholic Churchand world will result in the most diverse collection of church leaders in history gathering to select the new pope. According to Mary FioRito, an expert on papal elections and a senior fellow at the Catholic Association, this could very well result in the next pope having a very different set of priorities than thelate pontiff. Francis has selected about 80% of the 135 church leaders – called cardinals – who will vote for the next pope in the upcoming papal conclave. The result will be that instead of being dominated by European or even Western cardinals, the conclave will have large contingents from regions like Africa and Asia. WHAT IS THE PAPAL CONCLAVE: INSIDE THE ANCIENT PROCESS OF CHOOSING THE NEXT POPE A person holds a portrait of late Pope Francis at the Basílica de San José de Flores, where he worshipped as a youth, following the Vatican's announcement of his death, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Monday, April 21, 2025.(Gustavo Garello/AP) \"This will be the most diverse conclave in the history of the church,\" FioRito said. But this diversity could spell a departure from some of the defining focuses of Francis’ pontificate, such as his emphasis on\"synodality,\"that is, gatherings of small groups from around the world to discuss questions of theology and church practice. FioRito sees this next conclave, which she said will likely begin May 5, as a question of whether the next pope will be a man who continues Francis’ legacy or shifts the church’s focus to problems like persecution and poverty, which are major issues in countries like Nigeria, Pakistan and India. In Nigeria alone, where about half of the population is Christian, 3,100 Christians were killed and 2,830 were kidnapped in 2024, according a report by international religious freedom watchdogOpen Doors.

She explained that the African church has a very different set of priorities, which have been shaped in large part by the realities of rapid growth coupled with intense persecution. \"We're concerned about things like climate change, and they're concerned about not being locked in a church and set on fire,\" she explained. \"They're not sitting around at these tables for 10 discussing great ideas. They just want to make sure their kid gets to school without getting shot and they can pay their rent this month.\" With that will come a desire to select a pope who will respect the African church as an equal and who will stand against\"ideological colonization\"from the West with concepts like climate change, abortion and gender ideology. TRUMP, WORLD LEADERS REACT TO THE DEATH OF POPE FRANCIS Ghanaian Cardinal Peter Kodwo Appiah Turkson waits to exchange Christmas greetings with Pope Francis at the Clementina Hall on Dec. 21, 2013, in Vatican City.(Franco Origlia/Vatican Pool/Getty Images) \"The cardinals in Africa are very sensitive to this kind of ideological colonization where they're not being colonized in the traditional way, but the ideas of the West are coming in and attempting to change African culture with Western ideas without listening to the people first,\" she said. With this in mind, FioRito pointed to Hungarian Cardinal Péter Erdő, who at 71 is young enough to be selected and is seen by many as a \"John Paul II-type personality.\" He is respected by both the Pope Francis synodality camps as well as the African bishops. Another candidate, FioRito said, who could possibly \"bridge the gap\" between the different worlds is American-born Cardinal Robert Prevost, who currently serves as the president of the Pontifical Commission for Latin America.

    "article_text": "Fox News correspondent Chanley Painter reports on growing concerns from lawmakers and travelers as the deadline to use REAL ID-compliant licenses for air travel gets closer. It's virtually illegal to make a left turn in many parts ofNew Jersey, and bipartisan lawmakers there are outraged at how equally difficult it is to make a REAL ID appointment as of late. \"We’ve known for years that this deadline was coming,\" state Assemblymember Nancy Muñoz, R-Union, told Fox News Digital on Friday. \"There’s no excuse for the Motor Vehicle Commission to be this unprepared. Constituents are waking up early, refreshing their screens, only to watch appointments vanish in seconds,\" Muñoz, the Budget Committee’s minority leader, said. \"Some are driving over an hour just to find an available slot: It’s outrageous.\" REAL ID SEES NATIONWIDE STATE GOVERNMENT COMPLIANCE AHEAD OF THE DEADLINE BUT IT WASN'T ALWAYS THAT WAY A sign outlining the documentation necessary to get a REAL ID hangs in a Department of Motor Vehicles office.(Getty Images) New Jersey, like all states and territories, is fully legally compliant with the Department of Homeland Security’s new standards, which require a driver’s license to have a star affixed to a corner to confirm the holder has provided additional identifying documentation in order to board a domestic flight. But the Garden State ranked last out of 49 states that responded to aCBS Newssurvey on the percentage of residents who have actually obtained REAL IDs. Assembly Majority Leader Lou Greenwald, D-Cherry Hill, told Fox News Digital he understands residents’ concerns and panic, noting the deadline has been pushed back several times since President George W. Bush signed the law in 2005. \"Now we’re heading into summer, folks have travel plans, and they’re being told they’ll have to wait months just to get an appointment,\" Greenwald said. NO 'REAL ID' APPOINTMENTS OPEN IN NEW JERSEY AS RESIDENTS SOUND OFF: ‘GET WITH THE TIMES, NJ' REAL ID is set to go into effect soon.(Getty Images) \"There’s no reason in the 21st century that we should still be relying solely on in-person appointments, which are time-intensive, often require residents to take off work or travel long distances, and where a single forgotten document means starting the process all over again.\" Greenwald said New Jersey’s appointments system is more troublesome than other states like neighboring Pennsylvania, which allows residents to apply for REAL IDs online, and which he called a \"common sense\" tweak that’s not prohibited by the feds. In that regard, Greenwald said he will introduce a bill in Trenton to direct the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission (MVC) to begin online processing ofREAL ID applicationsto help fix the backlog and other issues. \"[That way,] New Jerseyans can obtain their REAL IDs easily and conveniently, without unnecessary delays,\" he said. A source familiar with New Jersey’s REAL ID rollout told Fox News Digital that because it is one of a handful of states where illegal immigrants can get \"status-neutral\" licenses, its low personal compliance proportion differs from states where only citizens can get drivers' licenses — so there is a baseline percentage of drivers who cannot get a REAL ID to start with. Only green-card holders and U.S. citizens can get a REAL ID. Passports also remain acceptable for travel for people without a REAL ID. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Newark is the largest city in New Jersey.(Getty Images) The MVC has noted it holds weekly \"REAL ID Thursdays\" — where only REAL ID applications are processed, not learner's permits or renewals — and employees are also required to work two weekends per month to better serve the public. Nonetheless, Muñoz said the state has had enough time to plan for the rush of New Jerseyans who need one. When reached for comment, Gov. Phil Murphy’s office directed Fox News Digital to the MVC. An agency spokesperson said the MVC has been working \"nonstop\" to help as many residents as possible. \"Our challenges are not unique to New Jersey — every state in the nation is facing similar pressures as the deadline approaches,\" the spokesperson said. \"Our state has made REAL IDs available for the past five and a half years — since September 2019. We are currently issuing approximately 23,000 REAL IDs per week and remain focused on delivering efficient service and to ensure that every eligible New Jerseyan can secure one.\" Charles Creitz is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

Shortly before Trump was sworn into office, Biden’s FDAproposed a rulethat it described at the time as \"bold\" that \"would make cigarettes and certain other combusted tobacco products minimally or nonaddictive by limiting the level of nicotine in those products.\" Cigarettes and \"certain other combusted tobacco products\" would not be allowed to have more than 0.7 milligrams of nicotine per gram of tobacco under the proposed rule,according to the FDA. The agency said that lower nicotine levels would \"be low enough to no longer create or sustain addiction.\" While the FDA insisted at the time that the rule \"would not ban\" cigarettes, critics disagree and are optimistic that Trump will continue his push for nicotine freedom and upend the rule.

And the Prime Minister's helping us.\" \"He wants it to be fast, too,\" he said. \"And I think everybody in this, at this time in NATO, they want to see this thing happen.\" The White House did not provide comment to Fox News Digital regarding details of the deadline. Trump’s team has signaled optimism about a deal this week, and Vice PresidentJD Vancedisclosed on Wednesday that a proposal is on the table. However, he said that time is limited and if neither party agrees, the U.S. will withdraw itself from advancing those discussions. The deal would require both Russia and Ukraine to give up some of their territory, but that the lines would remain \"close to where they are today,\" according to Vance. Here’s what also happened this week in the Trump administration: The White Housewent to bat for Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, who has come under additional scrutiny following a New York Times report that Hegseth shared information about a March military airstrike against the Houthis in a Signal messaging app group chat that also included his wife, brother and personal lawyer. In March, the Atlantic reported about an initial Signal group chat that included Hegseth and Vance to discuss the same attack on the Houthis. In that chat, Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg was accidently included. HEGSETH FACES LATEST BATTLE DEFENDING HIS SECRETARY OF DEFENSE POST AT THE PENTAGON The White House has made it clear it stands by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth.(Getty imges) The most recent incident has prompted lawmakers to call for Hegseth’s resignation, even though Hegseth maintains no war plans were disclosed in the chats. Despite a report from NPR that said the White House was considering finding a new secretary of defense amid the controversy, the Trump administration has voiced support for Hegseth this week. \"He is bringing monumental change to the Pentagon, and there's a lot of people in the city who reject monumental change, and I think, frankly, that's why we've seen a smear campaign against the Secretary of Defense since the moment that President Trump announced his nomination before the United States Senate,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Tuesday. \"Let me reiterate: The president stands strongly behind Secretary Hegseth and the change that he is bringing to the Pentagon, and the results that he's achieved thus far speak for themselves,\" Leavitt said. Trump and first lady Melania Trump departed Washington Friday morning to attend Pope Francis’ funeral in Rome Saturday. The Vatican announced that Pope Francis died Monday at the Vatican’s Casa Santa Marta. \"Rest in Peace Pope Francis!\" Trump said in a Monday post on Truth Social. \"May God Bless him and all who loved him!\" POPE FRANCIS AND US PRESIDENTS: A LOOK BACK AT HIS LEGACY WITH THE NATION'S LEADERS Pope Francis receives U.S. Vice President JD Vance, left, before bestowing the Urbi et Orbi (Latin for to the city and to the world) blessing at the end of the Easter mass presided over by Cardinal Angelo Comastri in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican Sunday, April 20, 2025. At center the head of the papal household Bishop Leonardo Sapienza.(Vatican Media via AP) The pope’s death came a day after Vance, who converted to Catholicism in 2019, met with him in one of the reception rooms of the Vatican hotel just hours before his death. Additionally, Trump signed an executive order Monday ordering all U.S. flags be flown at half-staff on all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels to remember Francis. The order also applies to all U.S. embassies, legations, consular offices and other facilities abroad, including military facilities and naval vessels and stations. Former PresidentJoe Bidenand his wife, Jill, are also planning to attend the Rome funeral. Trump also signed seven executive orders pertaining to education, including several that would incorporate artificial intelligence into K-12 school curricula, modify school discipline and accreditation guidelines, and update requirements for the disclosure of foreign funding to schools. Meanwhile, Trump’s Education Department also announced Monday it would resume collections on defaulted federal student loans in May for the first time since 2020.

But Trump administration officials are concerned that the pause has led the federal student loan portfolio to be \"headed toward a fiscal cliff if we don't start repayment in collections,\" according to a senior department official. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"The result has been that the federal government student loan portfolio has continued to grow, and we've got a record number of borrowers that are at risk of or in delinquency and default,\" the senior department official told reporters Monday.

    "article_text": "Fox News host Jesse Watters explains why companies now want to be associated with President-elect Donald Trump and 'kiss the ring' in his opening monologue. PresidentDonald Trumprecently hyped a new national poll which indicates an increasing percentage of Republicans now identify as MAGA supporters. The president, in a social media post, pointed to what he said was \"tremendous support\" for MAGA, which is the acronym for Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" movement. \"I am not, at all, surprised!!!\" Trump wrote, days ahead of the 100-days milestone. The poll indicated that 71%of Republicansnow identify as MAGA supporters, up from 55% in November. CLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLING President Donald Trump on the South Lawn of the White House before boarding Marine One, on Feb. 28, 2025.(Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images) The NBC News survey is the latest piece of evidence of Trump's extremely firm grip over the GOP, and his remaking of the Republican Party in his image, a transformation that started with the president's initial White House victory in 20216. While the president repeatedly teases the possibility of running for re-election in 2028, the reality is that serving a third term is clearlyprohibited by the Constitutionunder the 22nd Amendment. So what happens to Trump's MAGA movement and America First agenda after he departs the White House? \"The Republican Party will never go back to what it was. The old Republican Party of [former longtime Senate GOP leader]Mitch McConnellrun by Washington elites died forever in 2024,\" longtime Republican consultant Alex Castellanos told Fox News Digital. SCOOP: REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE SHOWCASES RECORD FUNDRAISING AS PARTY BUILDS 2026 WAR CHEST Castellanos, a veteran of numerous GOP presidential campaigns, emphasized that \"the Republican Party of Donald Trump is alive and growing out in America.\" And he made the case that \"what happened in 2024 is that what was a man became a movement.\" Former President Donald Trump arrives at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on July 18, 2024.(Reuters/Cheney Orr) David Kochul, another longtime Republican strategist with plenty of experience on the presidential campaign trail, concurred that \"we’re not going back to what the party looked like in 2012. That’s for sure. We’re going forward to something new and different.\" Even a vocal Republican critic of Trump agrees. Former congressman and former two-term Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who launched an unsuccessful 2024 Republican presidential nomination bid, acknowledged that \"those who want the GOP to go a different direction from the MAGA leadership of President Trump are now fighting an uphill battle.\" \"Trump has found his stride with his anti-immigrant message and it is overshadowing the chaos from his super-charged tariff war and its impact on the economy,\" Hutchinson told Fox News Digital. Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who ran for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, is interviewed by Fox News Digital at the Democratic National Convention, on Aug. 21, 2024, in Chicago.(Fox News - Paul Steinhauser) Whoever succeeds Trump as GOP standardbearer – be it heir apparentVice President JD Vanceor someone else – won't be Trump. \"Trump is such a unique actor and figure. He can’t be replicated,\" Kochul stressed. \"Nobody can be the next Donald Trump. That’s not possible. He’s singular.\" But his movement will have some staying power. \"Just likethe Reagan Revolution, Trump’s legacy and messaging will prevail beyond his last day in office,\" Dave Carney, another longtime Republican consultant and presidential campaign trail veteran, told Fox News. But Carney argued that Trump's legacy may \"wane over years unless the next Republican president continues it.\" TRUMP, MUSK FACE BLAME FOR SETBACKS, BUT ARE WISCONSIN, FLORIDA ELECTIONS CRYSTAL BALL FOR 2026 MIDTERMS? \"Is it going to be as hot and heavy as it is now without his personality? Carney asked. Answering his own question, he said, \"No. You need to have a messenger to carry that theme.\" But Castellanos noted that Trump has \"spawned a new younger generation of MAGA leaders who will carry on the MAGA movement long after Trump.\" Pointing to Vance and others, Castellanos described \"a fresh generation of MAGA.\" \"The players on the MAGA farm team are now playing major league ball,\" he said. Kochul, looking to the future of the GOP, said that \"it will be more populist, whomever emerges.\" And as for those future leaders, he suggested that \"we’ve got a lot of great leadership and a great bench.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Hutchinson, a former U.S. attorney under Ronald Reagan and high-ranking official inGeorge W. Bush's administration, also weighed in on the future of Trump's MAGA movement. \"Whether Trump’s dominance continues beyond the next few years depends upon the tolerance level of the GOP base on Trump’s view that ‘he is the law’ rather than respecting the separation of powers that have served our country well,\" Hutchinson said.",

    "title": "2028 auditions for Democratic presidential nomination kick off as blue-state governor visits key early state",
    "article_text": "Gov. J.B. Pritzker, D-Ill., gives his take on President Donald Trump’s tariff strategy and more on ‘Fox News Sunday.’ It's 2025, but it's starting to feel a little bit like 2028 in New Hampshire, the state that traditionally holds the first presidential primary in the race for the White House. That's because IllinoisGov. JB Pritzker, the billionaire two-term Democrat from the solidly blue Midwestern state, is coming to New Hampshire this weekend to headline the state party's largest annual fundraising gala. Pritzker, who has become one of his party’s most vocal critics of the sweeping and controversial moves by PresidentDonald Trumpduring the first three months of his second tour in the White House, is seen as a potential contender for the Democrats' 2028 presidential nomination. And trips to New Hampshire — which for over a century has held the first primary in the race for the White House — are seen as an early indicator of a politician’s interest in running for the presidency in the next election. HERE ARE THE DEMOCRATS WHO MAY EVENTUALLY RUN FOR THE WHITE HOUSE IN 2028 Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker is interviewed by Fox News Digital at a New Hampshire delegation breakfast at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on Aug. 22, 2024.(Paul Steinhauser) \"We’ve got to be ready for the fight,\" Pritzker said when asked by Fox News Digital what his message will be when he delivers the keynote address at the New HampshireDemocratic Party'sannual McIntyre-Shaheen 100 Club dinner. The governor, a member of the Pritzker family that owns the Hyatt hotel chain and who has started several of his own venture capital and investment startups, argued that the nation is \"in a constitutional crisis\" and that \"we have too many people who are ill affected by the policies of the Trump administration.\" \"This is the moment for people to stand up and fight,\" he added. Pritzker, 60, is the first potential Democratic presidential hopeful to visitNew Hampshire, or any other early primary state, since Democrats lost the White House and their Senate majority and failed to retake the House in November. And Trump and Republicans down-ballot made gains with key parts of the Democrats’ base, including with Black, Hispanic and younger voters. HEATING UP: PRESEASON MOVES IN 2028 PRESIDENTIAL RACE GETTING UNDERWAY In the wake of those setbacks, Democrats have experienced increased intra-party tensions with an angry and energized base itching to fight back against Trump. That anger is directed not only at Trump and Republicans, but also at Democrats, with many in the party's base upset that leaders haven't been effective or vocal enough in pushing back against the president. It’s also led to reflection about what the Democratic Party stands for and its direction moving forward amid flagging favorable ratings in national polling. Two-term CaliforniaGov. Gavin Newsom,another high-profile Democrat who likely also has national ambitions in 2028, said earlier this week in an interview with \"The Hill\" that he wasn’t sure what the party truly represents. \"I don’t know what the party is,\" Newsom said. \"I’m still struggling with that.\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who was a top surrogate for Democrats during the 2024 presidential election, speaks with voters during a stop at a highway rest area in Hooksett, New Hampshire, on July 8, 2024.(Fox News - Paul Steinhauser) Asked if he's also struggling, Pritzker responded, \"I've been clear my whole life. The Democratic Party stands up for working people. Stands up for working families. We're the party of civil rights. We're the party of human rights. No doubt about that, in my mind.\" Pritzker, who is not prevented by term limits from running for re-election in 2026, has yet to say if he’ll make a bid for a third term steering Illinois. But the clock is ticking, with the filing period opening up later this year and the state’s primary just 11 months away. HEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS REPORTING AND OPINION ON JB PRITZKER \"Given the circumstances of getting on the ballot for people, I would need to make a decision and announce it by, you know, by latest July,\" Pritzker said when asked about his timetable for making a decision. But it’s a possible presidential run by Pritzker that is grabbing headlines. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker says he will decide by July on whether he will seek re-election in 2026.(Brian Cassella/Chicago Tribune via AP, Pool) Chicagoan Bill Daley, who served as former PresidentBillClinton’scommerce secretary and former President Barack Obama’s chief of staff, told The Wall Street Journal last week that \"there is no doubt that he [Pritzker] is going to run.\" Pritzker, asked about Daley's prediction, said, \"I’d guess I'd remind you that he didn't support me when I ran for governor the first time… I don't know where he gets his information.\" And on the possibility of launching a national campaign in the 2028 election cycle, Pritzker said, \"All I can tell you is, I'm focused on the question of whether I will run for re-election as governor, and on defeating the policies of Donald Trump.\" DEMOCRATS' VICE CHAIR GETS ULTIMATUM: STAY NEUTRAL IN PRIMARIES OR STEP DOWN The governor is no stranger to New Hampshire. He headlined the 2022 New Hampshire Democratic Party convention, and he returned last September to campaign on behalf of then-Vice President Kamala Harris, who replaced then-President Joe Biden as the party's presidential nominee in July. Pritzker made multiple stops, including addressing union members at the New Hampshire AFL-CIO’s annual Labor Day breakfast. Pritzker was among those vetted by the Harris presidential campaign as a possible running mate. The governor, who led a successful effort to host the 2024 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, was also among the potential 2028 White House contenders to speak during the convention week at the New Hampshire Democratic Party delegation's daily breakfasts. A sign outside the state capital building in Concord, New Hampshire, spotlights the state's treasured position for the past century in holding the lead-off presidential primary.(Fox News - Paul Steinhauser) Veteran New Hampshire-based Democratic consultant Jim Demers noted that \"for many New Hampshire Democrats, his [Pritzker’s] visit is an early audition for 2028.\" \"It comes at a time when voters are really looking for leadership, someone who will challenge what Donald Trump is doing. So, what he says will be weighed very heavily,\" he added. Demers, pointing to Pritzker’s handful of trips to the Granite State over the past couple of years, said that \"every time he has visited with New Hampshire voters, he has delivered a message that has resonated very well.\" Neil Levesque, the longtime director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College, said that \"Pritzker is coming into a highly political state at an opportune time because of how fired up and charged up Democrats are in opposition to President Trump.\" And he noted that the stop \"will kick off the first of multiple visits by multiple potential candidates, considering that Democrats are hungry for an opposition.\" While Pritzker’s visit is the first as the very early moves in the 2028 White House race get underway, behind the scenes there’s already action. AGranite State-based Democratic strategist who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely shared that activists in New Hampshire are receiving fundraising emails on a regular basis from some of the potential candidates for 2028. \"Every week I receive a dozen,\" the strategist said, adding that the messages are signed by Pritzker, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Rep. Ro Khanna of California and other potential 2028 contenders. The strategist said the possible White House hopefuls are \"driving messaging and their names through this constant barrage of emails.\" While the stop by Pritzker may seem very early, it's actually occurring later in the calendar than the first stop in an early-voting state in the 2024 presidential election cycle. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo speaks at a breakfast hosted by the Westside Conservative Club in Urbandale, Iowa, on March 26, 2021. Mike Pompeo, the former congressman from Kansas who later served as CIA director and then Secretary of State in Trump's first administration, spoke in Iowa in late March 2021.

    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. The Kennedy Center has canceled a week’s worth of events celebrating LGBTQ+ people for the World Pride festival inWashington, D.C., amid a change in focus and the Trump administration firing the center's leadership. Multiple artists and producers involved in the center’s Tapestry of Pride schedule said their events had been quietly canceled or transferred to other venues. The Tapestry of Pride was planned for June 5 to 8 before the cancellation. Washington’s Capital Pride Alliance disassociated itself from the Kennedy Center in response to the canceled events. \"We are a resilient community, and we have found other avenues to celebrate,\" the alliance's deputy director June Crenshaw told The Associated Press. \"We are finding another path to the celebration … but the fact that we have to maneuver in this way is disappointing.\" TRUMP FIRES KENNEDY CENTER BOARD MEMBERS CITING DRAG SHOWS, APPOINTS HIMSELF CHAIRMAN The Kennedy Center has canceled a week’s worth of events celebrating LGBTQ+ people for the World Pride festival in Washington, D.C.(Getty Images) The Kennedy Center’s website still has a section for Tapestry of Pride with a general description and a link to the World Pride site. No other information is provided on the website. The cancellations come in the wake of massive changes at the Kennedy Center, including PresidentDonald Trumpfiring both the president and chairman in early February. Trump replaced most of the board with loyalists, who subsequently elected him the new chairman of the institution. The World Pride event is held every two years and this year's event runs from May 17 through June 8 with performances and celebrations planned across the nation's capital. But concerns arose about what kind of reception attendees will receive due to Trump administration policies targeting transgender people and comments about Kennedy Center drag performances. \"I know that D.C. as a community will be very excited to be hosting World Pride, but I know the community is a little bit different than the government,\" said Michael Roest, founder and director of the International Pride Orchestra, which had its June 5 performance at the Kennedy Center canceled just days after Trump’s took control of the institution. Roest told The Associated Press he was in the final stages of planning the performance at the center. He was waiting on a final contract when Trump revealed on Feb. 7 the leadership changes and his plans to amend the institution's programming. The center then became unresponsive, he said. Multiple artists and producers involved in the center’s Tapestry of Pride schedule said their events had been quietly canceled or transferred to other venues.(AP) On Feb. 12, Roest said he received a one-sentence email from a Kennedy Center staffer saying that they \"are no longer able to advance your contract at this time.\" \"They went from very eager to host to nothing,\" he told The Associated Press. \"We have not since heard a word from anybody at the Kennedy Center, but that’s not going to stop us.\" After the cancellation, Roest said he was able to move the International Pride Orchestra performance to the Strathmore theater in nearby Bethesda, Maryland. Roest said he was never given an explanation for why the performance was canceled so late in the planning stages. He said his orchestra would no longer consider performing at the Kennedy Center and that most queer artists would likely make the same choice. \"There would need to be a very, very public statement of inclusivity from the administration, from that board, for us to consider that,\" he said. \"Otherwise it is a hostile performance space.\" Crenshaw said some other events, including a drag story time and a display of parts of the AIDS Memorial Quilt, would be transferred to the World Pride welcome center in Chinatown.

She said she viewed the institution as her \"home base\" and \"a safe space for the queer community.\" She also said she was disappointed to lose the partnership she had with the Kennedy Center. \"We’re doing our community a disservice — not just the queer community but the entire community,\" she told The Associated Press. She said she was still finalizing the details of her event, which she said was \"meant to be family-friendly, just like the drag brunch was family-friendly and classy and sophisticated.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

In a letter to all governors, Chavez-DeRemer urged them to comply withPresident Donald Trump's directives to ensure that tax dollars aren't used to benefit those in the U.S. illegally. \"Our nation’s unemployment benefits exist solely for workers who are eligible to receive them,\" Chavez-DeRemer wrote. \"To qualify for unemployment, one must be able and available to work, actively seeking work and be legally authorized to accept employment in the United States.

EXPERIMENTAL WOMEN'S CANCER DRUG BOOSTS SURVIVAL RATES IN NOTABLE STUDY There were about six weeks between the discovery of the lump and the biopsy, she recalled. In the time between discovery of the lump and Bortner's diagnosis, Mochi became fixated on his owner's right breast, she said.(Breanna Bortner) During this time, Bortner's cockapoo, Mochi, became fixated on the breast with the lump. The behavior came as a surprise to Bortner, who said the dog had never behaved that way before. \"Even when I had been sick in the past or dealt with other things, he had never done that, so that was the first time that I really noticed how in tune he was to my body,\" she said. COMMON CANCER TREATMENT CAN HAVE THIS PAINFUL SIDE EFFECT The results of the biopsy soon confirmed that Bortner hadbreast cancer— but she said she already knew, courtesy of Mochi. \"I was like, oh my gosh, he’s known this whole time. Before I knew and the doctors knew.\" \"I was like, oh my gosh, he’s known this whole time,\" said Bortner of her cockatoo, Mochi, who seemed to detect her cancer.(Breanna Bortner) Doctors diagnosed Bortner with stage 2B triple-negative invasive ductal carcinoma, a type of breast cancer that has fewer treatment options than other types of invasive breast cancer, according to the American Cancer Society. DISABLED VETERAN LEANS ON SUPERHERO DOG WITH 'BATMAN' MARKINGS FOR SUPPORT, COMPANIONSHIP This is because thesecancer cellsdo not have certain receptors that allow them to be treated with hormone therapy. \"If the cancer has not spread to distant sites,surgery is an option. Chemotherapy might be given first to shrink a large tumor, followed by surgery,\" reads the ACS website. \"Everything about [chemotherapy drugs] is scary,\" says Bortner, who decided to refer to them instead as \"healing sessions.\"(Breanna Bortner) After doctors confirmed the cancer, Bortner said the process moved very quickly. She underwent five-and-a-half months of chemotherapy (16 rounds total). \"Chemotherapy is a very scary, daunting word,\" she said. \"Everything about [chemotherapy drugs] is scary. I found that calling them ‘healing sessions’ instead of chemotherapy was better for me.\" Part of Bortner's motivation to keep going was that she didn't want Mochi to lose his \"human mom,\" she shared.(Breanna Bortner) Bortner said that Mochi, who she calls her \"soul dog,\" continued to be a source of comfort — and a reason to keep going in those dark days. \"At the time, he was only 2 years old,\" she said.

You shouldn't be the one having to lose yourhuman mom.’\" Tasks as mundane as feeding the dog or taking him on a walk helped Bortner get off the couch and keep going. Mochi adapted to Bortner's new lifestyle during her recovery, keeping pace on slower, shorter walks.(Breanna Bortner) Mochi learned to adapt to Bortner's new lifestyleduring recovery, as their walks were slower and shorter. When Bortner would nap for long periods or sometimes cry, the dog was always there to comfort her, she shared. \"I cannot leave this earth before you do,\" Bortner recalled thinking about Mochi after she was diagnosed.(Breanna Bortner) When she left for appointments — sometimes multiple times per day — Mochi would dig through the trash to collect his owner's hair, which was falling out at the time due to chemotherapy. \"He would dig out my hair to smell me,\" Bortner said.

    "title": "Shedeur Sanders and family react to Browns picking him after historic, controversial NFL Draft slide",
    "article_text": "Urban Meyer joins Colin Cowherd to share his thoughts on Shedeur Sanders falling out of Round 1 of the NFL Draft. Shedeur Sandersis employed. The Cleveland Browns used the No. 144 overall pick in the fifth round of the NFL Draft totake Sanderson Saturday, ending one of the most shocking slides by a top quarterback prospect in league history. Sanders was, by some, projected to be the first quarterback taken this year shortly after the end of the 2024 college football season. But throughout the draft process, that dramatically changed, and Sanders fell all the way to the third day. NFL DRAFT QUARTERBACK MISTAKES THAT SHAPED LEAGUE LANDSCAPE Feb 6, 2025; New Orleans, LA, USA;  Deion Sanders (right) with his son Shedeur Sanders on the red carpet before Super Bowl LIX NFL Honors at Saenger Theatre.(Kirby Lee-Imagn Images) The family was at the center immense national attention with video footage of their handling of the dramatic fall. This included Sanders giving a speech to his family admitting that they weren't prepared to fall out of the first round on Thursday, and footage of a prank call to the prospect on Friday. But on Saturday, the family finally heard his name called…and it was time to party. In footage livestreamed on Twitch, Sanders and his family members were seen exploding in a raucous screeching celebration once his name was called. Additional footage showed the family breaking out into spontaneous dance moments after the selection was made. Shedeur himself made his own statement after the drafting, crediting God. \"Thank you God,\" he wrote. Sanders and his family members thanked God repeatedly throughout draft weekend. Sanders led the Big 12 Conference with 4,134 passing yards and 37 touchdown passes and was named the Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year. In his 50 college games, Sanders threw for 14,347 yards, 134 touchdowns and 27 interceptions. For a quarterback prospect of that esteem to fall out of the third round is highly unusual in the NFL. President Donald Trump even joined in on the debate on Friday, when he ripped \"stupid\" NFL owners for passing on the star Colorado quarterback and allowing him to fall into the second round. GET FULL 2025 NFL DRAFT COVERAGE WITH REAL-TIME PICKS, EXPERT ANALYSIS AND CAN'T-MISS MOMENTS \"What is wrong with NFL owners, are they STUPID? Deion Sanders was a great college football player, and was even greater in the NFL. He’s also a very good coach, streetwise and smart! Therefore, Shedeur, his quarterback son, has PHENOMENAL GENES, and is all set for Greatness,\" Trump wrote in aTruth Social post. \"He should be \"picked\" IMMEDIATELY by a team that wants to WIN. Good luck Shedeur, and say hello to your wonderful father!\" Top prospects like Sanders have seen shocking slides in past NFL Drafts. Aaron Rodgers slipped down to the 25th overall pick in the 2005 NFL Draft, and was passed on for Alex Smith by the 49ers. Patrick Mahomes wasn't taken until the 10th pick in the 2017 Draft, and was passed on for Mitch Trubisky by the Bears. Still, at the time, Mahomes was less of a hyped prospect than Sanders. Lamar Jackson fell all the way to the 32nd pick in the 2018 draft, after four other quarterbacks were taken ahead of him. But Sanders, who was once considered the top candidate to go No. 1 overall this year, falling to day three of the draft, is a historic anomaly. An anonymous NFL coach told theNFL NetworkSanders was \"the worst formal interview I've ever been in in my life.\" \"He's so entitled. He takes unnecessary sacks. He never plays on time. He has horrible body language. He blames teammates,\" the coach continued. \"But the biggest thing is he's not that good.\" Another longtime AFC executive echoed that sentiment, telling the outlet, \"It didn't go great in our interview. He wants to dictate what he's going to do and what's best for him. He makes you feel small.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Three quarterbacks were then taken ahead of him, including lower-rated prospects Jaxson Dart and Tyler Shough. Then Sanders was prank-called by an imposter during a livestream Friday night. While he and his family live-streamed day two of their NFL Draft party on Twitch Friday night, Sanders was seen answering a phone call that he assumed was from a general manager making the decision to draft him. But the wait, media scrutiny and even prank clearly wasn't enough to dampen the family's spirits when he finally was taken, nor their faith in God.

    "title": "Shedeur Sanders historic NFL Draft drama ignites heated racial debates: 'feels like Kaepernick'",
    "article_text": "Urban Meyer joins Colin Cowherd to share his thoughts on Shedeur Sanders falling out of Round 1 of the NFL Draft. Shedeur Sanders leaned on prayer and faith during thishistoric NFL Draft slide. But some of his supporters leaned intosomething else. ESPN star host Stephen A. Smith helped to stir, whether intentionally or not, a heated debate about the role of race in Sanders' draft drama. Smith revealed a text message from an associate who compared the situation to Colin Kaepernick being out of the NFL since 2016 after his infamous kneels during the national anthem, in an X post. And Smith agreed with the comparison. \"'This is a bad look for the NFL. This feels like Kaepernick-level collusion,'\" Smith said the text read, adding that the situation goes beyond \"talent evaluation.\" \"All the hard work the NFL League Office puts in to eradicate these kinds of perceptions, only to turn around and watch as the OWNERS look like they’re colluding, messing up everything. What has been done to Shedeur will outshine everything else in this draft. We’ll never believe this is about just talent evaluation again.\" NFL DRAFT QUARTERBACK MISTAKES THAT SHAPED LEAGUE LANDSCAPE Colorado Buffaloes quarterback Shedeur Sanders (2) walks through the tunnel for warm-ups before the Rocky Mountain Showdown against the CSU Rams at Folsom Field on September 16, 2023.(Andy Cross/MediaNews Group/The Denver Post via Getty Images) In an earlier post, Smith wrote, \"In a different way, this is Kaepernick all over again.\" Barstool founder Dave Portnoy took aim at Smith with a response, calling the ESPN host's stance \"insane\" and a \"race take.\" Portnoy made sure to express his \"love\" for Shedeur's father Deion Sanders in his response to Smith, and also pointed out the first quarterback taken was Miami quarterback Cam Ward, who is Black. \"This is insane. All these race takes are insane. I love Deion. And I’ve been saying for two years Shedeur would be my first QB off the board. But NFL GMs, coaches, owners will do ANYTHING to win games, save jobs. The NFL is cut-throat. Owners would stomp on each other’s throats to win. There is no collusion,\" Portnoy wrote. \"The first pick was a black QB. If teams thought Shedeur and everything he brings could help them win games more than guys available on the board, they’d draft him. That's it. End of story. Every other narrative is fantasy.\" Other debates over the issue have raged fiercely, branching deeply into the political sphere. Earlier on Friday, before Sanders even fell past the second and third rounds, former Democrat congressman Jamaal Bowman more bluntly suggest he has fallen because \"America continues to fear strong Black men.\" GET FULL 2025 NFL DRAFT COVERAGE WITH REAL-TIME PICKS, EXPERT ANALYSIS AND CAN'T-MISS MOMENTS \"The NFL doesn’t like [Shedeur] Sanders, because he wears gold chains and talks like a rapper. They don’t care that he’s a leader, intelligent, tough and completed 77% of his passes with no O-line and no running game. He’s entitled but Eli Manning wasn’t entitled when he refused to be drafted by San Diego?\" Bowman wrote on X. \"He’s not athletic, but that didn’t stop Joe Montana, Drew Brees or Tom Brady. America continues to fear strong Black men who come from means and have a strong sense of themselves without submitting to the 'dominant' culture.\" Bowman's original post has since received a community note pointing out the fact that the first picks in the last three drafts have been Black quarterbacks. Conservative filmmaker Matt Walsh mocked Bowman's video with a sarcastic re-share on X. ESPN radio host Peter Rosenberg posted a long-ranging thread on X, arguing that race has been a factor in Sanders' draft slide. \"Some (white) people may not understand why race is becoming a conversation around Shedeur. It may or may not have anything to do with what's going on here but the relationship between America and ‘brash’ Black athletes has a deep history. White America is historically angered by and scared of men like Shedeur Sanders. So whether that's what's happening here or not -- that history and feeling cannot go away,\" Rosenberg wrote. Meanwhile, the TNT Sports journalist Stan Becton went so far as to suggest the New York Giants passed over Sanders for Jaxson Dart because they \"don't like\" Black quarterbacks. \"The Giants don’t like Black QBs this has been documented over time. No way they were getting a Black QB with the personality of Shedeur Sanders unfortunately,\" Becton wrote. However, Becton's post also received a community note, pointing out the fact that they have two Black quarterbacks on their roster. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders talks to Mississippi quarterback Jaxson Dart at the NFL football scouting combine in Indianapolis, Saturday, March 1, 2025.(AP Photo/George Walker IV) Conservative influencer Robbie Starbuck dismissed the idea that Sanders was falling because of racism. \"Shedeur Sanders might end up being great and teams may regret not picking him but the idea that he hasn’t been picked because of racism is just stupid. The #1 pick in the draft was a black QB. The best QB in the NFL is half black. Teams are scared off by the circus, not his race,\" Starbuck wrote. The Sanders family itself has not made any such suggestions about race. Instead, they have posted bible verses and messages about thanking God. After Sanders was selected on Saturday, the family posted a video showing a boisterous celebration in their family home.

The New York Giants traded back into the first round, but they opted forJaxson Dartinstead, effectively ending any chance Sanders would be a first-rounder. Then, Tyler Shough, Jalen Milroe, and Dillon Gabriel were selected on Friday. SHEDEUR SANDERS IS FALLING IN NFL DRAFT BECAUSE OF HIS FATHER, STEPHEN A. SMITH SAYS But Gabriel, who the Browns selected in the third round, is now Sanders' teammate as they bring in another quarterback, making it four on the depth chart, including veterans Joe Flacco and Kenny Pickett. Deshaun Watson, who GM Andrew Berry admitted didn't work out as planned when they traded for him with the Houston Texans in 2022, is uncertain to play in 2025 after reinjuring his Achilles he ruptured last season.

Sanders, a four-star recruit and top 100 overall prospect across the nation, began his college career alongside his father at Jackson State after \"Coach Prime\" was brought in to lead the program. He initially committed to play at Florida Atlantic despite multiple SEC offers. Sanders quickly showed off his passing skills, earning SWAC Freshman of the Year honors after throwing for 3,231 yards with 30 touchdowns to eight interceptions, while also rushing in for three scores over 13 games. In 2022, Sanders topped that with a SWAC Player of the Year performance, which included 3,752 yards, 40 touchdowns and just six interceptions with six more rushing touchdowns.

He earned second-team All-American honors as well as being named the Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year and a Heisman Trophy finalist. He set a school record with 64 career passing touchdowns, and did so in just two seasons of play. Sanders also led the FBS with a 74% completion rate –again another school record. In 13 games, he had 4,134 passing yards with 37 touchdowns to 10 interceptions. On tape, Sanders is a highly accurate quarterback with good pocket presence and the ability to scramble, which you’d like to see at the pro level.

    "title": "Giants' Abdul Carter denied No 56 by Hall of Famer Lawrence Taylor: 'Get another number'",
    "article_text": "FOX Sports reporter Kevin Kugle recaps the second and third rounds of the NFL Draft and previews this weekend’s must-see USFL games. TheNew York Giantstook Penn State's Abdul Carter third overall with the dream that he could one day be in their Ring of Honor, solidifying a spot as one of the best players to wear their jersey. But that jersey won't feature the number 56 on it as he would like. The number 56 belonged to perhaps the greatest defensive weapon theNFLhas ever seen: Lawrence Taylor. It was retired by the Giants in 1994 to honor the Hall of Fame linebacker, and he intends to keep it that way despite Carter mentioning his desire to wear it. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM NFL Commissioner points out New York Giants fans to edge rusher Abdul Carter after the Giants select Carter with the third pick during the first round of the 2025 NFL Draft on Thursday, April 24, 2025, at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin. The draft runs through April 26.(Tork Mason/USA Today Network-Wisconsin) Carter, however, is using Lawrence's \"get another number\" comment as fuel for his own fire heading into his rookie campaign with Big Blue. \"The worst thing he could say was NO!! My stance don’t change, LT is the [goat emoji]. Nothing but respect… This just gonna make me work even harder!! I love it,\" he wrote on X. Carter's comment stems from Taylor being asked about the Penn State product's own right after being drafted by New York. GET FULL 2025 NFL DRAFT COVERAGE WITH REAL-TIME PICKS, EXPERT ANALYSIS AND CAN'T-MISS MOMENTS He spoke to fellowNittany LionMicah Parsons, the Dallas Cowboys' star edge rusher, who will now be an enemy. Parsons and Carter both wore No. 11 at Penn State, so the former asked the latter if he would carry that tradition into the NFL. The problem with that number is that former Giants quarterback Phil Simms saw that retired for him as well, but Carter said he was eyeing Taylor's No. 56 instead, to which Parsons and his Bleacher Report co-hosts reacted in amazement. The New York Postasked Taylor about Carter’s potential number request, and it was clear he wouldn’t be sharing it.

Get another number. I don’t care if it’s double zero, and then make it famous.\" The Giants' previous first-round draft pick, wide receiver Malik Nabers, did get the blessing from Ray Flaherty's family this past season to wear his retired number one. So, a request isn't out of the ordinary for the franchise. But Taylor wants Carter to forge his own path in the NFL, and have Giants fans remember him for his own number on his back. Of course, Carter would absolutely love to have a career remotely close to Taylor's. After Lawrence Taylor told Abdul Carter to 'get another number,' the Giants' first-round pick is using it as fuel.(IMAGN) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP He was a 10-time Pro Bowler, two-time Super Bowl champion, the 1986 league MVP and three-time AP Defensive Player of the Year over his 13 seasons in the league – all with the Giants.

Sanders was hopeful that he would be taken on Day 2, but after Rounds 3 and 4 came and went, he still didn't know whichNFL teamhe will begin his career with. Meanwhile, three other quarterbacks were selected on Friday night in Green Bay after Cam Ward went first overall to the Tennessee Titans, and the New York Giants traded back into the first round to grab Jaxson Dart 25th overall.

But after the final picks were made on Friday, Sanders pointed to his faith with his reaction, saying, \"Thank you GOD for EVERYTHING.\" He had a similar message Saturday morning on X. \"Another day another opportunity to get a chance to play the game I love.

Why is this happening for Sanders? It’s the question on everyone’s mind, with opinions flying in on all sides. Some feel that his father, NFL great and Colorado head coach Deion Sanders, has blame to shoulder. Others believe the reports during the draft process, which stated that Sanders had had bad meetings with teams.

He's shown elite-level accuracy, a solid arm in the pocket and outside, and the tools to be a good quarterback in the NFL. \"It’s gotta be about more than football,\" ESPN's Booger McFarland said during the NFL Draft broadcast on the network. \"He’s the best pure passer you can draft. When you start to see developmental projects like Jalen Milroe and Dillon Gabriel – and nothing against those guys, but they’re not nearly the player that Shedeur Sanders is. When they go before him, the only thing you can say is that it’s more than football.\" McFarland's colleague, Mel Kiper Jr., adds: \"I think it’s disgusting. I don’t understand what the heck’s going on with this. . . . Somebody’s gonna have to explain that one to me.\" Sanders has been surrounded by friends and family in Texas, awaiting the call that has yet to come. In fact, Sanders had todeal with a prank call,which was caught on his Twitch live stream. He has since ended the live broadcast. But through this surprising free fall, Sanders has been keeping a positive mindset, at least publicly.

    "title": "Shedeur Sanders' NFL Draft freefall has sports world in shock: 'This is disgusting'",
    "article_text": "Urban Meyer joins Colin Cowherd to share his thoughts on Shedeur Sanders falling out of Round 1 of the NFL Draft. When quarterback prospectShedeur Sandersfell out of the first round of the 2025 NFL Draft, there were some who couldn’t believe he hadn't been picked by an organization, although it wasn’t considered a total shock. But with Friday night seeing three more quarterbacks not named Sanders come off the draft board, the reaction was pure shock. Sanders, theColorado Buffaloesquarterback who was a Heisman Trophy finalist this past college season, remains available heading into the third and final day of the NFL Draft. There have been 102 prospects taken off the board, and with Round 4 beginning at noon in Green Bay, everyone is wondering which NFL team will finally pull the trigger on Sanders. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders watches a drill at the NFL football scouting combine in Indianapolis, Saturday, March 1, 2025.(AP Photo/Michael Conroy) Surprise and shock might not even be the words to describe this fall down the draft board, arguably being the biggest we’ve seen in recent memory for someone whom many considered to be, at the very least, a Day 2 selection. Why is this happening for Sanders? It’s the question on everyone’s mind, including ESPN’s Booger McFarland, who thinks the answer lies beyond the tape. GET FULL 2025 NFL DRAFT COVERAGE WITH REAL-TIME PICKS, EXPERT ANALYSIS AND CAN'T-MISS MOMENTS \"It’s gotta be about more than football,\" he said during the NFL Draft broadcast on the network. \"He’s the best pure passer you can draft.

When they go before him, the only thing you can say is that it’s more than football.\" Tyler Shough (New Orleans Saints), Milroe (Seattle Seahawks), and Gabriel (Cleveland Browns) were all selected on Friday night in respective order. Gabriel, especially, was the icing on the cake for those who were baffled that Sanders hadn't gone off the board, as some experts didn’t have him on their top five quarterback rankings heading into the draft. Mel Kiper Jr., the longtime NFL Draft analyst with ESPN, has been adamant about Sanders’ talent, ranking him the highest-graded prospect on his big board. He was vocal about Sanders making it out of the first round on Thursday night, but he was appalled to see what happened the next day. \"I think it’s disgusting,\" he said during a lengthy rant after Day 2 came and went. \"I don’t understand what the heck’s going on with this. . . . Somebody’s gonna have to explain that one to me.\" Joel Klatt, who called several Buffaloes games this past college season for Fox Sports, has seen what Sanders can do for a football program in person. Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders (2) throws a pass against Central Florida during the first half of an NCAA college football game, Saturday, Sept. 28, 2024, in Orlando, Fla.(AP Photo/Phelan M. Ebenhack, File) During NFL Network’s broadcast, Klatt pointed the finger at the narratives that were built about Sanders during the pre-draft process as to a reason why he’s slipping. \"Shedeur represents everything I dislike about the NFL Draft, and it’s only one thing: it’s narratives. It’s narratives that are built up, lazy, and quite frankly, trash. When you come out as an anonymous source about some meeting that you had, and you don’t think that some kid measured up to what you wanted him to be when he walked in your room, I think that’s trash. \"Shedeur Sanders is going to be a good quarterback in the National Football League, and I think he’s going to go make some head coach and some fan base very happy, because he’s already done that in his career in what I think is a very difficult spotlight for his dad at the University of Colorado and a program that was nothing before he got there for two decades.\" SHEDEUR SANDERS STAYING CONFIDENT AS STUNNING NFL DRAFT FALL HITS FINAL DAY: ‘THANK YOU GOD FOR EVERYTHING’ At the same time, Klatt also believes this is time for Sanders to reflect, because the analyst feels it isn’t the tape that’s causing this freefall. \"His play on the field would suggest he should already have been selected,\" Klatt explained. \"There were some quarterbacks, their play on the field probably doesn’t warrant a selection over his play on the field. \"The reason he’s undrafted at this point is because of the person that sat with those teams and did not, for whatever reason, jell with them.\" It’s not just the analysts opining about Sanders’ draft situation – even President Donald Trump jumped into the mix to say how crazy it was. \"What is wrong with NFL owners, are they STUPID? Deion Sanders was a great college football player, and was even greater in the NFL. He’s also a very good coach, streetwise and smart! Therefore, Shedeur, his quarterback son, has PHENOMENAL GENES, and is all set for Greatness,\" Trump wrote in aTruth Social post. ESPN host Stephen A. Smith called it \"a damn disgrace.\" Denver Broncos head coach Sean Payton, who already has a young quarterback after taking Bo Nix in the first round last years, admitted his surprise and even the Buffaloes football account on X posted 10 minutes worth of Sanders highlights, just to remind everyone of how good he can be on the gridiron. These reactions are just the tip of the iceberg, as the football world continues to be bewildered at Sanders being available heading into the fourth round on Saturday.

Thirty-one teams made first-round selections on Thursday night (the Houston Texans traded back), and none of them selectedShedeur Sanders. But then night two came, and more of the same occurred. In fact, the Colorado quarterback, who was once expected to potentially go in the top-five, was not even one of the top five QBs selected. Three more quarterbacks, Tyler Shough, Jalen Milroe and Dillon Gabriel, were all selected on Friday; Shough at 40 to the Saints, Milroe to the Seahawks at 92, and Gabriel going to Cleveland at 95.

Smith, doesn't think Sanders fell because of football reasons at all. \"I believe that the biggest issue in all of this was Primetime Deion Sanders and the thought of having to deal with him,\" Smith said onFriday's \"First Take,\"hours before the second round even began. \"It’s hard for me to sit here today and to watch a dude that was once projected to be one of the top two picks potentially in the draft to drop completely out of the first round and to ignore all those reports that had come out about him leading into the draft.\" Sanders' father, of course, has been rather vocal, on top of plenty of NFL rumors, over his coaching days. \"If you think that I’m going to sit here and assume that that was strictly an evaluation about his football skills alone that led to him falling out the entire first round without his father having an impact, I don’t buy that,\" Smith continued.

Ward separated himself and went first overall to the Tennessee Titans. But, in recent days, it was becoming apparent that teams did not love Sanders – the Raiders took Ashton Jeanty at six, and the Saints went with Kelvin Banks Jr. at nine, officially starting the Sanders fall. All eyes were on the Pittsburgh Steelers at No. 21. But as no one traded up in front of them, the Steelers’ selection came and went without a QB – they opted for Derrick Harmon. The New York Giants traded back into the first round, but they opted forJaxson Dartinstead. And then, rounds two and three happened.

    "title": "Shedeur Sanders goes undrafted through first three rounds of NFL Draft in historically shocking slide",
    "article_text": "Urban Meyer joins Colin Cowherd to share his thoughts on Shedeur Sanders falling out of Round 1 of the NFL Draft. Shedeur Sanderswas not selected in the first three rounds of the NFL Draft, in one of the most shocking slides of any top quarterback prospect in league history. The third round closed on Friday night withfive quarterbacksbeing taken, while Sanders and his family remain uncertain about where and when his pro career will begin. NFL DRAFT QUARTERBACK MISTAKES THAT SHAPED LEAGUE LANDSCAPE Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders speaks during a press conference at the NFL football scouting combine Friday, Feb. 28, 2025, in Indianapolis.(AP Photo/George Walker IV) After Cam Ward was selected with the first overall pick on Thursday night, experts assumed Sanders would soon follow as the second quarterback selected. Instead, Jaxson Dart was the second quarterback taken when the New York Giants traded back into the first round to take him at 25. Early in the second round, the New Orleans Saints used the 40th pick to take Tyler Shough. Then, late in the third round, the Seattle Seahawks took Jalen Milroe at 92 and then the Cleveland Browns took Dillon Gabriel at 94. Dart, Shough, Milroe and Gabriel were all projected to go much later than Sanders by scouts and analysts, and early projections even had Sanders going above Ward at No. 1. Sanders led the Big 12 Conference with 4,134 passing yards and 37 touchdown passes and was named the Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year. In his 50 college games, Sanders threw for 14,347 yards, 134 touchdowns and 27 interceptions. GET FULL 2025 NFL DRAFT COVERAGE WITH REAL-TIME PICKS, EXPERT ANALYSIS AND CAN'T-MISS MOMENTS For a quarterback prospect of that esteem to fall out of the third round is highly unusual in the NFL. Top prospects like Sanders have seen shocking slides in past NFL Drafts. Aaron Rodgers slipped down to the 25th overall pick in the 2005 NFL Draft, and was passed on for Alex Smith by the 49ers. Patrick Mahomes wasn't taken until the 10th pick in the 2017 Draft, and was passed on for Mitch Trubisky by the Bears. Still, at the time, Mahomes was less of a hyped prospect than Sanders. Lamar Jackson fell all the way to the 32nd pick in the 2018 draft, after four other quarterbacks were taken ahead of him. But Sanders, who was once considered the top candidate to go No. 1 overall this year, falling to day three of the draft, is a historic anamoly. To make matters worse for him and his family, Sanders was prank-called by an imposter during a livestream Friday night. While he and his family live-streamed day two of their NFL Draft party on Twitch Friday night, Sanders was seen answering a phone call that he assumed was from a general manager making the decision to draft him. Then the caller told the eager young athlete that he would \"have to wait a little longer,\" as Sanders' smile quickly faded. NFL teams' decision not to draft Sanders has prompted mass controversy and debate throughout the draft, and even prior to it as rumors of Sanders falling down draft boards became public. An anonymous NFL coach recently told theNFL NetworkSanders was \"the worst formal interview I've ever been in in my life.\" \"He's so entitled. He takes unnecessary sacks. He never plays on time. He has horrible body language. He blames teammates,\" the coach continued. \"But the biggest thing is he's not that good.\" Another longtime AFC executive echoed that sentiment, telling the outlet, \"It didn't go great in our interview. He wants to dictate what he's going to do and what's best for him. He makes you feel small.\" Kansas City Chiefs superstar Patrick Mahomes seemingly alluded to Sanders' draft slide in an X post later on Friday, simply writing \"Crazy.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP President Donald Trump even joined in on the debate on Friday, when he ripped \"stupid\" NFL owners for passing on the star Colorado quarterback and allowing him to fall into the second round. \"What is wrong with NFL owners, are they STUPID? Deion Sanders was a great college football player, and was even greater in the NFL. He’s also a very good coach, streetwise and smart! Therefore, Shedeur, his quarterback son, has PHENOMENAL GENES, and is all set for Greatness,\" Trump wrote in aTruth Social post. \"He should be \"picked\" IMMEDIATELY by a team that wants to WIN. Good luck Shedeur, and say hello to your wonderful father!\" Now, Sanders will have to wait until day three of the draft to hear his name called, if it is called at all. However, he has seemingly expressed gratitude and patience throughout the process despite the dramatic slide. In an X post late Friday night, while the third round was coming to an end, Sanders thanked go. \"Thank you GOD for EVERYTHING,\" he wrote.

    "article_text": "Colin Cowherd reacts to Shedeur Sanders’ surprising slide out of Round 1 and what it means for his NFL future The emotional roller coasterfor Shedeur Sandersplunged even harder during the second day of the NFL Draft. After falling to the third round and gettingpassed onin favor of two other quarterbacks projected to go much later than Sanders, he fell victim to an ill-timed prank call as the world watched. While he and his family live-streamed day two of their NFL Draft party on Twitch Friday night, Sanders was seen answering a phone call that he assumed was from a general manager making the decision to draft him. The 23-year-old quarterback had a big smile on his face as he answered and greeted the caller, with friends and family crowding around him. \"I'm good, been waiting on you,\" he said. But the imposter on the other side told the eager young athlete that he would \"have to wait a little longer,\" as Sanders' smile quickly faded.

Sanders has since ended his Twitch stream. Sanders' draft slide has been the biggest and most controversial storyline of this year's draft. After fellow quarterback Cam Ward out of Miami was selected with the first overall pick on Thursday, experts assumed Sanders would follow soon after as the second quarterback taken. But instead, Jaxson Dart was taken by the Giants late in the first round Tyler Shough was taken by the Saints early in the second. Both Dart and Shough were projected to go much later than Sanders by scouts and analysts. At one point during the quarterback's slide on Thursday, his other brother, NFL safety prospect Shilo Sanders, insisted \"something is going on\" with Shedeur not being selected, as seen in footage posted by their other brother, Deion Sanders Jr. \"Bro, if they don't take you right now, it's something going on,\" Shilo said. \"If they don't take him right now, it's something going on. I don't know what's going on, but it's something.\" NFL DRAFT QUARTERBACK MISTAKES THAT SHAPED LEAGUE LANDSCAPE In additional footage posted by Deion Jr. Thursday night, Shedeur addressed not being taken in a speech to his family when the first night of the draft was over. \"We all didn't expect this, of course, but I feel like with God, anything possible, everything possible. I don't feel like this happened for no reason. All of this is, of course, fuel to the fire. Under no circumstances did we all know this was going to happen, but we understand we on to bigger and better things,\" thequarterback said. \"Tomorrow's the day. We going to be happy regardless. Legendary.\" President Donald Trump even joined in on the debate on Friday, when he ripped \"stupid\" NFL owners for passing on the star Colorado quarterback and allowing him to fall into the second round. \"What is wrong with NFL owners, are they STUPID? Deion Sanders was a great college football player, and was even greater in the NFL. He’s also a very good coach, streetwise and smart! Therefore, Shedeur, his quarterback son, has PHENOMENAL GENES, and is all set for Greatness,\" Trump wrote in aTruth Social post. \"He should be \"picked\" IMMEDIATELY by a team that wants to WIN.

After falling out of the first round of theNFL DraftThursday, Sanders wasn't even the first quarterback taken in the second round Friday. In fact, Sanders ended up not getting taken in the second round at all. The New Orleans Saints chose former Louisville quarterback Tyler Shough with the 40th overall pick. It came as a surprise to many when the Saints passed on Sanders in the first round with the ninth overall pick, as the 23-year-old Colorado Star's slide became more pronounced after falling past the Saints. But the move to pick Shough over Sanders in the second round was an even bigger shock to fans on social media. Sanders was projected by some to contend for the No. 1 overall pick this year. Shough was projected by some to be the fifth-best quarterback in the draft. Many fans on social media were quick to post lowlights of Shough's passing ability, while critisizing the Saints' decision. But the Saints thought otherwise, and pulled the trigger on the underdog Shough with a hole at quarterback going into the 2025.

The RockYou2024 leak, whichexposed almost 10 billion passwordsin July of last year, might seem like old news, but its impact is still felt today. It's considered the largest password compilation ever released. With such a vast collection of breached credentials circulating, the risk of credential stuffing, identity theft and unauthorized access to online accounts and systems remains high. For anyone still reusing passwords, the dangers are real — and growing. That's why password security has never been more critical, and the big question remains, how secure is my password? Join The FREE CyberGuy Report:Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals — plus instant access to myfreeUltimate Scam Survival Guidewhen you sign up! Username and password on tablet(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) Think of weak passwords as an open door for hackers. Recent reports show that many common passwords can be cracked in literally seconds. Simple or reused passwords are especially vulnerable to automated attacks, and once one account is breached, others are often quickly compromised. If a company you’re signed up with experiences adata breachand your login info is leaked, attackers can try that same password on other platforms, potentially unlocking a lot more than just one account. Strong passwords act as your first line of defense. They’re long, complex and unique, making it significantly harder for attackers to guess or force their way in. When every account has its own strong password, even if one gets leaked, the rest stay safe. Think of it this way. Aweak passwordis like using the same key for your house, car and office and leaving it under the doormat. A strong password? It’s like a unique, high-security key for every door in your digital life. Illustration of username and password(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) APPLE FIXES PASSWORDS APP VULNERABILITY ENABLING WI-FI ATTACKS The most commonly used and insecure passwords are: These passwords are extremely easy to guess and should be avoided at all costs. Illustration of password login on laptop(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) MALWARE STEALS BANK CARDS AND PASSWORDS FROM MILLIONS OF DEVICES How secure is your password, really? It’s time to put it to the test. Grab a pen (or just keep a mental tally) and score yourself based on this 7-point password strength test.Each \"yes\" earns you a point.So, let’s see how your password holds up in today’s threat landscape. Length is your first line of defense. Short passwords — think six or eight characters — can be cracked in minutes bymodern hacking tools. At 12 characters or more, you’re making it exponentially harder for attacks to succeed. Mixing uppercase and lowercase letters strengthens your password by increasing complexity. For example, instead of using something like \"t8g5k9w2,\" use \"T8g5K9w2\" — same characters, just more variety. Mix it up. Adding numbers makes your password harder to crack. Instead of sticking to just letters — like \"Trkplmsh\" — try something like \"Tr8k5Plm2sh.\" Randomly placed numbers increase complexity and make your password much more secure. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? Symbols like !, @, #, and $ add another layer of security. For example, a password like \"T8g5K9w2\" becomes even stronger as \"T8g5#K9w2!.\" Special characters increase complexity and help defend against attacks. Reusing passwords is like handing hackers a master key. If one account gets breached, and you’ve reused that password elsewhere, you’re toast. One password, one purpose. No exceptions. Your name, birthday or \"Fluffy1990\" (your dog’s name and birth year) might feel clever, but they’re goldmines for attackers who can scrape social media or breached data. Keep it impersonal and unpredictable. Even good passwords can go stale. It’s a smart move to update them every 90 days, or sooner if a site you use has a security issue.

Even one weak spot could be all it takes for someone to break in. In a world full of data leaks, a strong, unique password is one of the easiest ways to protect yourself. So, what’s your score? Think it’s time to level up? If your score didn’t quite hit that seven out of seven mark, no worries. The good news? You’ve already taken the first step by identifying the weak spots. Now, you’ve got two options: GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE To keep your passwords secure, use ones that are at least 12 characters long with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters. Avoid using personal information or common patterns. Always use a different password for each account, and enabletwo-factor authenticationwhenever it's available. While you can build a strong password on your own, let’s be real, it’s not always easy. Coming up with something that’s at least 12 characters long, includes uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, special symbols and isn’t based on anything personal? That’s a tall order. And even if you do manage to craft the perfect one, you’ve still got to remember it, especially if you’re using a different strong password for every account (which you absolutely should be). This is the easier, faster and frankly smarter route. A password generator creates long, complex, completely random passwords for you — no guesswork or mental gymnastics required. These tools are designed to pump out passwords that check all the boxes, making them far harder to crack. If you want an easy and secure option, many password managers include built-in password generators that follow best practices for maximum strength. Either way, the key takeaway is this: Don’t settle for weak or recycled passwords. Whether you go DIY or use a tool, upgrading your password strength is one of the simplest ways to protect yourself online. Illustration of online banking login on laptop(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) Password security can seem like a tough thing to maintain manually. The good news is that password managers take the hassle out of it by generating, storing and autofilling strong, unique passwords for you. We recommend a password manager that is secure, user-friendly and includes features like a password health tool, data breach monitoring and a built-in password generator to help you create strong, unique passwords. Essentially, they are a digital safe designed to encrypt and store your login credentials, passkeys, credit card details, personal information and even sensitive files. It remembers everything for you, organizes your credentials neatly and fills in login forms with a single click. When you sign up for a new site, it autosaves the password with no effort required. The best part? A password manager puts an end to password reuse. Instead of leaning on that tired old \"Fluffy1990\" for every account, it generates strong, unique passwords tailored to each site, boosting security for both your personal and professional life. So, with a password manager, you’ll no longer have to ask yourself, how secure is my password? Get more details about mybest expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here. With data breaches becoming increasingly common, it's clear that password security isn't a \"set it and forget it\" task. It's an ongoing process. By prioritizing strong passwords and using tools to help you manage them effectively, you can significantly reduce your risk and enjoy greater peace of mind online.

    "title": "JONATHAN TURLEY: Out-of-control judges, not FBI, appear to have crossed 'red line'",
    "article_text": "Panelists Hugh Hewitt, Juan Williams and Stef Kight discuss the FBI arrest of a Wisconsin judge and more on ‘Special Report.’ \"This is not normal.\" Those words from Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., are undeniably true after the arrest of Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan. However, the reason it is not normal is far more debatable. Dugan is accused of becoming a lawbreaker in seeking to obstruct an effort to arrest a man wanted by federal authorities. If true, that is manifestly not \"normal.\" As soon as the news of the arrest was reported, Democrats declared another constitutional crisis. Klobuchar added that the arrest \"is a drastic move threatening the rule of law\" and a \"grave step and undermines our system of checks and balances.\" That is a curious claim unless Klobuchar believes that the officers are lying. If not, Klobuchar is suggesting that a judge should not be held accountable for actively shielding a wanted person and facilitating their evasion of law enforcement. Kash Patel and Judge Dugan(Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images, left, Mike De Sisti / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images, right.) Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., also condemned Dugan’s arrest, stating, \"If [FBI Director] Kash Patel and Donald Trump don’t like a judge, they think they can arrest them. This is stunning — we must stand up to this blatant power grab. Republicans: How is this not a red line for you?\" Yet, what is the \"red line\" for judges if the allegations are true? This judge is accused of conduct that has resulted in charges for other citizens. The judicial robe is not some form of invisibility cloak that allows judges to engage in alleged criminal acts. The Wisconsin media isreporting: Sources have told the Journal Sentinel that ICE officials arrived in Dugan’s courtroom on the morning of April 18. When they went to the chief judge’s office, Dugan directed the defendant and his attorney to a side door in the courtroom, directed them down a private hallway and into the public area on the 6th floor. If true, that would be an active effort to help the suspect elude police who were carrying out a lawful function. The judicial robe is not some form of invisibility cloak that allows judges to engage in alleged criminal acts. According to the criminal complaint, Ruiz allegedly attacked three individuals after an altercation with his roommate about playing loud music. Flores-Ruiz allegedly struck his roommate approximately 30 times with a closed fist and then attacked his girlfriend and a third person. Some of the injuries required hospital treatment. The evasion of police at the courthouse required officers to chase down Ruiz, which could have resulted in a more serious confrontation on the street. This is not the first time that a judge has been accused of participating in or directing such obstruction. I previouslywroteabout the case of Massachusetts judge Shelley M. Richmond Joseph who was charged with allegedly helping an illegal immigrant evade ICE agents in April 2018. Joseph and court officer Wesley MacGregor were charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice, obstruction of justice, aiding and abetting and obstruction of a federal proceeding. I was critical of the handling of the case. While Joseph was suspended for three years, charges were dropped in 2022 during the Biden Administration. The Dugan case occurred at the same time that a New Mexico judge was arrested for harboring an unlawful immigrant and an alleged TdA gang member. An HSI agent escorts former Doña Ana County Magistrate Judge Joel Cano out of his home on Thursday, April 24, 2025.(Courtesy of KFOX14) Doña Ana County Magistrate Judge Joel Cano and his wife were arrested on Thursday. Notably, Cano reportedly admitted to officers that he smashed the phone of Cristhian Ortega-Lopez after the 23-year-old was arrested in a raid at the judge’s home. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION As I said on Fox News Channel last night, I am perplexed by Democrats rushing to denounce the arrest of Dugan before we know whether these allegations are supported. If she escorted the suspect to a non-public door to facilitate his escape, that conduct is a shocking abandonment of judicial ethics. She can certainly use her authority to address matters properly before her in the form of judicial orders, but actively assisting in an escape is well beyond the pale. I have often criticized the reckless rhetoric directed against judges, including those who have ruled against the Trump administration. We need to maintain our civility and respect as we work through these often difficult questions. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP However, that works both ways. Judges have to reinforce respect for the judiciary in their own conduct. That includes showing restraint and respect in relation to the countervailing powers of the Executive Branch. It certainly includes avoiding actions that could be viewed as unethical or even criminal in resisting this administration. That is also a \"red line.\" CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JONATHAN TURLEY Jonathan Turley is a Fox News Media contributor and the Shapiro Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington University. He is the author of \"The Indispensable Right: Free Speech in an Age of Rage\" (Simon & Schuster, June 18, 2024).",

    "title": "Here's why helping the homeless rebuild their lives is key to America’s future success",
    "article_text": "Residents of Burlington, Vermont spoke with Fox News Digital about the challenges the city faces with respect to homelessness and drug addiction. As America stands at a crossroads – reassessing how we manage public services, strengthen our borders and privatize select government functions – one often-overlooked factor carries significant consequences for our future: how we effectivelyrespond to homelessness. Supporting the homeless in healing and becoming productive members of society is not just about compassion; it is also a strategic investment in America’s long-term prosperity and strength. For the past decade, our nation’s one-size-fits-all policyapproach to homelessness, Housing First, has sought to offer lifelong housing to every homeless American – without funding or mandates for addiction and mental health treatment, job training, or life-skills development. A homeless man sits in his tent with a river view in Portland, Oregon, June 5, 2021.(AP Photo/Paula Bronstein) Forced upon us by overzealous bureaucrats who assured it would eliminate homelessness within a decade, the policy has instead fueled the crisis. Many frontline leaders foresaw its failure, but we could not have imagined the full scale of devastation it would unleash. WHY BLUE STATE POLICIES ARE CAUSING EVEN MORE HOMELESSNESS IN AMERICA Homelessness has eruptedinto a full-blown catastrophe, reaching its highest point in recorded history, with bodies sprawled throughout America’s streets, lives lost daily and communities unraveling. Far from fostering stability, Housing First has institutionalized dependency – at the individual level, within the nonprofit sector and among local policymakers. Those struggling with homelessness face three primary deficits that keep them stuck: Deficit of Income:While seemingly obvious, homeless individuals often lack the capability to earn enough to meet their basic needs. Without intervention, they remain in a cycle of poverty. We must help the homeless grow their earnings through job training and financial literacy programs, enabling them to live within their means. Homeless people in San Diego, California, on Jan. 8, 2025.(Derek Shook for Fox News Digital) HOMELESS PEOPLE NEED MORE THAN A HOUSE. THEY NEED SOMETHING MONEY CAN'T BUY Deficit of Support:If you or I were to become homeless tomorrow, we would have family and friends to lean on for a hand-up. Not so for most people on the streets. They often have no support network. We must help them repair or rebuild their support systems – offering ongoing encouragement and guidance – so they are not left to struggle alone. Deficit of Purpose:Human beings are designed for purpose. Those experiencing homelessness may have lost their way, but they have not lost the intrinsic purpose for which they were designed. We must help them rediscover their value to reignite their sense of self-worth. Too often, it is suggested thataffordable housingis the silver bullet. It is not. Housing alone does nothing to address the income, support and purpose deficits that accompany homelessness. Homelessness is a health and human services emergency – deeply linked to mental health, substance abuse and individual well-being. Homeless migrants wait in line to receive food and clothing donations in Tompkins Square Park on Jan. 20, 2024 in New York City.(Stephanie Keith/Getty Images) I’M A BLUE STATE MAYOR AND THE FUTURE OF HOMELESSNESS SCARES ME Human First programs like the one I led for 13 years – Northern California’s largest program for homeless women and children – prove that addressing these issues and others that often accompany homelessness yields lasting results. By integrating treatment,job training, life-skills and accountability with temporary housing, thousands of formerly addicted single mothers achieved sobriety, secured employment and some even became California homeowners. Our $19,000 annual cost per person was a fraction of the short-term expense, and a substantial reduction in the long-term public burden that creates massive strain on public systems. Homeless individuals with untreated addiction and mental illness cost taxpayers between $30,000 and $50,000 annually in emergency services, health care and law enforcement expenses. To reverse this crisis, we must dismantle the disastrous federal mandates that have shackled the homeless, local communities and innovation. THESE CITIES' FEIGNED COMPASSION MAKING DRUG AND HOMELESSNESS CRISES WORSE Housing Secretary Scott Turner’s bold proposal to slash HUD’s bureaucracy and redirect its focus is a vital step. Massive cuts to the agency’s inefficiency and rigidity will empower local governments with the flexibility to create tailored, results-driven solutions. Equally promising is the idea of block-granting homelessness funds directly to states – or better yet, counties. Counties, as frontline providers ofhealth and human services, are best positioned to deliver precise, accountable care. Unlike states, counties have granular, real-time insights into their communities’ needs and can implement nimble, localized solutions. Moreover, routing funds through counties rather than states ensures that every dollar stretches further as each layer of bureaucracy siphons off resources. By directing funding to the county level, we reduce administrative waste and ensure resources swiftly reach those in need. However, these reforms, alone, will not reverse the nation’s crisis. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION For 11 years, state and county officials have been under HUD’s thumb, forced to implement Housing First as homelessness,overdose deathsand public disorder surged in their communities, constrained in challenging it for fear of losing funding. Secretary Turner must also consider how to equip local leaders who are lost when it comes to ways to quickly and effectively reverse their metastasizing crisis. Homelessness is far more than a moral dilemma. It is a national emergency with profound economic, social and security implications at every level of government. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP As we champion border security and streamlined government functions, we must recognize that helping the homeless become productive is not only fundamental to their success – it is equally fundamental to ours. The more individuals we restore, the stronger we become as a nation. In empowering the homeless to rebuild their lives, we are rebuilding America – one restored life at a time.

    "title": "BROADCAST BIAS: Media act like only problem with immigration is Trump deporting phony ‘Maryland man’",
    "article_text": "Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., discusses the Left's treatment of deportations under President Donald Trump on 'Life, Liberty & Levin.' The definition of \"news\" is incredibly elastic, and it’s often stretched and shaped to push the Democrat message of the day. In March, U.S. Customs and Border Protectionrecorded 7,180 Southwest border crossings,down from the monthly average of 155,000 over the last four years. The border is secure, and somehow that good news is not big news on ABC, CBS, and NBC. The facts were briefly noted, as a minor diversion. Instead of the overall picture, they settled on the narrative thatPresident Donald Trump’s mass deportationsare legally reckless, and the illegal immigrants are not. So, one man from El Salvador -- Kilmar Abrego Garcia – is more newsworthy than the entire border picture. The networks energetically hammered awayon the Democrat campaign to make this man a heroic victim routinely described as a \"Maryland man\" or \"Maryland father\" who was \"mistakenly deported\" back to El Salvador. With these misleading terms, a dabbler in the news might think Trump deported someone who grew up in Baltimore. ICE DENVER ARRESTS TREN DE ARAGUA MEMBER WITH MULTIPLE CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS Geoffrey Dickens at the Media Research Center revealed that the time count of ABC, CBS and NBC coverage of the Garcia case is now up to 143 and a half minutes on their morning and evening news in April. ABC spent the most time (52 minutes, 32 seconds) on it. CBS came in second with 49 minutes, 26 seconds. NBC aired 41 minutes, 45 seconds. The Trump White House edited and criticized a New York Times headline about deported illegal alien Kilmar Abrego Garcia.(White House/screengrab/Kevin Dietsch/Sheldon Cooper/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) You can hear their ardor for Garcia in the lingo they use. ABC chief White House correspondent Mary Bruce gushed it was \"remarkable\" to see him meeting with Democrat Sen. Chris Van Hollen: \"the first images of the wrongfully deported Maryland man since we last saw him, head shaved and shackled, held in that notorious prison in El Salvador.\" The network tilt here is what’s notorious. They poured out the stories on the \"Maryland man,\" but ignored a murdered Maryland mom. Also in April, there was a trial in Bel Air, Maryland against the assailant of Rachel Morin, a mother of five. An illegal alien named Victor Martinez-Hernandez, 24, was found guilty of first-degree premeditated murder, first-degree rape, third-degree sexual assault and kidnapping after the jury deliberated less than 50 minutes. The trial and the verdict were ignored. Notice which anecdote ABC, CBS and NBC promotes, and which they don’t. If it makes Trump look bad, it’s big news. If it sounds like a Trump talking point, it’s not news. On April 16, Team Trump brought Rachel Morin’s grieving mother Patty into the White House briefing room to make a speech about her daughter’s violent death in 2023. ABC and CBS still ignored her. NBC finally threw in a measly 12 seconds from Gabe Gutierrez in passing, who treated it as a Trump talking point: \"Late today, The White House highlighting the story of Patty Morin, whose daughter Rachel was killed by an undocumented immigrant.\" So, here’s the math again: 143 and a half minutes on \"Maryland man,\" compared to 12 seconds on \"Maryland mom.\" That’s 717 times more coverage on their anointed illegal immigrant. Negative angles on Garcia were downplayed or ignored. In 2021, his wife Jennifer Vazquez Sura filed a restraining order charging Garcia with punching and scratching and bruising her. This was barely acknowledged on the broadcast networks. Most soundbites from her were supportive valentines urging his return to America. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Over on the April 18 edition of NBC’s \"Today,\" senior White House correspondent Garrett Haake played the sympathy card: \"Garcia’s wife said overnight that her prayers have been answered now that she knows her husband is still alive, but he’s also still not coming back to Maryland.\" CNN commentator Scott Jennings defends the Trump administration's efforts to deport illegal immigrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia.(Screenshot/CNN) The April 18 edition of ABC’s \"Good Morning America\" had an interview with Abrego Garcia’s wife, which spurred an actual question about the domestic violence report. Michael Strahan asked: \"You did take out a temporary order of protection against your husband in 2021. Were you in fear of your husband?\" She demurred: \"My husband is alive. That’s all I can say.\" Strahan buckled and actually said: \"OK, then I won’t push you on that, apparently.\" The broadcast networks suggested that somehow the Trump administration falsely accused Garcia of being an MS-13 gang member, when the Department of Homeland Security noted this was a finding in Garcia’s court proceedings, including the testimony of a confidential informant. Now they’re ignoring reports that Garcia was driving an SUV in a 2022 Tennessee traffic stop owned by a man who was himself deported after pleading guilty to smuggling illegal aliens in 2020. Garcia claimed he was transporting his passengers to Maryland from Texas for construction work, although the state trooper found no luggage in the SUV. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP So, here’s the math again: 143 and a half minutes on \"Maryland man,\" compared to 12 seconds on \"Maryland mom.\" That’s 717 times more coverage on their anointed illegal immigrant. The televised passion for Garcia cooled this week just as Democrats worried this issue was not working for them, that immigration was working for Trump. Four leftist House Democrats who flew to El Salvador seeking a Garcia meeting did not make the news, unlike the network celebrations of Van Hollen’s trip. This underlines that network \"news judgment\" has an unmistakable tendency to align with Democratic political objectives. That’s why trust in the \"mainstream\" networks has cratered.

    "title": "NEWT GINGRICH: The best way to pay tribute to Pope Francis",
    "article_text": "Catholic Connection radio show host Teresa Tomeo describes the emotional reaction to Pope Francis' procession moving his casket to St. Peter's Basilica. Callista and I attended the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception inWashington, D.C., three times this past Holy Week. The Basilica is the largest Catholic Church in America – and one of the 10 largest churches in the world. It seats more than 3,500 people, and on Easter Sunday it was standing room only. While watching people receive communion, I was struck by the extraordinary diversity of people at the Basilica. On every one of the three days, the variety of dress and ethnicities was a tribute to the fact that theRoman CatholicChurch is truly universal. 5 WAYS POPE FRANCIS IMPACTED THE CATHOLIC CHURCH As the Basilica points out on its website, with more than 80 chapels and oratories, the diversity of the Catholic faith around the world is well represented: \"Among the nationalities and ethnicities represented throughout the Basilica are African, Austrian, Chinese, Cuban, Czech, Filipino, French, German, Guamanian, Hungarian, Indian, Irish, Italian, Korean, Latin American, Lebanese, Lithuanian, Maltese, Polish, Slovak, Slovenian, and Vietnamese.\" Pope Francis waves during an audience with Hungarian pilgrims in Paul VI hall at the Vatican on April 25, 2024.(Fillipo Monteforte/AFP via Getty) The late Pope Francis’s emphasis on helping and loving everyone dramatically furthered the attractiveness and growth of the Catholic Church. In Africa and South Asia especially, there has been a dramatic increase in those who adopt Catholicism. This was reflected duringEasterWeek at the Basilica. When Archbishop Jorge Mario Bergoglio chose Francis as his papal name in 2013, it was a clear signal of commitment to a papacy focused on and dedicated to serving the poor. Just like Saint Francis of Assisi, Pope Francis was determined to rekindle the spirit of Christ’s passion to help the less fortunate, downtrodden, and marginalized. Just last Thursday, deeply ailing and only four days from his death, Pope Francis went to Regina Caeli, Rome’s central prison, to meet with 70 inmates. He washed the feet of 12 of them in the tradition of Christ washing the feet of the Apostles. Pope Francis’s commitment to reach out to everyone was a powerful signal of caring and inclusion that opened the doors of the Church to those in spiritual and physical need across the entire planet. This openness to everyone was on display at the Basilica last week. POPE FRANCIS DEAD AT 88 YEARS OLD I have long been haunted by somethingRev. Martin Luther King Jr.asserted in his great Aug. 28, 1963, \"I have a Dream Speech\" at the Lincoln Memorial. He said, \"I think it is one of the tragedies –– one of the shameful tragedies –– that 11 o’clock on Sunday morning is one of the most segregated hours, if not the most segregated hour, in Christian America.\" Rev. King gave us a powerful test for moving beyond the baseline of legal desegregation toward a genuinely integrated society for all Americans. I think Rev. King andPope Franciswould have been proud of the unity, sincerity, and friendliness I witnessed at the Basilica last week. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION It may now be that the most united hour in America happens at the Basilica and other great churches. When Callista and I attended Mass at Saint Patrick’s Cathedral inNew York City, we had the same sense of people from every background coming together to worship in a community of faith. We experienced the same sense of universality for the three and a half years Callista served as U.S. Ambassador to the Holy See. With the second-largest diplomatic representation of any country in the world (next to Washington, D.C.) sitting in the diplomatic corps for Christmas Eve Mass atSaint Peter’s Basilicareminded us how diverse the world is – and how much that diversity is captured in the Catholic Church.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Julie Wainwright has taken two companies public, a pretty incredible feat by any standard. Yet in her new memoir,Time to Get Real, she offers readers something even more valuable: a blunt look at the messy realities of leadership. Wainwright shares the kinds of tough truths that many high-achieving CEOs can relate to but rarely discuss publicly, including the aftermath of what many would consider her first major setback, which was shutting down Pets.com during the 2000 market crash. If you’re of a certain age, you definitely remember it. The online pet supplies startup had become instantly recognizable thanks to its memorablesock puppet mascotand catchy slogan, “Because pets can’t drive.” But what seemed like just a fleeting moment in the dot-com bubble’s burst would cast a shadow over Wainwright’s career for nearly a decade. “When I would talk to recruiters, it was like, ‘No one’s going to hire you anymore,’” Wainwright said in an interview with this editor earlier this week. It came as a shock, given that Wainwright’s career trajectory initially seemed unstoppable. After cutting her teeth at Clorox, she rose through tech companies in the ‘90s when female leadership in the sector was exceedingly rare. As CEO of Berkeley Systems and later the online video store Reel.com, she worked “tons of hours” but was happy and, by her telling, succeeding, including growing Reel.com’s revenue from $3 million to $25 million — a time during which the company wassoldto Hollywood Video. “I just operated better without a boss,” she said. Then came the collapse that would have permanently derailed many careers. In 2000, Wainwright took Pets.com public, only to shut it down later that same year during the dot-com bubble burst. The professional blow was exacerbated by a personal one: she says that on the very same day she informed employees of the company’s closure, her husband asked for a divorce. “My work is gone, I’m getting a divorce, and I don’t have children,” Wainwright, then 42, recalls thinking as she faced what felt like total life collapse. Making matters worse, the media coverage was “incredibly negative and intrusive,” to the point that she says days after the company’s closure, reporters showed up at her doorstep. Wainwright describes what followed as a kind of long winter, where she was only offered roles leading turnaround efforts at failing companies. But that crossroads led to a remarkable second act. In 2010, she foundedThe RealReal, helping in the process to pioneer the luxury consignment market online. Like a lot of founders, Wainwright first set up the company out of her own home, but it soon outgrew her living room, and today, it processes many hundreds of thousands of different luxury items each month that it aims to sell within 90 days out of its more than 1.2 million square feet of warehouse space. It’s also publicly traded; in her second trip to Wall Street, in 2019, Wainwright took the outfit through the traditional IPO process. Unfortunately, this comeback has its own harsh chapter. In 2022, Wainwright was abruptly pushed out of The RealReal by board members she had recommended – another twist she doesn’t shy away from sharing. Instead, she names names in the book, and earlier this week, she described the move as a “power play” by an investor who “didn’t get his money out of the company and thought he could run the company better.” Wainwright — who fully supports the company’scurrent CEO(she was the company’s first hire) — is still miffed. She noted in conversation that “no founder is ever going to say they need to be shot and removed,” and it’s that honestly that makes the book – and Wainwright herself — so refreshing. In the corporate world, where people often spin narratives to make themselves look bulletproof, Wainwright is a straight shooter. If she doesn’t like something, she isn’t going to hold her punches. If someone spins the story differently than she sees it, she’ll call it out. Where she messes up, she says so. Even better about this memoir — in this reader’s opinion — is Wainwright’s ability to offer not just personal revelations but practical wisdom. She walks readers through her decision to bonus her sales staff a certain way, and shares her learnings about a leadership-evaluation quadrant she gleaned from McKinsey executives, including the realization she had hired one of the worst types: a “dumb aggressive,” meaning, in her words, someone whose “need to bully and coerce and to be on top supersede their abilities.” There’s also an interesting new chapter unfolding. Wainwright is continuing her entrepreneurial journey withAhara, a nutrition company that’s developing personalized dietary recommendations based on genetics and individual needs. You can find our full conversationhere, via TechCrunch’s StrictlyVC Download podcast. In the meantime, if you’re interested in a read that’s almost equal parts memoir and manual, offering founders something much more worthwhile than idealized success stories, you can pick up the bookhere.

These DeepMind employees are reportedly unhappy about Google’s decision to removea pledge not to use AI for weapons or surveillancefrom its website. They’re also concerned about the company’s work with the Israeli military, including a $1.2 billion cloud computing contract that hasprompted protests elsewhere at Google. One source told the FT that team members feel “duped,” and correspondence reportedly shows that at least five DeepMind staff members have quit citing these issues. DeepMind has around  2,000 total staff members in the United Kingdom. A Google spokesperson told the FT that the company encourages “constructive and open dialogue with all of our employees.” A small group of around 200 employees of Google and its parent company Alphabet previouslyannounced that they were unionizing, though as a union representing just a tiny slice of the total Google workforce, it lacked the ability to collectively bargain.

And it will completely stop launching new Nest products in Europe. That means owners of the Nest thermostats released in 2011 and 2012 (as well as the version released in Europe in 2014) won’t receive updates, and their devices will no longer be supported in the Nest and Home apps. They will, however, be able to adjust temperature and schedules directly on their devices. “To fully invest in [future] advancements and bring you the most cutting-edge features on our latest generation of Nest thermostats, we will be transitioning away from supporting three of our oldest devices, each over a decade old,” Google said. As for why it will no longer launch Nest thermostats in Europe, the company added, “Heating systems in Europe are unique and have a variety of hardware and software requirements that make it challenging to build for the diverse set of homes.” Existing Nest devices will still be sold in Europe while supplies last.

We’ve got tons of news for you this week: Slate EVs spotted in the wild; Airbnb pricing updates; a hack at Blue Shield; and much more. Let’s go! Get a clue:Cluely is an AI-based tool thathelps people cheaton exams, sales calls, and even job interviews. Though one of the co-founders was kicked out of Columbia over a similar tool, and one of thecompany’s ads falls short, Cluely boasts a $5.3 million monthly ARR. Guess cheaters do win sometimes? I’m interested:EV maker Slate has operated in relative secrecy until TechCrunch published a report revealing Bezos’ financial involvement, as well as its plan to price its EV at around $25,000. Now the company isplanting concept carsaround LA to garner interest. Seeing red:Tesla had its Q1 earnings call on Tuesday, and we got a look at how the company is doing. In short,it’s not doing well: Tesla’s net income reflects a 71% drop from the same quarter last year, and it was the worst quarter for Tesla deliveries in more than two years.

The insurance giant said it used Google Analytics to track how its customers used its websites, but a misconfiguration had allowed for personal and health information to be collected as well.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Amazon is raising eyebrows with the timing ofits big book salefor 2025, which runs from April 23 to 28 — which means it’s competing directly withIndependent Bookstore Day. As writer Maris Kreismanexplained in Lit Hub, Independent Bookstore Day is an annual event organized by the American Booksellers Association (ABA), with events, special guests, and exclusive merchandise at 1,600 participating bookstores. And this year, it’s taking place on April 26 (today). “I implore you: if you live near an indie bookstore (and I know that many of us still don’t and I hope one day we all do), you must go,” Kreizman said. Indie bookstores do appear to be on the upswing in the United States, at leastaccording to last year’s numbers from the ABA. But of course, Amazon remains dominant — in 2020,a House committee estimatedthat the company controlled more than 50% of the total online and offline print book market, and it’s even more dominant in e-books. So it’s not exactly a good look for the company to time its big sale to compete with a nationwide, celebratory bookstore event. In fact, Bookshop.org — an Amazon competitor thatpartners with indie bookstores— emailed customers with a note from CEO Andy Hunter describing Amazon’s sale as “a calculated move by a company that has already put half the bookstores in the country out of business, controls over 60% of the market and sells far more books than all indie bookstores combined.” “The people at Amazon responsible for the timing of their ‘Book Sale’ should be ashamed, but they are shameless,” Hunter said. Amazon, however,released a statementdescribing the timing overlap as “unintentional”: “The dates for our sale were set this year to accommodate additional participating countries.” Given the company’s scale, it’s certainly possible that Independent Bookstore Day barely registered with the people scheduling the sale. Even so,ABA CEO Allison Hill told Vulture, “At best it’s insensitive and at worst it seems like a tactic to hurt small businesses.” Topics Anthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Perhaps no one in the world has made such catastrophic tech flubs this year as U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. The saga started when the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg,reportedthat he had beenmistakenly addedto an unauthorized Signal group chat by U.S. National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, where numerous high-ranking government officials discussed detailed plans for attacking the Houthis in Yemen, including the times and places where such attacks would occur. To be fair, we’ve all made some embarrassing tech mistakes. But for most people, that means accidentally liking an ex’s Instagram post from five years ago — not sharing top-secret government military plans on a commercial messaging app with unauthorized recipients. This mishandling of massively sensitive information was already troublesome enough, but this week, The New York Timesreportedthat Hegseth shared information about the attacks on Yemen in another Signal chat, which included his lawyer, his wife, and his brother, who had no reason to receive such sensitive information; Hegseth’s wife doesn’t even work for the Pentagon. These security failures are particularly egregious — how do you manage to accidentally loop in a journalist on your military plans? But this is far from the first time that contemporary technology has landed global governments in tricky situations — and we’re not just talking Watergate. The fitness tracking/social media appStravacan be a privacy nightmare, even for your average athlete. The app allows people to share their exercise logs — often runs, hikes, or bike rides — on a public account with their friends, who can like and comment on their morning jogs in the park. But Strava accounts are public by default, meaning that if you aren’t savvy enough to check your privacy settings, you will inadvertently broadcast to the world exactly where you work out. Strava defaults to hiding the first and last 200 meters of a run as a means of obscuring where someone lives, since people are likely to begin and end runs near their home. For anyone on the internet, it’s still risky to broadcast a 200-mile radius of where you live, but it’s even more dangerous if you’re amember of the military at a secret base, for instance. In 2018, Strava unveiled a global heat map, showing where in the world public users have logged activities. This doesn’t really matter if you’re looking at a map of New York City, but in places like Afghanistan and Iraq, few people use Strava aside from foreigners, so one can assume that hot spots of activity may occur at or around military bases. Okay here is where things get problematic: Via Strava, using pre-set segments we can scrape location specific user data from basically public profiles (and yes those exist w/in bases and lead us straight so social media profile of service members).https://t.co/VDNBGcKvIY To make matters worse, users could look at certain running routes on Strava to see the public profiles of the users who logged activities there. So, it would be possible for a bad actor to find a list of U.S. soldiers stationed at a certain base in Iraq, for example. Venmois a peer-to-peer payments app, yet for some reason, it defaults to publicly sharing your transactions. So, by simply opening my Venmo app — which synced my Facebook friends to my account at some point, probably over 10 years ago — I can see that two girls I went to high school with got dinner together last night. Good for them. The information we share on Venmo can be pretty boring and benign, but dedicated fans of reality shows like “Love Is Blind” will search for contestants’ accounts to predict who from the show is still dating (if the couple sends each other rent money, then yes, they probably live together). So, if you can find reality stars on Venmo, why not search for the president? In 2021, some BuzzFeed News reporters decided to search forJoe Biden’s Venmo. Within 10 minutes, they found his account. From Biden’s account, the reporters could easily find other members of the Biden family and his administration and map out their broader social circles. Even if a user makes their account on Venmo private, their friends list will remain public. When BuzzFeed News contacted the White House, Biden’s profile was wiped clean, but the White House didn’t provide a comment. So, yes, reporters did indeedlocate the Venmo accountsof Pete Hegseth, Mike Waltz, and other government officials, too. Some things never change. You can take all of the precautions you want to protect your messages, but nothing can save you from the looming possibility of human error. Carles Puigdemont, the former president of Catalonia, led a movement in 2017 to attain independence from Spain and become its own country. But the Spanish government blocked this attempt and ousted Puigdemont from leadership. When the Spanish government issued a warrant for the arrest of Puigdemont and his allies, they fled to Belgium. A few months later, the Spanish media attended an event in Belgium where Puigdemont was expected to speak — he sent in a video of a speech instead, but as the clip was playing, a Spanish broadcaster noticed that a former Catalan health minister, Toni Comín, wastexting with his screen fully visible. The camera operator zoomed in on Comín’s phone, exposing texts from Puigdemont, where he had resigned himself to defeat in his attempts to bring about Catalan independence. Puigdemont latertweetedthat he was expressing himself in a moment of doubt but that he didn’t intend to back down. No matter what steps you take to encrypt your private messages, you might want to look over your shoulder before reading sensitive information in public — especially when you’re texting with a self-exiled former president.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us A new app calledLatelylaunched on the App Store a few weeks ago, targeting people with ADHD to help them arrive on time and rewarding them for doing so. The service is designed to help users manage their travel plans by notifying them when it’s time to leave for a trip, sending reminders 30 minutes, 10 minutes, and 5 minutes before departure. It also features Live Activities on iPhone and Apple Watch that display a countdown to leave. To encourage timely departures, Lately employs a point reward system with four difficulty levels. The easiest level, “Goldfish,” awards users 3 points for being early, 2 points for being on time, and 0 for being late, while the other levels — “Coffee,” “Grown Up,” and “Yoda” — become progressively less forgiving. Yoda, for instance, deducts 2 points for being late. As users accumulate points, they level up and unlock various virtual characters within the app that serve as achievement badges. While the reward may appear simple, it may provide users with a sense of progress and accomplishment. Lately was created by indie developer Erik MacInnis to address challenges faced by individuals with ADHD, particularly related to time management. “I’ve always been the ‘late one’ in my friend group,” MacInnis told TechCrunch. “For many of us, our toughest challenges to leaving on time are time blindness and poor time estimation. Lately addresses both of these problems by keeping the user constantly aware of when to leave, and it’s gamified, so you get points when you arrive on time, which honestly feels good.” While other similar apps exist — such as an Android app calledTime to Leave— MacInnis believes they’re outdated. ADHD apps likeStructuredandTickTickare mainly for task management and don’t specifically address time blindness for commuting. During our testing, we found Lately to be helpful, but we wish it could provide time estimations for commuters in large cities who use public transportation or biking. Currently, the app only offers options for driving or walking. Despite this small limitation, we believe the app can be successful among its target demographic. Individuals with ADHD frequently feel unmotivated, and specialists often suggest utilizing a reward system to help with self-discipline. Another gamified app,Finch, has gained attention for its point system. The self-care app encourages users to complete daily chores at home or engage in other healthy habits by rewarding them with points that can be used to customize their virtual pet. MacInnis revealed future plans for Lately, which include a social feature that automatically notifies friends when users leave, when they are five minutes away, and when they arrive. An Android version is also part of the long-term roadmap. Lately is available for free, but there is also a premium subscription ($3 per month or $10 per year) that offers features like customizing difficulty levels and scheduling recurring trips.

As the startup behind ChatGPT, OpenAI is arguably the biggest AI player in town. Its meteoric riseto a $300 billion valuationhas spurred many employees to leave the AI giant to create startups of their own. The hype around OpenAI is so high that some of these startups, like Ilya Sutskever’s Safe Superintelligence and Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab, have been able to raise billions of dollars without even launching a product. But there are lots of other startups in the OpenAI mafia ecosystem. These range from AI search giant Perplexity to xAI,the new owner of X (formerly Twitter.)There’s also smaller outfits with some futuristic plans, like Living Carbon, which is creating plants that suck more carbon out of the atmosphere, or Prosper Robotics, which is building a robot butler. Below is a roundup of the most notable startups founded by OpenAI alumni. Siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei left OpenAI in 2021 to form their own startup, San Francisco-based Anthropic, that has longtouteda focus on AI safety.  Later, OpenAI co-founder John Schulmanjoined Anthropic in 2024, pledging to build a “safe AGI.” OpenAI reportedly remains multiple times larger than Anthropic by revenue ($3.7 billioncompared to$1 billionfor 2024, The Information reported). But Anthropic has quickly grown to become OpenAI’s biggest rival andwas valued at $61.5 billion in March 2025. OpenAI co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskeverleft OpenAI in May 2024after he was reportedlypart of a failed effortto replaceCEO Sam Altman. Shortly afterward, heco-founded Safe Superintelligence, or SSI, with “one goal and one product: a safe superintelligence,” he says. Details about what exactly the startup is up to are scant: It has no product and no revenue yet. But investors are clamoring for a piece anyway, and it’s been able to raise $2 billion, with its latest valuation reportedlyrising to $32 billionthis month. SSI is based in Palo Alto, California, and Tel Aviv, Israel. Mira Murati, OpenAI’s CTO, left OpenAI last year to found her own company, Thinking Machines Lab, whichemerged from stealthin February 2025, announcing (rather vaguely) that it will build AI that’s more “customizable” and “capable.” The San Francisco AI startup has no product or revenue butplenty of former top OpenAI researchersand isreportedly in the process of raisinga massive $2 billion seed round valuing it at $10 billion, minimum. Aravind Srinivas worked as a research scientist at OpenAI for a year until 2022, when he left the company to co-found AI search engine Perplexity. His startup has attracted a string of high-profile investors like Jeff Bezos and Nvidia, although it’s alsocaused controversyover alleged unethical web scraping. Perplexity, which is based in San Francisco, is currentlyraising about $1 billion at an $18 billion valuationas of March 2025. Kyle Kosic left OpenAI in 2023 to become a co-founder and infrastructure lead of xAI, Elon Musk’s AI startup that offers a rival chatbot, Grok. In 2024, however, hehopped backto OpenAI. Palo Alto-based xAIrecently acquired X, formerly Twitter, and gave the combined entity a valuation of $113 billion. The all-stock transaction raised some eyebrows but isa good deal if you’re betting on Musk’s empire. Emmett Shear is the former CEO of Twitch who wasOpenAI’s interim CEO in November 2023for a few days beforeSam Altman rejoined the company. Shear is working on hisown stealth startup, called Stem AI, TechCrunch revealedin 2024. Although there are few details about its activity and fundraising so far, it has already attracted funding from Andreessen Horowitz. Computer vision expert Andrej Karpathy was a founding member and research scientist at OpenAI, leavingthe startup to join Tesla in 2017to lead its autopilot program. Karpathy is also well-known for his YouTubevideosexplaining core AI concepts. He left Tesla in 2024 tofound his own education technology startup, Eureka Labs, a San Francisco-based startup that is building AI teaching assistants. Jeff Arnold worked as OpenAI’s head of operations for five months in 2016 before co-founding San Francisco-based accounting startup Pilot in 2017. Pilot, which focused initially on doing accounting for startups,last raised a $100 million Series C in 2021 at a $1.2 billion valuationand has attracted investors like Jeff Bezos. Arnold worked as Pilot’s COO untilleavingin 2024 to launch a VC fund. David Luan was OpenAI’s engineering VP until he left in 2020. After a stint at Google, in 2021 he co-founded Adept AI Labs, a startup that builds AI tools for employees. The startuplast raised $350 million at a valuation northof $1 billion in 2023, but Luanleft in late 2024 to oversee Amazon’s AI agents labafterAmazon hired Adept’s founders. Tim Shi was an early member of OpenAI’s team, where he focused on building safe artificial general intelligence (AGI), according to his LinkedIn profile. He worked at OpenAI for a year in 2017 but left to found Cresta, a San Francisco-based AI contact center startup that has raised over $270 million from VCs like Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, and others, according to apress release. The trio all worked at OpenAI in 2016 and 2017 as research scientists before founding Covariant, a Berkeley, California-based startup that builds foundation AI models for robots. In 2024,Amazon hired all three of the Covariant foundersand about a quarter of its staff. The quasi acquisition wasviewed by someas part of a broader trend of Big Tech attempting to avoid antitrust scrutiny. Maddie Hall worked on “special projects” at OpenAI but left in 2019 to co-found Living Carbon, a San Francisco-based startup that aims to create engineered plants that can suck more carbon out of the sky to fight climate change. Living Carbon raised a $21 million Series A round in 2023, bringing its total funding until then to $36 million, according to apress release. Shariq Hashme worked for OpenAI for 9 months in 2017 on a bot that could play the popular video game Dota, per his LinkedIn profile. After a few years at data-labeling startup Scale AI, he co-founded London-based Prosper Robotics in 2021. The startup says it’s working on a robot butler for people’s homes, a hot trend in robotics that other playerslike Norway’s 1XandTexas-based Apptronikare also working on. Jonas Schneider led OpenAI’s software engineering for robotics team but left in 2019 to co-found Daedalus, which builds advanced factories for precision components. The San Francisco-based startupraised a $21 million Series A last yearwith backing from Khosla Ventures, among others. Margaret Jennings worked at OpenAI in 2022 and 2023 until she left to co-found Kindo, whichmarkets itself as an AI chatbot for enterprises.Kindo has raised over $27 million in funding, lastraisinga $20.6 million Series A in 2024. Jennings left Kindo in 2024 to head product and research at French AI startup Mistral, according to her LinkedIn profile.

The new app, which today helps users craft videos for Instagram reels, stories, and other social posts, was downloaded an estimated 702,900 times on iOS devices during its first two days on the market. That’s around 37 times more downloads on iOS than CapCut saw in its first two days of availability, according to data from app intelligence providerAppfigures. As of Thursday, Edits had grown to 1.2 million iOS downloads and 5.9 million downloads on Android, for a total of 7.1 million. By comparison, CapCut was downloaded only 83.5K times in its first three days on iOS and Android. To be fair, CapCut was only available in half the global markets at launch, but even if its numbers were doubled or tripled, Edits would be far ahead. In the U.S. alone, Edits was downloaded 381,000 times in the first three days, while CapCut had been downloaded just 3,400 times during its U.S. debut. In this more direct comparison, Edits’ U.S. launch was 112x the size of CapCut’s. Edits’ fast adoption also led to the app achieving a high ranking during its debut, Appfigures found, which could help boost its downloads further and increase competition. These numbers are also a demonstration of how powerful Meta’s network effects are when it comes to launching new apps that benefit from its wider social networking ecosystem. The new Instagram companion app hit No. 1 on the U.S. iPhone App Store’s charts, including the Top Overall apps and Top Apps (minus games) on its first day, April 22. By day two, it dropped to No. 2 on both charts, then remained there, before falling to No. 3 by Friday. Because the App Store tracks top apps by number of downloads and velocity of new installs, that’s left Edits currently ranking higher than CapCut, which was No. 14 Overall and No. 10 among top non-game apps on the U.S. App Store after its first three days on the market. However, Edits still has a long way to go to catch up with CapCut’s overall user base. The ByteDance-owned app, popular with TikTok creators, launched in April 2020 and has since been downloaded oniOSandAndroid1.22 billion times worldwide, excluding China. So far, Edits hasreceived a mixed reaction from creators, reports social media marketing consultant, Lia Haberman, in her recent newsletter. Many praised the app’s ease-of-use, built-in analytics, ad-free nature, support for 4K video, and watermark-free exports. Critics pointed out that Edits still lacked features provided by CapCut, including things like templates and a plethora of transition effects. In time, Edits could still catch up to CapCut, but it could also then choose to add a paid tier as a means of monetization or introduce ads.

    "title": "Trump questions Putin's desire for peace after meeting Zelensky at the Vatican",
    "article_text": "Donald Trump has questioned Vladimir Putin's willingness to end the war in Ukraine following his meeting with the country's leader Volodymyr Zelensky on the sidelines of Pope Francis's funeral. Posting on social media after leaving Rome, Trump said he feared Putin was \"tapping me along\" after Moscow's strikes on Kyiv earlier this week, adding there was \"no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas\". Earlier in the day Trump and Zelensky were seen in deep discussion in St Peter's Basilica shortly before the funeral began. The White House described the 15-minute meeting with Zelensky as \"very productive\". The Ukrainian president said it had the \"potential to become historic\". It was Trump's first face-to-face encounter with the Ukrainian president since February's acrimonious Oval Office showdown. Writing on his Truth Social account, Trump said the Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities \"makes me think that maybe he doesn't want to stop the war, he's just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through 'Banking' or 'Secondary Sanctions?'\". Trump had previously said Russia and Ukraine were \"very close to a deal\" following Friday's three-hour talks between his envoy Steve Witkoff and the Russian president. The Kremlin meanwhile said on Saturday that Putin had confirmed to Witkoff Russia's readiness to enter into direct talks with Ukraine \"without preconditions\". Trump and Zelensky's sit down in Rome was the first time the leaders had come face-to-face since their White House meeting, when Trump told Zelensky \"you don't have the cards\" and he was not winning against Russia. He repeated that message this week, saying the Ukrainian leader had \"no cards to play\". Trump has previously blamed Ukraine for starting the war and has accused Zelensky multiple times of being an obstacle to peace negotiations. But the White House struck a more positive tone about Saturday's meeting, while Zelensky described the sit down as a \"very symbolic meeting that has potential to become historic, if we achieve joint results\". Two images were released of the meeting, showing the US leader in a blue suit and Ukrainian president in a black top and trousers, sitting opposite each other in intense conversation. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha also posted an image of the meeting on X with the caption: \"No words are needed to describe the importance of this historic meeting. Two leaders working for peace in St. Peter's Basilica.\" Another image posted by the Ukrainian delegation from inside St Peter's showed the two men standing alongside British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and France's Emmanuel Macron, his hand on Zelensky's shoulder. The implication was that the prime minister and French president had helped to bring the two together, against the sombre backdrop of the funeral. After the meeting, Trump and Zelensky walked down the steps of the basilica, where Zelensky's arrival was met with applause from the crowds, and took their seats in the front row. During the service, the pair sat a short distance from each other, with Macron and other heads of state in between. In his homily, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re spoke of Pope Francis's incessant calls for peace. \"'Build bridges, not walls' was an exhortation he repeated many times,\" said the cardinal. Ukrainian officials had talked of a possible second meeting but Trump's motorcade drove away from St Peter's immediately afterwards and his plane left Rome a short time later. Zelensky, however, later met Macron in the garden of Villa Bonaparte, home to the French embassy to the Holy See. He also met Sir Keir at Villa Wolkonsky, the British ambassador's residence, as well as holding separate talks with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. In a post on X, Macron said ending the war in Ukraine was an objective that \"we share in common with President Trump\", adding that Ukraine was ready for \"an unconditional ceasefire\". A Downing Street spokesperson said Starmer and Zelensky discussed the positive progress that had been made recently to \"secure a just and lasting peace in Ukraine,\" adding that the pair had agreed to \"maintain momentum\" and \"speak again at the earliest opportunity\". During February's heated White House exchange, Trumpaccused the Ukrainian president of \"gambling with World War Three\"by not going along with ceasefire plans led by Washington. Kyiv has been on the receiving end of growing pressure from Trump to accept territorial concessions as part of an agreement with Moscow to end the war. These concessions would reportedly include giving up large portions of land, including the Crimean peninsula which was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014. Zelensky has repeatedly rejected the idea in the past. He suggested to the BBC on Friday that \"a full and unconditional ceasefire opens up the possibility to discuss everything\". One hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party Five Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs. A federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.

    "title": "Thousands line streets of Rome as Pope Francis laid to rest after Vatican funeral",
    "article_text": "Pope Francis has been buried in Rome after a funeral ceremony and procession attended by hundreds of thousands of people and many heads of state. The first South American pontiff passed away on Monday aged 88, marking the end of a 12-year pontificate. As the Italian capital woke up to a hazy morning, teenage pilgrims, nuns and priests of all denominations filed silently down the streets leading to the Vatican. Many of the streets around St Peter's Basilica were closed - both to allow the flow of visitors and for security reasons, as more than a hundred foreign dignitaries were expected to join the funeral mass. More than 8,000 Italian police of different branches were out in force, as well as firefighters, medics, canine unit handlers, volunteers, members of the armed forces and even park guards. Many had been called in from all sides of Italy to be in Rome today - resulting in a rather joyous blend of accents from across the country, from the Sicilian to the Milanese. By 08:00 local time (06:00 GMT) much of the square was already full. Jessica, 22 and from Mexico, and Cyril, 20 and from the US, had arrived at dawn to secure a front row spot to the funeral mass. \"We never thought we'd be this close. We sacrificed a little sleep to be here but it's worth it,\" said Jessica. She's a Catholic and said her relatives in Mexico would \"never believe it\" when she told them she had been at the Vatican for the Pope's funeral. As heads of state and foreign dignitaries took their places to the right of the altar, hundreds of photographers in the press area on the roof of the colonnade snapped their cameras furiously, hoping to capture a candid image of US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whose last meeting in February gave rise to a combative exchange in the Oval Office. But soon after, as a striking photo of the two men sitting on two chairs inside St Peter's began to circulate, it emerged that they hadalready met for around 15 minutes before the service began. Later, Zelensky said the meeting \"had potential to become historic, if we achieve joint results\". No more details were shared, but some on social media later joked that, given the setting, the meeting had been a \"miracle\". Photos showed that UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Trump, Zelensky and French President Emmanuel Macron had also all met in the Vatican. From the bright red of the clergy's habits to the muted grey and blue of nuns' veils to the rainbow sun hats worn by pilgrims, all morning St Peter's Square was a riot of colours glistening in the sun. Hymns played out on giant speakers, occasionally drowned out by the sound of helicopters flying overhead, as drones and seagulls crisscrossed over Michelangelo's dome. Yet the voice of 91-year-old Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re rang loud and clear as he presided over the mass. The service's structure was very similar to that of any Catholic funeral mass, although the readings were done in many different languages and all hymns were sung in Latin. Outside St Peter's, a crowd the Vatican later said numbered 200,000 applauded as large screens showed Zelensky take his seat. There was also applause when the Pope's simple wooden coffin was brought out. The crowd's applause marked some other salient moments - such as when Cardinal Re, as part of his homily, remembered the Pope's commitment to migrants and peace. He mentioned that the Pope's first trip had been to the Italian island of Lampedusa, the port of arrival in Europe for many migrants who make the perilous journey across the Mediterranean, and recalled the mass the Pope celebrated at the US-Mexico border. \"War, he said, results in the death of people and the destruction of homes, hospitals and schools. War always leaves the world worse than it was before: it is always a painful and tragic defeat for everyone.\" The cardinal emphasised that Pope Francis had repeatedly urged the world to \"build bridges, not walls\". \"It was good to hear that on a day when so many heads of state were on St Peter's Square,\" a woman called Maria told the BBC. She and her friend Grazia had flown in from Sardinia especially for the funeral. \"It was a message especially for them, I think, because it's them who decide whether there's going to be war or peace, not us... Let's hope something made it through to them.\" \"Otherwise them being here was just pure hypocrisy,\" added Grazia. During communion, a procession of white-clad priests made its way down St Peter's Square, carrying golden chalices full of wafers for communion, as many in the large crowd moved forward to receive the hosts. Soon after, Cardinal Re blessed the Pope's coffin with holy water, before burning incense in a thurible - a symbol of cleansing - and the basilica's bells tolled three times after the blessing of the coffin was carried out. After some brief mingling, world leaders started making their way out of the basilica. Their motorcades then filed out of the Vatican. Within an hour Trump was reported to be back on Air Force One, while other leaders held various informal meetings in Rome. Meanwhile, the Pope's coffin was carried through Rome in a slow procession to the church of Santa Maria Maggiore for burial. Authorities said 140,000 had lined the streets, clapping and waving as the hearse – a repurposed white popemobile – crossed the Tiber river and drove past some of Rome's most recognisable sights: the Colosseum, the Forum and the Altare della Patria national monument on Piazza Venezia. Once the coffin reached Santa Maria Maggiore, it was taken inside and the live broadcast ceased. Pope Francis was buried in the righthand side of the church, near a beloved icon of the Virgin Mary, at around 15:00. Visitors, pilgrims and the clergy vacated St Peter's Square quickly. Many could be seen minutes later in the numerous cafes, restaurants and pizzerias of the historic Borgo Pio neighbourhood nearby. Grazia from Sardinia said the funeral had made a big impression on her. \"It was wonderful to meet in a single square with people who come from every corner of the world and to live a shared moment. This is the legacy of the Pope,\" she said. Officials said the day had unfolded without any major incidents. \"Four hundred thousand people shared a historic and emotional moment, and thanks to everyone's commitment the day took place in a solemn and serene way, without critical issues,\" said the head of the Civil Protection, Fabio Ciciliano. The city of Rome and the Catholics of the world will now be preparing for the next momentous event - the conclave, which will select the next Pope. A date has not yet been set but it is thought it could start as early as 5 or 6 May, after the Novemdiales - the mandatory nine days of mourning - are over. With 135 cardinals set to attend, it will be the largest conclave in modern history andone of the most unpredictable. Over the past few days, cardinals wandering around Rome were hounded by journalists trying to get a steer on what the conclave might yield. After the funeral, too, the Cardinal of Tonga Soane Patita Paini Mafi was approached by the media as he made his way out of St Peter's Square. After a South American pope, is it time for an Asian one, he was asked. Cardinal Mafi laughed and pointed to the sky. \"Only He knows,\" he said. Michelle O'Neill said the late Pope was a \"man of humility\". Many world leaders and royals have gathered among mourners at the Vatican - here are the pictures of them there. First Minister John Swinney is among the Scots who have travelled to the Italian capital for the ceremony. Four Catholics from Nottinghamshire said it was important to pay their respects. Catholics across the region have been attending services to bid farewell to Pope Francis.",

    "title": "'Kicking butt' or 'going too fast'? Trump voters reflect on 100 days",
    "article_text": "When Donald Trump made a historic return to power earlier this year, it was with the help of voters who represented a diverse coalition of backgrounds - truck drivers, veterans, business owners and more. They represented a wide range of perspectives that helpedexplain Trump's enduring appeal. But 100 days after he took office, how do his staunchest supporters feel now? The BBC has returned to five of them. Here's what they had to say about the promises he kept, the pledges he has yet to address, and what they want next. Luiz Oliveira says he \"can't keep up\" with the rapid policy changes Trump has made in his first 100 days. On immigration, he has appreciated the flurry of new border restrictions and the emphasis on deportations, including sending men to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador. Encounters between migrants and US border agents at the US-Mexico are now at a four-year low. The issue is important to Luiz, a Brazilian who came to the US legally in the 1980s and now lives in Nevada. Echoing Trump, he describes the influx of migrants in recent years as an \"invasion\". Luiz, 65, says Trump is telling undocumented immigrants: \"This is my house, my yard, and you're not going to stay here.\" In other areas, however, he, is nervous about Trump's approach. The coffee shop owner supports Trump's efforts to make other countries pay \"their fair share\" through tariffs. But he's apprehensive about the short-term economic effects as well as how long it could take for America to see the benefits. \"It's going to be painful [and] I don't think it's going to be as fast as he says. \"I'm a supporter, but at the end of the day, if this doesn't work, I'll say it's a mistake - he did things too fast, scared the markets, scared the economy.\" Amanda Sue Mathis backed Trump in 2024 because she felt he was the best candidate to address America's most pressing problems - 100 days in, she says he's made strong progress. \"There were a lot of people who cared about the wars in the Middle East and Ukraine, but I think it's time we look at our country and get things in order before we go fix other countries' problems,\" the 34-year-old Navy veteran says. She wants a \"merit-based society\" and praises Trump's rollback of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies which had tried to boost minority representation and tackle discrimination. Critics say those policies are themselves discriminatory - and Amanda Sue believes they went too far in recent years. She also welcomes Trump's executive orders restricting gender care for Americans under the age of 19 and banning transgender women from female sports. Broadly, she thinks the president is \"kicking butt\" and his first 100 days have made her \"happier with [her] vote\". But Amanda Sue is prepared to have her mind changed too. \"I'm not one of those people who is always for Trump,\" she says. \"If he messes up, I'll be the first one to tell you.\" Trump's promise to impose tariffs and bring manufacturing jobs back to America was a key reason why Ben Maurer, a 39-year-old freight truck driver from Pennsylvania, voted for the president. \"A lot of people thought he was bluffing on more than a few things,\" he says. So Ben's delighted Trump hit the gas immediately, imposing tariffs on countries that range from allies like Canada and Mexico to adversaries like China. It has not been a smooth ride, however. In a tumultuous series of announcements, the administration has raised, lowered, delayed and retracted tariffs in response to ongoing trade negotiations and stock market reaction. Currently, the US has imposed a 10% tariffs on all imports - and China has been hit with a 145% tax on goods it exports to America. Despite economists' concerns about higher prices, Ben believes the businesses he delivers to will benefit in the long run. \"Trump has earned back the respect [for the US],\" he says of the president's tariff policies. \"We are still the force to be reckoned with.\" Overall, he feels Trump has been more productive at the start of his second term. The president had time to prepare, he says, and it shows. June Carey's opinion of Donald Trump has not changed, but the first few months of Trump's second term are not what she anticipated either. \"He's a bit more aggressive and a little bit more erratic than I expected,\" the California artist says. But June, 70, doesn't see the surprises as negative. She is \"blown away\" by the \"waste\" the so-called Department of Government Efficiency - led by billionaire Trump ally Elon Musk - says it has found. Critics say his claims about savings appear to be inflated and he has faced a backlash for blunt cuts at government departments that were later reversed, including firings of key federal workers. June says she's uncertain about Musk himself. \"Musk is a character I don't understand,\" June says. \"My feeling is that if Trump has trusted him as much as he has, than he must be a pretty good guy with the right ideas and the right goals.\" She previously told the BBC she was concerned about welfare spending and hoped Trump would push Americans to be more self-sufficient. While she is happy with the cuts so far, she hopes they leave alone social security - the monthly government payments that she and 67 million retired or disabled Americans live off. Democrats warn those are at risk in future, but June asks: \"Why would they cut [social security] when they've cut so many things that have saved them millions and millions of dollars?\" Jeremy Stevens has faithfully stood by Trump for years. \"[Trump is] very aggressively getting things he promised on the campaign trail done,\" he says. At his automotive repair and used car shop in Maine, Jeremy sees some customers who feel differently about Trump's economic efforts. But the 45-year-old believes their nerves around tariffs in particular come from \"a lack of understanding\". The tariffs are part of a Trump administration vision that Jeremy believes will pay off in the long run - if critics can hold on until then. \"There definitely is a perception out there about the impact of these policies that is short-sighted,\" he says. Trump's back-and-forth shift on tariff policies have come at a price, economists say. Markets around the world were sent spiralling. The International Monetary Fund has cut its global growth forecast because of the uncertainty, with the US hardest hit. It warned there is a 40% chance of a recession in the US. But Jeremy is convinced time will prove Trump right. \"It's a temporary pain,\" he says. \"This too shall pass.\" One hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party A federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister. The prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein and the Duke of York has died at the age of 41. Giuffre alleged she was trafficked to the Duke of York when she was 17, which he has strenuously denied.

    "article_text": "A man has been arrested and counter-terrorism police are investigating after two women were seriously injured in an attack involving a crossbow and a firearm in Leeds. Three people were found injured and taken to hospital - including the suspected attacker - in Otley Road, in the Headingley area, at 14:47 BST. A 38-year-old man who suffered a \"self-inflicted injury\" was arrested and two weapons - a crossbow and a firearm - were recovered from the scene. Counter Terrorism Policing North East said it had taken over the investigation from West Yorkshire Police and an extensive cordon remained in place in the Otley Road area. Det Ch Supt James Dunkerley said: \"From the enquiries undertaken so far, there is no evidence to suggest anyone else was involved in the attack, and, at this time, we are not looking for anyone else in relation to the incident.\" A spokesperson said extensive inquiries were continuing to establish \"the full circumstances and explore any potential motivation\". Assistant Chief Constable Carl Galvin said: \"Clearly this has been a shocking incident and we fully realise the concern it has caused. \"Due to the enquiry being active we are limited in what we can say, but I do want to reassure residents that everything possible is being done to investigate and understand what took place.\" He said uniformed officers were in the Otley Road area \"to reassure residents and continue our enquiries at the crime scenes\". \"I also want to thank members of the public for the support they gave victims and the emergency services as we attended the scene. \"We would strongly urge people not to speculate online or share information or footage which could affect the active investigation and continue to work closely with colleagues from Counter Terrorism Policing North East.\" The incident happened on the Otley Run, which is a popular pub crawl route in Leeds. Those participating in the run could be seen in fancy dress outside venues on Otley Road, close to where the incident happened. Taylor's Sports Bar & Grill, a venue which is part of the pub crawl, announced on social media it would be closed until further notice. A statement on its Facebook page said the closure was \"due to unforeseen circumstances\", before apologising to customers. Joanna Myers, owner of the Swine Bistro on Otley Road said: \"It was all very shocking, especially with all the Otley runners out. \"It could have been a lot worse than it was.\" Ali Khan, owner of Indian restaurant The Cat's Pyjamas, which is on Otley Road, said people were \"afraid and concerned\" following the incident. \"We didn't find it safe to go out anywhere unless we knew what was going on,\" he said. \"I told all my staff members to stay inside and stay safe and vigilant.\" Chancellor of the Exchequer and MP for Leeds West and Pudsey Rachel Reeves said it was \"shocking\" and asked anyone with information to contact the police. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said her thoughts were with the victims of the incident. She said she was being updated on the situation and thanked police and emergency services for \"their swift response\".

    "title": "Trying to book a driving test 'like buying a festival ticket', say learners",
    "article_text": "Some people used the Easter Monday bank holiday as a chance to have a much-needed lie-in. Not Stephen Dawes, who set his alarm for 05:45. It wasn't to start work or to catch a train - he just wanted to book his driving test. When he logged into the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) website, he entered an online queue \"almost like buying a festival ticket\", he says. \"I was number 11,000 in the queue.\" The 26-year-old, who lives in Newcastle, started learning to drive in February. His instructor told him about a month ago tobook his practical test, but each time Stephen looked, the only slots available were in Berwick-upon-Tweed or Scarborough, both more than an hour's drive away. After looking online, he discovered the trick was to log on at 06:00 on Mondays, when the DVSA releases new slots. But some people say it takes several weeks of trying to secure one. Stephen's experience reflects those of other learner drivers across the UK, who tell BBC News they're on a road to nowhere with getting a driving exam booked during an ongoing test backlog. Some are even paying for apps that alert them when slots become available. BBC Verify found this week that theaverage waiting timeacross the 319 driving test centres in Great Britain was 22 weeks, with three-quarters of centres hitting the maximum average wait time of 24 weeks. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander haspledged to reduce the average waiting timeto no more than seven weeks by summer 2026, a deadline the government had previously set for the end of 2025. She said the current situation was \"totally unacceptable\" and that ministers would aim to clear the backlog with measures such as doubling examiner training capacity and reintroducing overtime pay incentives. Pauline Reeves, the DVSA's director of driver services, told the BBC the organisation had \"made significant progress\" in reducing wait times since last December but customers were not yet seeing this. Jodie Johnston, a driving instructor in Exeter, likens booking a test to the infamous annual scramble to buy tickets for Glastonbury Festival - and says some learners in London, where demand can be even higher, are travelling 200 miles to take their tests in Devon. \"It's easier to pass a test than book a test at the moment,\" adds Ali Slade, a driving instructor in Farnham. One consequence of the long wait list is that many learners are trying to book their practical exam far in advance, despite DVSA advice stating that learner drivers should book it when they're \"test-ready\". And when learners eventually get a slot, for some it's so far in advance that they're having to fork out extra money on refresher lessons. Some learners say they're also worried about their theory tests expiring as they only last for two years - and you need one to take a practical test. Many driving schools have long waiting lists for lessons - Ali says hers is about seven months. It can therefore be difficult for learner drivers to align finding an instructor, passing their theory test, and booking a practical exam. This was the experience of Ella Davis, 26, from Leeds, who says her instructor told her to book her test as soon as she started learning. \"I had to book way before I was ready for a test and just guess when I would be ready,\" she says. Even then, when she looked, she struggled to find any slots in her area or at the right time. In the end, she booked a test for several months away, and then paid £18 for a mobile app that allowed her to change her test to an earlier date, in April 2024, so she wouldn't have to keep paying for more lessons when she already felt ready. Apps like these alert users when slots become available through other learners cancelling their tests. The DVSA says it does not endorse any apps that find cancellations. \"It just felt like the only way,\" Ella says. Lauren Devlin had put off using these apps, but she's worried she will soon be left with little choice. \"It felt a bit scammy to me… but at this point, I may just have to try,\" she says. Lauren, 37, got her driving licence in New Jersey, US, when she was 16. When she first moved to the UK, she relied on public transport to get around - but she's decided she would now like the freedom of being able to drive. Lauren estimates she's already spent about £2,000 on driving lessons, two theory tests and one practical test in summer 2024 that she failed. She has another test scheduled for August, for which she had to wake up early on multiple Monday mornings to join the online queue before she was able to book. But she's worried about what happens if it gets cancelled, or if she fails, as her theory certificate only lasts until next March. So, what's the cause of the current situation? A DVSA spokesperson has blamed an \"increase in demand and a change in customers' booking behaviour\" for the backlog. DVSA datashows that the number of people taking practical driving tests plummeted during waves of lockdowns in 2020 and 2021. There was then a surge in between September 2023 and March 2024, but the number of tests being taken is now similar to pre-pandemic levels. Just under 450,000 practical driving tests were taken between July and September 2024, the most recent data shows. The DVSA also says thatbots have been buying up some test slotsand thenreselling themat inflated prices. The agency says a high-speed consultation in May will aim \"to improve the booking system and block bots from accessing tests\". For some people, the difficulty of booking a test is just too much stress. Libby Murphy says she's \"just given up\" after failing her test in February, having had two previous tests cancelled by the test centre (the DVSA says it only cancels tests in \"exceptional circumstances\" and then offers the first available test in the area). Libby, who is 26 and lives in Liverpool, says she's had more than 100 hours of lessons and feels her decision to abandon it will harm her career aim of being a runner in the film industry. As she puts it: \"I've spent grands and grands and I've gotten nowhere.\" Rising costs, test delays and a low pass rate are putting people off becoming driving instructors. Dylan Whiteley, 17, has been trying to book a test for seven weeks, without success. Transport secretary Heidi Alexander said the government would provide at least 10,000 extra driving tests a month. BBC Verify finds that three quarters of British driving test centres have a 24-week wait to book a practical test. A bereaved mum is calling for the government to introduce graduate licences for young drivers.",

    "title": "Will this be the 'anyone but the big parties' local election?",
    "article_text": "\"A sliver here and a sliver there\" – in a few days millions of voters will be taking part in what are, frankly, a pretty weird set of elections. Forget the huge thwack of decisive national victory. Brace for what one former minister described as slivers of votes between five political parties, determining who wins and loses power over town halls in England, and one perch in the Commons. The results will set the political pace for the next few months. And from Friday, Reform could give the two big traditional tribes a problem, and also acquire a potential problem they haven't encountered thus far - a track record to defend. The largest parties are both likely to have a horrible time of it. Labour's wide coalition of voters went pop almost as soon as they moved into No 10. Calm heads in government say it was always going to be thus because of the state of the country when they took over. Sir Keir Starmer even told us on the record he was going to \"have to be unpopular\" – a curious ambition for a politician! But more candid insiders admit the government \"looked very unsure\" at the start. \"They didn't come in with a big project,\" one source says, and many voters took a dim view ofministers' freebiesand thedecision on winter fuel allowance. Labour loyalists and spin doctors will emphasise what is true – the elections being fought at council level are \"us fighting in the shires\", as one of them said. A poor performance in areas that are traditionally Tory, where the party prospered in 2021, won't be a surprise. One cabinet minister says, \"they're just not our heartlands, so we just haven't got our normal base\". But Labour could also lose mayors and there's no such excuse in what was one of their safest seats,in Runcorn, in the by-election where they could struggle to cling on. After 10 months in power, next week could show Labour how much the reality of government can really hurt. The Conservatives have also been falling over themselves to tell you just saying how awful it's going to be for them after they were, in the words of one senior figure, \"absolutely, mercilessly hammered\" back in July. The leadership says \"nowhere is safe\".  Some sources even warn in private they could lose all of the town halls they control. The concern behind the very public worry about losing hundreds and hundreds of seats is that \"we might not yet actually have hit the bottom\", in the words of another veteran. Leader Kemi Badenoch's backers continually say that rebuilding the party is a long-term project, and praise her for managing to draw at least a faint line under the toxic infighting that corroded Conservative ranks in recent years. The broad sense in Westminster is that dreadful results next week won't usher Badenoch to the door. Still, you'd be hard pressed to find a Conservative who'd happily bet their mortgage she'll definitely be in charge by the time of the next election. That's in large part because in the words of one Tory bigwig, \"she was working on the basis that it was her versus Starmer but it's not her versus Starmer,  it's her versus Starmer and Farage and Davey\". This election is pick and mix, with the newest morsels on offer coming from Nigel Farage's Reform UK. They see success in these elections as \"two or three more steps up the staircase\" towards power, says a senior figure. The other parties report Reform spending big, particularly on online advertising, focusing on national issues like immigration and net zero, and \"putting Farage out to draw a crowd\", according to a minister. Reform sources scent success. They hope they can nab Runcorn from Labour (although they aren't banking on it), but are more confident of winning mayoral races and of taking plenty of council seats. But anything less than big wins will undermine their exuberant claim that it's credible to see Farage in No 10 one day – and possibly, for that matter, give pollsters red faces again.

Reform might be the loudest group, but they're not the only one making life hard for the big boys. The Lib Dems reckon with a good night they might control more councils than the Tories this time next week – whether it's Oxfordshire or Wiltshire, Buckinghamshire or other parts of the South West. Leader Sir Ed Davey's been back in his happy place – carrying out ever more ridiculous stunts on the campaign trail, meeting hedgehogs, and even waving around packets of British pork chops on TikTok this time, (I'm not making that up). After July last year, the Lib Dems have a taste for making the Tories miserable, not just for the sake of it, but in the hope of taking out another chunk of their party's traditional infrastructure, in the shape of their county councillors. And party sources suggest their activists are more motivated, and their numbers even increasing, because of US President Donald Trump. Lastly, but not least, the Greens want to continue their steady march into council seats across England. In 2023 they had their best showing in 20 years and took majority control of a council for the first time, adding many more councillors to their number last year. This time round they want to add to the tally in counties like Shropshire, Gloucestershire and Kent, where they already have bums on seats. The Green MPs have made less noise than their other newbie rivals at the other end of the spectrum, Reform. So at a time when enthusiasm for the climate agenda has been fading, or at least evolving in both the big main parties, next week the Green Party will want to show it is a growing force. Any election is also a test of our political parties' campaign machines – the questions different for each this time round. For Labour, is it firing on all cylinders after its July triumph? Frankly, it doesn't seem to be running a campaign at full throttle this time, which given the geography of the contests, shouldn't surprise. For the Conservatives, how much of its once legendary campaigning muscle is left after getting whacked in the summer? Some loyalists are heartened there are still members willing to knock on doors. But a rival campaigner now calls them the \"tumbleweed Tories\", claiming they're nowhere to be seen on the ground. Both the Lib Dems and the Greens have long been playing effective local ground games, concentrating on building power bases in pockets of the country. The most acute test perhaps then is for Reform, who have proven time and time again they can make a lot of noise nationally, on air, and increasingly, online. In five-party politics, many races may be won with a relatively small share of the vote, by tiny margins, that \"sliver here and sliver there\". These elections are likely to result in real-life evidence of a political idea that's all the rage, that there's \"fragmentation\" among the public, the traditional voting blocs are no more. Excitable columns are already being penned in anticipation, proclaiming that two-party politics is dead. The splitting of the vote among so many groups also seems likely to leave more councils without any a clear majority. In that case, they go into what's known as \"no overall control\", so the biggest party needs votes from the others to get their way. It's likely that will pose the Conservatives with a tricky real-life question after many weeks of troublesome hypothetical arguments: will they, or won't they, work with their arch rivals Reform UK on the ground? Crucially, if Reform makes its expected big advances, it will for the first time have responsibility for decisions that affect people's lives.  That will be a big achievement. Both senior Labour and Conservative sources agree privately, as one said, \"the biggest thing to come out of Thursday night is that Reform will have a record to defend\". Next week the smaller parties are on track to have plenty to celebrate.  If the General Election was branded the \"ABC election – Anyone But the Conservatives\", maybe next week's ballots will be branded the \"ABB election – Anyone But the Big parties\".

    "title": "Area burned by UK wildfires in 2025 already at annual record",
    "article_text": "The area of the UK burnt by wildfires so far this year is already higher than the total for any year in more than a decade, satellite data suggests. More than 29,200 hectares (292 sq km or 113 sq miles) has been burnt so far, according to figures from the Global Wildfire Information System, which has recorded burnt area since 2012. That is more than the previous high of 28,100 hectares for the whole year of 2019. The prolonged dry, sunny weather in March and early April helped to create ideal conditions for widespread burning, according to researchers. Wildfires are very common in the UK in early spring, with plenty of dead or dormant vegetation at the end of winter that can dry out quickly. The switch back towetter conditions over the past couple of weekshas largely brought an end to the spell of fires for now, but not before reaching record levels. The figures from the Global Wildfire Information System only capture fires larger than roughly 30 hectares (0.3 sq km). More than 80 such fires have been detected across the UK since the beginning of the year. Most fires are deliberately or accidentally started by humans, but favourable weather conditions can make it much easier for fires to ignite and spread quickly. \"We had an exceptionally dry and sunny March,\" said Will Lang, head of risk and resilience services at the Met Office. \"This followed quite a wet autumn and winter, which can have the effect of increasing the vegetation that acts as fuel for any fire that does start.\" A lack of rainfall in March and April can be particularly conducive to fires. \"The vegetation is coming out of the winter and it has gone dormant, so it's not growing, and therefore it's very dry and doesn't have water,\" explained Guillermo Rein, professor of fire science at Imperial College London. \"Then in the spring, before you start to collect the water into the live tissue, there is a period where it's very flammable.\" The seven days from 2 to 8 April saw more than 18,000 hectares (180 sq km) burnt, the highest weekly figure on record. The BBC has also analysed satellite images to illustrate two of the biggest burns this year. InGalloway Forest Park, in south-west Scotland, an estimated 65 sq km burnt, nearly a quarter of the UK total. A fire in theCwm Rheidol areaof Wales, about 25 km (16 miles) from Aberystwyth, also burnt a large area of roughly 50 sq km. Fires have also been detected by satellite imagery on the Isle of Arran, the Isle of Bute and the Isle of Skye in Scotland, as well as in the Mourne Mountains in south-east Northern Ireland. All occurred in early April. These early season burns - predominantly grass, heath and shrub fires - have created great strain on fire services, but their ecological impacts can be complicated. Not all fires, particularly smaller, lower-intensity burns, are necessarily catastrophic to long-term vegetation health. Certain plants, such as heather, are adapted to fire-prone environments. But increasingly frequent or severe blazes can impair their ability to naturally recover. Some researchers are concerned about the second peak of the fire season, which typically comes later in the year when temperatures are high and vegetation has dried out again. \"My number one worry is what is going to happen in the summer,\" said Prof Rein, when \"there are fewer wildfires but they are bigger and they can actually be seriously catastrophic\". \"You can have 100 [small] wildfires across the whole country and all of them can be handled in one day, or you could have one summer wildfire that actually cannot be stopped in a week and actually goes on to burn houses.\" The recent widespread burns don't necessarily mean this summer will be a busy fire season. But scientists expect the UK to see an increase in weather conditions conducive to extreme wildfires in a warming world, even though there's lots of variation from year to year. Astudy led by the Met Officefound that the extreme \"fire weather\" that helped spread the destructive blazes of July 2022 were made at least six times more likely by human-caused climate change. Shifts in the way land is used can also play a key role in shaping fire risk. \"One thing that seems to have consensus is that we are likely to see more fires and possibly worse fires with climate change,\" said Rory Hadden, senior lecturer in fire investigation at the University of Edinburgh. \"We need to be prepared for this to become more common.\" Additional reporting by Phil Leake Sign up for our Future Earth newsletterto keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC's Justin Rowlatt.

    "title": "Virginia Giuffre's death leaves unanswered questions",
    "article_text": "The death of Virginia Giuffre will leave questions that are now likely to remain unanswered. Her name will always be associated with the scandals and criminality surrounding the late billionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his circle - with Ms Giuffre one of the most prominent among his accusers, revealing the trafficking and sexual exploitation of young women. The photo of her and Prince Andrew, taken in London in 2001, became emblematic of the royal's entanglement with Epstein and was central to his disastrous Newsnight interview in 2019. The origins of the picture remain uncertain. But Ms Giuffre's death adds another layer to the mystery of what must have inadvertently become one of the most widely viewed photos in royal history. Epstein - who was said to have taken the photo - died in jail facing sex trafficking charges. Ghislaine Maxwell - who helped him abuse young girls and is pictured to the right of Prince Andrew and Ms Giuffre - is in prison in the US. Prince Andrew has stepped down from all public duties. And Virginia Giuffre, a smiling teenager in the photo, is now dead. Ms Giuffre - who was born in the US - died by suicide at her farm in Western Australia aged 41, her family said on Friday. Prince Andrew has always strongly denied any wrongdoing involving Ms Giuffre. They reached an out-of-court settlement in 2022, in which Prince Andrew paidan undisclosed amount of money. A statement with the settlement expressed regret on his part - but contained no admission of liability or an apology. Prince Andrew has always denied all the accusations against him. The prospect of Prince Andrew facing a court hearing in New York was averted by the settlement, but it had been a huge problem for the Royal Family, and Prince Andrew was swiftly removed from all official public roles. His reputation has never recovered. At this stage, there is still much that is not known about Ms Giuffre's last days or her personal circumstances. But as her family has said, as a young woman, she had the strength to stand up to a toxic mix of power, money and privilege in the circle surrounding Epstein, that sexually exploited so many girls. There will be suspicions the long shadow of Epstein's poisonous misuse of wealth and influence has indirectly claimed another victim.

    "title": "'Bottle kicking trampling left me unable to walk'",
    "article_text": "A woman says she has been left unable to walk after she was accidentally trampled by players participating in an annual Easter Monday tradition. Alexie Winship said she was among spectators watching the Hallaton bottle kicking event in Leicestershire, where players attempt to wrestle wood kegs through a field to win. The 23-year-old was caught up in a scrum and seriously injured. At hospital, she was found to have suffered a neurological injury and a bleed on her spine, which has left her without most feeling below her waist. Ms Winship, who remains in hospital, said she could not remember much of what happened. \"I was on the outskirts [of the players], just watching when a beer keg came flying out in my direction,\" Ms Winship said. \"I couldn't get out of the way. I was with friends who said I got kicked in the head, knocked out, and then trampled on. \"It was like a stampede. One of my friends pulled me out and I was blue-lighted to hospital.\" Bottle kicking takes place in a field between neighbouring villages Hallaton and Medbourne. It has few rules, but is won when players are able to carry two of three barrels across a stream back to their village. Two of the \"bottles\" contain beer, while one is completely wooden - painted red and white - and is referred to as the dummy. Organisers have said local legend suggested the event, preceded by a procession through Hallaton in which hare pies are scattered, can trace its roots back 2,000 years. Ms Winship told the BBC she had planned to run a half-marathon on Sunday, but her injuries had \"thrown a spanner in the works\". She added while she was a spectator, she \"never intended\" to get involved in the action. \"I can't feel anything below my waist. I can't walk,\" she said. \"I don't know what's going to happen and that's the scary thing. I'm an active, fit and healthy person.\" Ms Winship, who works in retail, has been told she will recover, but that it would be \"a long-term thing\" and that she was facing \"months\" using a wheelchair. She added she wanted people to be aware of the risks of attending the event. \"I wasn't standing particularly close,\" she said. \"We were a few metres away but it surged so quickly towards us. \"They [the players] were looking at the keg, not where they were going. I know it was an accident. \"Maybe they could have marshals to make it safer.\" Phil Allan, chairman of the bottle kicking organising committee, said he wished Ms Winship a \"full recovery\". He added people were warned well in advance of the risks of entering the field of play. \"We don't want anyone to get hurt but you do get the odd injury - it's an age-old problem,\" Mr Allan said. \"We've looked at all sorts of things but you can't marshal it. It's an unpredictable event. \"We put posters up around the field telling people they enter at their own risk so they are warned. And we pay for ambulances and paramedics to attend in case anyone does get hurt.\" Bottle kicking is not the only peculiar rough-and-tumble English tradition that comes with a risk of injury. Paramedics are deployed tothe annual cheese rolling eventin Gloucestershire, where participants chase a 7lb (3kg) Double Gloucester down a steep 200-yard hill, many tripping and tumbling as they go. Medics have also been required to treat players hurt during Royal Shrovetide Football, which takes place annually in Ashbourne in Derbyshire,as the Up'Ards and Down'Ards compete to move a ballto opposite ends of the town.

Does bloody conquest, dark ritual or mercenary money explain a gold-covered helmet found buried in a field? The helmet, found more than 20 years ago, is being displayed again at a museum. Organiser Phil Allan says Hallaton secured bragging rights for the next 12 months. Houses may be targeted after paint which reflects UV light is used to mark them out, police say.

    "title": "Russia claims it has regained full control of Kursk from Ukraine",
    "article_text": "Russia's military says it has regained full control of the country's western Kursk region - a claim denied by Ukraine. Top Russian commander Valery Gerasimov said the last village held by Ukrainian troops had now been recaptured - eight months afterKyiv's surprise incursion. He also praised the \"heroism\" of North Korean troops during a Russian counter-offensive, in what is the first time Russia has publicly acknowledged their involvement. Russian President Vladimir Putin described Ukraine's efforts in Kursk as a complete failure. Ukraine says its troops are still conducting operations in the Russian border region, with the military describing Moscow's claims as \"propaganda tricks\". Ukrainian forces have been in retreat in Kursk in recent months, facing 70,000 Russian troops and heavy drone attacks as part of Russia's drive to regain the territory. In its latest report on 25 April, the US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) think-tank said: \"Russian forces recently advanced near the international border in Kursk Oblast [region] as part of efforts to push Ukrainian forces from their limited remaining positions in the area.\" The ISW also reported that \"fighting continued in [Russia's] north-western Belgorod Oblast [region] on 25 April\". During a video conference meeting with Putin on Saturday, Gerasimov said: \"Today, the last settlement in the Kursk region, the village of Gornal, has been liberated from Ukrainian forces.\" Gerasimov said more than 76,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed and wounded in the Kursk region - a claim not verified independently. He also praised North Korean troops for providing \"significant assistance in defeating the group of Ukrainian armed forces\". \"The Kyiv regime's adventure has completely failed,\" Putin told Gerasimov in response, claiming that it would pave the way for further Russian advances on other fronts. Russia's military says its troops now control several settlements in Ukraine's north-eastern Sumy region, located next to Kursk. Responding in a post on Telegram, the Ukrainian military's general staff said thesituation on the battlefield was \"difficult\"- but insisted its forces were still holding positions in Kursk and were continuing an incursion in the Belgorod region, which lies immediately south of Kursk. Ukraine's incursion was launched last August as an attempt to create a buffer zone on the border between the two countries that would prevent Russian forces from being deployed on Ukraine's eastern front line. It comes a day after US President Donald Trump said Russia and Ukraine were \"very close to a deal\" on ending the war, following talks between his envoy Steve Witkoff and Putin this week. But Trump on Saturdayquestioned Putin's willingness to end the war, referencing Russia's attacks on Kyiv earlier this week which killed at least 12 people and injured 90 others. His comments followed a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on the sidelines of Pope Francis's funeral at the Vatican - their first face-to-face encounter since February's acrimonious Oval Office showdown. The White House struck a more positive tone about Saturday's meeting, while Zelensky described the sit down as a \"very symbolic meeting that has potential to become historic, if we achieve joint results\". Ukraine's leader told the BBC on Friday that he was pushing for a \"full and unconditional ceasefire\" before any deal was struck. Kyiv has faced growing pressure from Trump to accept territorial concessions as part of any deal with Moscow to end fighting, which could reportedly include giving up the Crimean peninsula which was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014. Zelensky has repeatedly rejected any such concessions. Ukraine had hoped it could use the land it had seized in the Kursk region as a bargaining chip in future peace talks with Russia, which launched its full-scale invasion in 2022 andcurrently controls around 20% of Ukraine's internationally-recognised territory. The US president says he fears the Russian leader is \"tapping me along\" given Moscow's strikes on Kyiv earlier this week. The FSB say they detained a \"Ukrainian special services agent\". Kyiv has not commented on the attack. The leaders discussed the 'positive progress' made towards an end to the war in a meeting after the Pope's funeral.

Among the most prominent figures at the Vatican's St Peter's Square on Saturday morning were Prince William, US President Donald Trump and his predecessor Joe Biden, Britain's Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron. Their attendance comes at a fragile time for international diplomacy, with Trump meeting Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky before the service. So among the VIP attendees, who sat next to whom? Trump was in a front-row seat near Francis' coffin, alongside his wife Melania Trump, across the aisle from Macron and his wife Brigitte. Intriguingly, he and First Lady Melania were sitting between two staunch supporters of Ukraine. Estonia's President Alar Karis was to Melania's left, and Finland's Alexander Stubb to Trump's right. Estonia and Finland are both staunch allies of another man of the moment in attendance - Zelensky, who looked sombre-faced at the Vatican. He was sitting on the same row as Macron, separated by a few other dignitaries. Zelensky, who has been locked in negotiations and public arguments with Trump in recent weeks, was just 10 seats and one aisle away from him, on the same row. Shortly before the funeral started,the pair were pictured sitting locked in deep discussion. The White House described the 15-minute meeting as \"very productive,\" while Zelensky said it was \"very symbolic\" and had \"potential to become historic\". The VIPs were in a separate section from the hundreds of thousands of members of the public who have descended on Rome for the event. Dignitaries were sitting on the the right-hand side of the square, next to St Peter's Basilica. Those with the best seats were Javier Milei, president of Francis' native Argentina, Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Italian President Sergio Mattarella, representing the country that surrounds the Vatican City state. Behind them were reigning sovereigns, and other delegations were seated in alphabetical order in French, the official language of diplomacy, on other benches. Representing British royalty, the Prince of Wales was sitting next to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz several rows back from the front, and some distance away from Starmer. Starmer himself sat in the fifth row with his wife Victoria. Behind the British leader was the World Health Organization's (WHO) director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Former US President Joe Biden was seen hand in hand with his wife Jill. He was sitting four rows behind Trump. Many European leaders, as well as royalty from European countries, were in attendance.

    "title": "Australia's universal healthcare is crumbling. Can it be saved?",
    "article_text": "From an office perched on the scalloped edge of the continent, Victoria Bradley jokes that she has the most beautiful doctor's practice in Australia. Outside her window, farmland rolls into rocky coastline, hemming a glasslike bay striped with turquoise and populated by showboating dolphins. Home to about 3,000 people, a few shops, two roundabouts and a tiny hospital, Streaky Bay is an idyllic beach town. For Dr Bradley, though, it is anything but. The area's sole, permanent doctor, she spent years essentially on call 24/7. Running the hospital and the general practitioner (GP) clinic, life was a never-ending game of catch up. She'd do rounds at the wards before, after and in between regular appointments. Even on good days, lunch breaks were often a pipe dream. On bad days, a hospital emergency would blow up her already punishing schedule. Burnt out, two years ago she quit – and the thread holding together the remnants of the town's healthcare system snapped. Streaky Bay is at the forefront of a national crisis: inadequate government funding is exacerbating a shortage of critical healthcare workers like Dr Bradley; wait times are ballooning; doctors are beginning to write their own rules on fees, and costs to patients are skyrocketing. A once-revered universal healthcare system is crumbling at every level, sometimes barely getting by on the sheer willpower of doctors and local communities. As a result, more and more Australians, regardless of where they live, are delaying or going without the care they need. Health has become a defining issue for voters ahead of the nation's election on 3 May, with both of Australia's major parties promising billions of dollars in additional funding. But experts say the solutions being offered up are band-aid fixes, while what is needed are sweeping changes to the way the system is funded – reform for which there has so far been a lack of political will. Australians tell the BBC the country is at a crossroads, and needs to decide if universal healthcare is worth saving. Healthcare was the last thing on Renee Elliott's mind when she moved to Streaky Bay - until the 40-year-old found a cancerous lump in her breast in 2019, and another one four years later. Seeing a local GP was the least of her problems. With the expertise and treatment she needed only available in Adelaide, about 500km away, Mrs Elliott has spent hundreds of hours and tens of thousands of dollars accessing life-saving care, all while raising three boys and running a business. Though she has since clawed back a chunk of the cost through government schemes, it made an already harrowing time that much more draining: financially, emotionally and physically. \"You're trying to get better… but having to juggle all that as well. It was very tricky.\" When Australia's modern health system was born four decades ago – underpinned by a public insurance scheme called Medicare – it was supposed to guarantee affordable and accessible high-quality care to people like Mrs Elliott as \"a basic right\". Health funding here is complex and shared between states and federal governments. But the scheme essentially meant Australians could present their bright green Medicare member card at a doctor's office or hospital, and Canberra would be sent a bill. It paid through rebates funded by taxes. Patients would either receive \"bulk billed\" – completely free – care, mostly through the emerging public system, or heavily subsidised treatment through a private healthcare sector offering more benefits and choice to those who wanted them. Medicare became a national treasure almost instantly. It was hoped this set up would combine the best parts of the UK's National Health Service and the best of the United States' system. Fast forward 40 years and many in the industry say we're on track to end up with the worst of both. There is no denying that healthcare in Australia is still miles ahead of much of the world, particularly when it comes to emergency care. But the core of the crisis and key to this election is GP services, or primary care, largely offered by private clinics. There has historically been little need for public ones, with most GPs choosing to accept Medicare rebates as full payment. That is increasingly uncommon though, with doctors saying those allowances haven't kept up with the true cost of delivering care. At the same time, staff shortages, which persist despite efforts to recruit from overseas, create a scarcity that only drives up prices further. According to government data, about 30% of patients must now pay a \"gap fee\" for a regular doctor's appointment - on average A$40 (£19.25; $25.55) out of pocket. But experts suspect the true figure is higher: it's skewed by seniors and children, who tend to visit doctors more often and still enjoy mostly bulk-billed appointments. Plus there's a growing cohort of patients not captured by statistics, who simply don't go to the doctor because of escalating fees. Brisbane electrician Callum Bailey is one of them. \"Mum or my partner will pester and pester and pester… [but] I'm such a big 'I'll just suffer in silence' person because it's very expensive.\" And every dollar counts right now, the 25-year-old says: \"At my age, I probably should be in my prime looking for housing… [but] even grocery shopping is nuts. \"[I] just can't keep up.\" This is a tale James Gillespie kept hearing. So his startup Cleanbill began asking the question: if the average Australian adult walked into a GP clinic, could they get a free, standard appointment? This year, they called almost all of the nation's estimated 7,000 GP clinics – only a fifth of them would bulk bill a new adult patient. In the entire state of Tasmania, for example, they couldn't find a single one. The results resonate with many Australians, he says: \"It really brought it home to them that, 'Okay, it's not just us. This is happening nationwide'.\" And that's just primary care. Public specialists are so rare and so overwhelmed – with wait times often far beyond safe levels – that most patients are funnelled toward exorbitantly expensive private care. The same goes for a lot of non-emergency hospital treatments or dental work. There are currently no caps on how much private specialists, dentists or hospitals can charge and neither private health insurance nor slim Medicare rebates reliably offer substantial relief. The BBC spoke to people across the country who say the increasing cost of healthcare had left them relying on charities for food, avoiding dental care for almost a decade, or emptying their retirement savings to fund treatment. Others are borrowing from their parents, taking out pay-day loans to buy medication, remortgaging their houses, or selling their possessions. Kimberley Grima regularly lies awake at night, calculating which of her three children – who, like her, all have chronic illnesses – can see their specialists. Her own overdue health checks and tests are barely an afterthought. \"They're decisions that you really don't want to have to make,\" the Aboriginal woman from New South Wales tells the BBC. \"But when push comes to shove and you haven't got the money… you've got no other option. It's heart-breaking.\" Another woman tells the BBC that had she been able to afford timely appointments, her multiple sclerosis, a degenerative neurological disease, would have been identified, and slowed, quicker. \"I was so disabled by the time I got a diagnosis,\" she says. The people missing out tend to be the ones who need it the most, experts say. \"We have much more care in healthier, wealthier parts of Australia than in poorer, sicker parts of Australia,\" Peter Breadon, from the Grattan Institute think tank says. All of this creates a vicious cycle which feeds even more pressure back into an overwhelmed system, while entrenching disadvantage and fuelling distrust. Every single one of those issues is more acute in the regions. Streaky Bay has long farewelled the concept of affordable healthcare, fighting instead to preserve access to any at all. It's why Dr Bradley lasted only three months after quitting before \"guilt\" drove her back to the practice. \"There's a connection that goes beyond just being the GP... You are part of the community. \"I felt that I'd let [them] down. Which was why I couldn't just let go.\" She came back to a far more sustainable three-day week in the GP clinic, with Streaky Bay forced to wage a bidding war with other desperate regions for pricey, fly-in-fly-out doctors to fill in the gaps. It's yet another line on the tab for a town which has already invested so much of its own money into propping up a healthcare system supposed to be funded by state and private investment. \"We don't want a gold service, but what we want is an equitable service,\" says Penny Williams, who helps run the community body which owns the GP practice. When the clinic was on the verge of closure, the town desperately rallied to buy it. When it was struggling again, the local council diverted funding from other areas to top up its coffers. And even still most standard patients – unless they are seniors or children – fork out about A$50 per appointment. It means locals are paying for their care three times over, Ms Williams says: through their Medicare taxes, council rates, and then out-of-pocket gap fees. \"No-one would say this is the Australia that we want, surely,\" Elizabeth Deveny, from the Consumers Health Forum of Australia, tells the BBC. Like many wealthy countries, the nation is struggling to cope with a growing population which is, on average, getting older and sicker. There's a small but increasing cohort which says it is time to let go of the notion of universal healthcare, as we've known it. Many doctors, a handful of economists, and some conservative politicians have sought to redefine Medicare as a \"safety net\" for the nation's most vulnerable rather than as a scheme for all. Health economist Yuting Zhang argues free healthcare and universal healthcare are different things. The taxes the government collects for Medicare are already nowhere near enough to support the system, she says, and the country either needs to have some tough conversations about how it will find additional funds, or accept reasonable fees for those who can afford them. \"There's always a trade-off... You have limited resources, you have to think about how to use them effectively and efficiently.\" The original promise of Medicare has been \"undermined by decades of neglect\", the Australian Medical Association's Danielle McMullen says, and most Australians now accept they need to contribute to their own care. She says freezes to Medicare rebates – which were overseen by both parties between 2013 and 2017 and meant the payments didn't even keep up with inflation – were the last straw. Since then, many doctors have been dipping into their own pockets to help those in need. Both the Labor Party and the Liberal-National coalition accept there is a crisis, but blame each other for it. Opposition leader Peter Dutton says his government will invest A$9bn in health, including funds for extra subsidised mental health appointments and for regional universities training key workers. \"Health has become another victim of Labor's cost of living crisis... we know it has literally never been harder or more expensive to see a GP than it is right now,\" health spokesperson Anne Ruston told the BBC in a statement. On the other side, Albanese - whipping out his Medicare card almost daily - has sought to remind voters that Labor created the beloved system, while pointing out the Coalition's previously mixed support of the universal scheme and the spending cuts Dutton proposed as Health Minister a decade ago. \"At this election, this little card here, your Medicare card, is what is at stake,\" Albanese has said. His government has started fixing things already, he argues, and has pledged an extra A$8.5bn for training more GPs, building additional public clinics, and subsidising more medicines. But the headline of their rescue packages is an increase to Medicare rebates and bigger bonuses for doctors who bulk bill. Proposed by Labor, then matched by the Coalition, the changes will make it possible for 9 out of 10 Australians to see a GP for free, the parties claim. One Tasmanian doctor tells the BBC it is just a \"good election sound bite\". He and many other clinicians say the extra money is still not enough, particularly for the longer consults more and more patients are seeking for complex issues. Labor has little patience for those criticisms, citing research which they claim shows their proposal will leave the bulk of doctors better off and accusing them of wanting investment \"without strings attached\". But many of the patients the BBC spoke to are sceptical either parties' proposals will make a huge difference. There's far more they need to be doing, they say, rattling off a wish list: more work on training and retaining rural doctors; effective regulation of private fees and more investment in public specialist clinics; universal bulk billing of children for all medical and dental expenses; more funding for allied health and prevention. Experts like Mr Breadon say, above all else, the way Medicare pays clinicians needs to be overhauled to keep healthcare access genuinely universal. That is, the government needs to stop paying doctors a set amount per appointment, and give them a budget based on how large and sick the populations they serve are – that is something several recent reviews have said. And the longer governments wait to invest in these reforms, the more they're going to cost. \"The stars may be aligning now... It is time for these changes, and delaying them would be really dangerous,\" Mr Breadon says. In Streaky Bay though, locals like Ms Williams wonder if it's too late. Things are already dangerous here. \"Maybe that's the cynic in me,\" she says, shaking her head. \"The definition of universal is everyone gets the same, but we know that's not true already.\" Valerie survived intense heat and avoided venomous snakes during her time lost in the wilderness.

    "title": "Eighty years on, survivors and families remember horrors of Bergen Belsen",
    "article_text": "There had been rumours. There had been aerial photographs. There had been the written testimony of a few escapees. But it took liberation for the revelation of the shocking reality of the Nazi's concentration camps. Nowhere was this more true than when British and Canadian troops advanced on the camp at Bergen-Belsen, near Hanover, in April 1945. A truce with local German commanders enabled them to enter without a fight. They were met with a stomach-churning vista of death, a torrid panorama of human suffering. The troops calculated there were 13,000 unburied corpses. A further 60,000 emaciated, diseased, spectral-like survivors stood and lay amongst them. On Sunday, to mark the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Belsen, more than a thousand survivors and families will attending commemoration events at the camp. \"To me, Belsen was the ultimate blasphemy,\" wrote one British soldier, Michael Bentine, who, after World War Two, went on to become a famous entertainer. Other chroniclers, film-makers and diarists struggled to convey in words and pictures the scenes that made unwanted incursions into their minds. The BBC's Richard Dimbleby was the first broadcaster to enter the camp shortly after liberation. In his landmark broadcast he included the words:  \"This day at Belsen was the most horrible of my life.\" Belsen's notoriety soon stood out, not just because of the chillingly vivid accounts of journalists, soldiers and photographers, whose testimonies were sent around the world, but because it was found with all its grotesqueness intact. Other camps further east, like the death camps of Treblinka, Sobibor and Auschwitz, had either been destroyed by the Germans to hide their crimes in the face of Soviet advances or emptied of their inmates. At Belsen, the huts, the barracks, the evidence, remained. At Belsen, there were witnesses, perpetrators, victims. It was where many of those eastern concentration camp prisoners ended up. Overcrowding led to dysentery, malnutrition and typhus. There were no gas chambers at Belsen. It was Nazi cruelty and incompetence that accounted for the 500 deaths a day that the camp endured. And most of it came in the final weeks of the war, well into April 1945. As the Third Reich collapsed and freedom came to those in other occupied territories, the dying continued at Belsen: between 50,000 and 70,000 people in total, more than 30,000 of those between January and April 1945. Around 14,000 of the prisoners died after liberation, their digestive systems unable to cope with the high calorific, rich, sustenance offered by well-meaning cooks and medics. The vast majority were Jews, with Soviet prisoners of war, Sinti and homosexuals among other groups to be engulfed by the horrors of the camp. WATCH on iPlayer:Belsen: What They Found - Directed by Sam Mendes Among the survivors and relatives attending the event on Sunday are 180 British Jews. Their journey is being organised by AJEX, the Jewish Military Association. Wreaths will be laid by AJEX veterans, as well as dignitaries, including Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner. A psalm will be read by UK Chief Rabbi Sir Ephraim Mirvis. They will do so amid the verdant surroundings of Lower Saxony where the watch towers, fences and buildings have gone. That's because, in the end, to contain disease, the British soldiers decided they had to burn the huts at Belsen. And so, today, little remains. A visitor centre is a focal point, near to where a handful of memorial stones and crosses have been erected. The inscription on one readsHier ruhen 5,000 toten -here rest 5,000 dead. It is just one of the graves, one of the memories, that haunt the grassed landscape. Local composers and poets will be involved in the celebration of 80 years since German forces left. Ettie Eyre was inspired to run the London Marathon by her grandmother, who served in World War Two. Events will be taking place across the county to celebrate the 80th anniversary of VE Day.

    "title": "Virginia Giuffre remembered as 'fierce warrior against sexual abuse'",
    "article_text": "Virginia Giuffre, who became a prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein and the Duke of York, has been described by her family as a \"fierce warrior in the fight against sexual abuse and sex trafficking\" after her death aged 41. Ms Giuffre was born Virginia Roberts in California in 1983, before her family relocated to Florida. At seven, she said she was sexually abused by a family friend and her later childhood was spent in and out of foster care. She met Ghislaine Maxwell, a British socialite, in 2000 while working as a locker room attendant at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach. Maxwell offered her an interview for the chance to train as a massage therapist, she said, and took her to Jeffrey Epstein. What she had expected to be a job interview was in fact the beginning of years of abuse, according to Ms Giuffre. Ms Giuffre was taken by Epstein on private jets around the world. She told the BBC she was abused by the US financier and \"passed around like a platter of fruit\" to his associates. In 2001, at the age of 17, she said Epstein brought her to London and introduced her to Prince Andrew, who she claimed sexually abused her three times. The prince, who has denied all claims against him, reached an out-of-court settlement with her in 2022 which contained no admission of liability or apology. In an interview with the Miami Herald, Ms Giuffre said Epstein had lost interest in her when she turned 19 in 2003, as she had become too old for him. She said she convinced the wealthy financier to pay for her to get training to become a professional masseuse and he arranged for her to take a class in Thailand. But she was also expected to bring home a Thai girl that Epstein had arranged to come to the US. Instead, on that trip, Ms Giuffre met a man named Robert whom she fell in love with and married 10 days later. They spent time in the US before moving to Australia, initially settling in Cairns in far north Queensland before relocating close to the western city of Perth. The pair had three children together: Christian, Noah and Emily. Reports suggest their marriage eventually broke down. On 2 February, she allegedly breached a family violence restraining order in Ocean Reef, the town where her family lived, according to Western Australia Courts. On 22 March she posted the following on Instagram: \"My beautiful babies have no clue how much I love them and they're being poisoned with lies. \"I miss them so very much. I have been through hell & back in my 41 years but this is incredibly hurting me worse than anything else.\" Just over a week later she posted again to say she was recovering in hospital after a \"serious\" vehicle collision and had \"four days to live\", alongside a photo of her in hospital. Her family later said she had not intended to make the post public. Western Australia Police disputed the severity of the crash, saying they were only able to find a report of a \"minor crash\" between a school bus and a car in Neergabby, about an hour north of Perth, on 24 March. The collision was reported by the bus driver the following day, while there were no reported injuries, a police spokeswoman said. Ms Giuffre was living at a farm in Neergabby, where she was found dead on Friday. \"It is with utterly broken hearts that we announce that Virginia passed away last night at her farm in Western Australia,\" her family said in a statement, confirming her death by suicide. \"Virginia was a fierce warrior in the fight against sexual abuse and sex trafficking. She was the light that lifted so many survivors. Despite all the adversity she faced in her life, she shone so bright. She will be missed beyond measure.\" The family added the children \"were the light of her life\" and that it was while holding her newborn daughter she \"realized she had to fight back against those who had abused her and so many others.\" Ms Giuffre's representative Dini von Mueffling described her as \"one of the most extraordinary human beings I have ever had the honour to know. \"Deeply loving, wise, and funny, she was a beacon to other survivors and victims. She adored her children and many animals. It was the privilege of a lifetime to represent her.\" If you are suffering distress or despair, details of help and support in the UK are available atBBC Action Line.

    "title": "Mini dachshund rescued after spending 529 days in Australian wilderness",
    "article_text": "A miniature dachshund has been found alive and well on Kangaroo Island off the coast of Australia, more than 500 days after she first went missing. Kangala Wildlife Rescue had been working \"around the clock\" to find the dog, Valerie, since she was last spotted by her owners on a November 2023 camping trip. Georgia Gardner and her boyfriend, Joshua Fishlock, had momentarily left Valerie in a playpen at their campsite while the couple went fishing. When they returned, she was gone. Valerie survived intense heat and avoided venomous snakes during her 529 days in the wilderness. \"After weeks of tireless efforts [...] Valerie has been safely rescued and is fit and well,\" Kangala said in a social media post. Kangala Wildlife Rescue said volunteers spent 1,000-plus hours searching for Valerie, covering more than 5,000km (3109 miles). The effort also included surveillance cameras and a trap cage with a remote door system filled with food, Ms Gardner's clothes and some of Valerie's toys from home. In the initial days after Valerie went missing, other campers spotted her underneath a parked car which startled the dog and sent her fleeing into bushland, the Washington Post reported. Months later, island locals reported seeing a pink collar that matched Valerie's, much to the surprise of Jared Karran, a director at Kangala. \"Of all dogs, that would be the last one I would say would survive out there, but they do have a good sense of smell,\" Mr Karran said. Ms Gardner sent rescuers a t-shirt that she had worn that helped lead to Valerie's capture by creating \"scent trail\" inside the large dog trap. In a 15-minute video on social media, Kangala directors and rescue volunteers Jared and Lisa Karran explained how the \"rollercoaster\" rescue transpired. Ms Karran said they had to wait until Valerie was in the right part of the trap and calm enough to ensure she would not attempt another escape. \"She went right into the back corner, which is where we wanted her, I pressed the button, and thankfully it all worked perfectly,\" Mr Karran said. \"I know people were a little bit frustrated, like 'why is it taking so long?' but these are the things that we were doing in the background,\" he said. Ms Karran said she wore the remnants of Ms Gardner's clothes as she approached Valerie and sat with her until the dog was \"completely calm\". Ms Gardner said on social media after Valerie's long-awaited rescue: \"For anyone who's ever lost a pet, your feelings are valid and never give up hope. \"Sometimes good things happen to good people.\" More and more Australians, regardless of where they live, are delaying or going without the care they need.

    "title": "Trans people should be given alternative facilities to use, watchdog says",
    "article_text": "The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has released interim guidance on how organisations should interpret the UK Supreme Court's ruling that a woman is defined by biological sex in law. The new guidancesays that, in places like hospitals, shops and restaurants, \"trans women (biological men) should not be permitted to use the women's facilities\". It also states that trans people should not be left without any facilities to use. The EHRC said it was releasing interim guidance because \"many people have questions about the judgement and what it means for them\". Guidance on when competitive sports can be single-sex will be published in due course, the EHRC said. Last week the Supreme Courtfound the terms \"woman\" and \"sex\" in the 2010 Equality Act\"refer to a biological woman and biological sex\". This means, for instance, that transgender women, who are biologically male but identify as women, can be excluded from women-only spaces. As part of the judgement, Supreme Court judge Lord Hodge stressed that the law still gives protection against discrimination to transgender people. The EHRC - which enforces equalities law and provides guidance to policymakers, public sector bodies and businesses - said the impact of the ruling was that \"if somebody identifies as trans, they do not change sex for the purposes of the [Equality] Act, even if they have a Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC)\". In this respect, the EHRC says, \"a trans woman is a biological man\" and \"a trans man is a biological woman\". The guidance also states that \"in some circumstances the law also allows trans women (biological men) not to be permitted to use the men's facilities, and trans men (biological women) not to be permitted to use the women's facilities\". When asked to clarify this, the EHRC pointed to a section of the Supreme Court ruling stating that trans men could be excluded from women's facilities \"where reasonable objection is taken to their presence, for example because the gender reassignment process has given them a masculine appearance or attributes to which reasonable objection might be taken\" in the context of a women-only service. The EHRC guidance adds: \"However where facilities are available to both men and women, trans people should not be put in a position where there are no facilities for them to use.\" Akua Reindorf KC, a barrister and a Commissioner at the EHRC, told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that situations where trans men could be excluded from women's facilities would be decided on a \"case-by-case\" basis. She said there \"should never be a situation where a trans person is left without a toilet to use\". But, citing the example of a rape crisis counselling session, she said a trans man could be \"excluded properly and lawfully from that because of the alarm that it may cause to vulnerable women to share that space with somebody who to all intents and purposes appears to be a man\". Where possible, mixed-sex toilets, washing or changing facilities should be provided in addition to sufficient single-sex facilities, according to the guidance. Alternatively, the guidance says it is possible to have toilet, washing or changing facilities which can be used by all, provided they are \"in lockable rooms (not cubicles)\" and intended to be used by one person at a time. One such example might be a single toilet in a small business such as a café. In schools, it says: \"Pupils who identify as trans girls (biological boys) should not be permitted to use the girls' toilet or changing facilities, and pupils who identify as trans boys (biological girls) should not be permitted to use the boys' toilet or changing facilities. Suitable alternative provisions may be required.\" In associations - groups or clubs with more than 25 members - the EHRC says \"a women-only or lesbian-only association should not admit trans women (biological men), and a men-only or gay men-only association should not admit trans men (biological women)\". The EHRC says the interim guidance, published online on Friday evening, is intended to highlight the main consequences of the Supreme Court judgement. \"Employers and other duty-bearers must follow the law and should take appropriate specialist legal advice where necessary,\" it adds. A two-week consultation to seek views from \"affected stakeholders\" is expected to be launched in May. The EHRC aims to provide an updated code of practice to the government for ministerial approval by the end of June. A government spokesperson said: \"We welcome the ruling and the clarity it brings for women, and service providers. \"We will review and update policy wherever necessary to ensure it complies with the latest legal requirements.\" A spokesman for the Scottish government said it was \"keen to work with EHRC to ensure consistent, inclusive and comprehensive guidance is in place following the Supreme Court judgement\" and would meet the body to \"discuss further\". The City of London Corporation, which owns Hampstead Heath, is reviewing a Supreme Court ruling. It comes as Fermanagh and Omagh District Council said it would be implementing the provisions of the Supreme Court's ruling across its buildings. The celebration is due to be held in August but is facing pressure over funding this year. Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi says Welsh government and others were \"captured\" by LGBT charities.

    "title": "Gregg Wallace seeks 'space to heal' after saying claims against him 'not all true'",
    "article_text": "Gregg Wallace has said he needs \"space to heal\" after stating in an interview that allegations against him of inappropriate sexual comments were \"not all true\". A BBC News investigation revealedallegations of inappropriate sexual comments by 13 people who had worked with Wallace across a range of shows, over a 17-year-period. He told the Daily Mail \"they're not all true\", and said he had felt \"under attack\" and had contemplated suicide. In an Instagram post after the interview was published, the former MasterChef presenter said he knew there would be \"a lot of noise\" following the Mail interview but he \"won't be joining in\". Wallace has faced further claims of \"groping\" and \"touching\" since the original allegations. He strenuously denies them. MasterChef's production company, Banijay, has launched an inquiry into the historical allegations. In a post on Instagram Wallace said he \"meant every word\" of his Mail interview. \"It was hard to do, but speaking honestly for myself, my family and especially my mum, felt right,\" he wrote. He said he now needed \"space to heal and be with the people who know who I really am\". In his first interviewsince the claims emerged, Wallace said that he had received \"a tidal wave of abuse\" on social media after posting a video on Instagram hitting out at his accusers. In the video, which he subsequently apologised for, he said the claims against him had come from \"a handful of middle-class women of a certain age\". \"News channels were updating hourly with new allegations,\" he said. \"You're watching yourself get personally ripped apart, criticised, accused of all sorts of stuff over and over again. You're thinking, this isn't true. It isn't true. What's coming next?\" Wallace said he couldn't sleep at the time, adding: \"The feeling of being under attack, of isolation, of abandonment was overwhelming. Nobody from the BBC contacted me once these stories started breaking – absolutely nobody at all.\" The BBC and Banijay declined to comment. Wallace said that at the time, his mother called him to ask why people were \"picking on him\". He said he responded: \"I've said something really stupid. They're investigating my behaviour, but more and more people are coming forward with complaints about me. Mum, they're not all true. I haven't done these things.\" Wallace revealed that his mother recently died, adding that it was \"terribly sad\" that she had spent the last few days of her life reading \"horrible things\" about him. One of the women who spoke to BBC News as part of its investigation was broadcaster Kirsty Wark who appeared on Celebrity MasterChef. Wark accused Wallace of telling \"sexualised jokes\" during the filming of the show, and said that it left people feeling \"uncomfortable\". But Wallace says he was never aware he had offended her until it came to light last year, saying: \"I thought we got on.\" Other high-profile media personalities, including Vanessa Feltz and Kirstie Allsopp, also spoke up at the time. Wallace said that Feltz's complaint \"knocked him for six\", and also pushed back against Allsopp's comments about his language, saying: \"I wouldn't have said that.\" Writing on Instagram in November, singer Sir Rod Stewart described Wallace as an \"ill-mannered bully\", and said the presenter \"humiliated\" his wife Penny Lancaster when she was on Masterchef in 2021. Addressing that claim, Wallace said it was a \"shame\" as he liked Sir Rod. He acknowledged there had been a \"falling out\" between himself and Lancaster, but said it was over \"whether an orchid should stay on a bowl of soup or not\". He also addressed other allegations that emerged towards the end of last year, including one that he'd walked around on set naked with a sock on his penis. He admitted to putting a \"sock over my private bits\" and opening his dressing room door shouting \"hooray\", but claimed he did this to three friends who were in the studio after filming had finished, rather than while it was taking place. He admitted that some of the inappropriate jokes were \"probably true\", saying: \"Some of what's been said sounds like the sort of comments I'd have made.\" But he insisted he never groped any workers, calling those claims \"absolutely not true\". He also said that many of those who work with him had been supportive, including John Torode, his co-presenter on MasterChef. Torode has not responded to a request for comment. When Banijay launched an inquiry, Wallace said his \"world tumbled in\". \"It's very difficult to explain the pressure unless you've been through it. I thought about suicide all the time: \"Is my insurance up to date? Will [Wallace's wife] Anna get some money? She doesn't deserve this. It would be better if I wasn't here.\" He told the newspaper Banijay had arranged for a crisis mentor to support him. Wallace said he was recently diagnosed with autism, saying: \"I want to make it absolutely clear I'm not blaming my behaviour on my diagnosis, but it does explain a hell of a lot to me.\" He added that he accepts he was \"very slow to wake up\" to a changing work environment. \"It wasn't until seven years ago that I had a massive wake-up call and realised the loud, energetic greengrocer persona I was on the telly was, maybe, becoming redundant. So I changed.\" \"I honestly never meant to upset anyone. I thought I was going in every day and just delivering what was wanted. I didn't realise I was causing any problems.\" Wallace has been one of Britain's most high profile presenters for more than two decades. BBC News, which is editorially independent from the wider organisation, started investigating Wallace last summer, after becoming aware of allegations. The claims were made across five shows, from 2005 to 2022. Most of the allegations came from production workers. Many were young female freelancers. Allegations heard include Wallace talking openly about his sex life, taking his top off in front of a female worker saying he wanted to \"give her a fashion show\", and telling a junior female colleague he wasn't wearing any boxer shorts under his jeans. BBC News has also heard from a former MasterChef worker who says he showed her topless pictures of himself and asked for massages, and a former worker on Channel 5's Gregg Wallace's Big Weekends, who says he was fascinated by the fact she dated women and asked for the logistics of how it worked. Another female worker on MasterChef in 2019 says Wallace talked about his sex life; a female worker on the BBC Good Food Show in 2010 says Wallace stared at her chest; and a male worker on MasterChef in 2005-06 says Wallace regularly said sexually explicit things on set. After BBC News's initial investigation, more women came forward with claims. One woman says he touched her bottom at an event and another says he pressed his crotch against her while filming on a different show. His lawyers have strongly denied he engages in behaviour of a sexually harassing nature. Wallace has repeatedly declined interview requests from BBC News.

    "article_text": "Wright has been an advocate of the women's game for many years Ian Wright says he \"cannot accept\" Eni Aluko's apology for suggesting the former England striker risked blocking female pundits from being given broadcasting opportunities. Wright, who is a pundit for various outlets on the men's and women's game, said he had seen theapology from the ex-England forwardbut wanted to move on from it. \"I'm very disappointed by what Eni has said,\" the 61-year-old Arsenal legend said. \"She knows how I have helped her and supported her publicly. \"I can't accept it [the apology] but I also want to move on from it. I don't need any further social commentary directed at anyone.\" Wright has long been an advocate for women's football, on which he has worked regularly as a pundit, with particular focus on Lionesses matches. In her interview with BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour on Wednesday, Aluko - who has worked alongside Wright as a pundit - said he needed to be aware of how much he works in the women's game as there are only a\"finite amount of opportunities\"for women. The former Chelsea player, 38, has faced scrutiny for her comments. Sheapologised on Instagram on Friday,saying: \"Ian Wright is a brilliant broadcaster and role model whose support for the women's game has been significant. \"In my interview with Woman's Hour this week, I was trying to make a broader point about the limited opportunities for women in football - whether that's in coaching, broadcasting or commercial spaces - and the importance of creating more space for women to thrive on and off the pitch. \"But it was wrong for Ian's name to be raised in that conversation, and for that I sincerely apologise. I've known and worked with Ian for many years and have nothing but love and respect for him.\" Wright thanked the public for their comments of support towards him, but said more needs to be done to help the women's game grow. \"Because of the past, where men blocked the women's game for 50 years, the game has serious systemic challenges and it is going to take everyone to help fix it,\" he added. \"We are the country that invented modern football so we have a responsibility to lead the way in women's football. \"For me, I will always give back to the game. It has given me so much. \"It has never bothered me about who is playing the game, as long as they are playing the game.

    "title": "Eubank outpoints bitter rival Benn in emotional fight",
    "article_text": "Chris Eubank Sr (right) made a surprise appearance at his son's fight Chris Eubank Jr narrowly beat bitter foe Conor Benn as one of Britain's most rancorous and long-running boxing rivalries lived up to the hype at London's Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Both fighters showed wild aggression, taking the centre of the ring and letting their hands go in a 12-round edge-of-your-seat firefight. Neither boxer could land the telling blow but it was the experience of Eubank, 35, which prevailed as all three judges scored it 116-112. He claims bragging rights in a family feud which began 35 years ago when their legendary fathers first fought. \"I knew I could do that, I just needed someone to bring that out of me and I didn't think that he would be the guy to do that,\" Eubank said. In a sensational plot twist, Eubankarrived at the venue alongside his father, Chris Eubank Sr. The pair had supposedly been estranged for years and Eubank Sr had criticised the match-up. \"I'm happy to have this man [Eubank Sr] back with me. We upheld the family name - onwards and upwards,\" Eubank added. The heartwarming reconciliation seemingly gave Eubank a boost as he extended his record to 35 wins in 38 fights. In a result which could have easily gone either way, Benn, 28, loses for the first time in 24 professional fights. \"I felt like it was a close fight. I'm not going to say 'yeah I should have won that' - I've got to watch it back. It was close,\" he said. Eubank was taken to the hospital after the fight which is standard procedure for boxers after a gruelling fight. Benn suggested his rival was being checked for damage to his jaw. The boxers signed a two-fight deal and, after putting on such a show, could contest a rematch later this year. 'Legendary behaviour' - reaction as Eubank beats Benn in thrilling fight 'I love my son' - Eubank Sr's shock arrival at Benn fight Emotional, ferocious Eubank v Benn fight in pictures This video can not be played Nigel Benn lost to Chris Eubank Sr in 1990 before a controversial draw in 1993 The grudge match was two and a half years in the making, ever since Bennfailed two drug testsand a scheduled fight in 2022was cancelled. With a lack of transparency behind the reasons for his doping offence, he was given a villain's welcome. Jeers reverberated around the stadium as he walked with his father, Nigel Benn, and a choir sang 'Ready or Not' by Fugees. Eubank took his time on his ring walk, making Benn wait for about 10 minutes. He too was joined by his father to the tune of Tina Turner's 'Simply the Best' - a song which the legend Eubank Sr walked out to in his heyday. The 65,000 sell-out crowd erupted when Nigel Benn and Eubank Sr shared a hug before the first bell. The 'wall of sound' South Stand amplified the already ear-splitting pandemonium, and a sea of camera lights added to the spectacle. But the bloodline rivalry, doping scandal andegg slapall led to their sons, nobody else, standing face-to-face inside a boxing ring. Conor Benn began the contest aggressively before Eubank edged his way back in Benn loaded up with every punch from the opening bell and wobbled Eubank with a left hook in the third. Although he is notoriously a slow starter, Eubank seemed to be struggling with the pace. Actor Idris Elba, celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay and England footballers Marcus Rashford and Declan Rice sprinkled some celebrity stardust as a trademark Eubank uppercut squeezed through Benn's low guard in the fourth. The pair were told to buck up their ideas by the referee as they began talking to each other during the middle of the rounds. Eubank lookedweight-drained in fight weekafter he was hampered by a rehydration clause which limited his weight gain. He was breathing heavily at the end of round five. Benn - who moved up two divisions from welterweight - had landed the more eye-catching shots in the first half of the fight. \"It's too easy,\" Eubank told Benn as he began to claw his way back into the contest. Eubank Sr left his front-row seat to join his son's corner after Eubank was cut above the right eye in a clash of heads. A flurry of punches in the 11th earned his nod of approval. There was a touch of gloves before the final round. After everything these two had been through, there was a smidgen of respect. Benn remarkably stayed on his feet after a ferocious, sustained attack by Eubank in the 12th. Both men raised their hands at the end of a enthralling all-British contest, one which will live long in the memory of all those in attendance. Eubank proved he is not yet done, while Benn showed he can mix it at a decent level. After serving up such a delight - one full of drama and a will to win from both men - the clamouring for a rematch will be too loud to ignore.

    "title": "Huge blast at key Iranian port kills 14 and injures more than 750",
    "article_text": "At least 14 people have been killed and 750 injured in a massive explosion at one of Iran's key ports, authorities say. The blast took place at Shahid Rajaee, the country's largest commercial port, near the southern city of Bandar Abbas on Saturday morning. It blew out windows and roofs of nearby buildings and destroyed cars. Residents reported feeling the impact of the blast up to 50km (31 miles) away. Videos verified by the BBC show a fire growing in intensity before a huge explosion, with people subsequently fleeing the blast and others lying wounded on roads surrounded by smoking debris. \"The entire warehouse was filled with smoke, dust and ashes. I don't remember if I went under the table or was thrown there by the blast,\" one person who was in the area told state TV. Aerial footage showed at least three areas ablaze and Iran's interior minister later confirmed that the fire was spreading from one container to another. Schools and offices in the region have been ordered to remain closed on Sunday. One private maritime risk firm said it believed the affected containers had contained solid fuel destined for ballistic missiles. The fire was the result of \"improper handling of a shipment of solid fuel intended for use in Iranian ballistic missiles\", Ambrey Intelligence said. Ambrey said it was aware that an Iran-flagged ship \"discharged a shipment of sodium perchlorate rocket fuel at the port in March 2025\". The Financial Times newspaper had previously reported that two vessels had shipped fuel to Iran from China. State media quoted witnesses as saying the explosion occurred after a fire broke out and spread to unsealed containers storing \"flammable materials\". Customs officials later released a statement reported by Iranian state TV saying the explosion had probably resulted from a fire that had broken out in a hazmat and chemical materials storage depot. In a later update Ambrey quoted Iran's National Disaster Management Organisation as saying officials had previously issued warnings to Shahid Rajaee port regarding the safe storage of chemicals. Shahid Rajaee port is Iran's largest and most advanced terminal, through which much of the country's commercial shipping transits. It is located on the Strait of Hormuz, a major shipping channel for oil cargo, and is about 20km (12 miles) west of Bandar Abbas, Iran's major port city on its south coast and home to the Iranian Navy's main base. Iran's national oil production company said the explosion at the port had \"no connection\" to the country's oil refineries, fuel tanks and pipelines, local media reported. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has expressed his \"deep regret and sympathy\" for victims. He has announced a government investigation and sent the interior minister to the region to lead it. Saturday's explosion coincided with the latest round of negotiations between Iranian and US officials on Iran's nuclear programme, with US President Donald Trump aiming to make a deal that would prevent Tehran from gaining nuclear weapons. Negotiating through Oman mediators, both sides reported that progress had been made, but Iran's top representative said work was still needed to narrow differences. Negotiations will continue next week. Iran has said it is open to curbs on its nuclear programme in return for sanctions easing but has insisted it will not stop enriching uranium. It insists its nuclear programme is for civilian use. The talks this year have marked the first high-level engagement between the US and Iran since 2018, when Trump in his first term pulled out of a previous deal to restrict Iran's nuclear activities and reinstated economic sanctions. At least four people have been killed and 500 more injured in Bandar Abbas. The highest-level talks between the two nations since Trump's first term in office will resume next week. Donald Trump has suggested Iran could face military action if it does not agree to a new nuclear deal. The BBC's James Landale looks at how Iran might respond to Trump's threat to agree to a deal or face military action Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi says Iran will \"never accept coercion\" ahead of Saturday's talks in Oman.",

    "title": "Woman who used lipstick to write on statue during Brazil unrest jailed for 14 years",
    "article_text": "A woman who wrote on a statue using lipstick during unrest in the Brazilian capital in 2023 has been jailed for 14 years. Debora Rodrigues took part in the unrest along with hundreds of supporters of former president Jair Bolsonaro, who attacked government buildings following his election loss the previous year. The 29-year-old was convicted of involvement with a criminal organisation aiming to launch a coup and eliminate the democratic rule of law. Justice Cristiano Zanin, one of a panel of five judges overlooking Rodrigues's case, stressed she was not being tried solely for the graffiti and was convicted of multiple offences, but many in Brazil believe her sentence is too harsh. Supporters of Bolsonaro meanwhile say the ruling is further evidence that the Supreme Court has become too powerful and partisan. Rodrigues was arrested as part of a broader investigation into an alleged coup plot against the newly-elected President Lula da Silva. The 39-year-old hairdresser apologised for writing \"You lost, idiot\" on the statue of Justice outside the Supreme Federal Court - an incident dubbed the \"lipstick coup\". She maintains that she did not take part in any violence. \"I went to the protests and I didn't imagine that they would be so turbulent,\" said Rodrigues. \"I have never done anything illegal in my life\". Rodrigues' lawyers said that she did not enter any buildings during the riots and acted impulsively in the \"heat of the moment.\" She expressed regret over her actions. ​ Justice Alexandre de Moraes, presiding over the case, argued that Rodrigues \"consciously and voluntarily\" aligned herself with demonstrators seeking to overthrow the government. He added that Rodrigues had admitted to taking part in anti-democratic acts in her testimony to police, and that gaps in messages on her phone suggested she had attempted to conceal evidence. The case has become a rallying point for Bolsonaro supporters, who view Rodrigues as a victim of political persecution. In February, a video about Rodrigues went viral on social media. The following month, Bolsonaro shared a post about her on X, calling for an amnesty for those involved in the civil unrest in 2023. Bolsonaro is also facing criminal proceedings over the alleged coup attempt. If found guilty he faces over 40 years in prison.

    "title": "'No-one expected this' - how Slot took Liverpool to brink of title",
    "article_text": "'No-one expected this' - how Slot took Liverpool to brink of title \"If you had asked Liverpool fans back in August would their team win the Premier League, most would have said no,\" says former Liverpool goalkeeper Sander Westerveld. Jurgen Klopp was always going to be the hardest of acts to follow as manager. Liverpool supporters were understandably worried about the future when the charismatic German, whose force of personality and success gave him iconic status, announced in January 2024 he was leaving at the end of that season. Who would undertake the seemingly impossible task of replacing Klopp? Would Liverpool tread water or even go backwards for a season or two while his successor settled into the job? \"Klopp was a sort of god who changed the club - not just on the pitch but the whole atmosphere,\" says Westerveld. Former Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso, who had taken Bayer Leverkusen to the brink of a first Bundesliga title, was strongly linked with an Anfield return before announcing he was staying in Germany and that paved the way for Arne Slot's appointment. \"At that moment I didn't even think about Arne,\" adds fellow Dutchman Westerveld, who has remained friends with Slot since their playing days together at Sparta Rotterdam in 2007-08. \"Nobody in England knew an awful lot about him. Everybody who knows football said it was going to be a huge task and that this was an unknown coach who comes from the Netherlands.\" Yet the transition from Klopp to Slot has been seamless, culminating in Liverpool needing just one more point to win the championship for a record-equalling 20th time. With 24 wins in 33 games and just two defeats, Slot's Liverpool have made top spot their own after looking down on the rest of the Premier League since 2 November. And now, if they avoid defeat against Tottenham on Sunday, they will be champions of England - with four games to spare - for just the second time since 1989-90. Slot, who ruled himself out of the running to become the next Spurs boss while at Feyenoord in May 2023, would join an elite band of bosses in the Premier League era to have delivered the title in their first season in charge. Jose Mourinho (2004-05) and Carlo Ancelotti (2009-10) both managed it at Chelsea before Manuel Pellegrini (2013-14) accomplished the feat at Manchester City. The last boss to do so before Slot was Antonio Conte - also at Chelsea - in 2016-17. \"Nobody expected this,\" adds Ian Doyle, chief Liverpool writer for the Liverpool Echo. \"In terms of an achievement for a manager in his first season at Liverpool, it has to be right up there.\" Neil Atkinson, presenter and CEO of Liverpool fans' podcast and website The Anfield Wrap, adds: \"I don't think anyone wanted the new manager to come in and try to be a Jurgen Klopp tribute act. \"All Liverpool fans wanted was Slot to be himself - and that's what he has been.\" 'Slot's Liverpool will evolve, but he can build with Salah & Van Dijk' Slot - the 'control freak' inspired by Guardiola In many ways, Slot's main job has been to build on and improve the outstanding squad left behind by his predecessor, who averaged 80.33 points in his last three seasons at Anfield. Four more victories would see Liverpool break the 90-point barrier after Slot tightened the defence and brought more control to the midfield. \"They've amassed these points by winning when it's hard, winning when it's ugly, winning when the opposition have put up a fight,\" adds Atkinson. \"Liverpool have managed to do that - none of their rivals have.\" WhileFederico Chiesahas been the only addition to Slot's squad for this season, the Dutch coach has improved players, including Ryan Gravenberch, who has grasped his opportunity at the base of Liverpool's midfield after the club missed out on signingMartin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad. With 27 Premier League goals and 18 assists in 33 appearances - compared to 18 goals and 10 assists in 32 appearances in Klopp's final season, Mohamed Salah's figures under Slot have been seriously impressive. Gravenberch's Netherlands team-mate Cody Gakpo has also provided 16 goals in all competitions in 2024-25, matching his tally from last season. \"In his first meeting with the players, Arne had all the data from the season they were champions in 2019-20 and all the data from the final season under Klopp,\" adds Westerveld. \"Last season, compared to the title season, there were less sprints, the team was less effective. Instead of saying to the players, 'come on, work hard', he was telling them exactly what they had to do and needed to know showing them all the data.\" There have been tweaks off the field too, with Slot implementing a new routine to how his players build up to games. Under Klopp, the day would begin later but this season players have been at the training ground in Kirkby, about six and a half miles from Anfield, at 9.15am for breakfast. Slot and his backroom team have introduced a process known as 'body wake-up' which involves breathing exercises before both training and matches. Under Klopp, the Liverpool squad would stay together in a hotel before home games. That is no longer the case, with players allowed to remain at their own homes. Training sessions have been longer than before but less intense to reduce injury risk, with fitness issues undermining several campaigns in recent years. In addition, Slot has made key hires behind the scenes. Ruben Peeters, a specialist in periodisation (the science of optimising training loads), followed Slot from Feyenoord, Dr Jonathan Power was promoted to director of medicine and performance, while Amit Pannu joined as a new first-team doctor. Liverpool's tactical tweaks under new boss Sander Westerveld (pictured right at Liverpool's training ground) is a friend and former team-mate of Arne Slot Liverpool fans had plenty of time to get used to Slot before his first Premier League game in charge. There were three months between the Reds announcing him as theirnew head coachand the match at Ipswich on 17 August. It helped that Klopp, after his final match in charge, urged supporters to sing with him: \"Arne Slot, na na na na na\" to the tune of Opus' Live Is Life before the German waved goodbye to Anfield - a chant that has become more and more popular at the ground as the season has gone on. \"Before his first home game in front of 60,000 I asked Arne if he was nervous,\" says Westerveld, who won the FA Cup, League Cup and Uefa Cup at Liverpool in 2000-01 under Gerard Houllier. \"He said, 'Oh well, you know, I was manager of Feyenoord and we had a stadium of 50,000 so I'm used to that'. \"I said, 'No, Arnie. No... this is Anfield, this is different'. He was downplaying everything. \"Then I thought about it afterwards and Liverpool is perfect for him. He's just a normal guy, down to earth, feet on the floor, very calm. For him everything is the same and he doesn't change. \"He didn't get carried away when Liverpool won 11 of the first 12 games, and he didn't panic when they lost the League Cup final five days after going out of the Champions League.\" One banner that has become a regular feature in The Kop this season is 'Arne's Slot Machine', a nod towards his popularity with supporters young and old. He has befriendedIsaac Kearney, a Liverpool-obsessedseven-year-old, who was born with a rare condition known as Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome, meaning he develops at a slower rate than other children his age. When the club heard about Isaac's story, they invited him, his mum and dad Melissa and Alan, and older sister Florence to the training ground to meet the players. They were told they might not see Slot as he was busy planning for a game. \"Isaac was walking past the manager's office with Mo [Salah] and Virgil [van Dijk] and Isaac being Isaac shouted 'Arne' through the window at him,\" Melissa recalls. \"Arne was in a meeting but came out to chat with Isaac. He was so genuine and down to earth. We sat down for lunch and Arne came over and was fist-bumping Isaac. \"Arne asked if he was having a nice day and Isaac told him he was still waiting to see Trent [Alexander-Arnold]. Arne said, 'I'm going to take you to meet him right now'.\" Before Liverpool's home game with Southampton in March, Slot also name-checked Isaac in his pre-match news conference. Asked how he would cope with serving a touchline ban, the Reds boss said he would be sitting in the stand close to his friend Isaac. Slot spent time with Isaac Kearney (right), his mum Melissa, dad Alan and sister Florence after Liverpool invited the family to the training ground Slot comes across as likeable, approachable and intelligent in interviews, although there were occasions in his early days when he struggled to grasp the local dialect. Before Liverpool's Champions League game with Bologna in October, a local reporter asked if preparations for a big European game were any different to a domestic match. \"That was a bit of Scouse,\" said Slot, struggling to understand the local accent before turning to Tony Barrett, director of first team communications, for help. \"He's relaxed into the job,\" adds Doyle. \"Anyone who has seen his press conferences, he doesn't mind a laugh and a joke. He's mentioned in the past that his dad reads the newspapers.\" Arend Slothit the headlinesin January when Arne revealed his dad was not impressed with the way the Reds performed in the 2-1 Champions League win over Lille. \"When I called him after the game he says, 'ah, it wasn't as exciting as other games of Liverpool',\" said Arne at the time. Doyle adds: \"I haven't seen him snap in press conferences but if he doesn't believe a question is fair he'll make a point of addressing that fact. \"He always says 'this season we've basically got what we deserved' whether it's after a win over Real Madrid in the Champions League or defeat by Newcastle in the League Cup final.\" Westerveld was at Goodison Park in February when Slot was shown a red card after a dramatic Merseyside derby ended 2-2, with Everton equalising in the 98th minute. \"He looked really angry when he walked off the pitch and then he saw me and straight away he smiled,\" he adds. \"It's like I said before... he doesn't get too down. He's exactly the same as he was in his first coaching role at Cambuur.\" Away from football in the Netherlands, Slot used to relax by playing golf with Westerveld, but since moving to Liverpool he keeps fit playing racquet sport padel with his backroom staff at the training ground. \"Go home, eat, take the computer out, watch the training session back, prepare for the next meeting,\" said Slot - whose family have remained in the Netherlands - earlier this season when asked what he does after training. \"He's clearly a brilliant coach... and a serious minded person,\" adds Atkinson. \"His reaction to getting knocked out of the Champions League by Paris St-Germain wasn't to bemoan the referee or blame injuries. \"He said it was thebest game he had ever coached in.He has shown genuine humility while simultaneously having a real sense of confidence in himself, his coaching staff and players.\" Liverpool fans have taken Slot to their hearts Not since they were champions in the early 1980s have Liverpool won back-to-back league titles. Assuming they do go on to complete the job, will they build on this season's incredible success? While there has been no need for a rebuild in 2024-25, Slot is expected to be active in the transfer market to ensure Liverpool are in a strong position next season. Although Salah has signed anew two-year contractand captain Virgil van Dijk has also committed his future, England international Alexander-Arnold isexpected to move to Real Madrid. Reported Liverpool targets include Newcastle's Sweden forward Alexander Isak and Bournemouth's Hungary left-back Milos Kerkez. \"I refuse to believe Slot will allow standards to slip next season,\" adds Atkinson. \"I think they'll break 80 points again - and if you do that you have every chance of being in the conversation for the title.\" Westerveld will be at Anfield on 25 May, when Liverpool host Crystal Palace on the final day of the season, in the hope of seeing his friend and former team-mate show off the Premier League trophy. \"To come from coaching in the Netherlands to the Premier League... I didn't expect it to be so easy for him to adapt,\" he admits. \"At the start of the season I used to send him a message to congratulate him after a win. Then I sent him a message saying, 'I'm not going to congratulate anymore because it's getting boring'.\" This video can not be played I want to keep Liverpool at the top - Slot Latest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views Get Liverpool news sent straight to your phone",

    "title": "'Glasner's FA Cup heroes give Tuchel food for thought'",
    "article_text": "This video can not be played Highlights: Palace beat Villa to reach FA Cup final When Crystal Palace languished in the Premier League's bottom three in October without a win in eight games, manager Oliver Glasner gave an insight into the managerial style that has now led them to the brink of history. Asked, after a loss at Nottingham Forest, to explain how he would react to a wretched start that had brought Palace only three points, the Austrian said: \"It's time for hugging players, not kicking them.\" And there was plenty of hugging at Wembley after Glasner's Palace moved to within one game of the club's first major honour with an outstanding FA Cup semi-final win over Aston Villa. The 50-year-old's refusal to embrace tough love and simply embrace was rewarded with a 3-0 victory inspired by the brilliance of Eberechi Eze and Ismaila Sarr, but which was also a pitch-perfect team display from back to front. And, amid it all, four key elements of Palace's landmark victory - Eze, goalkeeper Dean Henderson, Marc Guehi, and Adam Wharton - all pushed their claims to England head coach Thomas Tuchel in brilliant fashion. Crystal Palace thump Aston Villa to reach FA Cup final 'It's all about moments' - the goals Palace fans will never forget As the Palace fans belted out their Dave Clark Five anthem 'Glad All Over' at one end of Wembley draped in red and blue, this high-class performance was not simply justification for Glasner's methods, but also the faith shown in him by chairman Steve Parish and the club's hierarchy. The barren run in the early weeks of this campaign - their worst start in the Premier League since 1992-93 - came after Palace ended last season with 19 points from their last 21. It also came, however, after they lost brilliant forward Michael Olise to Bayern Munich and key defender Joachim Andersen to Fulham. Parish backed Glasner, telling BBC Sport after the semi-final: \"I never had any doubt -  watching him work, the positivity and the way he is. He loves football, always believes we can win, and he instils that in his players. \"This was superb. I thought they were excellent. All credit to the manager and the players. You can see what it means to them. \"I thought this was a real celebration of fans. Two clubs who haven't won a lot of honours in recent times. For us never. A great occasion at Wembley and we stand at the edge of doing something we've never done before.\" The crowning moment of Glasner's career to date has been winning the Europa League with Eintracht Frankfurt in 2022 - claiming the first major honour in this proud, passionate south London club's history may even top that. It was done under the gaze of three of his predecessors in Roy Hodgson, Alan Smith and Steve Coppell, the latter taking Palace to the 1990 FA Cup final, where they lost after a replay against Manchester United. This video can not be played 'Unbelievable performance' - Glasner on Palace win The headlines will be grabbed, understandably, by the spectacular feats of Eze, who started the ball rolling after 31 minutes with a stunning rising finish past Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez, and Sarr. Sarr drilled in the second just before the hour, then ran clear deep into stoppage time to score, wrapping up a result that sends a clear warning to potential FA Cup final opponents Manchester City and Nottingham Forest. This, however, does not do justice to the excellence running right through Palace's team which will surely give England coach Tuchel food for thought. Everton's Jordan Pickford is rightly established as England's first choice, but Palace goalkeeper Henderson gave the sort of mature display on the big stage that confirms he will provide the sternest competition. Tuchel is known to admire Henderson, and he was there when Palace needed him at Wembley. He saved well from Ezri Konsa's header in the first half, but two stops just after the break from John McGinn and Lucas Digne were crucial, halting any momentum Villa hoped to gather. Crystal Palace captain Guehi, arguably England's best player at Euro 2024, was surprisingly excluded in favour of Newcastle United's Dan Burn for Tuchel's first game against Albania at Wembley, but here he again demonstrated leadership and high quality on the few occasions Villa exerted real pressure. This video can not be played How Palace dominated Villa in semi-final Eze's impact earned him the man-of-the-match award, but he will surely have faced strong competition from the brilliant Wharton, who strode through midfield in style, a potent mixture of composure, creation and that priceless ability to win possession then use it well. Former England captain Wayne Rooney is a firm admirer, telling BBC Sport: \"Attacking players get a lot of the credit, but Adam Wharton was outstanding. His commitment and winning the ball back - I thought he was the best player on the pitch.\" This follows rich praise delivered by Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola, who described him as \"an excellent holding midfielder\". Wharton's somewhat strolling style, socks at half mast, belies a fierce competitive instinct. He was not included in Tuchel's first full England squad as Palace nursed him back after groin surgery, but the German knows what a talent he has at his disposal. He was included in England's under-21s squad, but trained alongside the senior players at St George's Park. Wharton, it was, who robbed Villa's Youri Tielemans to start the move that ended with Sarr scoring Palace's crucial second. It was one of five successful tackles he made, the most of any player in the semi-final. And so Palace go on to their third FA Cup final at Wembley, led by the charismatic Glasner and his eminently watchable team. Can he now succeed where Coppell and Alan Pardew failed and write his name into the Crystal Palace history books?

    "title": "'Off days don't exist' for Celtic 'mentality monsters'",
    "article_text": "This video can not be played Watch the celebrations as Celtic clinch fourth title in row When Kasper Schmeichel, a Premier League winner, tells you that what Celtic do year in and year out is \"extremely difficult and shouldn't be underestimated\", you should probably listen. The 38-year-old was passed the Celtic gloves by long-time pal Joe Hart last summer when he was reunited with Brendan Rodgers. At Leicester City, the two won the FA Cup and Community Shield. Before that, Denmark international Schmeichel was part of the team who won the league under Claudio Ranieri, and he has scooped up a bounty of individual awards in his career. Now he has a Scottish Premiership and League Cup in his cabinet and - although injured for now - hopes to be back in time to add a Scottish Cup medal and help Celtic complete a sixth domestic treble in nine years. While the first title win of Schmeichel's career couldn't have been more unforeseeable in his Leicester days, the second couldn't have been more expected. But he does not care for that narrative. \"Much is made of the Scottish league and the competition, but you have to win every single game,\" Schmeichel told Sky Sports. \"It's extremely difficult and definitely shouldn't be underestimated. Off days don't exist for us.\" Celtic overwhelm Dundee Utd to seal 13th title in 14 years Celtic's success shouldn't feel 'normalised' What were the key games in Celtic's title triumph? For so much of this campaign, it has been a case of when, not if, Celtic would clinch a 13th title in 14 seasons, such is there utter domestic dominance. In recent weeks, there has been discourse around the routineness of these trophy days. Captain Callum McGregor, Rodgers and now Schmeichel have all shot down that sentiment. 'You don't get sick of it' has been the gist of their retort. \"They're mentality monsters,\" former Celtic striker Chris Sutton said of Rodgers' side on Sky Sports. \"They've made winning the league look so easy again and it's anything but.\" When Sutton joined in 2000 from Chelsea, Celtic won their third treble in his first season. Now they're on course for their sixth in nine campaigns. \"They're winning them every other season now, their mentality is phenomenal,\" Sutton said. \"It's so underestimated. \"It is so, so difficult to win games of football - Martin O'Neill used to emphasise that to us on a weekly basis - but to do in the style they do as well.\" Celtic have been Scotland's dominant side in the 21st Century A sticky start at Tannadice on Saturday was soon forgotten as Rodgers' Celtic scored five goals in the game that clinched the title for the fourth time running. They don't fall over the finish line, they sprint over it. When Nicolas Kuhn cushioned in his second of the afternoon - and 20th of the season - it was Celtic's 100th goal of the league season. Adam Idah added the 101st and 102nd after the break. In the manager's first season in charge - the invincible campaign of 2016-17 - they hit 106 goals. Pre-match, Rodgers said the target now was to better that. They have four games to score five goals and do that. With 10 in their last two - 15 in three if you include last week's Scottish Cup semi-final scudding of St Johnstone - you would fancy them to do that. \"That relentless nature is what we're all about,\" said Schmeichel. \"Any championship-winning team has to have that internal drive. It starts with the manager and it's up to us to implement them. \"We are constantly striving for better, striving for more.\" That's a harrowing thought for the rest given Celtic have now claimed 21 of the last 26 available major domestic honours. Unprecedented and utter domination. This video can not be played Success at Celtic 'means the world' to Callum McGregor Evidently irked by the outside noise surrounding the perceived monotonous movie of title after title, trophy after trophy, Celtic will make sure they enjoy this one. McGregor will lift his ninth trophy as captain on the final day of the season against St Mirren. His 24th in total with the club. James Forrest has moved out on his own as the most decorated player in the club's history with 26 major honours, overtaking Lisbon Lion Bobby Lennox. If you focused on the two senior players at the full-time whistle, you would be forgiven for thinking it was their first time feeling it, such was the way they immersed themselves in the celebrations. \"You have to cherish it and live in the moment because someday it'll all be over and you'll never get the chance to do it again,\" McGregor, 31, told BBC Scotland. For much of his career, though, the former Scotland international has had good odds to do it again. Team-mate Schmeichel, not so much. He got a taste for it down south but now has the opportunity to cash in on that buzz season on season. \"When you win a game in the Premier League, you're celebrating, but here it's totally expected and I love it,\" he said.",

    "title": "Resilient England finally get test they needed",
    "article_text": "This video can not be played 'We got it done' - England coach Mitchell on 'nervy' Grand Slam win The clock goes red and France need a score to win the Women's Six Nations Grand Slam at Allianz Stadium, Twickenham. That was not in the script. England had cruised past their competition leading up the Grand Slam decider, scoring 33 tries in four comfortable wins. Les Bleues came off the back of a scare in Parma against Italy, where they were behind at half-time but were saved by a second-half response. The general consensus was the Red Roses would cruise to a fourth consecutive Grand Slam. A thrilling43-42 win secured four in a rowand a seventh straight Six Nations title was achieved. It may not have been perfect and the \"complete performance\" England head coach John Mitchell asked of his players. Before the 25-minute mark, Mitchell's side led 31-7 but their dominance did not remain as their visitors outscored their hosts 21-12 in the second half, scoring six tries across the 80 minutes. However, Mitchell was happy his side have been tested before a home Rugby World Cup that starts in August. \"I would rather have this sort of feedback any day of the week,\" Mitchell told BBC Sport. \"We got it done, we completed a goal that hasn't been done in the modern era - four Grand Slams in a row - and now we can have a celebration and get ready for a World Cup. \"The French get energy from success but I knew that we would have to win the game three or four times.\" England's last defeat in the Six Nations was against France in 2018 and in any fixture was in the World Cup finalby New Zealand in 2022. The Red Roses are on a 25-game winning run and eyeing their own record 30-Test winning streak, which came to an end in that World Cup final. A pattern which Mitchell does not want repeated. \"Those [close] games do help us - we get them occasionally,\" Mitchell added. \"The Red Roses are a unique team in the world but teams are out to perform against us. \"It's going to continue in 2025. We are going to have to raise our game, that is clear.\" This video can not be played England lift the Women's Six Nations trophy Alongside winning a seventh title in a row, Mitchell made clear his priority was to build\"two teams\"for this year's World Cup. Having used 34 players and trusting the likes of full-back Emma Sing to start a Grand Slam decider to avoid risking Ellie Kildunne's minor hamstring injury, Mitchell achieved his goal of building a wider squad. Continuity in selection will always affect team cohesion, and despite it preventing a full 80-minute performance, Mitchell has built incredible player depth. Competition for places is at an all-time high, proven by both 2014 World Cup-winners Marlie Packer and Emily Scarratt missing out on the matchday squad at Allianz Stadium. \"You can't play eight matches with the same group in a World Cup,\" the New Zealander said. \"We don't have to do that because of the competition we have got. \"We give them their jobs early. Some girls might only get one game at the World Cup and that is my job. We have matured massively in that area now. We are ready for what is to come.\" If England and France top their pool and win their quarter-finals they will meet in Bristol for the semi-finals of this year's World Cup. Former England flanker Maggie Alphonsi, who also won the World Cup in 2014, agrees with Mitchell that a tough test against Les Bleues will be a blessing for the Red Roses come the showpiece tournament. \"The Six Nations needed that jeopardy,\" Alphonsi told BBC Sport. \"It was a proper Test match and England should be proud of the way they dug deep to win. \"They had to grind it out and you want that test before a World Cup.\" This video can not be played England survive France comeback to win Grand Slam by a single point The Red Roses have been defeated by the Black Ferns in the past two World Cup finals and the draw for this year's tournament means they could again present the final hurdle. Since losing to New Zealand in 2022, Mitchell's side have defeated the world champions three times to increase their tag of favourites for the competition. Canada, who are ranked number two in the world behind England, have also vastly improved anddespite defeatgave the Six Nations champions a good test at WXV1 in October. With nations improving, the knack of simply getting over the line when it matters will stand Mitchell's side in good stead. \"Would England have got away with that playing New Zealand?\" former England hooker Brian Moore told BBC Sport. \"That's the question they have to ask. It is about winning and England got over the line.\" England captain Zoe Aldcroft had a practice run at lifting a trophy at the venue that hosts the World Cup final. She nearly dropped it, but like her team held on. Should England make the final at Twickenham in September, the skipper and her team will be ready for whatever comes their way.

    "title": "What went wrong and what next for Ipswich?",
    "article_text": "This video can not be played Ipswich already looking to the future after relegation Ipswich Town's rapid rise to the top is now starting a descent the club itself has been braced for. Successive promotions from League One to the Premier League ended their 22-year exile from the top flight last summer, but they have been unable to stave off an immediate return to the Championship. The Tractor Boys' fate was sealed on Saturday afternoon by Champions League-chasing Newcastle, who capitalised on Ben Johnson's first-half red card to secure a comfortable 3-0 victory. Ipswich's relegation is not a huge surprise, even within Portman Road. They are in better shape than fellow relegated sides Southampton and Leicester - financially and in terms of strategy and togetherness. But that did not make the sound of Michael Salisbury's final whistle at St James' Park any less painful for boss Kieran McKenna and his players, who looked crestfallen as they applauded their fans at full time. \"We're disappointed and gutted the dream is over,\" said defender Luke Woolfenden. \"We've not been at it this season. I think we have probably let ourselves down one too many times.\" McKenna, meanwhile, admitted he had come to terms with the prospect of relegation following the2-1 defeat by Wolvesat Portman Road earlier this month. \"We knew we had given ourselves too much to do,\" he told Sky Sports. \"We knew the games had run out.\" Newcastle send Ipswich down as Magpies go third With the Saints and the Foxes joining Ipswich in the Championship next season, all three promoted sides have suffered instant demotion. It is the first time in Premier League history that the identity of all three relegated sides has been known with as many as four games to go, and the second time after 2005-06 that all three have been confirmed before May. It is not difficult to understand why McKenna cut a resigned figure after the Wolves defeat, which left the Tractor Boys 12 points adrift of safety with seven matches remaining. His team have lost a league-high 27 points from winning positions this season - including the loss against Wolves, who recovered from 1-0 down to triumph 2-1. They have also struggled to turn Portman Road into a fortress, collecting just seven of their 21 points so far in front of their own supporters. Only rock-bottom Southampton have picked up fewer points on home soil this season. \"There are so many lessons,\" McKenna said. \"Ours might be different from other clubs' because we've climbed so quickly from League One. It's been a massive challenge. \"There are many things we have done positively that will set us up well for the years ahead, and there are some things we could have done better and things we will learn from.\" Injuries have not been kind to Ipswich either this season. They were without 10 first-team players at Newcastle on Saturday, with Leif Davis' suspension leaving them without a recognised left-back. Discipline - or a lack of it - has also been an issue. Johnson's dismissal was Ipswich's fifth red card of the season - only Arsenal have had as many red cards in the top flight in 2024-25. \"[Red cards] have been costly,\" McKenna told BBC Match of the Day. \"I think we had one in my two-and-half years before this season. \"To have five this season is a reflection of a lot of things.\" Liam Delap is Ipswich's top scorer this season with 12 Premier League goals For a club who were in League One two years ago, the step up to the top flight was always going to be huge - and Ipswich needed to recruit significantly to try to bridge the gap. The Tractor Boys spent around Â£120m last summer and added Â£20m Jaden Philogene in January. They targeted young English assets in a business decision â Liam Delap, Jack Clarke and Jacob Greaves â that the club expect to make money on this summer or beyond. The investment did not work in terms of keeping them in the division, but Ipswich believe the value in their squad is there. Striker Delap is the obvious example, with the striker poised to net the club a minimum of Â£30m because of the relegation release clause in his contract. The 22-year-old's 12 Premier League goals have seen him become the club's standout performer and the expectation is he will move in the summer. He has not been pushing to leave and Delap is understood to be conscious of making the right move, rather than jumping at the biggest offer from the biggest club. They may also lose Davis or forward Omari Hutchinson but the cash is there to invest, those sales would help with any Profit and Sustainability concerns, and Ipswich are wary of balancing the books without harming the squad's quality. McKenna's future will also be up for speculation. He was close to joining Crystal Palace last February - before they appointed Oliver Glasner - while flirtations with Brighton, Chelsea and Manchester United ultimately came to nothing before he signed a new deal last April. He will remain hot property, despite relegation, but there is currently no obvious pathway away from Portman Road. McKenna is planning to lead Ipswich in the Championship, where they intend to back him again in the summer with the target an immediate return to the Premier League. He said month: \"I was proud to lead the club when we were in League One. I was proud to lead the club when we were in the Championship and I'm proud to lead the club now in the Premier League. So that doesn't change my perspective too much. \"We're already looking forward again, to be honest, irrespective of what division we're in. We're already looking forward to progressing the club further.\"",

    "title": "Fifty years since the sky fell: how the Vietnam war changed Australia",
    "article_text": "“It’s like the world collapsed,” says Thi Xa Nguyen, looking back 50 years to the fall of Saigon. She was living in the coastal town of Vũng Tàu where the soldiers of the southern Army of the Republic ofVietnamhad retreated. A 12-hour walk away in Long Thanh, Nguyen’s mother waited. There was only one way to know if her daughters were alive as their motherland fell – so she started walking. Like the war itself, the date that commemorates its ending has lots of names. To millions of Vietnamese people today, it isgiải phóng– the liberation; but for many it is the fall of Saigon orngày vong quốc– the day the country was lost. Nguyen says it was the day ofsụp trời– the sky falling. Wednesday marks 50 years since the northern People’s Army of Vietnam captured Saigon, the capital of the southern Republic of Vietnam, ending a war that had raged on for nearly two decades, taking more than a million lives and leaving thousands displaced. In Vietnam, there will be a sense of nostalgia in the air. It’ll be Reunification Day and every year the streets are emblazoned with national symbols: a golden star on a red flag and phrases expounding socialist values. The film-maker Mai Huyen Chi, speaking to the Guardian from Da Nang, had family on both sides of the war – remembering 1975 is not as straightforward. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads While her mother’s family were ordinary citizens of south Vietnam, Mai’s grandfather was a war hero, fighting against both the French and Americans in the consecutive Indochina wars. She says he fought for “dignity, self-respect (and) because the French were ruling a country that didn’t belong to them … it made sense for the Vietnamese that we should run our own country.” Since the conclusion of theVietnam war– or American war as Mai and many Vietnamese call it – the country has developed at a breakneck pace. In a single generation, the nation has emerged from devastating poverty to become one of the rising middle-income economies of the region. But Mai feels like Liberation Day in Vietnam will just be another public holiday. “I don’t know if they even care,” Mai wonders about today’s young Vietnamese. She believes that in the age of social media, people only ever lived in prospering and independent Vietnam do not have the bandwidth to engage in history. In Australia, the mood is very different. By the time northern troops had entered Saigon, most Australians had already left Vietnam, save for embassy staff and journalist Neil Davis, who scooped an exclusive film of tanks smashing through the gates of the southern president’s palace. Australian forces, about 50,000 service personnel, had been withdrawn by 1971. “All Ho Chi Minh wanted was his country,” says Vietnam war veteran Tony Mullavey. “Someone put a bloody line through it, and there was north and south.” It’s a perspective that Mullavey has developed with age, but at the time, he says, “we were doing our duty … it was for the good of Australia”. He was conscripted to fight in Vietnam a few months before he turned 20. He recalls his training, being taught that the enemy wore black pyjamas and conical hats, and then arriving in Vietnam to see ordinary civilians in black pyjamas conical hats. It was there, he says, that they all grew up and experienced something many back home wouldn’t understand. “Vietnam wasn’t considered a war,” Mullavey says. Despite the lethal combat, there was no formal declaration of war on the northern Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Organisations like RSL NSW would ostracise service personnel who returned from Vietnam. It would be a fight to get veterans the recognition they were due fighting for Australia. “Today, the younger veterans can thank us.” It was that struggle that established organisations, like the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia, that ensured those who fought in Vietnam got their due benefits and recognition. They also opened benefits to the refugee veterans of the southern Republic of Vietnam army – making Australia one of the only countries in the world to do so. But for Mullavey and his brothers in arms, the association and its outposts has been a vital source of human connection. Perhaps the most visible way the Vietnam war changed Australia was through the thousands of Vietnamese refugees it accepted.

His government declared the end of the White Australia policy and in the same year that Saigon fell, the Whitlam government passed the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. Despite that, Whitlam had been apprehensive to accept Vietnamese refugees from the fallen south – many of whom would face reprisal for working with foreign forces like Australia. Whitlam’s government saw southern refugees as anti-communist and potentially anti-Labor. Labor senator and repatriation minister, John Wheeldon, once said: “What did we see in the dying hours of the so-called Saigon government? What did we see of these heroic defenders of democracy? We saw them doing the scoot as fast as their legs could carry them.” It wouldn’t be until 1976 – and a change in government – that Vietnamese refugees started arriving. Under the leadership of Malcolm Fraser, Australia came to accept the most refugees per capita of any country. In 1981, Thi Xa Nguyen got her chance to seek asylum. Her husband had survived arrest and re-education to save enough money and petrol to leave Vietnam by boat. They sedated their daughters and boarded what essentially was a riverboat. It was a voyage of seven days before they arrived in Indonesia. By 1982, Thi and her family had been resettled in Melbourne. It was a journey often recalled in dreams, but it all came flooding back vividly at her daughter Tammy’s wedding. “I got married in Fiji,” says Tammy, who is the chief executive of the Vietnamese Museum Australia. “The ferry that we took was very unfortunate because … the weather was really terrible … and it was so traumatic for her. It just reminded her of the escape from Vietnam.” “It was actually really challenging,” Tammy says. She’s part of what the community calls the 1.5 generation, a cohort of refugees who arrived in Australia as children and grew up in a land drastically different from the one they were born in. To this day, she remembers how hard it was to grow up as a minority. “If in your formative years you don’t fit in somewhere, who do you fit in with?” Tammy remembers from her work social worker when her community was overrepresented in prisons in Melbourne. “It was pretty diabolical … If you’re a displaced person and your parents are busy setting up a new life, they’re busy working and don’t have time, you’re going to hang out with other kids … who feel ostracised by western society.” “We were normal kids growing up who got into a whole lot of issues: drugs, teen pregnancy, crime.” Today Vietnamese is the fourth most spoken language in Australia , and more than 300,000 Australians have Vietnamese ancestry. Vietnamese staples like banh mi and pho have entered the culinary lexicon (and standard dictionary) of the country. Thi says despite the pain she endured and the nation that she lost, becoming an Australian has been “like a dream come true”. “That’s what we were raised with. Gratitude for being in this country,” Tammy says. “We have a good life off the back of the sacrifice that my parents made. I wouldn’t have this life if they weren’t brave enough to get on that boat.”",

    "article_text": "Marmalade was never really my jam, but at the world marmalade awards at Dalemain house on the edge of theLake District, I found myself a convert. The experience has given weight to my theory that you might fall in love with any food if you try it at its finest. Hate tomatoes? Go to Italy. Not a fan ofmarmalade? Savour a spoonful in the presence of beaming marmalade fanatics who have spent their lives devoted to creating the tangiest, sweetest, jelly-ish version of the preserve. At first I was sceptical about tasting the jam off the spoon. What is marmalade without the soft layer of butter? The crunch of toast? Surely it cannot be enjoyed without its accompaniments. Reassured by the purists, I dive in. The first one I try is Keya Jam, a marmalade made from citrus taiwanica, a fruit endemic to the forests of Miaoli inTaiwan. The marmalade is the perfect blend of sweet and bitter: honey notes come through more powerfully at the end and melt away the sharper taste of the citrus taiwanica. The texture is jelly-like, wobbling on the spoon. It’s also smooth, with peel so finely cut it immediately melts in the mouth. Next up is the winner of the “interesting additions” category: a marmalade made with Seville oranges, clementines, lemon, sugar and peanut butter. I was apprehensive about this one. I’ve never been a fan of mixing two big staples together. But I am pleasantly surprised. The peanut flavour immediately tickles through, but it’s not overpowering, and gently fades into the background giving space for the citrus notes to shine through. Japanese marmalades are traditionally more bitter in taste, but Hitomi Wakamura’s winning marmalade is the exception. The notes of pear make it deliciously sweet. Made with yuzu, a small, round citrus fruit, it’s zesty and tastes exceptionally fresh, as if the fruit had just been picked off a tree. The mix of flavours are exquisite.",

Yet with a week to go tothe election,polls showthe Coalition is losing the mortgage belt, and is in a weaker position now than when the campaign began three weeks ago. Many lay the blame on a poorly performing shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, who may be a technically better economist than his counterpart,Jim Chalmers, but is a far worse political performer. But it’s not just the message. Focused on the past, Dutton and his team have looted policies from the Morrison government that are geared to fight the last war. Take halving the fuel excise for six months. It’s the same measure introduced in March 2022 but set against a hugely different backdrop. Three years ago petrol prices were spiking after Russia’s invasion in Ukraine. Now oil prices are plunging and a litre of petrol is 10 cents cheaper than it was at the start of the year. Sign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025 Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Then there’s the low- and middle-income tax offset, which is worth as much as $1,200 for those earning up to $144,000 in 2025-26. It’s another Morrison-era relic that became a feature of the former Coalition government’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic but feels slightly anachronistic now. In contrast, Albanese and Chalmers have made a show of focusing on the future, of the progress that has been made. Sure, they really didn’t have much choice – but it has been the right one. And there’s a good story to tell, albeit carefully. Real wages have been climbing for a year and the battle to tame inflation has not pushed unemployment up. The economy has regained momentum and even the threat from Donald Trump’s trade war plays into the hands of the incumbents. Labor will get another opportunity to trumpet this progress in Wednesday’s inflation figures. The headlines will be about further interest rate cuts on the way, and economists are talking about three this year. That’s not to say that Labor has presented a compelling suite of meaningful reforms that are desperately needed to underpin the next era of national prosperity. It hasn’t. But when it comes to what swings votes and wins elections, the old trope holds true: it’s the economy, stupid. And as the two major parties enter the final stretch to Saturday’s election, it has become clear that the economy on many punters’ minds is tomorrow’s, not yesterday’s.

    "title": "Virginia Giuffre, Jeffrey Epstein and Prince Andrew accuser, dies aged 41",
    "article_text": "Virginia Giuffre, one of the most prominent victims of the disgraced US financierJeffrey Epsteinwho alsoalleged she was sexually trafficked to Prince Andrew, has died aged 41. Her family issued a statement on Saturday confirming she took her own life at her farm in Western Australia, where she had lived for several years. “It is with utterly broken hearts that we announce that Virginia passed away last night at her farm in Western Australia. She lost her life to suicide, after being a lifelong victim of sexual abuse and sex trafficking,” the statement read. “In the end, the toll of abuse is so heavy that it became unbearable for Virginia to handle its weight.” Giuffre was one of the most vocal victims of Epstein, alleging she had been groomed and sexually abused by him and his longtime associate,Ghislaine Maxwell, beginning in her teens. The family described her as a “fierce warrior” against sexual abuse and sex trafficking and a “light that lifted so many survivors”. “Despite all the adversity she faced in her life, she shone so bright. She will be missed beyond measure,” they said. Giuffre is survived by her three children, Christian, Noah and Emily, who her family said were the “light of her life”. “It was when she held her newborn daughter in her arms that Virginia realised she had to fight back against those who had abused her and so many others,” they said. “There are no words that can express the grave loss we feel today with the passing of our sweet Virginia. She was heroic and will always be remembered for her incredible courage and loving spirit.” Giuffre’s lawyer, Sigrid McCawley, said she was “much more than a client”. “She was a dear friend and an incredible champion for other victims. Her courage pushed me to fight harder, and her strength was awe-inspiring,” McCawley said. “The world has lost an amazing human being today. Rest in peace, my sweet angel.” Giuffre’s representative Dini von Mueffling said she was “one of the most extraordinary human beings I have ever had the honour to know”. “Deeply loving, wise, and funny, she was a beacon to other survivors and victims. She adored her children and many animals,” she said. “She was always more concerned with me than with herself. I will miss her beyond words. It was the privilege of a lifetime to represent her.” Josh Schiffer, a lawyer who represents one of Epstein’s victims, said Giuffre was integral to exposing the financier. “The case wouldn’t have existed without the input, her cooperation, her bravery at the beginning, inspiring so many other people to come forward,” he told the US cable network NewsNation. Schiffer said: “Her loss will hopefully be a marker and almost an inspiration for people to calling attention to the epidemic that is sex trafficking, that is the international sex industry. This is an issue that still persists. It changes its form all the time and it exists all around the world. This just happened to be a really prominent example.” Western Australia police did not publicly confirm Giuffre had died, but said emergency services responded to reports a 41-year-old woman was unresponsive at a home in Neergabby, about 75km north of Perth, about 9.50pm on Friday. The woman was given emergency first aid but was pronounced dead, they said. The death will be investigated but is not considered suspicious. Earlier this month, Giuffre posted on social media that she hadjust days to live after a school bus crashed into her car. WA police later confirmed a 41-year-old woman was in a car that collided with a bus on 24 March but there were no reported injuries. It is understood Giuffre presented to a Perth hospital emergency department on 1 April. Giuffre, who is American, said she met Maxwell, a British socialite, in 2000 when working as a locker-room assistant at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Maxwell offered her a job as massage therapist to Epstein, during which she alleged she was trafficked to the financier’s friends and clients – “passed around like a platter of fruit”. In a 2009 civil lawsuit against Epstein, under the pseudonym “Jane Doe 102”, she alleged that her duties included being “sexually exploited by Epstein’s adult male peers including royalty”. Giuffre reached a settlement with Epstein in that case before it went to trial. In 2021, Giuffrefiled a civil lawsuitagainstPrince Andrewin the federal court in New York, alleging he sexually assaulted her on three occasions when she was 17. Andrew has repeatedly and strongly denied the accusations. In the lawsuit, Giuffre alleged Epstein and Maxwell had introduced her to Andrew in 2001, and alleged that Maxwell forced her to have sex with Andrew. In 2022,Andrew and Giuffre agreed to an out-of-court settlementfor an undisclosed sum. Maxwell, who has maintained her innocence,was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2022for sex trafficking. Epstein wasarrested by federal authorities in July 2019and charged with sex-trafficking counts. Shortly after, hedied by suicidewhile awaiting trial. In the US on Saturday, the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (Rainn) praised Guiffre’s courage while warning that victims of abuse are “significantly more likely to attempt suicide or suffer other long term effects of trauma”. “Our heart goes out to Virginia Giuffre’s family and loved ones and to all those victimized byJeffrey Epsteinand his associates,” said Scott Berkowitz, the president and founder of Rainn, adding that the group “will honor Giuffre’s memory by continuing our work to prevent sexual violence and to improve the criminal justice process for survivors” and urging other victims that they are “never alone” and to reach out for help to relevant groups.

Dutton campaign to head out of Darwin after less than two hours The press pack followingPeter Duttonis about to leave Darwin less than two hours after we first landed. As we mentioned earlier, Dutton visited a small shopping centre to chat with some pharmacists who were worried about local crime. He then ducked into a state politician’s office in the shopping centre to conduct a “roundtable”. A journalist and some cameramen were allowed in to report the initial remarks before being asked to leave so they could discuss issues more candidly. The press pack were then told to get back on the bus to catch the plane to our next stop before the roundtable was finished. The pace of the opposition’s campaign has really ramped up in the last week. For example, it took the travelling press pack more than two hours to fly to NT’s capital from Cairns and will jet off to the next destination having spent less than two hours on the ground. Along the road back to the airport, there are a number of orange Country Liberal party-branded signs spruiking the Coalition’s fuel excise cuts. Thanks for joining me on the blog this morning. I’m handing over now toPetra Stock, who will keep you posted with the afternoon’s news. Storms and flash flooding forecast along NSW coast Severe thunderstorms, heavy rain and flash flooding in New South Wales are expected to shift east, before spilling into parts of Queensland and Victoria on Sunday. Miriam Bradbury, a senior meteorologist at the Bureau of Meteorology, said the low pressure system would act as a magnet for “moisture and strong winds pulling in from out over the ocean and being directed against the New South Wales coast”. Thunderstorms could deliver locally heavy falls leading to flash flooding, she said, with northern inland NSW expected see the highest rainfall totals. We could see widespread rainfall in excess of 40mm across the course of today, but thunderstorms may deliver locally higher falls in the range of 70 to 100mm. Flash flooding was a risk, she said. When a lot of rain falls in a short space of time, our gutters and drainage systems tend to get overwhelmed, and that’s when we see water moving quickly over roads, pathways, public areas and private property. This will quickly lead to some dangerous driving conditions where those heaviest falls occur. We may also see some damage to crops, property and trees, as stronger winds combine with that heavy rain along the east coast tomorrow. The opposition leader,Peter Dutton, has promised to work with the Country Liberal party Northern Territory government to get on top of youth crime in the Top End. Dutton held a roundtable with the chief minister,Lia Finnochario,Lisa Bayliss, the candidate for the federal Labor seat of Solomon, and about 20 locals in a small room in the Karama shopping plaza. Dutton claimed the prime minister,Anthony Albanese, had ignored the crime issue in the NT, as he listened to locals talk about finding meat cleavers left on the streets and having their cars stolen. He invoked his time as a police officer as he pledged to focus on community safety if elected on 3 May. “It instills in you, I think for ever, a real sense of what’s right and wrong, and what we’ve seen in the NT for a long time is just wrong,” Dutton said. You need financial support and moral support to get on top of bail laws … and to provide a secure environment for people to lead their lives. The current government is too focused on what’s happening in the inner cities of Sydney and Melbourne with the Greens. Finnochiaro said her eight-month-old government had started to put downward pressure on crime rates. “We need a federal government that understands the root causes of crime,” she said. – Pool copy Dutton turns focus to cost of living and crime in Darwin Peter Duttonis in Darwin this afternoon to visit the community about cost-of-living and crime issues. His first stop is a small shopping centre in Karama with the Northern Territory chief minister,Lisa Finocchiaro, Liberal candidate for Solomon,Lisa Bayliss, and Indigenous affairs spokesperson,Jacinta Nampijinpa Price. The Labor MPLuke Goslingholds Solomon, which takes in Darwin and some outer suburbs, on a 9.4% margin. Democracy sausages and photo opps The prime minister,Anthony Albanese, health minister,Mark Butler, and finance minister,Katy Gallagher, enjoyed some snags at a barbecue event with Labor supporters at Punchbowl Reserve in the Launceston electorate of Bass. Australia’s only cardinal has spoken in Rome hours before the funeral ofPope Francis, AAP reports. The Melbourne-based CardinalMykola Bychok, Australia’s highest-ranking Catholic official, opened up about what he said was “a profoundly sacred moment for the church and the world”. The 88-year-old pope, who had led the church since 2013, died on Monday after suffering a stroke. More than 200,000 people are expected to attend his funeral outside St Peter’s Basilica from 6pm AEST on Saturday. Bychok, who Francis made a cardinal late in 2024, said the period since the pontiff’s death on Easter Monday had been “a most challenging time”. “As a newly appointed cardinal, this experience is still very new to me,” he said. I have only just arrived here in Rome after spending several days in the Holy Land – days that were marked by silence, prayer and reflection in the very places where our lord walked. Bychok will be part of the conclave to choose a new pontiff, expected to start early in May. Some 160 foreign delegations will attend the funeral alongside world leaders includingDonald Trump. Australia will be represented by the governor general,Sam Mostyn, ambassador to the Holy SeeKeith Pitt, cabinet ministerDon Farrelland Riverina MP,Michael McCormack. Valerie the dachshundtreated to roast chicken after 529 days on the run Kangala Wildlife Rescue has revealedValerie the dachshund’s first meal after 529 days on the run. In a social media update,Lisa Karranfrom the Kangaroo Island wildlife rescue organisation said: We had her favourites – roast chicken and her favourite dog food as well – to help her recognise that we were safe and that we were not a threat. Jared Karran, also from Kangala Wildlife Rescue,said: She looks quite big on the camera. When I saw her in real life, she is tiny. He said they were being extremely careful not to let Valerie out of the cage. There was no way we were letting that sausage dog run away on us again. They said Valerie’s owners, Josh and Georgia, were “over the moon” to receive the news that their dog had finally been secured and would be on her way home soon. ‘Negative narrative’: co-author of Senate submission with Liberal candidate distances herself from claims Hazaras not persecuted due to ethnicity An Afghan-Australian who co-authored a controversial Senate submission with the Liberal candidate for Bruce,Zahid Safi, says she had no involvement in its creation and wants to no longer be associated with it. The 2021 submission to an inquiry into Australia’s involvement in the Afghanistan warsuggested the Hazara community in Afghanistan was not persecutedon the basis of its ethnicity. This contradicted the Australian government and drew rebuke from international human rights groups. The allegations led members of the Hazara community, which has a significant presence in the electorate of Bruce, to lodge their own dissenting submissions to the inquiry, alleging the claims sought to erase the “well-documented persecution of an entire ethnic group”. Tamkin Hakimhas told her social media followers that while she was aware the submission was being written, she “did not write it” and “did not endorse it”. I did not consent for my name to be added to anything that created a negative narrative about the Hazara community. I have requested that my name be removed from any such statements, publications or submission that I did not personally author or endorse. Hakim has previously accused the submission, which still carries her name, of “betraying” the Hazara community. When contacted by Guardian Australia, Safi defended the submission and said he was “a staunch advocate for freedom of religion or belief for all individuals worldwide”: A full and fair reading of my submission makes clear that I advocated for every single living individual at risk from the national atrocity and humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan under the Taliban. TheAustralian Hazara Advocacy Networkhas called on Safi to apologise for the contents of the submission and to be disendorsed. The petition has 15,000 signatures, although it is not known how many of these are from the electorate of Bruce or Victoria. Wet and cloudy day in S-E Qld and northern NSW South-east Queensland and northern New South Wales are looking at a wet and partly cloudy Saturday. There is a high chance of showers for the southern border ranges in Queensland’s south-east, the Bureau of Meteorology says. There is medium chance of showers elsewhere, a chance of a thunderstorm in the south, and temperatures will get to the mid to high 20s. For those in NSW’s northern rivers, expect cloudy skies, a very high chance of showers, a chance of a thunderstorm and light winds. Temperatures will reach the low to mid 20s. There’s only a week to go, and polls are showing that the gap between the two major parties is widening in favour ofAnthony Albanese– but with such a high number of soft voters, can we count the Coalition out? Barrie Cassidy and Tony Barrydiscuss the big issues of the last week. Listen here: Woman dies after falling at Mapleton Falls national park Queensland police will prepare a report for the coroner after a 36-year-old woman died after reportedly falling 80 metres at Mapleton Falls national park on the Sunshine Coast yesterday. AQueensland policespokesperson said: Emergency services were called to Mapleton Falls around 3.30pm following reports a woman had fallen. She was located deceased around 4.30pm. The spokesperson said the death was not being treated as suspicious. Virginia Giuffre, a survivor of the disgraced US financierJeffrey Epstein, has died by suicide at her farm in Western Australia, a statement from her family, attorneySigrid McCawleyand PRDini von Muefflingsays.

Other international helplines can be found atbefrienders.org At the press conference earlier withPeter Dutton,the LNP candidate in Leichhardt,Jeremy Neal, was asked whether he still supportedDonald Trumpafter social media posts surfaced during the campaign. Neal said “those views are [from] a very long time ago, and they were deleted a very long time ago”. He added the US president’s decision to place tariffs on Australian exports had left a “sour taste” in his mouth. ‘We can win this election,’ Dutton tells LNP supporters in Cairns Earlier this morning,Peter Duttonstopped by the Barr Street Markets in Cairns for breakfast with his supporters in the seat of Leichhardt. The opposition leader was joined by the LNP candidate,Jeremy Neal, as they worked their way through the early morning crowd of poll booth volunteers. Dutton thanked supporters and joked the breakfast was put on to feed them up quickly and get them to pre-poll stations as quickly as possible. He said: We’ve got all seven days ahead of us, but there’s no doubt in my mind, we can win this election, and we must for our great country. After his press conference, Dutton and the media pack following his campaign travelled to Mount Sheridan, south of Cairns, to visit a new housing estate. There he announced $33.8m in funding for the estate as part of the Coalition’s broader $5bn package to build the required infrastructure for houses, such as connecting sewerage and water. Dutton said many places around the country faced “growing pains” in regards to new housing and the funding “provides support to those blocks of land being developed more quickly and coming on to market more quickly”. The prime minister,Anthony Albanese, says mainstream politics needs to speak out against a rise in far-right figures. I condemnedwhat happened yesterdaywith someone associated with neo-Nazis. I have had some of those figures confront me, as you may be aware, here in Melbourne. I think it’s good that across the board, the political spectrum condemned what occurred yesterday. It was condemned byMrDuttonas well. That’s a good thing. Mainstream politics needs to speak out against far-right figures and the rise … We know from the Asio director general,MrBurgess, he has publicly spoken about the threat … We know the consequences of this. We need to take this seriously. These threats. Because they are real. The prime minister says it is “fantastic” that media organisations “have come together to speak out against hate”. “I just think we as a society have got to come together.” He also points to algorithms that encourage “people to go to more extreme views”. Dutton avoids questions about Leichhardt candidate’s online history Looking back toPeter Dutton’s press conference from the must-win seat of Leichhardt in Cairns earlier this morning, where the opposition leader vouched for his candidateJeremy Neal. Dutton said: People know if they vote for Jeremy Neal, they’ll get more local doctors. They’re also going to get $6m more for local Headspace – and Headspace is something we’ve invested in for a long period of time … it provides that primary care response for young people presenting with mental health conditions, and it has made a big difference in the lives of hundreds of thousands of Australians. On Wednesday, Neal’s online history, including controversial posts about China, Covid-19 restrictions and “feminists” who helped “kick out” Donald Trump in 2020,resurfaced. Dutton avoided answering questions about Neal’s online history. Neal is in a fight to retain the seat as Labor attempts to capitalise on the retirement of the veteran Liberal MPWarren Entsch.",

    "article_text": "This live blog is now closed, you can read more on this story here: My colleague,Angela Giuffrida, is reporting fromVatican City and has this report: Pope Francishas been eulogised as “a pope among the people, with an open heart towards everyone” during a funeral mass that brought together an array of mourners, from pilgrims and refugees to powerful world leaders and royals. Francis, 88, died on Mondayafter a stroke and subsequent heart failure, setting into motion a series of centuries-old rituals and a huge, meticulously planned logistical and security operation not seen inItalysince the funeral ofJohn Paul IIin April 2005. The crowd erupted into applause as the late pontiff’s wooden coffin was carried from the altar of the 16th-centurySt Peter’s Basilica, where it had laid in state for three days, by 14 white-gloved pallbearers and into the square for the open-air ceremony. Applause also rang out when the Italian CardinalGiovanni Battista Re, who presided over the funeral mass, spoke of Francis’s care for immigrants, his constant pleas for peace, the need for negotiations to end wars and the importance of the climate. Under a blue sky, more than 250,000 pilgrims descended ontheVatican, with the crowds stretching alongVia della Conciliazione, the road connecting the Italian capital with the Vatican. More than 2,000 journalists from around the world travelled toRometo cover the event. The 90-minute mass was celebrated by 220 cardinals, 750 bishops and more than 4,000 priests. “The outpouring of affection that we have witnessed in recent days following his passing from this Earth into eternity tells us how much the profound pontificate of Pope Francis touched minds and hearts,” Battista Re said at the start of his eulogy. This blog will be closing shortly. Thank you for following along and reading the updates. Here is a summary of the day’s events: Pope Francis has been eulogised as “a pope among the people, with an open heart towards everyone” during a funeral mass that brought together an array of mourners, from pilgrims and refugees to powerful world leaders and royals.The crowd erupted into applause as the late pontiff’s wooden coffin was carried from the altar of the 16th-century St Peter’s Basilica, where it had laid in state for three days, by 14 white-gloved pallbearers and into the square for the open-air ceremony. Applause also rang out when the Italian cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, who presided over the funeral mass, spoke of Francis’s care for immigrants,his constant pleas for peace, the need for negotiations to end wars and the importance of the climate. At least 400,000 people turned out for Pope Francis’s funeral at the Vatican and lined Rome’s streets, Italy’s interior minister said on Saturday afternoon. Pope Francis, who famously refused to judge gay or divorced Catholics, believed the Church “is a home for all”, Battista Re said in his funeral homily.Francis was driven by “the conviction that the Church is a home for all, a home with its doors always open … a Church capable of bending down to every person, regardless of their beliefs or condition, and healing their wounds,” he said. Leaders from more than 150 countries attended the funeral mass, including the US president, Donald Trump, who had repeatedly clashed with Pope Francis over immigration, and his wife, Melania.UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, French president, Emmanuel Macron, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, former US president Joe Biden, Argentinian president Javier Milei, the European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni and Prince William were also among the guests. Cardinals performed the rite of burial for Pope Francis at his simple tomb inside Rome’s Santa Maria Maggiore Basilica.The burial ceremony on Saturday was private, attended by top cardinals and people close to the pope. Video provided by theVaticanshowed Cardinal Kevin Farrell, who is running the Vatican in between papacies, blessing Francis’ coffin before it was interred.Francis’ tomb has been constructed using stone from Liguria, the Italian region where his grandparents once lived.The simple tomb bears just the inscription “Franciscus” and a replica of his pectoral cross. Volodymyr Zelenskyyappeared to receive a round of applause as he attended the funeral of Pope Francis.The crowd of assembled world leaders could be heard clapping as the Ukrainian president left St Peter’s Basilica, where he had paid his respects in front of the pontiff’s coffin ahead of the funeral ceremony. Trump and Zelenskyy used their time at the Vatican while attending the funeral of Pope Francis to discuss a possible ceasefire with Russia, with the Ukrainian president releasing a photograph of a seemingly intense conversation in St Peter’s Basilica. The White House described the meeting as “very productive”, while Zelenskyy said on X that the talk with the US president was very symbolic and had the “potential to become historic, if we achieve joint results”. Trump, Zelenskyy, Macron and Starmer had a “positive meeting” on the sidelines of Pope Francis’s funeral, the French presidency said on Saturday. Starmer and Zelenskyy agreed to work intensively to maintain the positive momentum in peace talks to end the war with Russia, Starmer’s office said on Saturday.“They discussed positive progress made in recent days to secure a just and lasting peace in Ukraine,” a Downing Street spokesperson said in a statement after Starmer and Zelenskyy met in Rome, where world leaders gathered on Saturday for Pope Francis’s funeral at theVatican. Ukrainian foreign minister Andrii Sybiha said Zelenskyy also had a separate meeting with French president Emmanuel Macron. The 90-minute funeral mass for the late pope was celebrated by 220 cardinals, 750 bishops and more than 4,000 priests.More than 2,000 journalists from around the world travelled to Rome to cover the event. The public can begin visiting Pope Francis’s tomb at the Roman basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore “as early as Sunday morning”, Vatican spokesperson Matteo Bruni announced on Friday. You can also catch up on the day’s events with our main story and a picture gallery linked below: With songs, candles, flags and prayers,Buenos Airesmourners marked the burial of pontiff and native sonPope Francison Saturday. As the 88-year-old was being laid to rest an ocean away inRome, thousands gathered byBuenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedralfor dawn vigils and a mass of remembrance, reports Agence France-Presse. They were urged to take up the activist mantle ofLatin America’s first pope and to carry on his life’s work. “Let us be the outgoing church that Francis always wanted us to be, a restless church that mobilises,” Buenos Aires’ archbishopJorge García Cuervatold a funeral mass. Braving rain and the an autumn chill, dozens of people set up tents in the city’s famedPlaza de Mayofor an overnight vigil until 5am local time (8am GMT), when Pope Francis’s funeral began inSt Peter’s Squareatthe Vatican. Images of the pope and the Virgin of Lujan were illuminated with candles, bread was broken and flags were flown, reports AFP. Iara Amado, a 25-year-old social worker, said she wanted the vigil “to reclaim the pope’s legacy, to transform the sadness left by his departure into a beacon of hope.” Mourners hung banners with some of the most emblematic phrases of Francis’s papacy: “Make a ruckus” and “dream big.” An image of the pope with the inscription “pray for me” was projected on to a nearby obelisk. Lucas Pedro, a 40-year-old teacher, told AFP that those gathered did so “with a deep sense of gratitude”. Italy’sGiorgia MeloniexpectsRussiato show concrete signs of its willingness to pursue peace inUkraine, the prime minister said in a statement after meeting Ukraine’sVolodymyr ZelenskyyinRome. Meloni, who met Zelenskyy afterPopeFrancis’s funeral, stressed “the urgency of an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, as well as the need for a concrete commitment by Moscow to launch a peace process”. As the recent filmConclaveshowed, predicting the next pope is not a straightforward matter. Francis– the first Jesuit pope – was a surprise choice; a facttheArgentinianimmediately acknowledgedwhen he joked that his fellow cardinals had had to “go to the end of the earth” to find a new bishop ofRome. But among thenames frequently mentioned as possible successorsareMatteo Zuppi, a progressiveItaliancardinal;Pietro Parolin, who serves as the Vatican’s secretary of state; andLuis Antonio Tagle, fromthe Philippines. The next pope will be chosen by theCollege of Cardinals, the Catholic church’s most senior figures appointed by the pontiff, who will make their way toRomein the next few days for theconclave. The name comes from the Latincum clave, meaning “with key”, indicating the closed process of electing a pope. There are more than 250 cardinals from more than 90 countries, but only about 135 are cardinal electors (those over the age of 80 are excluded). About 110 of the cardinal electors have been chosen byFrancisin the past 10 years and largely reflect his vision of a more inclusive church. Once the cardinals are assembled in Rome, usually 15-20 days after the pope’s death, they gather under Michelangelo’s magnificent painted ceiling in theSistine Chapelto begin their deliberations. After the wordsextra omnes– everyone out – are declared, referring to all but voting cardinals and a handful of officials and doctors, the doors are locked. The cardinals swear an oath of absolute secrecy, and are permitted no contact with the outside world for the duration of the election process. Their phones are removed, and no newspapers, television, letters or messages are allowed. The chapel is also swept for listening devices before and during the conclave. The cardinals sleep and eat in a purpose-built hostel,St Martha’s house, near the Sistine Chapel, wherePope Francishad lived for the past 12 years. The conclave begins with a celebration of mass, after which deliberations and voting begins. Votes are taken each day, morning and afternoon, until a candidate wins a two-thirds majority. There is a day’s break for prayer and reflection after every seven ballots. The longest papal conclave in recent history was 1922, when the cardinals took five days to choose their new leader. Any baptised male can be elected as pope, although a serving cardinal is invariably chosen. Each elector is given a ballot card with the wordseligo in summum pontificem(I elect as supreme pontiff) printed at the top. They insert the name of their choice, fold the card and drop it into a chalice. The ballot is secret, but that does not mean the process is immune from factionalising, intrigue and lobbying. After each round of voting, the ballot cards are burned. Chemicals are added to make the smoke black or white. Black smoke emerging from the 60ft chimney indicates an inconclusive ballot; white smoke announces to the world that a new pope has been elected. The successful candidate is asked if he accepts election and, if so, which name he chooses to take as pontiff. The cardinals pledge obedience to the new pope, who is led into the adjacentRoom of Tearsto be dressed in a white cassock and skull cap, and red slippers. Three sets of vestments in different sizes will have been made byVaticantailors in advance. The dean of the cardinals steps on to the main balcony ofSt Peter’s Basilica, in front of which thousands of Catholic devotees and tourists will be gathered. The dean will declare: “Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum: Habemus papam” – “I announce to you a great joy: We have a pope.” Guardian readers have reflected on the life ofPope Francis, the late Roman Catholic pontiff, who spoke up for marginalised and vulnerable people. You can read the letters here: Donald TrumpandVolodymyr Zelenskyyused their time atthe Vaticanwhile attending the funeral ofPope Francisto discuss a possible ceasefire withRussia, with theUkrainianpresident releasing a photograph of a seemingly intense conversation inSt Peter’s Basilica. TheWhite Housedescribed the meeting as “very productive”, while Zelenskyy said on X that the talk with theUSpresident was very symbolic and had the “potential to become historic, if we achieve joint results”. It was the first time that Zelenskyy and Trump had met face to face after a frosty February encounter in the White House where Trump and the US vice-president,JD Vance, berated the Ukrainian leader and accused him of ingratitude for US aid. In an effort to end fighting betweenUkraineand Russia,Washingtonis engaging in intense mediation betweenthe two countries, at war since Russia’s 2022 invasion. On Friday, Trump’s envoySteve Witkoffmet the Russian president,Vladimir Putin, inMoscowfor three hours to discuss Washington’s peace proposal. Trump said that “most of the major points are agreed to”, in a post on his Truth Social platform, without further elaboration. He called for a meeting betweenKyivand Moscow’s leadership to sign a ceasefire deal, which he said was “very close”. Despite Trump’s eagerness for a deal, significant differences remain between the US vision for peace and what Ukraine and itsEuropeanallies have deemed acceptable conditions for a ceasefire. Footage shared by theHoly Seeshowed cardinals markingPope Francis’s wooden and zinc coffin with red wax seals, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). Cardinal Kevin Farrell, who as camerlengo is runningthe Vatican’s day-to-day affairs until a new pope is elected, sprinkled it with holy water after it was lowered into a tomb set inside an alcove. A reproduction of the pectoral cross worn by Francis during his lifetime hung above it. Francis had asked that the tomb, located near the altar ofSaint Francis, be simple and unadorned, reflecting the humble spirit of his papacy. The tombstone bears only the inscription “Franciscus” – the pope’s name inLatin. Its marble is sourced fromLiguria, the north-westernItalianregion once home to theArgentinepontiff’s Italian ancestors. Francis, bornJorge Bergoglio, had specified in his will the exact spot he wanted to be buried, in the side nave of the beloved fifth-century church. The pontiff was devoted to the worship of the Virgin Mary and made a point of praying inSanta Maria Maggiorebefore leaving on trips abroad and upon his return toRome. He declared his desire to be entombed there in 2023. Located in the heart of Rome, the basilica already holds the tombs of seven popes, reports AFP, but the last one to be buried there wasClement IXin 1669. More recently popes have usually been buried inSt Peter’s Basilica. One of four papal basilicas in Rome, Santa Maria Maggiore also holds the remains of several other renowned figures, such as the architect and sculptorGian LorenzoBernini, who designedSt Peter’s Squareand its surrounding columns. Built in about AD432 underPope Sixtus III, the basilica holds some of the Catholic church’s most important relics, including an icon of the Virgin Mary holding the baby Jesus, attributed toSaint Luke, reports AFP. Cardinals have performed the rite of burial forPope Francisat his simple tomb insideRome’sSanta Maria Maggiore Basilica.The burial ceremony on Saturday was private, attended by top cardinals and people close to the pope. Video provided bythe VaticanshowedCardinal Kevin Farrell, who is running the Vatican in between papacies, blessing Francis’ coffin before it was interred. The pope chose the basilica because of his devotion to the Salus Populi Romani icon of the Virgin Mary, which is located next to his tomb. UKprime ministerKeir StarmerandUkrainianpresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyyagreed to work intensively to maintain the positive momentum in peace talks to end the war withRussia, Starmer’s office said on Saturday. “They discussed positive progress made in recent days to secure a just and lasting peace in Ukraine,” aDowning Streetspokesperson said in a statement after Starmer and Zelenskyy met inRome, where world leaders gathered on Saturday forPopeFrancis’s funeral attheVatican. The spokesperson added: They agreed to maintain momentum and continue working intensively with international partners to drive forward the next stages of planning.

TheArgentinianpontiff, who died on Monday aged 88, was laid to rest during a 30-minute burial ceremony which started at 1pm, local time (11am GMT) at theSanta Maria Maggiore Basilicain theItaliancapital. After the procession fomVatican Cityto theSanta Maria Maggiore BasilicainRome,Pope Francis’s coffin was welcomed by “‘the last ones,’ a group of poor and marginalised people who always had a special place in Pope Francis’s heart”, writes the Vatican News. The group gave a final tribute before the coffin was carried to the altar. While the burial will take place privately,VaticanNews did provide some details in its reporting. It stated thatCardinal Kevin Farrell, the camerlengo runningthe Vatican’s day-to-day affairs until a new pope is elected, will mark Pope Francis’s coffin with his seal, along with those of the Prefecture of the Papal Household, the Office of Liturgical Celebrations of the Supreme Pontiff, and the Liberian Chapter. Vatican News add: The remains of the Successor of Peter [Pope Francis] will be laid in the tomb and sprinkled with holy water. After theRegina Cæliprayer, the notary of the Liberian Chapter will draw up the official act confirming the burial and will read it aloud to those present. The act will be signed by the samerlengo cardinal, the regent of the papal household, the master of papal liturgical celebrations, and finally the notary. UkrainianpresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyyhad separate meetings withFrenchpresidentEmmanuel Macronand UK prime ministerKeir StarmerinRomeafter they attended the funeral ofPope Francis, Ukrainian foreign ministerAndrii Sybihasaid in a post on X. At least 400,000 people turned out forPope Francis’s funeral atthe Vaticanand linedRome’s streets,Italy’s interior minister has said. This is up from the 250,000 estimated earlier by the Vatican. “We estimate not fewer than 400,000 people between those present in St Peter’s Square and those along the route,”Matteo Piantedositold the TG5 news programme, according to Agence France-Presse (AFP). My colleague,Angela Giuffrida, is reporting fromVatican City and has this report: Pope Francishas been eulogised as “a pope among the people, with an open heart towards everyone” during a funeral mass that brought together an array of mourners, from pilgrims and refugees to powerful world leaders and royals. Francis, 88, died on Mondayafter a stroke and subsequent heart failure, setting into motion a series of centuries-old rituals and a huge, meticulously planned logistical and security operation not seen inItalysince the funeral ofJohn Paul IIin April 2005. The crowd erupted into applause as the late pontiff’s wooden coffin was carried from the altar of the 16th-centurySt Peter’s Basilica, where it had laid in state for three days, by 14 white-gloved pallbearers and into the square for the open-air ceremony. Applause also rang out when the Italian CardinalGiovanni Battista Re, who presided over the funeral mass, spoke of Francis’s care for immigrants, his constant pleas for peace, the need for negotiations to end wars and the importance of the climate. Under a blue sky, more than 250,000 pilgrims descended ontheVatican, with the crowds stretching alongVia della Conciliazione, the road connecting the Italian capital with the Vatican. More than 2,000 journalists from around the world travelled toRometo cover the event. The 90-minute mass was celebrated by 220 cardinals, 750 bishops and more than 4,000 priests. “The outpouring of affection that we have witnessed in recent days following his passing from this Earth into eternity tells us how much the profound pontificate of Pope Francis touched minds and hearts,” Battista Re said at the start of his eulogy. Pope Francis’ tomb in Rome’s Basilica of St Mary Major has been constructed using stone from Liguria, the Italian region where his grandparents once lived. The simple tomb bears just the inscription “Franciscus” and a replica of his pectoral cross. Located near the Altar of St Francis, between the Pauline Chapel and the Sforza Chapel, the tomb reflects the pope’s wish to rest in a place connected to his family heritage. Cardinal Rolandas Makrickas, co-Archpriest of the Basilica, shared the details in a recent television interview. Vatican Newsreported: It is precisely in the small town of Cogorno that a plaque of slate – a fine-grained grey, green or bluish metamorphic rock – commemorates Bergoglio’s great-grandfather, Vincenzo Sivori. He travelled from Italy to Argentina in the 1800s. There, he raised his family, including his granddaughter Regina Maria Sivori: Pope Francis’ mother. Pope Francis often kept his connection to Liguria private, so the mayor of the town, Enrica Sommariva, described her surprise when she heard that the pope had requested stone from his grandparents’ region for his tomb. Angela Sivori, who still lives in Cogorno, recounted the moment in which she found out she was Pope Francis’ cousin. She described receiving a phone call from Buenos Aires, and a genealogy tree via email. She and her daughter, Cristina, said the pope’s request regarding the stone for the tomb was a wonderful gift to the family, “one last surprise”, Cristina said. As a priest, and then cardinal, Jorge Mario Bergoglio would always call into Santa Maria Maggiore (Saint Mary Major), one of the four papal basilicas in Rome, during his regular visits to the Italian capital. The fourth-century basilica with its distinctive bell tower is perched on one of Rome’s seven ancient hills in Esquilino, a neighbourhood that lies between the Colosseum and Termini train station, which during the Roman empire served as a burial ground for slaves. On one visit, Bergoglio had a close shave with a suspected pickpocket. But that did not sully his experience. Years later, in March 2013, on the morning after he becamePope Francis, a name chosen in honour of Francis of Assisi, the Italian saint who renounced a life of luxury to help the poor, he snuck out of the Vatican to go to pray at Santa Maria Maggiore. Francis frequented the basilica, which is about two-and-a-half miles away from Vatican City, more than 100 times during his 12-year papacy, mostly to pray before and after trips overseas. On 23 March,the day he was discharged from hospitalafter a near-fatal bout of pneumonia, he stopped by to deliver flowers on his way back to the Vatican. His most recent visit was on 12 April.",

    "title": "Trump says he fears Putin ‘may be tapping me along’ after Zelenskyy meeting",
    "article_text": "Donald Trump andVolodymyr Zelenskyyhave sat down for a face-to-face talk in the opulent halls of a Vatican basilica to discuss a possible ceasefire, after which the US president accused his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, of not wanting to “stop the war”. The White House described Trump’s meeting with the Ukrainian leader before Pope Francis’s funeral as “very productive”, while Zelenskyy said on X that the talk with the US president was symbolic and had the “potential to become historic, if we achieve joint results”. It was the first time that Zelenskyy and Trump had met face to face after a frosty February encounter in the White House where Trump and the US vice-president, JD Vance, berated the Ukrainian leader and accused him of ingratitude for US aid. Trump later published a social media post criticising Putin. “There was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days,” he posted on Truth Social. “It makes me think that maybe he doesn’t want to stop the war, he’s just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through ’Banking’ or ’Secondary Sanctions?’ Too many people are dying!!!” the US president wrote. In an effort to to end fighting betweenUkraineand Russia, Washington is engaging in intense mediation between the two countries, at war since Russia’s 2022 invasion. On Friday, Trump’s envoySteve Witkoff met Putin, in Moscow for three hours to discuss Washington’s peace proposal. Trump said that “most of the major points are agreed to”, in a post on his Truth Social platform, without further elaboration. He called for a meeting between Kyiv and Moscow’s leadership to sign a ceasefire deal, which he said was “very close”. Despite Trump’s eagerness for a deal, significant differences remain between the US vision for peace and what Ukraine and its European allies have deemed acceptable conditions for a ceasefire. Two sets of peace plans published by Reuters on Friday showed that the US is proposing Moscow retain the territory it has captured, including the strategic Crimean peninsula, whichRussiaannexed in 2014. This is seemingly a non-starter for Ukraine and European countries, with Zelenskyy insisting the territory is the “property of the Ukrainian people”. “Our position is unchanged,” the Ukrainian president told reporters in Kyiv. “The constitution of Ukraine says that all the temporarily occupied territories … belong to Ukraine.” It is also unclear if Moscow will agree to the US peace deal, which is seen as offering considerable concessions to Russia. On Saturday, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said all Ukrainian troops had been forced from Russia’s Kursk region, a key aim for Moscow. Ukrainian officials disputed the claim. The technical details of a ceasefire deal still need to be hammered out, including how western sanctions imposed on Russia would be lifted and what sort of security guarantees would be offered to Ukraine. Trump acknowledged on Friday that the talks were “very fragile”, and he has warned that the US would halt its mediation efforts if the two sides did not come to an agreement soon. Fighting continues in tandem with mediation efforts, and the Kremlin blames Ukraine for a car bomb that killed a senior Russian general near Moscow on Friday. Kyiv did not comment on the incident, the latest in a string of killings of Russian military officials over the past three years. The day before, Russiacarried out its deadliest attack in months on Ukraine, launching 70 missiles and 145 drones, mostly towards Kyiv. The attack caused Trump to lash out at Putin on social media. “I am not happy with the Russian strikes on KYIV. Not necessary, and very bad timing. Vladimir, STOP! 5000 soldiers a week are dying. Let’s get the Peace Deal DONE!” Trump posted on Truth Social on Thursday.",

    "title": "‘I haven’t slept for two days’: Kharkiv residents reel from Russian attacks",
    "article_text": "About 1am on Friday, Yuliia Verbytska woke to the sound of an air raid siren. She grabbed her teenage children – Dmitry, 17, and Olexiy, 12 – and sat in the corridor, checking her phone. In the sky above came an ominous whine. Minutes later, a Russian drone crashed into the disused soap factory down the road in Polyova Street. There was an enormous explosion. “We don’t have a shelter in our building, so we hide behind two concrete walls. All the neighbours sit together. You wonder if this is your last moment,” she said. Friday’s raid followed a massive attack on Thursday on Verbytska’s home, Ukraine’s second city, Kharkiv, and on the capital, Kyiv, where 12 people were killed. “I haven’t slept for two days,” she said wearily. Exhausted residents sweeping up glass and fixing broken panels pointed out that the latest attack camehours after a post from Donald Trump on social media. It said: “Vladimir, STOP.”Russia’s president, it seemed, had decided to ignore Trump’s rare rebuke. Despite peace negotiations and an appeal byUkraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskyyfor a month-long ceasefire, the Russians were bombing as usual. One of the damaged buildings belongs to a charity,Heart of Kharkiv, where Verbytska works as a volunteer. Bits of concrete fell amid clothes and donated shoes. Children’s drawings were blown from a noticeboard. The charity’s wheelchairs and pushchairs survived unscathed. “I don’t believe in promises or words. Not from Trump or anybody else. I don’t really have much faith in anything any more,” Verbytska said gloomily. By late morning, emergency service workers were still extinguishing small blazes in the now-ruined factory. Built in 1918, it once made soap for the Soviet Union. It went bankrupt last year. The Kremlin’s drones narrowly missed an old acacia tree by its entrance gate. They flattened a brick administration building. Firefighters doused charred beams and splashed among puddles and piles of twisted metal. “They are fascists. Inhuman people. Barbarians. Cruel,” the complex’s security guard, Anton, said, when asked what he thought about Russians. “They want to destroy Ukraine and Ukrainians. That’s their plan.” He was sceptical that the peace process – Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff held talks on Friday with Putin in Moscow – would lead to a settlement that might end the fighting. The security guard said Zelenskyy would be unwise to accept the US’s latestleaked proposal. It envisages handing Crimea and four other Ukrainian regions to Russia. Ukraine gets back a sliver of territory in the Kharkiv region. “Today it’s fiveoblasts. Tomorrow, the Russians will demand another five. Zelenskyy should not sign,” he said. He dismissed Trump as a “Russian agent recruited long ago”, and said: “I’m disappointed that the Americans elected him.” Russia says its devastating attacks are against Ukrainian military objects. Its latest murderous barrage followsa double strike this month on the north-eastern city of Sumy, in which 35 people were killed. Most were travelling on a bus when an Iskander missile exploded next to them. Overwhelmingly, the victims of Russia’s air raids are civilians. They include two children killed on Thursday and dug from the rubble of their Kyiv apartment block. Liudmyla Hanzii, a pensioner, was at her home in Kharkiv’s Slobidsky district when the soap factory was hit. Her son, Andriy, showed off the bed where she had been sleeping. It was decorated with icons and a black-and-white photograph of Liudmyla as a young woman. “Mum heard a bang. All the glass came flying in. A teenage boy living next door dragged her out,” he said, adding she was being treated in hospital for minor injuries. According to Anatoliy Yaskovets, the deputy head of Kharkiv fire station No 6, Russia has stepped up its air attacks. The frequency increased in January, he said, when Trump came back as US president. Apart from a brief pause last weekend, when Putin announced an Easter ceasefire, bombing was continuous. “It’s terror against the civilian population. There’s no time to react. It takes 50 seconds for a missile fired from Belgorod in Russia to arrive,” he said. The Russians had recently changed tactics, he added. They now send a swarm of drones, one after another, at the same target. Three of his colleagues were killed last year when they went to the scene of a drone strike. Twenty minutes later, a second drone incinerated their vehicle. Moscow was using drones to drop CS gas and delayed-action grenades, which detonate up to an hour after impact. They go off if touched, he explained. Asked if he thought the war might end soon, Yaskovets answered: “Probably not.” He continued: “People are tired. There are air raid sirens all the time. It’s a psychological burden. Russia has been destroying our power stations and industrial infrastructure. The aim is to make people unhappy so they turn on Ukraine’s government.” His mobile phone rang with a popular song, Moscow Burns. “It’s my mother. She worries about me,” he said. In February 2022, Russian armoured columns tried to seize Kharkiv. There was fierce fighting. Ukrainian units pushed the enemy back to the city’s edge. For the next six months, Kharkiv was repeatedly shelled. That autumn, a Ukrainian counteroffensive liberated most of the surrounding province. In recent months, though, the Russians have been advancing again,reoccupying the border town of Vovchansklast year, andswallowing villages. How far could they go? Yaskovets said it was clear the Russians would try again to encircle and occupy Kharkiv. “Putin doesn’t intend to stop. He wants to take the south of Ukraine and go as far as the Dnipro River. He doesn’t have a big enough army to do that,” he suggested. In the meantime, there would be more drone attacks, and more casualties. “We’ve had four years of full-scale war. Somehow, people have got used to it,” he noted. A group of soldiers from the Kraken regiment – breaking off for coffee at a Kharkiv petrol station – said Putin’s behaviour this week was not surprising. “By bombing us, he shows his true nature,” one of them, Saifula, said. He added: “My feeling is that Trump is not really a president at all. He’s a parody or a clone of a president. The whole world is laughing at him. Our only option now is to have a strong army and to carrying on fighting.”",

    "title": "Giorgia Meloni faces awkward weekend at funeral of pope whose values she opposed",
    "article_text": "It is an awkward weekend forGiorgia Meloni. The Italian leader will host a gathering of world leaders to say goodbye to a much-revered pope whose public views – from the treatment of people fleeing war to the climate crisis – were diametrically opposed to hers. WhilePope Franciswas a staunch advocate for asylum seekers, and blessed the vessels that saved refugees at sea, Meloni once said Italy should “repatriate migrants back to their countries and then sink the boats that rescued them”. Close allies of Meloni are attending, including the US president, Donald Trump, who Francissharply criticised for his anti-immigration stance, saying: “Anyone who only wants to build walls and not bridges is not a Christian.” Also flying in is Argentina’s president, Javier Milei, who at various times called the pontiffan imbecile and a representative of the “evil one”. In ajoint session of parliament on Wednesday, Meloni cited how the pope “gave back a voice to those who did not have one”. The words of Italy’s prime minister were sharply criticised by opposition parties in parliament. The leader of the centre-left opposition Democratic party,Elly Schlein, said: “Francis does not deserve the hypocrisy of those who deport migrants, take money from the poor, deny the climate emergency and deny care to those who cannot afford it.” The former Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi of Italia Viva was equally scathing. “It is very funny that each of us seeks to grab a little piece of his legacy,” he said.Addressing the government’s members, he added: “Your detention camps for migrants were a disgrace to Pope Francis.” On big issues, Meloni and the pope could not have been further apart. The climate emergency was for Francis a moral and spiritual crisis demanding a radical and systemic response, whereas for Meloni the ecological transition is subordinate to economic competitiveness and national interest. In economics, the pope denounced the “culture of waste”, criticising a system that values people according to their productivity and calling for an economy in the service of human dignity. Meloni, meanwhile, has abolishedsubsidies for the poorand cut healthcare. “There was a huge gap between the two,” said Francesco Galietti, the founder of Policy Sonar, a political consultancy in Rome. “Meloni bet on Atlanticism, on a close rapport with Trump, while Bergoglio [Pope Francis] was by no means pro-American nor a friend of Trump. There was also a divergence in geopolitical vision: Francis pursued a policy of rapprochement with China, whereas under MeloniItaly withdrew from Beijing’s ambitious belt and road initiative.” But on a personal level, they appeared to be friendly, even friends. “Despite this,” Galietti added, “the friendship between Meloni and the pope was allegedly genuine. They spoke in Spanish and met often. This should come as no surprise: after all, the pope, who grew up under Argentina’s Videla dictatorship, was forced to coexist with generals in uniform far to the right of Meloni.” Melonihas long publicised her personal rapport with Francis, frequently citing details of their conversations in public speeches. Many political observers and media outlets described the prime minister’s strategy as an“operazione simpatia”, an attempt to win over her electorate by highlighting her friendship with one of the most beloved pontiffs. With the death of Francis, Meloni has lost someone politically, and possibly personally, important to her. “Francis accepted Meloni’s history, her self-portrayal as an underdog,” said Prof Alberto Melloni, a church historian at the University of Modena-Reggio Emilia and the Unesco chair on religious pluralism and peace. “Once Bergoglio told me he liked the PM because she was ‘a woman of the people’.” The professor said the crucial question for Meloni was whether the next leader of the Catholic church would also play a useful role. “If the pope does not sympathise with them, he won’t let them off so lightly.”",

    "title": "Palestinian president names Hussein al-Sheikh vice-president of PLO and his likely successor",
    "article_text": "Palestinian presidentMahmoud Abbason Saturday named a veteran aide and confidant as his new vice-president. It’s a major step by the ageing leader to designate a successor. The appointment of Hussein al-Sheikh as vice-president of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) does not guarantee he will be the next Palestinian president. But it makes him the frontrunner among longtime politicians in the dominant Fatah party who hope to succeed the 89-year-old Abbas. The move is unlikely to boost the image among many Palestinians of Fatah as a closed and corrupt movement out of touch with the general public. Abbas hopes to play a major role in postwar Gaza. He has been under pressure from western and Arab allies to rehabilitate the Palestinian Authority, which has limited autonomy in parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. He has announced a series of reforms in recent months, and last week his Fatah movement approved the new position of PLO vice-president. The PLO is the internationally recognised representative of the Palestinian people and oversees the western-backed Palestinian Authority. Abbas has led both entities for two decades. Under last week’s decision, the new vice-president, coming from the PLO’s 16-member executive committee, would succeed Abbas in a caretaker capacity if the president dies or becomes incapacitated. That would make him the frontrunner to replace Abbas on a permanent basis, though it is not a guarantee. The PLO’s executive committee would need to approve that appointment, and the body is filled with veteran politicians who see themselves as worthy contenders. The Palestinian Authority, meanwhile, would have a separate caretaker leader, Rawhi Fattouh, the speaker of the Palestinians’ non-functioning parliament. But within 90 days, it would have to hold elections. If that is not possible, the new PLO president would probably take over the position. Al-Sheikh, 64, is a veteran politician who has held a series of top positions over decades, most recently as the secretary general of the PLO’s executive committee for the past three years. He spent 11 years in Israeli prisons in his youth and is a veteran of the Palestinian security forces – experiences that could give him credibility with Palestinian security figures and the broader public. Now he finds himself in a strong position to shore up his power. He is Abbas’s closest aide and, most critically, maintains good working relations with Israel and the Palestinians’ Arab allies, including wealthy Gulf countries. As Abbas’s point man with Israel, al-Sheikh is responsible for arranging coveted travel permits for Palestinians, including VIP leaders, giving him an important lever of power over his rivals. However, polls show al-Sheikh, like most of Fatah’s leadership, to be deeply unpopular with the general public. This week’s decision behind closed doors by the PLO’s ageing leadership is likely to reinforce its image as being stodgy and out of touch. The most popular Palestinian, Marwan Barghouti, is serving multiple life sentences in an Israeli prison, and Israel has ruled out releasing him as part of any swap for Israeli hostages held in Gaza by theHamasmilitant group. As Israel’s war with Hamas drags on, with talk by the US president, Donald Trump, and the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, of uprooting Palestinians in Gaza to relocate them elsewhere, al-Sheikh will be under mounting pressure to unite the Palestinian leadership. The PLO is a rival to Hamas, which won the last national elections in 2006 and is not in the PLO. Hamas seized control of Gaza from Abbas’s forces in 2007, and reconciliation attempts have repeatedly failed. In a 2022 interview with the Associated Press, al-Sheikh defended his unpopular coordination with Israel, saying there was no choice under the difficult circumstances of the occupation. “I am not a representative for Israel in thePalestinian territories,” he said at the time. “We undertake the coordination because this is the prelude to a political solution for ending the occupation.”",

    "title": "Huge explosion in Iranian port kills at least eight and injures more than 500",
    "article_text": "An immense blast in Iran’s southern port of Shahid Rajaee has killed at least 14 people and injured more than 700, according to state media, with an official suggesting the fire was caused by the explosion of chemical containers. A spokesperson for Iran’s crisis management body pointed to poor storage conditions of chemicals as the trigger for the port explosion. “The cause of the explosions was the chemicals inside the containers,” Hossein Zafari, a crisis management spokesperson, told Iran’s ILNA news agency. He added that the port administration had previously been warned about the danger these chemicals posed. The Iranian government has not yet specified the exact cause of the explosion, though it suspected combustible chemicals to be behind the blast. The provincial attorney general had ordered a “thorough and urgent” investigation into the circumstances of the explosion, which local officials said began in several containers in the port. Shahid Rajaee is a large Iranian container facility that handles 80m tons of goods a year, including fuel and other combustible materials. It is part of the Bandar Abbas port, the country’s largest. State media had previously quoted Iranian security officials as saying “any speculation about the cause of the explosion is worthless”. Videos showed a huge billowing mushroom cloud and the force of the blast destroyed a nearby building and shattered windows. Injured people lay on the roadside as authorities declared a state of emergency at hospitals across Bandar Abbas to cope with the influx of wounded. Aerial and naval firefighting teams worked to extinguish the blast, and state media reported officials expected the firefighting operation to be completed within an hour. Local media reported people trapped under the wreckage of a collapsed building. In the aftermath of the explosion, port activities were suspended and Iranian customs officials halted export and transit shipments to the port. The state-owned National Iranian Oil Refining and Distribution Company said that oil refineries, tankers and pipelines in the area continued to operate and were unaffected by the blast. The explosion occurred as Iran and the US met for the third round ofnuclear talksin Oman on Saturday, aiming to achieve a deal on Iran’s nuclear programme.Trump envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araqchi spoke through Omani mediators for six hours on Saturday to create a framework for a new nuclear deal.Trump, in an interview with Time magazine on Friday, said that he thought a deal with Iran was possible. Oman’s foreign minister announced that another “high-level meeting” was scheduled for 3 May. The US and Israel view the prospect of Iran getting a nuclear weapon as an urgent threat. Iranian officials, in turn, are keen to lift a severe US sanctions regime on the beleaguered economy.“Iran remains steadfast in its principled stance on the need to end unjust sanctions and is ready to build confidence about the peaceful nature of its nuclear programme,” Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said in Oman. In 2020, the Shahid Rajaee container facility was hit with a complex cyber-attack that jammed port logistics, which the Washington Postreportedas being perpetrated by Israel in retaliation for an Iranian cyber-attack. The cyber-attack was one of a series of incidents that has affected Iranian critical infrastructure in recent years. The government has blamed some of the incidents, such as a 2024 coalmine blast in southern Iran which killed 31 people, on negligence. Tehran has accused Israel of being behind other incidents, such as an attack on Iranian gas pipelines last year. The Israeli government made no comment on Saturday’s explosions in Iran.

    "title": "India and Pakistan trade gunfire across Kashmir border after deadly attack",
    "article_text": "Indian and Pakistani troops have exchanged gunfire across the volatile frontier in Kashmir for a second day, amid growing tensions after a brazen attack that killed 26 people at a popular tourist resort. The massacre has sent relations between the nuclear-armed neighbours into a dangerous downward spin. India and Pakistan have fought three wars, two over Muslim-majorityKashmir, which is divided between them but claimed fully by both. India’s military said Pakistani soldiers opened fire from “multiple posts” along the heavily militarised ceasefire line, and Indian forces “responded appropriately” to what it called “unprovoked” firing. No casualties were reported. Pakistan did not immediately comment. The clashes followed the attack last Tuesday, whengunmen opened fire in a meadow near Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir. The attackers reportedly asked the victims, all male, whether they were Hindu or Muslim and shot the Hindus. Violence had been steadily abating in Kashmir, and the attack struck a heavy blow to the region’s recovering tourism industry. An obscure group calling itself the Kashmir Resistance claimed responsibility. India links the group to the outlawed Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, but Pakistan denies involvement. In an apparent attempt to ease tensions, Pakistan’s prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, offered to cooperate with a “neutral investigation”. The Indian prime minister,Narendra Modi, has vowed to “track and punish every terrorist and their backers” and pursue the killers “to the ends of the earth”. “Pakistan is open to participating in any neutral, transparent and credible investigation,” Sharif said, while warning Pakistan’s forces stood ready to repel “any misadventure” by India. In tit-for-tat moves, India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty, a critical water-sharing pact, expelled Pakistani diplomats and cancelled Pakistani visas. Islamabad retaliated by expelling Indian diplomats, cancelling Indians’ visas and closing its airspace. It also suspended the 1972 Shimla accord, a key framework for dialogue. India’s resources minister, C R Patil, said the country would move to ensure “not a single drop” of river water flowed into Pakistan after the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty. Pakistan has warned any attempt to block water would be an “act of war”, with the Pakistan People’s party chief, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, declaring: “Either our water will flow through it, or their blood.” Experts say disrupting the flow would require big investment and years of work. “India lacks the hydro infrastructure needed to actually impede the flow of water to Pakistan in the short term,” Brahma Chellaney, an analyst, said. “So the action is largely symbolic.”",

    "article_text": "Counter-terrorism police have been called in after two women were seriously injured inLeedsand a crossbow and a gun were seized by police, while a male suspect with a self-inflicted injury was arrested. WestYorkshirepolice were called at 2.47pm on Saturday after reports of a man with weapons. The two women injured were taken to hospital, while a 38-year-old man was arrested and taken to hospital. Their injuries were not regarded as life-threatening, police said. Counter Terrorism Policing North East said it had taken over the investigation “due to the circumstances surrounding the incident … Extensive enquiries continue to establish the full circumstances and explore any potential motivation.” The home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said: “I am being kept updated on the serious violent incident in Leeds this afternoon. Thank you to the police and emergency services for their swift response. My thoughts are with the victims and all those affected by this attack.” The head of CTP North East, DCI James Dunkerley, said: “From the enquiries undertaken so far, there is no evidence to suggest anyone else was involved in the attack, and, at this time, we are not looking for anyone else in relation to the incident.” Assistant chief constable Carl Galvin of West Yorkshire police, who commanded the police operation, said officers were in the area to “reassure residents and continue our enquiries”. “I also want to thank members of the public for the support they gave victims and the emergency services as we attended the scene,” he said. “We would strongly urge people not to speculate online or share information or footage which could affect the active investigation and continue to work closely with colleagues from Counter Terrorism Policing North East.” The incident happened on the Otley Run, a pub crawl that is popular with students, just days before the summer term starts for many university courses. Bethany Connelly, who works in the area, told Yorkshire Live: “I was at work at a nearby restaurant and some girls were sitting outside. “They asked if they could come in and finish what they were having because they’d seen someone with a crossbow. This was all before the incident, and a few minutes later, we saw ambulances and police rushing down the roads. “The roads were getting blocked off, and we’d been told by police to keep everyone indoors and away from the area.” Rachel Reeves, the chancellor and MP for Leeds West and Pudsey, said the incident was shocking, telling the BBC: “My thoughts are with all of those affected.” With PA Media",

    "title": "Letter by high-profile Titanic survivor sells for record £300,000",
    "article_text": "A letter written by a survivor of the Titanic disaster has sold for a record £300,000 at auction. First-class passenger Col Archibald Gracie wrote The Truth About the Titanic, which described his experience of the 15 April 1912 tragedy that claimed 1,500 lives on the vessel’s journey to New York. The letter card is dated 10 April 1912, the day he boarded, and is postmarked Queenstown 3.45pm on 11 April and London on 12 April. It said: “It is a fine ship but I shall await my journeys end before I pass judgment on her.” The item sold for five times the expected price of £60,000 at Henry Aldridge and Son of Devizes, Wiltshire on Saturday. It is the highest price ever achieved for a letter written on board the Titanic, the auctioneers said. Letters from “survivors of Gracie’s profile” rarely, if ever, come to market and the item has never before been offered for sale, the auctioneers added. The seller’s great-uncle, who was an acquaintance of Gracie, received the letter at the Waldorf hotel in London. It was written over four sides and added: “The Oceanic is like an old friend and while she does not possess the elaborate style and varied amusement of this big ship, still her sea worthy qualities and yacht like appearance make me miss her. “It was very kind of you to give me this kindly send off, with best wishes for your success and happiness, Archibald Gracie.” The colonel “spent much of the voyage chaperoning various unaccompanied women” including a woman and three sisters who survived, the listing said. On 14 April, he played squash and swam in the Titanic’s swimming pool before attending church and socialising. At about 11.40pm he was jolted awake and discovered the ship’s engines were not moving. He helped women and children on to lifeboats and fetched them blankets before the ship dipped below the water’s surface in the North Atlantic Ocean. Gracie managed to scramble on to an overturned collapsible boat along with a few dozen other men. There were swimmers around them but those aboard paddled away through fear the vessel could be overwhelmed. The colonel later wrote: “In no instance, I am happy to say, did I hear any word of rebuke from a swimmer because of a refusal to grant assistance.” One refusal “was met with the manly voice of a powerful man” that said “all right boys, good luck and God bless you”, he reported. He also said more than half the men who had originally reached the collapsible died from exhaustion or cold and slipped off the upturned keel during the night. Henry Aldridge and Son said The Truth About the Titanic is “one of the most detailed accounts of the events of the evening”. The auctioneers added: “It is impossible to overstate the rarity of this lot, it is written by one of the highest profile survivors, with excellent content and on the rarest of mediums, a letter card. “A truly exceptional museum-grade piece.”",

    "article_text": "David Tennant has criticised the “demonisation” of the trans community, saying that while he wishes JK Rowling “no ill will”, he hopes that “we can all as a society just let people be”. The Scottish actor, who appeared in the 2005 film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, likened the treatment of transgender people to the Thatcher government’s introduction of section 28 – a 1988 law that prohibited local authorities from “promoting” homosexuality. “When I was a teenager, there was this thing that Mrs Thatcher’s government introduced called section 28, which was about stopping the promotion of homosexuality in school, which was a weird umbrella term, which was basically saying it was illegal to talk about being gay in school, or to suggest that that might be a normal way of behaving,” said Tennant during an appearance on ITV1 show The Assembly. “We look back on that now as a medieval, absurd thing to try and say, and I think the way the trans community is being demonised and othered is exactly the same. It’s become this kind of political football.” Rowling had previously taken a swipe at Tennant for saying that Conservative party leader Kemi Badenoch, who has called for abar on transgender peoplein single-sex spaces, should “shut up”, during his appearance at the British LGBT Awards in June 2024. When Badenoch was elected leader of the Conservative party in November, Rowling posted to X that her “thoughts and prayers” were “with David Tennant at this very difficult time”. Asked about Rowling’s remarks on the ITV1 show, which sees celebrities face questions from a group of autistic, neurodivergent and learning-disabled people, Tennant said: “JK Rowling is a wonderful author who’s created brilliant stories, and I wish her no ill will, but I hope that we can all as a society, just let people be. Just get out of people’s way.” Harry Potter actors Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint have alsodistanced themselvesfrom Rowling’s gender-critical views, issuing statements in support of trans rights after the Scottish author’s2020 essayabout surviving sexual assault, in which she called arguments about “femaleness not residing in the sexed body … deeply misogynistic and regressive”. Rowling reportedly donated £70,000 to For Women Scotland, the campaign group whose long-running legal case against the Scottish government last week culminated in the UK supreme court ruling that the terms “woman” and “sex” in the Equality Act refer only to a biological woman and to biological sex. The Assembly will air on ITV1 at 10pm on Sunday.",

    "title": "Gordon Brown makes criminal complaint against Rupert Murdoch’s media empire",
    "article_text": "The former prime minister Gordon Brown has made a new complaint to British police over allegations that Rupert Murdoch’s newspaper empire obstructed justice, after stating he has spoken to officers involved in the original phone-hacking inquiry. Writing in the Guardian, Brown said one of the detectives had alleged they believed there was “significant evidence” that News Group Newspapers (NGN) deleted millions of emails to pervert the course of justice. In the article, Brown states that the former officers told him that if they had been aware of the background to the email deletions, they would have pushed for further action. Brown said one former officer told him: “If we had known this in 2011, we would have investigated fully and taken a different course of action including considering arrests.” “Today I am making a criminal complaint to the Met and CPS alleging that I am, along with many others, a victim of the obstruction of the course of justice by News Group,” he writes. “This is not an allegation made lightly.It is informedby recentlyavailable evidence, and by thestatements of senior officersinvolved in the original investigations into unlawful news gathering, who have now stated to me that they were misled.” NGN strenuously denies any allegations of evidence destruction. It said the Crown Prosecution Service concluded in 2015 that there was no evidence that company email deletions were carried out to pervert the course of justice. In January,NGN apologised to Prince Harryfor phone hacking by journalists at its Sunday tabloid, the News of the World, and the “serious intrusion by the Sun between 1996 and 2011 into his private life, including incidents of unlawful activities carried out by private investigators working for the Sun”. The apology was part of an out-of-court settlement to end litigation brought against NGN by the prince andTom Watson, a former Labour deputy leader. Brown said the settlement had “not closed an era of investigation and litigation into media corruption. It has opened it up”. Brown’s complaint to the Metropolitan police follows details ofclaims made by former detectivescontained in a document filed with the high court in London. Their statements were made in support of the long-running phone-hacking litigation pursued against NGN by Harry and Watson. The skeleton legal arguments of both sides,reported by the Guardian, were not made public at the time and the claims have not been tested at trial because of the settlement. No admissions were made about the allegation of illegal destruction of evidence, which NGN strongly denies. The company said it would have successfully fought the allegation if the case had gone to trial. In his piece for the Guardian, Brown accuses Will Lewis, now chief executive of the Washington Post but then a senior NGN executive, ofattempting to incriminate him and Watson. He claims a false allegation against them was used to justify the deletion of emails to officers involved in Operation Weeting, the Met investigation launched in January 2011 to examine phone-hacking allegations. His accusation relates to documents disclosed in high court civil actions last year, which included a minute taken by the Met police of a meeting detectives held with Lewis on 8 July 2011. In the meeting, Lewis said the company had been told of a plot involving Brown and Watson to obtain the emails of Rebekah Brooks, the then chief executive of News International, through a third party. Lewis was the company’s general manager at the time. Brown states that one of the investigating officers has now said to him that NGN “falsely implicatedGordon Brown. If I had known this I would have made arrests for obstruction of justice.” NGN apologised to Watson over the idea of a plot as part of the settlement of his case, stating the company now understood “this information was false”. However, the company has said they believed at the time that the threat was genuine and would have proved this at trial. NGN planned to cite a 2011 email from Brooks, not previously made public, expressing concern about the internal security of the company’s IT systems. NGN’s skeleton defence also noted that a range of security measures were subsequently taken. The company also refers to a letter sent in January 2011 by Watson to the then Met assistant commissioner, John Yates, disclosed ahead of trial. In it Watson claimed to have been approached by former company employees with “knowledge of the information technology arrangements of News International”, NGN claimed. Lewis has previously strongly denied wrongdoing. He did not comment when approached by the Guardian. In its skeleton defence, NGN strenuously rejected allegations of a cover-up. A spokesperson stated that there was a lack of contemporaneous evidence in support of the claimants’ case and that NGN had a strong a lineup of witnesses who could confirm its own position. They said thestatements of two former officers with concernswere a “selective and partial consideration of the contemporaneous documents”. According to NGN’s skeleton argument, the deletion of emails had “long been in the planning, for sound commercial, IT and practical reasons”, and that Harry and Watson’s claims in this area had drawn on “wholly unreasonable inferences from an incomplete account of the facts, many of which are taken entirely out of context”. An NGN spokesperson said that when Operation Weeting was initiated, the company handed incriminating material to police, while officers were immediately made aware of “the steps NGN had taken in relation to its historic email archive as well as the actions it had taken to preserve relevant evidence”. They said NGN worked alongside specialist IT police officers for months to reconstruct its electronic archives. “The allegations of email deletion had formed part of the prosecution case in the criminal trial in 2013/14,” they said. “The investigation into News International concluded in 2015, almost 10 years ago, with a lengthy statement by the CPS deciding that no further action was to be taken in the light of there being no evidence to support an allegation of wrongdoing.” Brown writes that the police should request a series of court documents submitted during years of litigation, including from former NGN employees and ex-police officers. He also calls for prosecutors to step in – and for parliamentary committees to reopen their inquiries into the deletion of emails. He also asks the attorney general, Richard Hermer, to intervene. A spokesperson for NGN said: “NGN once again strenuously denies that there was any plan to delete emails in order to conceal evidence from a police investigation.” They said Brown was an “unreliable complainant driven by vendetta and revenge for perceived wrongs by NGN”. They said NGN figures working with police on company emails “acted throughout with the utmost integrity and at all times followed the protocol agreed with the [Metropolitan police] in order to provide access to and restore data”. “Mr Brown’s concerns again provide an inaccurate summary of allegations dealt with in the civil proceedings, which have already been extensively investigated and litigated,” an NGN spokesperson said. “It is not uncommon for retired police officers to hold views about their failure to achieve a conviction or matters that have not gone their way in court … There are officers from the 2011 to 2015 investigations who, in possession of all the facts, would not agree.” A Met spokesperson said: “While we acknowledge that information emerging from civil proceedings is of interest to the public and the press who may be seeing it for the first time, in the vast majority of cases it is material that has already been considered as part of the numerous investigations and reviews that have previously been carried out. “We are aware that parties in this recent case indicated an intention to pass material to us but we are yet to receive any such correspondence. In the event that we do, we will consider it carefully and proportionally, recognising the need to explore genuine lines of inquiry but acknowledging the significant resources already committed to past investigations.”",

    "article_text": "Liam andNoel Gallagherhave performed together for the first time in 16 years in a working men’s club in north London, according to reports. The brothers were pictured arriving at the Mildmay club in Newington Green, northLondon, on Thursday where they are believed to have filmed a promotional video for this summer’s sold-out Oasis reunion tour. According to the Sun, they arrived at the venue separately, stayed for just over an hour, and made enough noise to provoke the ire of local people. Set to begin in Cardiff on 4 July, the much-anticipatedOasis‘25 tour will come 16 years after the band bitterly split after an infamous backstage fight at Rock en Seine festival in Paris, and 30 years after the release of their bestselling second album, (What’s the Story) Morning Glory?. In a joint statement after the tour’s announcement, the band said: “The guns have fallen silent. The stars have aligned. The great wait is over. Come see. It will not be televised.” The brothers are thought to be back in each other’s good graces, with Noel confirming to TalkSport earlier this week that rehearsals for the tour will begin in the next few weeks. When asked about Liam, he said: “He’s alright. He’s on tip-top form. I was with him yesterday, actually.” The UK leg of the tour will include seven shows at Wembley Stadium in London, as well as five in the Gallaghers’ home town of Manchester. They will then tour the US, Mexico, Japan, South Korea and Australia, before ending in South America in November. The tourmade headlinesearlier this week when data from Lloyds Banking Group revealed that fans have collectively lost more than £2m to scams since tickets went on sale in August 2024.

The band shrugged off any criticism of ticket pricing, saying in a statement last year: “Inevitably interest in this tour is so overwhelming that it’s impossible to schedule enough shows to fulfil public demand. “As for the well-reported complaints many buyers had over the operation of Ticketmaster’s dynamic ticketing: it needs to be made clear that Oasis leave decisions on ticketing and pricing entirely to their promoters and management, and at no time had any awareness that dynamic pricing was going to be used.” In response to one fan, who wrote on X that they “didn’t expect [Oasis] to rip off the fans as much as they have”, Liam curtly replied: “SHUTUP”.",

    "title": "London councils yet to spend £130m in local climate funds",
    "article_text": "London councils are sitting on more than £130m that should be funding local climate action, the Guardian can reveal. More than £170m has been collected through the mayor of London’s carbon offset fund, which developers are required to pay into to mitigate emissions from new projects, since it was introduced in 2016. However, the capital’s 33 local authorities have spent less than £40m between them. Somehave saidthey do not have the resources, expertise or time to decide how to spend it. The money gathered from this fund must be spent on carbon reduction measures in local areas. These include energy efficiency improvements to council housing and other buildings that would lower energy bills for tenants, as well as renewable energy projects and district heating schemes. The cash can also be given out as community grants, and some councils have used it to fund education projects, tree planting and community food-growing schemes. The data, obtained through freedom of information requests, shows a wide variation in spending by councils up to the end of last year. Some authorities have spent all of the funding they have collected from developers while others have spent none. The vast majority have spent less than 20% of the cash. The Guardian was told by a number of councils that some of their unspent cash – about £15m in total – had been allocated for projects but not yet spent. Meanwhile, Greater London Authority figuresshowcouncils have at least another £150m on the way from developers. Zack Polanski, the deputy leader of the Green party and chair of the London assembly’s environment committee, said progress had been “unacceptably slow and inconsistent”. “Thousands of Londoners are stuck in cold, damp and mouldy homes while their bills keep climbing,” he said. “It’s unbelievable that despite having the funds available to fix this, councils are sitting on the money year after year, leaving the most vulnerable to suffer.” Polanski said the situation “reeks of complacency” and he blamed the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, for a failure to deliver a clear net zero plan. Tower Hamlets (£20m), Islington (£18.5m) and Westminster (£16.1m) councils have received the most offsetting cash from developers. Tower Hamlets has spent just over a quarter at £5.3m and Westminster has spent £2.4m – about 15%. Both say they have significantly more cash allocated for projects. Islington has spent £12.1m, the most of any London borough by some distance and about 65% of its pot. Isaac Beevor, a partnerships director at Climate Emergency UK, which monitors the climate action of councils across the country, said Khan needed to “get a grip” on his policy to achieve his target of a net zero London by 2030. “This money could have been spent on retrofitting council homes, planting trees and greening our boroughs, or supporting community energy,” he said. “Some councils have utilised the fund, so there is no valid excuse for those who have spent the last decade refusing to spend a huge pile of cash destined for climate action. We would expect all London boroughs to be ramping up their climate action by spending this money.” He added: “This situation highlights flaws in these schemes: if funds aren’t spent, emissions from new developments have not been offset.” A City Hall spokesperson told the Guardian “urgent talks” were taking place with councils about speeding up the delivery of projects. They said the amount of money collected and spent by councils had been increasing year on year, but added: “A key challenge is the pipeline of deliverable projects available for funding.” London Councils, an umbrella group representing the capital’s boroughs, said there were “undoubtedly challenges to overcome” and pointed out that Khan’s recommended price of £95 for each tonne of carbon dioxide emitted had been devalued sinceit was set in 2021. Sign up toDown to Earth The planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential after newsletter promotion “Boroughs find that carbon offset funds often fail to cover the cost of the projects needed to mitigate operational emissions generated by new development,” a spokesperson said. Councilstold the Greater London Authoritylast year that as well as lacking the required funding, they did not have the time, expertise or resources needed to get projects off the ground. London Councils has now launched a series of workshops to advise boroughs on how to spend the money. The majority of London councils charge developers the recommended £95/tonne CO2, but this is only a guide. As of last year, three Labour-run councils have started charging developers more – not with the aim of raising more cash, but to discourage offsetting, which the Climate Change Committee says “should not be relied on” to decarbonise buildings. Another 15 councilsare said to be looking into raising offsetting costs. Beevor has urged all councils to do this, saying it will encourage developers to hit net zero emissions on-site and remove the need for mitigation projects altogether. Merton council, which in 2003 introduced the pioneering“Merton rule”requiring new developments to generate 10% of their energy from renewables, now charges developers £300 per tonne of CO2. Lewisham has set a new price of £104, while Westminster now charges £330 for electric-based schemes and £880 for gas-based schemes. Haringey council in Februaryallocated all of its outstanding carbon offset fundingto projects including the Haringey Community Carbon Fund, which awards grants to community-led decarbonisation projects such as solar panel schemes, upcycling wood workshops, school uniform swaps and football boot recycling. Of London’s 33 local authorities, 28 declared a climate emergency in 2019 or 2020, announcing bold net zero targets and sweeping commitments to cut private vehicle use, divest pension funds from fossil fuel companies and improve energy efficiency of council housing. Last year, the Local Government Association found two-thirds of councils were not confident of hitting the net zero targets, saying climate action was being “strangled” by a complex web of hard-to-reach Whitehall funding pots.",

Federal prosecutors said at trial that she had raised more than $70,000 for the statue of aLas Vegaspolice officer who was fatally shot in 2014 in the line of duty, but had instead spent it on cosmetic surgery, rent and her daughter’s wedding. Adelson, who is worth $35bn,spent $100mon re-electing Trump in 2024, but apparently decided not to intervene when the Review-Journal, Nevada’s largest newspaper, attacked him on Friday. The newspaper’s editorial criticized Trump’s pardon of Fiore, who was due to be sentenced next month, in no uncertain terms. “The pardon, which was brief and contained no explanation, is an affront to the federal jury that heard her case and sends precisely the wrong message to public officials tempted to enrich themselves through their sinecures,” the Review-Journal wrote. “In addition, pardons are typically reserved for those who were wrongly convicted or the victim of some other miscarriage of justice. There is no evidence that either occurred in this case. Instead, it’s difficult to argue that political considerations weren’t the primary motivation for granting relief to Ms Fiore.” Trump quietly pardoned Fiore, a firm supporter of his, on Wednesday, and the move only came to light after Fiore wrote about the clemency in a Facebook post. The White House confirmed the pardon, but did not elaborate further.

    "title": "Americans, including Republicans, losing faith in Trump, new polls reveal",
    "article_text": "Americans, including someRepublicans, are losing faith inDonald Trumpacross a range of key issues, according to polling released this week. One survey found a majority describing the president’s second stint in the White House so far as “scary”. Along with poor ratings on the economy and Trump’s immigration policy, a survey released on Saturday found that only 24% of Americans believe Trump has focussed on the right priorities as president. That poll comes as Trump’s popularity is historically low for a leader this early in a term. More than half of voters disapprove of Trump’s performance as president, and majorities oppose histariff policiesand slashing of the federal workforce. The scathing reviews come as Trump next week marks 100 days of his second stint office, and suggest Americans are already experiencing fatigue after a period that has seen global financial market nosedives and chilling deportations, including of documented people. A poll by the Associated Press-Norc Center for Public Affairs Researchpublishedthis weekend, found that even Republicans are not overwhelmingly convinced that Trump’s attention has been in the right place. A narrow majority, 54%, ofRepublicanssurveyed said that Trump is focussed on the “right priorities”, while the president’s numbers with crucial independent voters are much weaker. Just 9% of independents said that the president is focussed on the right priorities – with 42% believing Trump is paying attention to the wrong issues. About four in 10 people in the survey, 39%, approve of how Trump is handling the presidency overall, and only about 40% of Americans approve of Trump’s approach to foreign policy, trade negotiations and the economy. Meanwhile, aNew York Times/Siena College pollof registered voters on Friday found that Trump’s approval rating is 42%, and just 29% among independent voters. More than half of voters said Trump is “exceeding the powers available to him”, and 59% of respondents said the president’s second term has been “scary”. While Republican leaders typically receive strong scores on economic issues, Americans have been underwhelmed by Trump’s performance. The Times survey found that only 43% of voters approve of how Trump is handling the economy – a stark turnaround from aTimes poll in April 2024, which found that 64% approved of Trump’s economy in his first term. Half of voters disapproved of Trump’s trade policies with other countries, and 61% said a president should not have the authority toimpose tariffswithout congressional approval, while the Times reported that 63% – including 40% of Republicans – said “a president should not be able to deport legal immigrants who have protested Israel”. Further on immigration, a Washington Post-ABC-Ipsos poll on Friday found that 53% of Americans now disapprove of the president’s handling of immigration matters, while 46% approve. In February the majority was the other way, with half of those surveyed approving of Trump’s approach on that issue. The Postreportedthat as support has drained away on this topic, at this point 90% of Democrats, 56% of independents and 11% of Republicans dislike the way Trump is dealing with immigration. The poor reviews have dogged Trump all week. An Associated Presspollon Thursday found that about half of US adults say that Trump’s trade policies will increase prices “a lot” and another three in 10 think prices could go up “somewhat”, and half of Americans are “extremely” or “very” concerned about the possibility of the US economy going into a recession in the next few months. Polling conducted by the Trump-friendly Fox News has brought little respite. A survey published on Wednesday found that just 38% of Americans approve of Trump on the economy, with 56% disapproving. The Fox News poll found that 58% of respondents disapproved of Trump’s performance, and 59% disapproved on inflation. Just three in 10 Americans said they believed Trump’s policies were helping the economy, and only four in 10 said Trump’s policies will help the country. Among generation Z, generally regarded as those born between 1995 and 2012, a staggering 69% told pollsters for anNBC Stay Tuned surveythat they don’t approve of Trump’s handling of the economy and the cost of living. Gen Z participants complained of struggling to even pay the rent in some places, let alone buy a home, and they worry about inflation. A minority of gen Z people polled thought the country would be stronger if more people lived by traditional binary gender roles and more than 90% of those polled said they believed foreign students with visas or green cards should have the same due process protections as US citizens. This comes amid the Trump administration declaring there are only two genders, male and female, andarresting and detainingsome pro-Palestinian student activists without due process.",

    "title": "Trump officials deport two-year-old US citizen and mother of one-year-old girl",
    "article_text": "TheTrump administrationhas deported a two-year-old US citizen “with no meaningful process”, according to a federal judge, while in a different case the authorities deported the mother of a one-year-old girl, separating them indefinitely. Lawyers in the two cases, the first inLouisianaand the second in Florida, say their clients were arrested at routine check-ins at Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) offices and were given virtually no opportunity to speak with them or family members. They are the latest examples of the White Housecracking down ondocumented immigrants, including green card holders and also even citizens who have the status by birth or naturalization. The unorthodox policy and the frequent avoidance of due process has brought about aclash with the judicialbranch of the US government in a battle over the constitution. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), National Immigration Project and several other allied groups said in a statement that deporting children who are US citizens, as in these two cases, are a “shocking – although increasingly common – abuse of power”. US district judge Terry Doughty in Monroe,Louisiana, said the two-year-old girl, who was referred to as VML in court documents, was deported with her mother to Honduras. “It is illegal and unconstitutional to deport, detain for deportation, or recommend deportation of a US citizen,” said the judge. He scheduled a hearing for 19 May “in the interest of dispelling our strong suspicion that the government just deported a US citizen with no meaningful process”. VML was apprehended by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) on Tuesday with her mother, Jenny Carolina Lopez Villela, and older sister when Villela attended a routine appointment at itsNew Orleansoffice, according to a filing by Trish Mack, who said the child’s father asked her to act as the child’s custodian. The girl’s father is seeking to have her returned to the United States. Immigrants of all sorts with cases in process, pending appeals or parole, have routinely been required to regularlycheck in with Ice officers, sometimes for many years. And so long as they had not violated any regulations or committed any crimes, they were usually sent on their way. Now, as the Trump administration pushes for the massarrestanddeportationof immigrants, check-ins have become increasingly fraught. According to Mack, when VML’s father briefly spoke to Villela, he could hear her and the children crying. According to a court document, he reminded her that a US citizen “could not be deported”. However, prosecutors said Villela, who has legal custody, told Ice that she wanted to retain custody of the girl and take her toHonduras. They said the man claiming to be VML’s father had not presented himself to Ice despite requests to do so. VML is not prohibited from entering the US, federal prosecutors said.. She was among two families deported from Louisiana, also including one pregnant woman, the advocacy groups noted. The Department of Homeland Security and the justice department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. “These actions stand in direct violation of Ice’s own written and informal directives, which mandate coordination for the care of minor children with willing caretakers – regardless of immigration status – when deportations are being carried out,” the ACLU said. Sign up toThis Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration after newsletter promotion In Florida, meanwhile, a Cuban-born woman who is the mother of a one-year-old girl and the wife of a US citizen was detained at a scheduled check-in with Ice in Tampa, her lawyer said on Saturday.Heidy Sánchez was held without any communication and flown to Cuba two days later. She is still breastfeeding her daughter, who suffers from seizures, her lawyer, Claudia Cañizares, said. Cañizares said she tried to file paperwork with Ice to contest the deportation on Thursday morning but Ice refused to accept it, saying Sánchez was already gone. Sánchez is not a criminal and has a strong case on humanitarian grounds for staying in the US, Cañizares said. Donald Trump, whose presidential campaigns havefocused heavilyon immigration, said earlier this month he wanted to deport some violent criminals who are US citizens to El Salvadoran prisons, where he removed hundreds of Venezuelans and some Salvadorans last month without even a court hearing. He sent them toa brutal prisonfor suspected gangsters and terrorists, claiming they were all violent criminals when it has since been argued that most were not and even if they were they had the right to due process. The comments from Trump about sending US citizens or what he termed “home grown” criminals to another country to be incarcerated have alarmed civil rights advocates and is viewed by many legal scholars as unconstitutional. TheUS supreme courthas ordered the Trump administration to “facilitate and effectuate” the return of Maryland residentKilmar Ábrego García, whowas sentto the country on 15 March with hundreds of others despite a US court order protecting him from deportation. Opinion polls in the last week show Trumpstruggling for approvalwith voters who were surveyed, including on some of his hardline anti-immigration tactics.

    "title": "Democrats decry Wisconsin judge’s arrest as Republicans call to remove her",
    "article_text": "The FBI’s arrest of Wisconsin judge Hannah Dugan has triggered strong reactions from Republican and Democratic politicians, as the Trump administration veered closer to direct confrontation with the judiciary over itscrackdownon immigration. Following the Milwaukee county circuit judge’sarreston Friday, over allegations that she helped a man evade US immigration officers at her courthouse, Republicans have called for her removal while Democrats regard her arrest as a reflection of the administration’s increasing disregard of judicial independence amid its push to deport immigrants on an enormous scale. In a clear signal that the administration welcomed a political fight over the judge’s arrest, the FBI director, Kash Patel, posteda photographof Dugan in handcuffs on Twitter/X on Friday night, captioned: “No one is above the law.” According tothe criminal complaintagainst the judge filed in federal court, a six-person arrest team, which included an immigration officer and two FBI agents, arrived at the courthouse to arrest Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a Mexican immigrant facing three misdemeanor battery counts they intended to deport. Flores-Ruiz was in Dugan’s courtroom on 18 April for a scheduling hearing. The complaint alleges that when the arrest team identified themselves to courthouse security, and waited in the public hallway outside Dugan’s courtroom, she confronted them and ordered them to report to the chief judge’s office. Then, according to a court officer cited in the complaint, Dugan directed the defendant and his lawyer to a side exit from the courtroom, which led to a private hallway. In responseto Dugan’s arrest, Representative Glenn Grothman, a Wisonsin Republican, accused Dugan of being a “liberal judge [who] would go so far as to obstruct federal law enforcement in order to protect a violent illegal immigrant from arrest”. Tony Wied, another Republican representative of Wisconsin in Congress, demanded Dugan’s resignation. “Absolutely unacceptable,” Wiedwrote, adding: “Not only are activist judges trying to thwart the president’s agenda, now they are actively breaking the law to protect illegal aliens. Judge Dugan should resign immediately.” Democrats, including Wisconsin’s governor, Tony Evers, condemned the FBI’s arrest of Dugan as an overreach of executive power by Donald Trump. Everssaid:“In this country, people who are suspected of criminal wrongdoing are innocent until their guilt is proven beyond reasonable doubt.” He went to add: “Unfortunately, we have seen in recent months the president and the Trump administration repeatedly use dangerous rhetoric to attack and attempt to undermine the judiciary at every level, including flat-out disobeying the highest court in the land and threatening to impeach and remove judges who do not rule in their favor.” Referencing the US president and the White House’s own messaging of likening Trumpto a king, the state’s Democratic senator, Tammy Baldwin,said: “Make no mistake, we do not have kings in this country … By relentlessly attacking the judicial system, flouting court orders, and arresting a sitting judge, this president is putting those basic Democratic values that Wisconsinites hold dear on the line.” Sign up toThis Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration after newsletter promotion Meanwhile, the state’s former Republican governor Scott Walkercalled on, the Wisconsin state legislature “to remove disgraced Milwaukee county circuit court judge Hannah Dugan from office”. Republicans from outside of Wisconsin echoed those calls, with Tennessee’s representative Tim Burchettsaying: “If she broke the law, she needs to be prosecuted to the fullest extent. No double standards.” But Wisconsin’s Democratic representative Gwen Moorecounteredthat what she called the administration’s “willingness to weaponize federal law enforcement is shocking and this arrest has all the hallmarks of overreach. Federal law enforcement coming into a community and arresting a judge is a serious matter and would require a high legal bar.” Milwaukee’s city council members also released a statement,saying:“Perhaps the most chilling part of judge Dugan’s arrest is the continued aggression by which the current administration in Washington DC has weaponized federal law enforcement, such as ICE, against immigrant communities.” Similarly, Milwaukee county board supervisor, Miguel Martinez,said: “The people will not stand for an administration that continues to weaponize our justice system as a means to intimidate immigrant communities, made clear by the cumulative actions over recent weeks.” Becca Balint, a Vermont Democrat who sits on the House judiciary committee,toldAxios that there should “absolutely” be a probe into Dugan’s arrest. “On the face of it, this is dangerous and outrageous and it is designed to intimidate our judiciary,” she said. Her fellow House judiciary committee member, Maryland Democrat Jamie Raskin,said: “This is a drastic escalation and dangerous new front in Trump’s authoritarian campaign of trying to bully, intimidate and impeach judges who won’t follow his dictates.” “We must do whatever we can to defend the independent judiciary in America … This is an unmistakable descent further into authoritarian chaos,” he added.",

    "title": "Residents of New Orleans comeback district fear port development could kill the renaissance",
    "article_text": "Residents ofNew Orleans’ Ninth Ward, an area many declared dead afterHurricane Katrina, know their history – and the resurgent arts district that marks their comeback. They worry that a huge industrial project would bury the great resurrection. And it’s only the latest crisis with which they have grappled. For all its grandeur and rocking street pageants,New Orleansfaced another crisis after theNew Year’s Day terrorist attackkilled 14 on its globally famed Bourbon Street. Would the killings turn away tourists? The city doubled down on security as it hosted the NFL’sSuper Bowlin February, with help from the state government. Lavish media coverage followed. The city rolled into Mardi Gras in early March, with crowded parades, nightclubs, restaurants and art galleries, a healthy boost for New Orleans’s $8bn tourist economy. Yet to come: the bittersweet 20th-anniversary commemoration ofHurricane Katrina, when the city nearly drowned on global television. On 29 August 2005, the 175mph winds drove a 25ft water surge from the Gulf of Mexico up 90 miles of ragged wetlands, smashing the federal levee system, flooding an area seven times the size of Manhattan. In the city’s Black-majority Ninth Ward,people on rooftops pleaded for rescue as bloated bodies lay below. A subsequent federal investigation faulted the US army corps of engineers for negligent operation of the levees. “The worst engineering catastrophe in US history,” said a national engineers’ society. The army corps operates a shipping link known as the “industrial canal” that runs from the Mississippi River levee five miles north to Lake Pontchartrain, dividing the ward into the Upper and Lower Ninth. During Katrina, an unloosed barge shattered the canal’s protective wall. Water gushed across the sprawling Lower Ninth Ward, more than 20ft high in places, spilling into the adjacent suburban community of St Bernard parish, where levees also broke. Though poor and scarred by crime, the Lower Ninth Ward had a 61% home ownership rate, the city’s highest. But many dwellings with mortgages paid had no insurance. The area fell into dense overgrowth for years. Slowly, the gritty rebuilding began. A strain of gentrification came with writers and artists seeking affordable spaces. Today’s Lower Ninth Ward – population 5,000 – is two-thirds less populous than it was in 2005. The same army engineers who were responsible for the levee failures that redefined the Lower Ninth Ward after Katrina now oversee river-related projects with the port ofNew Orleans, a political subdivision of the state that is one of Louisiana’s most powerful institutions. Its portfolio of warehouses, wharves and other properties earn rent, while fees from cargo, cruise ships and railroads add to its projected 2025 revenue of $27m. A public hearing on 20 February reviewed one of the big ticket projects being pursued by the entity that markets itself as PortNOLA. Such gatherings rarely draw 50 hostile people, such as those who came that day from Holy Cross, named for a high school of stately brick which was displaced by Katrina damage. The community now consists of condos and apartments along the levee, a linear park with riverine vistas for families, kids, dogs and joggers. These community members know their history. And they worry those spinning the project as an industrial victory for the region could annihilate a post-Katrina comeback symbol – as well as a vital bohemian enclave of the arts – in the process. The project at issue involves an empty warehouse on the levee, a facility known as the Alabo Street wharf. It is being leased to Sunrise Foods International, a Canadian multinational with plans to rebuild it into a terminal for importing organic grain from foreign ports. A spokesperson told the Guardian the port had spent $37m through January on preliminary engineering design and permit support. It has also spent $3.3m for upgrading a long-dormant Norfolk Southern rail line which will take cargo on Alabo Street to link with tracks on the median of St Claude Avenue, a main Ninth Ward thoroughfare. At an open house last fall, residents decried the prospect of 24 rail crossings, sirens, clanging bells, traffic gridlock and trains trundling over streets where children play. “This has never been about where we are as a stabilizing community,” said the Rev Willie Calhoun of the Fairview Mission Baptist church. Calhoun called the project’s plans as presented by the port, Sunrise and Norfolk Southern “a dog and pony show”. Calhoun and others joined Stop the Grain Train, the name of a movement led by small business owner Jeffrey Wittenbrink. Findings the group acquired through Freedom of Information Act requests stoked complaints about secrecy. Sunrise has since posted a study insisting grain dust will not be a threat. But Calhoun unloaded grain as a longshoreman in the 1970s after air force duty in Vietnam, and he said: “Grain dust is not good for anybody. I asked Sunrise about their system to get it out of the terminal into the railcar. They said they were still in design. How do you permit it without an environmental impact statement?” An army corps of engineers spokesperson told the Guardian that the agency had not received two of the relevant permit applications for the wharf project. Wittenbrink’s group met with city council members seeking help. Soon thereafter, council member-at-large Helena Moreno, a candidate for mayor in October, wrote to the port chief executive officer, Beth Ann Branch. Moreno cited residents’ “fear regarding safety, health and noise issues, as well as concerns about the devaluation of their property and the potential destruction of their neighborhood if the grain terminal project proceeds”. Branch declined the Guardian’s interview request. However, the port of New Orleans press secretary provided information to the outlet. On 20 February, Branch and five board members sat for an hour of comment, listening. One Holy Cross resident, Patricia Ordinate, held a walker and told the officials they were “destroying an entire neighborhood”. “It’s criminal and inhuman!” she said. Jolie Robichaux said: “We moved to Holy Cross for peacefulness. We have not heard a plan for safety!” Another man cried, “You should all be ashamed,” while accusing the port of withholding information. Jennifer Ward sat holding a Stop the Grain Train sign. With a long background as a curator for galleries, she did not testify. A Holy Cross homeowner, Ward leases an 11,000-sq-ft building called Art Conscious, a ground floor gallery and upstairs print and framing business, in Arabi, a St Bernard village just below the Lower Ninth. Ward has six employees and is hiring. Her home and larger business have a combined value of $1.5m, she told the Guardian. Ward said her home value on Zillow had fallen $40,000 since the port plan became public, though a direct correlation is impossible to gauge. “I am scared to death that if this area goes industrial, what I have made here will be lost,” Ward said after the hearing. “This plan is an atrocity after everything the neighborhood has survived,” Gary Lavigne, a Ninth Ward historic renovation builder, told the Guardian. As residents filed out of the port hearing, Branch congratulated board member James Carter – a Black attorney and former city council member – for having been named the honorary king of a carnival parade. As TR Johnson – an English professor at New Orleans’ Tulane University – sees it, the Ninth Ward “has replaced the French Quarter as a catalyst of New Orleans arts”. “This cluster of neighborhoods … has evolved into an enclave of artistic production that marked the French Quarter from the 1920s through the 70s,” he says. A look at some of the area’s residents supports the notion that it is a renaissance district. They include the distinguished Mexican novelist Yuri Herrera (a Tulane professor), author most recently of Season of the Swamp; the painter Regina Scully, whose 2017 New Orleans Museum of Art exhibit made her Japanese-inspired cityscapes a hot item with collectors and galleries across the country; and Leyla McCalla, the pop singer and cellist formerly with the Grammy-winning Carolina Chocolate Drops. To name a few others, there is also bestselling novelist Jami Attenberg; African American photographers Chandra McCormick and husband Keith Calhoun; Black Masking Indian artist Demond Melancon, who won the 1858 Prize for contemporary southern art; environmental photographer Ben Depp; members of RAM, the Haitian rock band; singer Dawn Richards; the memoirist Anne Gisleson; painter Gina Phillips; and film documentarian Katherine Cecil. The resurgent cultural footprint stretches across the city line into St Bernard, whose population of 40,000 is down from 75,000 in 2005. Arabi, the site of Ward’s Art Conscious building, is a slow-tempo section of St Bernard with artists’ studios scattered about. It is home to the Ranch, a film production soundstage. In adjacent Chalmette, a repurposed Ford auto plant developed by attorney and arts patron Sidney Torres III is an arts center on the National Register of Historic Places. PortNOLA’s expansion plan includes the multibillion-dollarLouisianaIndustrial Terminal (LIT) in Violet, a community 8.6 miles south of Arabi. Servicing the superport will require crushing an 1,100-acre cypress and wetlands forest to erect an elevated highway for 1,728 industrial trucks to travel 17 miles daily to Interstate 10. PortNOLA has invested $107m in site acquisition and other costs. Irony hovers here like a mushroom cloud. The LIT is in a $14bn federally funded flood protection zone the army corps of engineers executed in upgrading the levees post-Katrina. The port’s LIT budget of $1.8bn includes $300m in federal funds. But it requires a permit by the army corps which, if approved, would then have the agency gutting its own post-Katrina remedial work through dredging and facilitating destruction of the coastal forest, a storm-surge buffer. The wheel of history rolls backwards in this scenario. In 1963, the port and the army corps, with locals’ support, began dredging for the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet – or MR-GO, a 76-mile artery – with Congress’s approval as an alternate shipping route downriver to the Gulf of Mexico. Construction wrecked a forest of cypress trees and tidal wetlands, a buffer to storm surges comprising more than 23,000 acres in St Bernard. MR-GO opened a sluiceway for Hurricane Betsy’s Gulf waters barreling into the city in 1965, with deep flooding in parts of St Bernard and the Lower Ninth Ward. Seventy-six people died in Betsy, thefirst stormof $1bn in assessed damages. More than 160,000 homes flooded, with bodies found in scattered attics. Forty years later, Katrina’s storm surge followed a similar route, wreaking far greater damage in the Ninth Ward and St Bernard in terms of death, cost and population loss. Today’s New Orleans of 357,767 people is down from the 484,674 in 2005. Many residents were too poor to move back after the natural disaster. “MR-GO never delivered the results its boosters promised,” writes the historian Craig Colten, citing a meager impact of “about 3% of the New Orleans port’s freight tonnage”. In 2009, by political consensus, the corps began filling inMR-GO, as the wetlands’ reseeding began. St Bernard officials oppose the Violet superport. Torres, an attorney, in challenging the plan cites a PortNOLA public notice that 1.8m cubic yards of “native materials will be excavated and filled with” nearly 3.9m cubic yards of river sand. Torres in a legal motion said there would also be nearly 2.4m cubic yards of crushed stone and paving with more than 1m cubic yards of thick reinforced concrete. “Debris removal and stone must be trucked,” he said. “The existing vital forest will become a giant concrete hardscape covered by over 14m tons of materials. There is no reversing the impacts of this environmental devastation.” Advising St Bernard’s local government, architect-engineer John Vickerman is a maritime consultant based in Williamsburg, Virginia, specializing in freight logistics for heavy cargo ports across the globe. Vickerman did consulting for PortNOLA on a 2017 plan. He evinces a trace of scorn, calling the Violet LIT project “risky” in a Guardian interview. “Consider the environmental risk of some 1,700 container trucks a day to transport ship cargo” to I-10, he said. Vickerman cited downriver sites in the community of Plaquemines parish that have “better connections to road or rail”. Vickerman’s report argues that the river dimensions at Violet can’t accommodate mega-ton supercargo ships without help from outsize tugboats to literally turn around before leaving the dock, meaning “82% of the navigational river traffic would be completely blocked during vessel departures from LIT”. Vickerman’s document criticized PortNOLA for “neglect[ing] to conduct and/or share crucial project due diligence information and justification analysis to rigorously evaluate and justify the LIT” proposal. “The permit application for the proposed LIT project in Violet is still in review,” an army corps spokesperson said in an email. The spokesperson said the applicant was working through an environmental assessment and that the agency anticipated hosting a public hearing in the summer “to gather … feedback on the permit application”. New Orleans seduced the Kentucky-born artist Gina Phillips, who earned a master’s in fine arts at Tulane in the late 1990s. As her works gained sales and critical notice, she put down funds in 2004 on a blighted house in the Lower Ninth Ward as part of a Federal Housing Authority package for first-time buyers. Just off the river, Phillips’s lot abutted an earthen levee along the industrial canal. She plunged into long days of sweat-equity repair work. With paintings that explore southern identity, she liked the Lower Ninth quilt of churches, shotgun houses and vegetable gardens. Some folks raised chickens. Some hunted rabbits and squirrels in the savannah near the back swamp by Bayou Bienvenue. Six days before Katrina, with work nearly done, Phillips visited friends in Richmond, Virginia. She was heartsick less than a week later realizing her house was underwater. A mile down from Phillips’s place, the late rock and R&B legend Fats Domino and his wife raised eight children in a baronial home with an adjacent shotgun house. The army corps’ harbor patrol vessels rescued Fats and his family from the Katrina flood. They soon made it to Baton Rouge to stay with friends. When Domino moved back to a New Orleans suburb, graffiti on his old house reading “RIP Fats We Love You” became a must-stop on “disaster tour” buses from downtown hotels, tourists agog at the Lower Ninth’s washed-out streets, feral dogs and cats roaming trash mounds. About a million people in and around New Orleans evacuated. Many took years to rebuild their homes, with $3.3bn in federal aid for homeowners who were underinsured. In July 2006, Phillips began a long slog of renegotiating loans, dealing with the Road Home federal assistance program. “I didn’t have flood insurance because it was in a so-called safe zone.” She had $90,000 invested when the flood hit. Road Home eventually paid $150,000. After restoring an 1,100-sq-ft house, she built a studio in the yard with oak trees. She calculates their value at $500,000, “but that’s arbitrary if the army corps ends up widening the industrial canal”, she said. “Who wants to live next to a multiyear construction zone?” After the federal report on its levee failures, and litigation from citizens’ groups, the army corps has moved slowly on an envisioned $1bn new lock for the industrial canal. It is now projected to take 13 years. Members of a group billing itselfthe Canal Will Kill Nolaattend meetings with hard questions. A short documentary featuring Dr Joshua Lewis of Tulane University’s ByWater Institute for Coastal Studies captures the history of hurricane destruction abetted by flawed development projects such as MR-GO. “The lock replacement would devastate neighborhoods on both sides of the canal for an unknown period of time,” said Sam Bowler, a Lower Ninth Ward metal sculptor and community organizer. Residents fear that the lock work, which involves widening parts of the artery, will crack their walls and foundations and affect home values and quality of life. “We keep asking, ‘How long will it take? What’s the impact of pile driving?’ They have to demolish a gigantic amount of underwater concrete. The levee walls have failed twice [in 1965 and 2005]. They’re asking for a third shot. Really? The alternative is to find another navigational route.” In 2008, Phillips began her Fats Domino series, an exhibition over several years celebrating the Lower Ninth’s most famous resident as a resurrection symbol. The legendary singer died in 2017. The family’s restored home faces the renamed Fats Domino Avenue, just above the city line and the Arabi arts district. Raised in Dorset, in the south of England, Katherine Cecil lives today with her children, ages 12 and seven, in a steamboat gothic house a block from the river in the Lower Ninth. The kids ride bikes on the levee. Ship foghorns boom like basso profundo bullfrogs. “Sometimes you hear bullets at night – but the birds sing in the morning, making it rather idyllic,” Cecil said. In the early 2000s, while studying for a master’s degree in literature at Tulane, Cecil grew intrigued by the city as a cultural crossroads and transitioned into documentary work. She filmed the 2006 mayor’s race. The incumbent, Ray Nagin, a Black businessman who won in 2002 with 86% of the white vote and 38% of African Americans, cast himself as a post-Katrina populist, advocating for displaced Black people. He defeated the liberal Mitch Landrieu, at the time the lieutenant governor, with 83% of the Black vote and a mere 21% of whites. Cecil’s documentary, Race, shows the election as a referendum on Blacks’ right of return. Nagin never delivered once re-elected. Unable to run again after his second term, he went to prison for bribery. Landrieu won in 2010 and led a major rebuilding of the broken city before becoming the White House’s infrastructure czar during Joe Biden’s presidency. PortNOLA’s plans for the Alabo wharf, some six blocks down the levee from her house, haunt Cecil for its parallels with herwork-in-progress: the multi-platform Claiborne Avenue History Project, with Dr Raynard Sanders, an urban scholar. In the mid-1960s, amid the civil rights movement and before Blacks voted en masse, the city tore down several miles of stately oak trees on the grassy neutral ground of North Claiborne, the crosstown avenue with an industrial canal bridge between the Upper and Lower Ninth Wards. Bulldozing the vertical park saw scores of Black businesses on Claiborne sacrificed for a highway overpass that linked the suburbs to the French Quarter and downtown business district. The Tremé neighborhood lost a quarter of its population and was economically devastated for years. “Most residents who saw the oaks go down are elderly and don’t remember much opposition,” Cecil said. “Dodie Smith-Simmons, a legendary activist, told us they were too busy fighting for civil rights to realize what the city was doing. There is a similarity with the port and Alabo. These infrastructure projects are presented as done deals with almost no opportunity for public comment. The port began the train tracks here before an environmental evaluation. In the 60s, the city made no effort to solicit input from people; the bulldozers came out of nowhere.” Saying “there’s a stealth aspect to this”, Cecil called for a moratorium until “a fully objective environmental evaluation can be done” on dust control and cost management. The Louisiana national guard’s Jackson barracks – brick buildings on a lush lawn – lie on St Claude Avenue just before the city line where Arabi begins. The Rev Willie Calhoun lives seven blocks from there on Delery Street, by his childhood home. He recalls the 1960s’ Lower Ninth Ward as a “tight neighborhood fabric, [with] close families”. The pastor, his wife and mother evacuated before Katrina. The flood reached 20ft there. “I rebuilt my house and my mother’s from the ground up,” Calhoun said. “The bonus God gave me was the years I had left with my mom.” The man “around the corner, he drowned. One of my schoolmates, she and her sister drowned in the attic. On this block now we have four houses and seven empty lots.” Calhoun worked 32 years with the Federal Aviation Administration. “I retired in order to rebuild. Insurance paid $100,000. Road Home gave me $47,000. The gentleman who did my claim said I hadoverbuiltfor the area – it would be $300,000 to rebuild. Before the flood I was debt-free. To rebuild, I had to take [a small business loan] I’m still paying on today.” He estimated perhaps five of more than 50 non-profits “that came here after the storm … are left”. “Even though properties here are dirt cheap, it’s expensive to rebuild,” he said. “We haven’t gained an understanding of what it takes to raise a neighborhood. I guess that’s why they figure they can industrialize it – and why we keep fighting.” Several blocks away from Calhoun’s home, on a street near the Jackson barracks, Regina Scully has a grassy yard and rebuilt house where she has lived and worked for nearly a decade. Her sister, novelist Helen Scully, is finishing a law degree at Loyola University New Orleans and lives nearby. Regina Scully’s odyssey is one parable of the Lower Ninth. Raised in Virginia, Scully studied at the Rhode Island School of Design. In 2004, after several years in New York, she moved to New Orleans, where her mother, sister and brother had gone. Her father had taken a job as a Loyola University dean. Her work back then focused on “abstract figures, very psychological and large in composition,” shesaidin a 2021 interview with the Artful Mindmagazine. As Katrina bore down, she went to Mobile, where her mother had family. She returned months later to the flood-battered city. Helping friends dig out to salvage their homes, she took photographs of castoff toys, coat hangers, lampshades, tricycle parts. Her paintings took a sharp realistic turn in abstract style. In 2008, she began a master’s in fine arts at the University of New Orleans. She soon found space to paint with a job managing a bed-and-breakfast in Bywater, the Upper Ninth neighborhood of Victorian cottages and camelback houses with tropical yards, cheek to jowl with Greek revival manses, warehouses and old stores being repurposed as homes and studios. Meanwhile, across St Claude Avenue, Habitat for Humanity was building houses in the upstart Musicians’ Village, today an Upper Ninth entertainment hub. Scully felt a metaphysical pull to the Lower Ninth, photographing “dead houses and strewn shapes, like domestic installations out on the street, and it shook everything up for me”. She reflected one recent afternoon, surrounded by paints, brushes and varied objects arrayed throughout her front rooms and kitchen. A cat lounged in the yard outside the screen door. Scully spoke of being fixated on “how water can be so destructive and yet so beautiful”. Her style evolved into vistas of water melding with shards of land, objects and people mixed into the flow, sensations of beauty amid destruction. Her break came in a 2011 exhibition, Double Crescent, of five New Orleans artists and five from Istanbul, chosen by the influential New York curator Dan Cameron. In the catalogue, Cameron calls her work a “representation of the Gulf Coast environment, its strong symbiosis between land and water and its ongoing dialogue between gestation and decay … a world where boundaries keep shifting”. She moved to the Lower Ninth in 2016, paying $225,000 for a 3,000-sq-ft house that is mostly work space. “Basically,” she said, “I was priced out of Bywater because the studio rent kept going up along with the home prices.” In 2017, at 42, Scully had a major exhibition at the New Orleans Museum of Art, Japanese Landscape: Inner Journeys. Having never visited Japan, she did intense study in the museum’s archives, focusing on the animated, abstract landscapes of Nangaartists in the Edo period (1603-1868) known for fluid brushwork in black ink. Memories of the flood shadowed Scully’s immersion in the Japanese style. “She considers the beauty of nature, its vastness, and its potential destruction,” wrote Lisa Rotondo McCord, Noma’s curator for asian art, “pushing the boundaries of her practice to explore different environments and spaces within”. Life in the Lower Ninth was not always pastoral. A drive-by shooting near Scully’s house several years ago was jarring. But, she said, “I don’t hear many gunshots today”, perhaps a reflection of an overall drop in violent crime that the city has reported. Scully is still pushing boundaries. She recently severed ties with her local gallery and sells her work via referrals from her website. Every few weeks, high-end collectors drive past the Alabo wharf and visit her house to see pieces that range in price from the low to upper five figures. Most of her neighbors are Black. “This is a flourishing place,” she said. “My neighbors and I get along well. The creative spirit is strong but has a delicacy as it grows. “If the Alabo development goes through it would cut up these neighborhoods, and we’d be crushed by the pollutants and noise.” Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville founded New Orleans in 1718 on an oxbow of the great river for its geo-strategic value, 90 miles upriver from the Gulf. He ignored French engineers advocating for Biloxi, Mississippi, and broke ground near present-day Jackson Square, securing the city’s raison d’etre. Even with the fusion of the climate crisis, sea rise and land subsidence, the river is an economic lifeblood. The port of south Louisiana, with 54 docks along the lower Mississippi,ranksfirst nationally in key indices of cargo. But the separate PortNOLA, once a pre-eminent docking area in stand-alone terms, has been steadily slipping. It ranks 15th of the top 30 individual ports, well behind the top five: Los Angeles, Newark, California’s Long Beach, Georgia’s Savannah and Houston in overall cargo. Several reasons explain this. For one, New Orleans’s Crescent City Connection, the bridge across the Mississippi to its west bank suburbs, is not high enough to facilitate supersized cargo ships – and proximity to rail and trucking lines is also key. Population is another factor pivotal to an economy supporting a major port. Houston has been growing for years. New Orleans is well behind its pre-Katrina population. But unlike the 2010s, when young people flocked here for jobs with digital startups, it has seen a decrease of 6.65% since the 2020 census, according to the World Population Review. In 2020, it had 383,997 people. Today the figure is about 357,767. Those 26,000 exiles, part of 50,000 who left Louisiana, departed for better jobs, less costly housing and more affordable insurance – and to escape hurricanes, according to various studies. Rebuilding a population turns on promoting the promise of life. New Orleans’ historic appeal has been a rooted culture with an authentic quality of life. To that end, the Lower Ninth and St Bernard stand as miracles of American resilience. The port of Plaquemines downriver from Violet hasproposeda joint venture with PortNOLA to place the superport at its facility. How the major investment in Violet would be recouped is a sticking point. Louisiana’s governor, Jeff Landry, has remained neutral. The Avondale shipyard on the Mississippi River’s west bank in the New Orleans area suburban community of Jefferson parish is potentially an alternative site for the grain terminal. PortNOLA’s two-pronged plan for the Alabo wharf and the Violet super-terminal reflects the politics of mid-20th-century urban renewal – and high-scale land use that prized economic development over expendable communities. Many such projects sacrificed sustainable neighborhoods for highways as well as river and industrial expansion. Today’s research-driven impact statements and regional planning bodies weigh past mistakes – like disasters – in gauging benefits to citizens in the way. The secrecy behind the port’s logic of “start building, get permissions later” ignited a political firestorm with the leading contenders for mayor. Council members Helena Moreno and Oliver Thomas, a son of the Ninth Ward, united against the Alabo plan. For the army corps of engineers to greenlight PortNOLA’s permits means reversing its post-Katrina agenda of protecting the city, with a cynical wink and nod to plans that would smash two areas that beat the odds as comeback zones with the Mississippi River central to the fabric of their respective neighborhoods. Jeffrey Wittenbrink, the Ninth Ward activist, invokes a long-rangeplan, Redeveloping the Crescent, a prize-winning study of a repurposed riverfront advanced by local architects in 2008. The plan envisions sequenced spaces along the levee as a greenway from the French Quarter down to St Bernard. The Alabo wharf, says Wittenbrink, would be one hub of the linear park and become a magnet for building population in affordable neighborhoods with economies of scale. For Wittenbrink, the solution lies in purchasing enough of PortNOLA’s property in the Lower Ninth to engineer a shift in location to Avondale Global Gateway, the port across the river on the west bank with a 200-acre industrial site. That would mean a joint venture among the port, Sunrise Foods and Avondale far from residential areas. PortNOLA and Sunrise could amicably terminate their lease. “They would both make money,” he said. Wittenbrink thinks the conversion of the Alabo wharf and nearby port properties would facilitate restaurants and spaces for concerts and workshops, anchoring the comeback. “If the port and its board are open to selling the property, including two warehouses off Alabo wharf, it offers little downside,” he said. His group is working on a prospectus to seek “public and philanthropic funding sources” – about $60m. Based on meetings he’s had with people on different sides, Wittenbrink says he thinks “the port would seriously consider this if we can come up with the money”. He refused to disclose details. In a city as poor as New Orleans, $60m is a tough hunt. Yet in real world terms, it’s rocket fuel for the resurrection zone the rest of the world wrote off years ago as a lost cause at the bottom of America. Jason Berry is the author of City of a Million Dreams, a history of New Orleans and subject of a documentary film to be released in August",

    "title": "‘100-year timeframe’: how Project 2025 is guiding Trump’s attack on government",
    "article_text": "David A Graham doesn’t say he readProject 2025so you don’t have to, but it might be inferred. The Atlantic staff writer’s new book,The Project: How Project 2025 Is Reshaping America, is a swift but thorough overview of the vast far-right plan for a second Trump administration that achieved notoriety last year. Over just 138 pages, a passing dream next to the Heritage Foundation’s922-page doorstop, Graham considers the origins of Project 2025, its aims and effects so far. There’s a reason Project 2025 came out so long. “They’re looking at a 100-year timeframe,” Graham said. “They’re looking at things from the New Deal and saying, ‘This is where the government went wrong, and we need to fix these things. We need to change them permanently and reframe what the government does and what its relationship with every American is.’” The New Deal is the name given to the vast expansion of the federal government under Franklin D Roosevelt in the 1930s, in response to the Great Depression and laying the foundation of the modern US state. Project 2025 waspublishedin 2023. As the 2024 election loomed, Democrats raised alarms about its hardline policy recommendations on issues including climate, LGBTQ+ rights, reproductive healthcare and more.Incendiary rhetoricraised awareness too. Kevin Roberts, Heritage president and author of the Project 2025foreword, said he and his allies were “in the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be”, then peppered his own book with images of fire and destruction. In praise of Roberts, JD Vance, Donald Trump’s running mate, said it was time to “load the muskets”. To Graham, such bellicose rhetoric was “terrifying” but also, in retrospect, a clear signpost to things to come. “To say that publicly before the election is really a strange public relations choice. It’s such a chilling thing to say. But you know, it told us what they wanted.” Amid controversy, Trumptried to distance himselffrom Project 2025 and its authors. But then he won the election. At the outset of his second term, he duly unleashed slashing cuts to federal staffing and budgets and a barrage of executive orders advancing policies directly linked to Project 2025 or firmly in its spirit. Graham is anaward-winningreporter, used to working fast. He started writing The Project “at the very end of November”, weeks after Trump defeated Kamala Harris, “and turned the book in in mid-January”. He wrote the book, he said, because “we the press, we the American public, had talked a lot about Project 2025 during the election, and it felt like it had kind of gone away – but it remained really relevant. And I felt like there was a lot in it that I didn’t understand, and a lot that had been missed.” During the 2024 election, experts did indeed advise that such policy plans for possible administrations have existed for decades but have rarely been enacted. The sheer size of Project 2025 might also have lulled some into a false sense of security. Like many reporters, Graham “had dabbled in parts of it”. Unlike many, he found “it was a different experience to read the whole thing altogether. “I think it is both more radical in some ways than it came across – like, when you’re just reading atomized policies, you don’t get what a social program it is – [but] one of the other things that I think is interesting is how there are ideas that I think are either [only] fairly objectionable or might have widespread appeal, right next to ones that are totally out in right field. You’ll be in the same paragraph or in the same chapter. “And the third thing I think is interesting is the way there are disagreements within the text, either between the authors or between the authors andDonald Trump. Those cleavages within the right I think are worth paying attention to now.” Trump opponents looking for cleavages will not find them in the influential office of management and budget, now directed by Russ Vought, a Christian nationalist,advocateof “traumatizing” political enemies, and Project 2025 co-author. The original director of Project 2025, Paul Dans, fell victim to political necessity in 2024, forced out of the Heritage Foundation as Trump came under pressure – but remains a true believer, recentlydeclaringTrump’s actions in office to be beyond his “wildest dreams”. But there is also Elon Musk. The world’s richest man has led Trump’s so-called department of government efficiency, or Doge, inattacking federal agenciesand departments with startling speed and recklessness. “This is one of the places I have been most surprised,” Graham said, “because I think the methods that they lay out [in Project 2025] are really important. I thought that an important part of this was going to be how deeply people like Russ Vought had thought about, ‘OK, how can we work within the bounds of the law to achieve these things? How can we rework the bureaucracy?’ And in fact, Musk came in and just blasted right through it and made it a lot easier for them, and a lot faster. I certainly didn’t expect that. It’s not contemplated in the book or in the original document.” Nor are Trump’s beloved tariffs much loved by Project 2025 and its free-trade-loving authors. Graham said: “There are these big differences within Project 2025. The most obvious place is the chapters on tariffs … they [also] disagree with Trump on Ukraine. They’re much more hawkish on Ukraine, and anti-Russia. You have this sort of standard, ‘We stand up for Israel, We oppose Iran,’ sort of thing, but foreign policy is barely mentioned. It’s all about China. And Trump talks the talk on China, but then many of the things he’s doing, like tariffs, which are discussed in Project 2025 but not as a major priority, are alienating the rest of the world, which makes it very hard to take on China. “But then, even something as small as how to handle childcare, you have different people having different views [within Project 2025]. One of the things that jumps out at me is they did a really good job of figuring out how to meld these longstanding social and religious conservative priorities on to Maga. They find places where they can work with Trump. Trump is very interested in talking about trans rights and Democrats, and men are very interested in fighting back much more broadly on gender norms, LGBTQ+ rights, and so … Project 2025 becomes sort of like a tip of the spear to get Trump’s attention. They care about “wokeness”, and DEI, maybe for different reasons than he does, but they’ll attack that, and it gets him onboard. On another key issue of Trump’s second term, Graham sees the White House and the ideologues of Project 2025 much more closely aligned. Project 2025 is “very focused on illegal immigration, but also on legal immigration. Overall, the point is to have fewer people who are born overseas in the US, by whatever means necessary. And so they talk about mass deportation, and they talk about detention centers, but they also talk about reducing the number of visas that people get and trying to … find people who have lied on their citizenship applications, to revoke citizenship, denaturalization. “There are things where you see maybe not a direct correlation but the same spirit. So we see in Project 2025 an argument that we need to crack down on student visas from quote, unquote, unfriendly countries, and use student visas as a sort of tool of political warfare.” Trump may not be implementing Project 2025 word for word but its authors have much to delight them. Conversely, Graham’s book is sprinkled with lines that prompt grim laughter. Consider the case of James Sherk, a Trump adviser on civil service and labor issues in the first term who drafted “Schedule F”, a proposal to reclassify about 50,000 civil service jobs as political, thereby allowing a president to fire such people at will. Under Joe Biden, Schedule F was shelved. Ahead of Trump’s second term, Project 2025 advocated putting it swiftly to use. Last year, Sherkspoke to ProPublica. “The notion we’re going to can 50,000 people is just insane,” he said. “Why would you do that? That would kneecap your ability to implement your agenda.” Under Trump,more than 260,000government workers have been fired, taken buyouts or retired early.

    "title": "Chris Eubank Jr beats Conor Benn on unanimous points decision",
    "article_text": "Chris Eubank Jr dealt fellow Briton Conor Benn a first career defeat after going the distanceto win their middleweight grudge matchon a unanimous points decision. All three judges scored the fight 116-112 after a pulsating 12-round slugfest, with both fighters coming out hard from the start and going toe-to-toe in front of 65,000 spectators at London’s Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The fight between the sons of former world champions and archrivals Chris Eubank Sr and Nigel Benn, who met twice in the 1990s, was called off in 2022 when Benn tested positive for trace amounts of fertility drug clomifene. “I knew I was capable of that, and I just needed someone to bring that out of me. I did not expect him to be the guy to do that,” Eubank told DAZN. “The fact our fathers did it before brings out the soul in you. “I did not know he [Benn] had what he had in him. I thought I’d break him early. I didn’t train for a fight like that.” Both fathers were present, 32 years on from their last clash, and embraced in the ring before the opening bell. The fight itself rolled back the years from the scraps that their fathers produced with sheer aggression and energy dominating. “It was close,” Benn said after. “I need to watch it back. I thought I won. Maybe I stayed on the ropes for too long. I enjoyed it, and it was a massive homecoming. “We always knew Chris was a good fighter, and has good fighting talk.” Benn had made a step up in weight to face someone who had been a fierce rival outside the ring. “I believe I can go back down a weight and win a title,” Benn said on reflection. A rematch between the pair is in the contract, and promoter Eddie Hearn was clear that it needs to happen, in his opinion. “I couldn’t split them. I thought Benn was winning the fight and then lost the last two rounds,” Hearn told DAZN. “It is what it is, but I didn’t see Eubank winning that by four rounds. “Benn became the people’s champion. He rose up to fight a middleweight, and he took the kitchen sink. He never stopped trying to win the fight. “It was one of the most dramatic fights I’ve seen. “Those two warriors should respect each other after that.”",

    "title": "Pakistan calls for ‘neutral’ investigation into Kashmir attack",
    "article_text": "Pakistan has called for a “neutral” investigation into thekillingsof tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir that New Delhi has blamed on Islamabad, saying it was willing to cooperate and favoured peace. India has identified two of the three suspected attackers as Pakistani, though Islamabad has denied any role in the attack on Tuesday that killed 25 Indians and one Nepali national. “Pakistan is fully prepared to cooperate with any neutral investigators to ensure that the truth is uncovered and justice is served,” said Pakistan’s interior minister, Mohsin Naqvi, on Saturday. “Pakistan remains committed to peace, stability and the following of international norms but will not compromise on its sovereignty,” he told a news conference. Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said, “The recent tragedy in Pahalgam is yet another example of this perpetual blame game, which must come to a grinding halt.” India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi has pledged to pursue the attackers to “the ends of the earth” and said that those who planned and carried it out “will be punished beyond their imagination”. Meanwhile, calls continue togrowfrom Indian politicians and others for military retaliation against Pakistan. After the attack, India and Pakistan unleashed a host of measures against each other, with Pakistan closing its airspace to Indian airlines, and India suspending the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty that regulates water-sharing from the Indus River and its tributaries. The two sides, who both fully claim Kashmir while partly governing it, have also exchanged fire across their de facto border for two straight days after four years of relative calm. The Indian Army said it had responded to “unprovoked” small arms fire from multiple Pakistan Army posts that started around midnight on Friday along the 740km (460-mile) de facto border separating the Indian and Pakistani areas of Kashmir. It reported no casualties. Pakistan’s military has not yet commented on the exchange of fire. Maleeha Lodhi, a former Pakistani diplomat, told Al Jazeera that there was “a sombre mood” in Pakistan with a great deal of apprehension about what might happen next. Lodhi said, “The nuclear neighbours are on the brink of a more dangerous confrontation, so there are fears, especially because of speeches by Prime Minister Modi as well as the Indian media.” The former ambassador stressed that, due to this rhetoric, there is a fear that India might take “kinetic action” against Pakistan. “That would mean a very strong, robust response from Pakistan,” she said. “So, the fear and the apprehension are really focused on the fact that we could be on the threshold of a full-blown crisis,” Lodhi concluded. Indians living in Jammu and Kashmir’s border village R S Pura have also begun cleaning out community bunkers as diplomatic tensions with Pakistan escalate. “We are the residents of border areas. Whatever happens in India, our areas will be the first to be affected,” resident Balvir Kaur told the Reuters news agency. “We are preparing ourselves so that we are ready if anything happens. The Indian government would not need to think whether its people living in the borders are safe. We do not want to be a burden for them.” In an editorial published on Saturday, Pakistan’s Dawn news outlet said, “It is time again to give diplomacy a chance as neither Pakistan nor India can afford war.” The editorial added that “these are dangerous times in the subcontinent, and there is a need for both Pakistan and India to show restraint, and handle the post-Pahalgam developments with sense.” Meanwhile, Indian security forces have continued theirhuntfor the suspects and have demolished the Indian-administered Kashmir houses of at least five suspected rebels, including one they believe took part in the latest attack. Pieces of broken glass littered the site of one such house in Murram village in Pulwama district on Saturday. Locals said they had not seen Ehsan Ahmed Sheikh, a suspected fighter whose house was destroyed, in the past three years. “Nobody knows where he is,” neighbour Sameer Ahmed told Reuters. “Ehsan’s family have lost their home. They will suffer for this, not him.” But citing “interest of national security”, Indian authorities have declared a ban on live coverage of the large-scale military and security operations.",

    "article_text": "British environmental activist group Just Stop Oil has held itsfinal demonstrationin London, ending three years of high-profile climate protest stunts as they moved their focus away from civil disobedience. On Saturday, several hundred supporters walked peacefully through the centre of the UK capital, from parliament to the headquarters of oil and gas giant Shell, where they removed their familiar high-vis orange vests. The group mainly campaigned for the United Kingdom to end the extraction of oil and gas by 2030 and had become one of the country’s best-known protest organisations. In March, the group announced it would halt its headline-grabbing protests, arguing it had accomplished its initial aim of stopping the UK approving new oil and gas projects. More than 3,000 Just Stop Oil protesters have been arrested since it was founded in 2022 and 11 of them are currently in jail, including 58-year-old co-founder Roger Hallam. Five more are due to be sentenced in May. Stunts by its activists included targetingVincent van Gogh‘s Sunflowers painting with tomato soup and daubing the historical landmark Stonehenge with orange paint powder. They also disrupted theatre and sporting events, including tennis matches at Wimbledon. Over the years, the actions have drawn condemnation from politicians, police and some sections of the public. But the group claimed a victory after the UK Labour government halted new oil and gas exploration licences in the North Sea. Labour has distanced itself from Just Stop Oil, however. Prime Minister Keir Starmer criticised its actions and said protesters should face the full force of the law. Mel Carrington, a spokesperson for the protest group, said that while its actions had been “very effective to get press attention”, the re-election of climate change sceptic Donald Trump as US president had made their work more difficult. “The repression does make it more difficult to mobilise, and the external environment has changed,” she told the AFP news agency. Just Stop Oil has been coy about its future strategy, but has said it will “continue to tell the truth in the courts, speak out for our political prisoners and call out the UK’s oppressive anti-protest laws”. “In the background, we are working with other [similar] groups… to develop a strategy for what comes next,” said Carrington.",

    "title": "Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas appoints aide as PLO deputy",
    "article_text": "Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbashas appointed a close aideas vice president, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) said. Hussein al-Sheikh was named “deputy [vice president] of the PLO leadership,” Wasel Abu Yousef, a member of the PLO’s Executive Committee, said on Saturday. Abbas, 89, created the vice presidency position during the 32nd session of the Palestinian Central Council in Ramallah earlier this week. During the session, Abbas reaffirmed his commitment to initiating a “comprehensive national dialogue”, which aims to engage “all Palestinian factions to achieve reconciliation and reinforce national unity,” the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported. Abbas also informed the committee on “upcoming political efforts aimed at halting the ongoing Israeli aggression and war of genocide in the Gaza Strip”. These include ensuring the rapid entry of humanitarian and medical aid, full Palestinian governance over Gaza and pushing for a total Israeli withdrawal from the enclave as “a step towards launching a political process to end the occupation and realize an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital”, according to WAFA. The appointment follows years of international pressure to reform the PLO and comes as Arab and Western powers envision an expanded role for the Palestinian Authority (PA) in the Gaza Strip’s post-war governance. Founded in 1964, the PLO is tasked with negotiating and signing international treaties on the Palestinian people’s behalf, while the PA is responsible for governance in limited parts of the occupied Palestinian territory. The PLO is an umbrella organisation comprising several Palestinian factions, but not the Hamas and Islamic Jihad groups. Sheikh, 64, is a veteran leader of Abbas’s Fatah movement, which dominates the PA, and is considered close to the president. Marwan Bishara, Al Jazeera’s senior political analyst, said Sheikh’s role in the PA has included being “in charge of security coordination with the Israeli occupation”. Sheikh has been “groomed for the past 18 years in this relationship between Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian Authority and Israel”, Bishara added. “Israel knows and trusts him more than they know and trust Abbas himself. And Abbas, as we all know, has been the ultimate pragmatic/moderate leader within the Palestinian Authority, much to the liking of the United States and European Union, even if he’s not to the liking of [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu and his ilk.” Analyst Aref Jaffal said the new role was created to pave the way for someone to take the reins from Abbas, “as there are many things the Palestinian situation requires”. “The Palestinian political system is already miserable, so I believe that all these arrangements are a prelude to creating a successor to Abbas,” Jaffal, director of the Al-Marsad Election Monitoring Center, told AFP. The PLO Executive Committee is set to hold another meeting next Saturday to appoint a new secretary-general.",

    "title": "Russia says it has fully retaken Kursk, but Ukraine says fighting continues",
    "article_text": "Russia said its forces have completely recaptured the embattled Kursk region, eight months after Ukraine’s militarystormed into the Russian territoryin a surprise counteroffensive, but Ukrainian officials quickly rejected the claim. Russia’s military Chief of Staff Valery Gerasimov made the declaration during a video conference with President Vladimir Putin Saturday, saying Russian troops had “liberated” the last village in Kursk under Ukrainian control: Gornal. “The Kyiv regime’s adventure has completely failed,” Putin told Gerasimov. Ukraine’s military immediately disputed the claim, saying its soldiers are still operating in parts of Kursk. “Statements by the enemy leadership about the ‘defeat’ of the Ukrainian troops are nothing more than propaganda tricks,” said Ukraine’s chief of staff in a post on Telegram. However, he acknowledged Ukraine’s battlefield position in the territory – where Russian forces have madesteady gains in recent months– is “difficult”. Kyiv has sought to use its hold on land in Kursk as leverage in future peace talks with Russia, which has seized parts of eastern and southern Ukraine since Putin ordered the full-scale invasion in February 2022. Announcing the Russian advance, Gerasimov also paid tribute to North Korean troops fighting alongside Russians – the first official acknowledgement by Moscow of their role in the conflict. He praised the “heroism” of North Korean soldiers in Kursk, saying they “provided significant assistance in defeating the group of Ukrainian armed forces”. According to South Korean and Western intelligence agencies, more than 10,000 soldiers from North Korea were sent to Russia last year to help Moscow fight Ukraine’s forces there. Ukraine claims it hascaptured and interrogated several of the North Korean soldiersfighting in the territory. The claimed Russian recapture of Kursk came as Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy discussed efforts to reach a “full and unconditional ceasefire” with United States President Donald Trumpon the sidelines of Pope Francis’s funeralat the Vatican. The Kremlin on Saturday also said Putin is ready to “resume negotiations with Ukraine without any preconditions”. Russian troops are now at the border and are poised to beef up threats to the Ukrainian region of Sumy, where Moscow has carried out incursions in recent weeks.",

    "article_text": "Uganda has officially declared the end of its latestEbola outbreak, three months after the first cases emerged in the capital, Kampala. The Ministry of Health announced the milestone on Saturday via its official X account, calling it “good news” and confirming that 42 days had passed without new infections since the last patient was discharged. “During this outbreak, 14 cases, 12 confirmed and two not confirmed through laboratory tests [probable], were reported. Four deaths, two confirmed and two probable, occurred. Ten people recovered from the infection,” The World Health Organization (WHO) said in a statement. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus applauded the Ugandan Health Ministry for its “leadership and commitment” in overcoming the outbreak. “Congratulations to the government and health workers of #Uganda on ending the #Ebola outbreak,” he said on X on Saturday. Ebola infections are frequent in Uganda which has many tropical forests that are natural reservoirs for the virus. The latest outbreak, caused by theSudan strainof the virus, was detected on January 30 this year when a male nurse contracted the virus and later died. The strain has no approved vaccine. It was Uganda’s ninth outbreak since the country recorded its first infection in 2000. Neighbouring theDemocratic Republic of the Congo– a country that has experienced more than a dozen outbreaks, including one from 2018 to 2020 which killed nearly 2,300 people – Uganda remains highly vulnerable to the spread of the disease. The latest outbreak began in Kampala, a bustling city of four million people and a key transit hub linking eastern DRC, Kenya, Rwanda and South Sudan. Health experts say Uganda has been able to leverage on its experience battling the disease over the years to bring them under control relatively quickly. Ebola is spread through contact with infected bodily fluids and tissues, with symptoms such as severe headache, muscle pain, vomiting blood and internal bleeding.",

    "title": "Thirteen killed, dozens under rubble as Israel bombs Gaza amid food crisis",
    "article_text": "At least 13 Palestinians have been killed since dawn and dozens of others buried under the rubble of a building destroyed in an Israeli air attack on Gaza City. Four victims, at least, were killed in a strike on a home in the city’s Sabra neighbourhood on Saturday, with the residents forced to dig the ground with their bare hands to reach people buried in the debris. Mahmoud Basal, spokesman for Gaza’s civil defence agency, said a lack of rescue equipment has prevented emergency workers from reaching those buried underneath the collapsed building bombed by Israel before dawn. “Our crews cannot reach them because of the lack of the necessary machinery,” he told the AFP news agency. Earlier this week, Israeli aircraft destroyed 40 engineering vehicles the civil defence teams were using to remove heavy debris during rescue operations. Israeli air raids also hit other parts of the Strip on Saturday, including al-Mawasi and Khan Younis, as the besieged territory faces impending mass starvation amid anongoing genocide. After 18 months of the Israeli military invasion that has killed more than 51,000 Palestinians, the situation in Gaza “is probably the worst” it has been, the United Nations warned. The UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) on Friday said the entire Strip, with a population of two million people, may be on thebrink of famineand aid kitchens are “expected to fully run out of food in the coming days”. Israel’s ongoing blockade has meant no food, fuel or medicine has entered Gaza for two months. For many Palestinians in Gaza, community kitchens were their only source of nutrition after Israeli forces destroyed almost all food production facilities. WFP has appealed to the international community to put pressure on Israel to lift the blockade, saying more than 116,000 metric tonnes of food assistance – enough to feed one million people for up to four months – are already positioned for delivery “as soon as borders reopen”. Reporting from Deir el-Balah on Saturday, Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum said the humanitarian crisis in the besieged territory “has reached a very unprecedented breaking point”. “Civilians are really struggling to cope with this crisis,” he said. Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA, said the crisis was “man-made”. Michael Fakhri, UN rapporteur on the right to food, said Israel is “executing this starvation campaign with no repercussions”. The World Health Organization said the situation was no different for medical supplies, with WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus pleading on X for the aid blockade to end. At least 2,062 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel resumed itsdeadly campaign against Hamason March 18, and more than 50,000 since October 7, 2023. Hamas’s attack on Israel killed 1,218 people, mostly civilians.",

    "article_text": "From some of the world’s most powerful leaders to those on society’s margins whom Pope Francis always made a point to minister to, hundreds of thousands of people gathered at the Vatican for thefuneral ritesfor the late pontiff. US President Donald Trump and some60 other headsof state and reigning sovereigns travelled to Rome from around the globe. The Vatican said “a group of the poor and the needy” would be on the steps of Saint Mary Major Basilica topay homageto the first Jesuit and first Latin American pope before his burial in the church. The Holy See media office added that the poor had a special place in Francis’s heart. He had chosen for his papacy the name of the medieval Italian saint who famously renounced his family’s wealth when he joined the church. Already, long lines of the faithful have paid their homage to Francis, who died on Monday at age 88, over the three days that his body was lying in state in a simple wooden coffin inside Saint Peter’s Basilica. From the beginning of his papacy in 2013, Francis won over many around the world, Catholic or not, with his advocacy for migrants and the environment. His legacy was more mixed on the topics of clergy sexual abuse and LGBTQ+ outreach, which made waves for increasing inclusion but was criticised by some for not going far enough.",

    "title": "Pope Francis laid to rest after tens of thousands attend Vatican funeral",
    "article_text": "Pope Francis has beenlaid to restin Rome following solemn, hours-long funeral rites at St Peter’s Square in the Vatican, bringing to a close his sometimes turbulent 12-year leadership of the world’s 1.4 billion Catholics. TheArgentinian pontiff, who died earlier this week from a stroke and cardiac arrest at the age of 88, was buried on Saturday at the Basilica of St Mary Major in the Italian capital. As sunny skies greeted crowds of well-wishers in Rome, tens of thousandspacked the squareto attend the ceremony, officiated by Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, with many queueing from the early hours outside the square. Security around the Vatican was unprecedented, with Italian authorities deploying more than 2,500 police officers and 1,500 soldiers, closing the airspace above Vatican City, and stationing a torpedo ship off the coast, Italian media reported. Applause and cheers rang out as Francis’s wooden coffin, inlaid with a large cross, was carried by 14 white-gloved pallbearers through the main doors of St Peter’s Basilica to the outdoor funeral service. Among the mourners were royals and global leaders, includingUnited States President Donald Trump, who had frequently clashed with Francis over their sharply contrasting views on immigration. French President Emmanuel Macron, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, European Union leaders, the United Kingdom’s Prince William, and members of the Spanish royal family were also in attendance. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who had initially said he could not attend due to new Russian attacks, was present after all. According to reports, he held a meeting with Trump before the ceremony – their first face-to-face encounter since a heated Oval Office clash in February. Al Jazeera understands that a second meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy is expected after the service. Former US President Joe Biden also attended, alongside other world leaders including Argentina’s President Javier Milei, Brazil’s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, and Lebanon’s General Joseph Aoun. As world leaders watched from the sidelines, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re delivered a moving funeral homily, describing Francis as a relentless advocate for peace and human dignity. “Faced with the raging wars of recent years, with their inhuman horrors and countless deaths and destruction, Pope Francis incessantly raised his voice imploring peace and calling for reason and honest negotiation to find possible solutions,” Battista Re said. He also praised Francis’s landmark papal letter on climate change and highlighted his many visits to places like Lampedusa and Lesbos, where the pope met migrants and refugees in detention camps. “His gestures and exhortations in favour of refugees and displaced people are countless,” Battista Re told the crowd. He eulogised Francis as “a pope among the people, with an open heart towards everyone”, known for his informal, spontaneous style and his ability to reach “the least among us”. Reporting from the Vatican, Al Jazeera’s Jonah Hull called it an “utterly beautiful service” that was “very well received by the enormous crowd”, noting how spontaneous applause broke out during the historic moment. Following the service, Francis’s coffin made a 4km (2.5-mile) journey through the centre of Rome. According to the Vatican, 150,00 lined up the route of the motorcade to watch the pope’s motorcade. His burial at St Mary Major Basilica – rather than St Peter’s – was a deeply personal decision made by Francis himself in his last will, Hull reported. “It has a deep personal significance to Pope Francis and the Jesuit faith, which he was part of,” Hull said. Earlier this week, more than 250,000 people stood in line – some for hours – to pay their final respects while Francis’s body lay in state at St Peter’s Basilica. The Vatican kept its doors open overnight to accommodate the crowds. His final resting place, a plain tomb in a historic Roman church that has not held papal remains in centuries, reflects the humility and independence that defined Francis’s papacy. After the funeral, a group of 40 people – including migrants, homeless individuals, prisoners, and transgender people – greeted the late pope’s coffin with white roses on the steps ofSt Mary Major Basilica. Al Jazeera’s Natacha Butler, reporting live from the Vatican, reflected on the moving nature of Francis’s final journey: “In many ways, it’s symbolic that he is leaving behind the heads of state, royalty, world leaders, and he’s coming here to a common neighbourhood in the heart of Rome – this is where he wants to be, close to the people, among the people.”",

    "title": "USAID and the pacification industry in Palestine",
    "article_text": "The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) opened its office in Palestine back in 1994. Its website, which is no longer available, used to boast that since then, it has “helped four million Palestinians lead healthier and more productive lives”. Now that the agency has been shuttered by US President Donald Trump’s administration, it is pertinent to evaluate the claim that USAID was a force for good in the occupied Palestinian territories. Undoubtedly, the shutdown of the agency has affected Palestinians, especially those benefitting from its funding for education and healthcare institutions. Humanitarian provision was also affected, with the World Food Programme, one of the main humanitarian actors in the occupied Palestinian territories, facing majordisruptions. While the short-term negative impact is apparent, the utility of USAID and other US funding becomes questionable when put in the larger political context of the Israeli occupation of Palestine. As a researcher, I have been directly and indirectly involved in assessing USAID-funded programmes for years, and I have seen first-hand how they have contributed to maintaining Israeli occupation and colonisation. The US agency was far from “helping” Palestinians lead better lives, as it claimed. USAID opened its West Bank and Gaza Strip office as part of the broader American effort to lead and shape the political settlement between Palestinians and Israelis initiated by theOslo Accordsof 1994. The so-called “peace process” promised Palestinians an independent state on the lands occupied by Israel in 1967, with a final agreement supposed to be signed by 1999. Needless to say, such an agreement was never signed, as Israel never intended to conclude peace with the Palestinians and recognise their right to self-determination. Instead, Oslo was used to cover up Israel’s relentless colonisation of the occupied Palestinian territories in the rhetoric of peace negotiations. The creation of the Palestinian Authority (PA) as a local governing body tasked with managing civil affairs for Palestinians in designated areas was part of this strategy. While the official Palestinian leadership envisioned the PA as a transitional polity that would administer daily life until an independent state was established, it was ultimatelydesignedand closely overseen by the US to function as a client regime, managing and controlling the occupied population. To that end, the PA was obliged to engage in close coordination with Israeli security forces to suppress any form of resistance in the territories it managed. Its two main security bodies – the Intelligence Service and the Preventive Security – were set up to fulfil this duty. While US intelligence agencies were tasked with supporting and training the Palestinian security apparatus – funnelling millions of dollars to it every year – USAID was tasked with supporting the civilian functions of the PA. Between 1994 and 2018, USAID provided more than$5.2bnin aid to Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. It funded infrastructure, health, and education initiatives, with the aim of winning public support for the peace negotiations. A portion of its funding was funnelled through civil society organisations with two primary objectives: to depoliticise the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and to cultivate a network of civil society actors who would promote this agenda. The depoliticisation framework treated the Palestinian issue as an economic andhumanitarian matter. This approach addressed Palestinian economic and social problems in isolation — detached from their primary cause: Israeli occupation. It also sought to delegitimise Palestinian resistance by portraying it as a source of instability and chaos rather than a political response to occupation. To distribute its funding, USAID established a complex system of background checks, alongside an Orwellian set of conditions. The vetting extended beyond the individual to their extended family, the name of the place, and even the cultural context in which the funds would be used — none of which could be associated with resistance. In this context, it is hardly surprising that USAID programmes often failed to improve the lives of ordinary Palestinians. A lot of USAID funding went into initiatives that sought to normalise Israeli colonisation by seeking to establish connections between Palestinians and Israelis. The premise was that the two people “can learn to live together”, which of course completely ignored the realities of apartheid and occupation. One of the USAID-funded programmes I assessed was the Conflict Management and Mitigation (CMM) Program, promoted under USAID’sPeople-to-People Partnershipframework. By 2018, CMM had allocated over $230m to different initiatives and was set to distribute another $250m by 2026. The programme included projects targeting bereaved parents, farmers, and students to promote peacebuilding. One such project sought to foster cooperation between Palestinian and Israeli farmers through shared farming experiences. During one focus group discussion, I spoke to a Palestinian farmer who explained that Palestinian olive oil production has been stagnating due to the Israeli occupation regime that restricted Palestinian farmers’ access to water and, in some cases, to their land. “These programmes,” he said, “don’t talk about these issues.” When I asked why he participated, he explained that the project enabled him to obtain an Israeli travel permit — allowing him to work on Israeli farms and earn an income to survive. The absurdity of this dynamic was striking: on paper, the programme spoke of fostering productive relationships between Palestinians and Israelis, building a shared, peaceful future where farmers become friends. In reality, however, Palestinian farmers signed so they could a travel permit and work on Israeli farms — many of which were established on confiscated Palestinian land. Participation in the programme did not resolve any of the problems the Palestinian farmers faced in olive farming – i.e., Israeli occupation policies. Another USAID-funded programme I studied, Seeds of Peace, had the mission to bring together young people from conflict regions who had the potential to become future leaders in their countries. The programme’s central activity was a youth summer camp in an affluent area in the US state of Maine, where participants engaged in dialogue and leadership training. The two largest participant groups were Israelis and Palestinians. While the Israeli Ministry of Education was responsible for selecting Israeli participants, the Seeds of Peace office in Ramallah oversaw the recruitment of Palestinian participants. Each participant benefitted from a heavily subsidised programme, withcostsreaching up to $8,000 per person. A closer look at participant lists over the years revealed a striking pattern: the sons and daughters of PA leaders and affluent families frequently appeared. Curious about this pattern, I once asked a programme officer about it. The response was revealing: “In Palestinian society, leadership often passes to the children of high-ranking officials.” This meant that the organisation’s —and by extension, the US’s – vision of political leadership in Palestine assumed that power in Palestinian politics is hereditary and therefore, US initiatives should focus on the sons and daughters of the current elite. Seeds of Peace was by far not the only programme that served to support PA cadres and their families. Some relatives of high-ranking officials have received preferential treatment in securing lucrative USAID contracts; others have led nonprofit organisations funded by the agency. USAID has also been involved indirectly in the political scene in Palestine by supporting political actors favoured by Washington. Between 2004 and 2006, it implemented an expansive democracy promotion programme in the Palestinian territories in the lead-up to the 2006 legislative elections. While there is no direct evidence of financial support for specific candidates or party lists, observers have noted that civil society organisations (CSOs) linked to Fatah or the Third Way candidates were recipients of USAID funding. In some cases, this support was channeled through organisations operating in unrelated sectors. Despite substantial funding and political support, these groups failed to secure enough seats to prevent Hamas’s electoral victory. After Hamas took control of Gaza, USAID continued supporting Palestinian CSOs, in some cases dramatically increasing their funding. USAID alsosupportedthepolice forceunder the PA through rule of law programmes, although the bulk of funding for the PA’s repressive security apparatus has come through the CIA and the International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE) of the US Department of State. A more recent and stark example of problematic USAID involvement is themalfunctioningpier constructed by the US military in 2024 to facilitate aid delivery into Gaza, at a cost of $230m. The project was promoted as a humanitarian initiative and USAID was one of the organisations tasked with distributing the trickle of aid that came through it. In reality, the pier served as a public relations stunt by the administration of former US President Joe Biden to obscure US complicity in Israel’s blockade of Gaza. It was also used by the Israeli military in an operation that resulted in the killing of more than 200 Palestinians, raising serious questions about the militarisation and misuse of aid infrastructure. The pier farce is a good illustration of the US approach to providing aid to the Palestinians: it was never done in their best interest. It is true that some impoverished Palestinians may be affected by the shutdown of USAID operations in the West Bank and Gaza. However, it is unlikely to decisively alter the situation on the ground. The cutoff of aid will have a more dramatic impact on the US strategy of leveraging Palestinian civil society organisations to promote a pacification agenda and perpetuate empty rhetoric about peace. In this regard, the shuttering of USAID could give an opportunity for the Palestinian civil society to reconsider its engagement with US government donors in light of its moral obligations to the Palestinian people. Millions poured into pacification clearly did not work; it is time for a new approach that actually serves the interests of the Palestinians.

    "title": "Trump, Zelenskyy hold ‘productive’ meeting at the Vatican",
    "article_text": "United States President Donald Trump and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy had a “very productive” meeting in the Vatican, a White House official said – their first since atense Oval Office meetingin February this year. The two leaders, leaning in close to each other while seated in St Peter’s Basilica, spoke for about 15 minutes on Saturday, according to Zelenskyy’s office, and images of the meeting released by Kyiv and Washington. “President Trump and President Zelenskyy met privately today and had a very productive discussion. More details about the meeting will follow,” White House communications director Steven Cheung said. Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, described the 15-minute meeting as “constructive”, but did not give more details. The two leaders were in the Vatican to attend the funeral of Pope Francis. Their meeting came as US efforts to negotiate an end to theUkraine-Russia conflictface increasing challenges. After the funeral service, Trump boarded Air Force One and departed Rome. While in the air he published a social media post in which he took a tough tone on Russian President Vladimir Putin. “There was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days,” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform. Twelve people were killed on Thursday when a missile fired by Russia hit a Kyiv apartment block. “It makes me think that maybe he doesn’t want to stop the war, he’s just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through ‘Banking’ or ‘Secondary Sanctions?’ Too many people are dying!!!” Trump wrote. The post was a departure from Trump’s usual rhetoric which has seen the toughest criticism directed at Zelenskyy, while he has often spoken positively about Putin. In a post on social media platform Telegram, Zelenskyy wrote: “Good meeting. One-on-one, we managed to discuss a lot. We hope for a result from all the things that were spoken about.” He said those topics included: “The protection of the lives of our people. A complete and unconditional ceasefire. A reliable and lasting peace that will prevent a recurrence of war.” Zelenskyy added: “It was a very symbolic meeting that has the potential to become historic if we achieve joint results. Thank you, President Donald Trump!” Zelenskyy’s office released photos of the meeting, offering a rare glimpse into the private talks. In one photograph, the two leaders sat opposite each other in a grand marble hall, leaning in closely as they conversed. No aides appeared alongside them. Another image from the same setting shows the Ukrainian president standing in a tight circle with the US president, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron. Tensions betweenTrump and Zelenskyywere on full display during their last meeting when the Ukrainian president faced criticism from Trump and Vice President J D Vance over what they saw as a lack of gratitude for American support. A US reporter also accused Zelenskyy of disrespect for not wearing a suit. Trump, who has pushed both Moscow and Kyiv towards a ceasefire, said on Friday that talks between his envoy and Russian officials had been “productive,” urging a direct meeting between the two sides to finalise an agreement. However,divisions have emergedbetween Washington’s proposals and the positions of Kyiv and its European allies. One major sticking point is a US proposal for legal recognition of Crimea as Russian territory, a move Ukraine and European nations strongly oppose. Disputes also remain over the timing of sanctions relief for Moscow, the nature of security guarantees for Ukraine and how Kyiv would be compensated financially.",

    "title": "Iran ‘extremely cautious’ about success of nuclear talks with the US",
    "article_text": "Iran and the United States have agreed to continue nuclear talks next week, both sides said, as Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said he was “extremely cautious” about the potential success of the negotiations aimed at resolving a decades-long nuclear standoff. US President Donald Trump has signalled confidence in clinching a new pact with the Islamic republic that would block Tehran’s path to a nuclear bomb. On Saturday, Araghchi and Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff held athird round of indirect talksin Oman’s capital Muscat through Omani mediators for about six hours, a week after a second round in Rome that both sides described as constructive. “The negotiations are extremely serious and technical … there are still differences, both on major issues and on details,” Araghchi told Iranian state TV. “There is seriousness and determination on both sides … However, our optimism about success of the talks remains extremely cautious.” A senior US administration official described the talks as positive and productive, adding that both sides agreed to meet again in Europe “soon”. “There is still much to do, but further progress was made on getting to a deal,” the official added. Earlier, Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi had said talks would continue next week, with another “high-level meeting” provisionally scheduled for May 3. Araghchi said Oman would announce the venue. Speaking earlier on board Air Force One, en route to Rome for the funeral of Pope Francis, Trump also expressed cautious optimism. “The Iran situation is coming out very well,” he said. “We have had a lot of talks with them and I think we are going to have a deal. I would much rather have a deal than the other alternative. That would be good for humanity.” But Trump alsorepeated threatsstressing that military options remained on the table if diplomacy failed, saying: “There are some people that want to make a different kind of a deal – a much nastier deal – and I don’t want that to happen to Iran if we can avoid it.” An Iranian official, briefed about the talks, told the Reuters news agency earlier that the expert-level negotiations were “difficult, complicated and serious”. The only aim of these talks, Araghchi said, was “to build confidence about the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief”. Meanwhile, the Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson told state TV that the country’sdefence and missile programmeswere not being discussed during the negotiations in Oman. “The question of defence capacities and the country’s missiles is not [on the agenda] and has not been raised in the indirect talks with the United States,” Esmaeil Baghaei said on Saturday. Tensions have remained high since Trump withdrew from Tehran’s 2015 nuclear agreement with world powers in 2018, prompting a series of escalations. Iran has since abandoned all limits on its nuclear programme, and enriches uranium to up to 60 percent purity – near weapons-grade levels of 90 percent. Western countries, including the US, have long accused Iran of seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, an allegation Tehran has consistently denied, insisting that its programme is for peaceful civilian purposes. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said earlier this week Iran would have to entirely stop enriching uranium under a deal, and import any enriched uranium it needed to fuel its sole functioning atomic energy plant, Bushehr. Tehran is willing to negotiate some curbs on its nuclear work in return for the lifting of sanctions, according to Iranian officials, but ending its enrichment programme or surrendering its enriched uranium stockpile are among “Iran’s red lines that could not be compromised” in the talks.

    "title": "Have scientists discovered a new colour called ‘olo’?",
    "article_text": "A team of scientists claims to have discovered a new colour that humans cannot see without the help of technology. The researchers based in the United States said they were able to “experience” the colour, which they named “olo”, by firing laser pulses into their eyes using a device named after the Wizard of Oz. Olo cannot be seen with the naked eye, but the five people who have seen it describe it as being similar to teal. Professors from the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Washington School of Medicine published an article in the journal, Science Advances, on April 18 in which they put forth their discovery of a hue beyond the gamut of human vision. They explained that they had devised a technique called Oz, which can “trick” the human eye into seeing olo. The technique is named after the Wizard of Oz. In the Wonderful Wizard of Oz, published in 1900, Frank Baum wrote about a man who uses tricks to fool the residents of the fictional land of Oz into thinking he’s a wizard. For instance, it is believed that the Emerald City, the capital of Oz, is so bright and vibrant that visitors have to wear special glasses to protect their eyes. The glasses are one of the wizard’s tricks, since they make the city appear greener and grander. The human eye perceives colour via three types of photoreceptor or “cone cells” in the retina. S cones pick up shorter, blue wavelengths of light; M cones detect medium, green wavelengths; and L cones detect longer, red wavelengths. “The signals from these cones are then sent through a complex series of cells in the retina that act to clean up and integrate the signal before passing it down the optic nerve through parts of the brain,” Francis Windram, a research associate at the department of life sciences at Imperial College London, told Al Jazeera. The part of the brain that the visual information is passed to is the visual cortex. In normal vision, the function of M cones overlaps with the neighbouring S and L cones, so any light that stimulates M cones also activates the other two cones. The M cones don’t function alone. “There’s no wavelength in the world that can stimulate only the M cone,” Ren Ng, a professor of electrical engineering and computer sciences at UC Berkeley, explained in an article published on its website. “I began wondering what it would look like if you could just stimulate all the M cone cells. Would it be like the greenest green you’ve ever seen?” So Ng teamed up with Austin Roorda, one of the creators of the Oz technology and a professor of optometry and vision science at UC Berkeley. Oz, which Roorda described as “a microscope for looking at the retina”, uses tiny microdoses of laser light to target individual photoreceptors in the eye. The equipment, which must be highly stabilised during use, is already being used to study eye disease. The work using Oz began in 2018 by James Carl Fong, a doctoral student in electrical engineering and computer sciences at UC Berkeley. Hannah Doyle, another doctoral student at Berkeley, ran the experiments through which human subjects were able to see the new colour, olo. The shade of olo has always existed, it just falls beyond the spectrum of shades visible to the human eye. There are other such shades that we cannot see. Hence, olo is not a new colour that has come into existence, from a physical or scientific perspective. However, “from a sociolinguistic perspective, if people give new names to colours which previously were indistinguishable thanks to this technology, then maybe! It all depends on how you say it,” Windram said. Five people have seen the “new” colour – four men and one woman. All had normal colour vision. Three of the subjects, including Roorda and Ng, are the co-authors of the research paper while the other two are members of the participating lab at the University of Washington and were unaware of the purpose of the study before they took part. Those who have seen olo describe it as a teal or green-blue colour – but one they had never seen before. In the article by UC Berkeley, it is described as a “blue-green colour of unparalleled saturation”. “It was like a profoundly saturated teal … the most saturated natural colour was just pale by comparison,” Roorda said. “I wasn’t a subject for this paper, but I’ve seen olo since, and it’s very striking. You know you’re looking at something very blue-green,” Doyle said. The researchers said an image of a teal square is the closest colour match to olo. However, this square is not an olo-coloured square. The naked human eye simply cannot see the shade. “We’re not going to see olo on any smartphone displays or any TVs any time soon. And this is very, very far beyond VR headset technology,” Ng said, according to a report in the UK’s Guardian newspaper. What if some colors are invisible not because they’re rare, but because we physically can’t see them? UC Berkeley scientists discovered Olo – a hue that can’t be rendered, only experienced. Olo may never join the Pantone Color System… or will it?https://t.co/sBRGVhw85gpic.twitter.com/rxmbutd7y2 — PANTONE (@pantone)April 23, 2025 Berkeley researchers are exploring whether the Oz technology could help people with colour blindness. Windram said success would depend on the cause of colourblindness in individuals. Deuteranomaly, which causes decreased sensitivity to green light, is the most common form of colour blindness. “In this case, a miniaturised version of this technology could theoretically be used to correct this by directly stimulating the cones when the correct colour of light hits them,” Windram said. Windram pointed out that publicity materials for the research show images of the Oz experiment on a highly stabilised table. “This would require a lot of work to miniaturise the technology, and is likely a long way off. Given that the laser must stably hit the correct cones in order to stimulate them, this may not really be feasible as a form of vision correction technologically,” he said. The concept of a colour has three main components, Windram explained: The physical, which has to do with the wavelengths of light that meet the eye; the neurological, which refers to how humans biologically process these light signals; and the societal or linguistic component, which pertains to how colours are named. “In the end I may see a colour and call it ‘red’, someone else may call it ‘rot’ or ‘rouge’ … but also another may look at it a bit more closely and say ‘well it’s claret’ or ‘crimson’.” To test this, neuroscience and AI researcher Patrick Mineault developed awebsitefor entertainment purposes in September 2024, on which users can take a test to see how their colour perception compares to others. Humans can also perceive colour differently due to differences in factors such as “temperature” of light. This was demonstrated when a photo of a dress went viral in 2015, dividing social media users over whether the dress was white and gold, or blue and black. Windram explained that people who were deciding what colours the dress was were drawing on preconceived notions of whether the photograph of the dress was taken in warm lighting or cool lighting. Yes, different species can experience colours differently. For example, humans process three wavelengths corresponding to red, blue and green light, while the mantis shrimp, a tiny crustacean, can visually perceive 12 channels of colour instead of three. An article by the Australian Academy of Science explains that the mantis shrimp can also detect ultraviolet and polarised light, which humans cannot see. However, while the human eye can mix two colours and perceive an in-between shade – such as purple as a mix of red and blue – the mantis shrimp’s eyes cannot mix colour receptors. Meanwhile, dogs only have two types of cones and can mostly only see shades of yellow and blue.",

    "title": "Powerful explosion at Iran port kills at least 14 people and injures 750",
    "article_text": "At least 14 people have been killled and 750 others were injured after a powerful explosion and fire at Iran’s largest commercial, state news agency IRNA reported. Helicopters dumped water on the raging fire hours after the initial explosion on Saturday at the Shahid Rajaei port, located more than 1,000km (620 miles) south of the capital, Tehran. Hossein Zafari, a spokesperson for Iran’s crisis management organisation, appeared to blame the explosion on poor storage of chemicals in containers at Shahid Rajaei. “The cause of the explosion was the chemicals inside the containers,” he told Iran’s ILNA news agency. “Previously, the director general of crisis management had given warnings to this port during their visits and had pointed out the possibility of danger,” Zafari said. However, an Iranian government spokesperson said that although chemicals had likely caused the blast, it was not yet possible to determine the exact reason. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian ordered an investigation of the incident and sent to the site his interior minister, who said efforts were continuing to extinguish the fire and prevent it from spreading to other areas. About 10 hours after the blast at Shahid Rajaei Port in southern Iran, Press TV reported the fire had intensified. With choking smoke spreading throughout the area, schools and offices 23km (14 miles) away in Bandar Abbas, the Hormozgan provincial capital, have been ordered closed on Sunday, Press TV said, to allow authorities to focus on the emergency effort. National Iranian Oil Products Refining and Distribution Company issued a statement saying oil facilities in the area were not affected by the blast. “The explosion and fire in Shahid Rajaei Port have no connection to refineries, fuel tanks, distribution complexes and oil pipelines related to this company,” the company said. Earlier, Hormozgan Ports and Maritime Administration official Esmaeil Malekizadeh said the explosion took place near the Shahid Rajaei port dock. Social media videos showed a huge plume of black smoke and a ball of fire rising from the area of the explosion. Other videos showed damage to buildings and vehicles. Several people were also seen around the area attending to the injured and checking the damage to the properties. Shahid Rajaei port mainly handles container traffic and also has oil tanks and other petrochemical facilities. In May 2020, Israel was accused of launchinga major cyberattackon the same port, causing transport chaos for days after crashing the facility’s computer system. The blast comes at a sensitive time as Iranian officials continue toengage in talkswith United States officials on a possible new nuclear deal.",

    "title": "At least 11 killed in suspected RSF drone attack on Sudan displacement camp",
    "article_text": "A suspected drone attack by Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary has killed at least 11 people at a displacement camp in River Nile state, authorities said. In a statement late on Friday, the local governor said the attack knocked out a nearby power station for the fourth time since the war between the RSF and the Sudanese army began two years ago. The attack marks a deadly escalation in the ongoing conflict, with a further 23 people injured, a medical official said. Witnesses said at least nine children were among the wounded. “My son, my cousin, my daughter’s husband and two children, my cousin’s children are dead. The boy is 10 years old and the girl is about two years old,” witness Haleema told Al Jazeera. Over the past months, the RSF has been accused of attacking power infrastructure in Sudanese army-controlled areas across central and northern Sudan. The RSF, led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, denies carrying out drone attacks. Friday’s attack hit a makeshift camp roughly 3km (2 miles) from the Atbara power station outside the town of al-Damer. The camp housed about 180 families who had fled fighting in the capital, Khartoum, and were living in abandoned buildings and tents with minimal humanitarian assistance. “The first drone attack came and landed right behind us,” said Mawaheb Mohamed, another survivor of the attack. “Fifteen minutes later, another one came – four in total. He decided to leave because the scene was very difficult, there were corpses, people had been dismembered, and people in the hospital.” Following the attack, authorities were seen hosing down the smouldering remains of tents and belongings, as residents boarded buses headed to an unknown location. The escalation came amid a wider collapse of Sudan’s power grid, with drone and missile attacks plunging millions into weeks-long blackouts, further worsening the humanitarian crisis in a country devastated by civil war. Sudan descended into violence in April 2023 when tensions between the Sudanese army, led by Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the RSF erupted into open conflict. Al-Burhan has been celebrating recent gains made by the military, including in Khartoum, while ground fighting is currently concentrated in theDarfur region, where the RSF is battling to eliminate remaining army positions, forcing hundreds of thousands to flee. The conflict has triggered one of the world’s largest displacement crises. According to the United Nations, more than 12.4 million people have been uprooted from their homes, including 3.3 million who have fled to neighbouring countries.",

    "title": "DR Congo, Rwanda agree to draft peace deal by May 2",
    "article_text": "Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) have agreed to draft a peace deal by May 2, committing to respect each other’s sovereignty and refraining from providing military support to armed groups. DRC Foreign Minister Therese Kayikwamba Wagner and her Rwandan counterpart Olivier Nduhungirehe signed the agreement in a tense meeting in Washington, DC, on Friday, in which the two did not shake hands. The deal, part of diplomatic efforts to end the violence in eastern DRC, came two days after Qatar brokered anunexpected trucebetween the African nations. The United States brought the two countries’ foreign ministers together and voiced an interest in investment in the DRC’s turbulent but mineral-rich east, where fighting between DRC forces and M23 rebels hasintensified since January. The M23 has captured key cities in the east in a campaign that has left thousands dead. The US and the United Nations experts say M23 is backed by Rwanda, which has repeatedly denied the charge, saying it is defending its security against hostile militias operating in DRC, including remnants of the Hutu-led group behind the 1994 genocide. Friday’s joint declaration, signed in front of US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, pledged the two sides would halt military support to non-state armed groups, though it avoided naming M23 directly. Wagner later said the deal amounted to a commitment for Rwandan forces to withdraw, as outlined in a UN Security Council resolution. “The good news is there is hope for peace. The real news – peace must be earned, and it will require seriousness, transparency and sincerity,” she said. Nduhungirehe said US President Donald Trump had made a “real change in the conversation” on DRC, including by drawing a link to efforts to expand US private-sector investment. Rubio described the agreement as a “win-win”, suggesting it could unlock major US-backed investment in energy and mining – areas where China already has significant influence. A new US envoy to Africa, Massad Boulos, recently visited both nations and urged Kigali to stop backing M23 and pull out troops. Since 2021, the two sides have agreed to at least six truces that later collapsed. The latest bout of violence since Januaryhas killed thousandsand raised fears of a wider regional war. Analyst Martin Ziakwau Lembisa believes the US pressure pushed both governments towards diplomacy. “If it were up to the M23, they would have advanced further,” he told AFP news agency. “But how far the Americans will really get involved is the whole question.”",

    "article_text": "Soldiers in Indian-administered Kashmir have demolished the homes of two men suspected of carrying out the disputed region’sdeadliest attackagainst civilians in nearly two decades. Police say the attackers are members of The Resistance Front (TRF), a faction of Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). Pakistan rejects the allegation. Meanwhile, Indian security forces have launched a huge manhunt for those responsible for killing 26 menin Pahalgamon Tuesday. Authorities have released wanted posters with sketches of three suspects: Adil Hussain Thokar, a suspected Kashmiri rebel, and two Pakistani citizens identified as Ali Bhai and Hashim Musa. They are also searching for Ashif Sheikh, another suspected rebel. The family members of the two suspected rebels were also detained for questioning after the attack, a police officer and their relatives said. Sheikh’s sister Yasmeena said soldiers cordoned off the area around their house in Kashmir’s southern Tral area late on Thursday night. “One soldier climbed over the mud compound wall of our home,” said Yasmeena, who gave only one name. “After some time, a big, frightening blast brought the house down. Everything inside was destroyed,” she said, adding that no one was inside the home at the time. A police officer said soldiers also destroyed Thokar’s family home in neighbouring Bijbehara area in the same manner early on Friday. “Both [suspected rebels] have been active for three to four years, and are part of TRF, which is an offshoot of LeT,” the officer told AFP news agency on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the media. “They are wanted militants [rebels] involved in earlier attacks as well on security forces,” the officer added. Police have also offered a two million rupee ($23,500) bounty for information leading to each man’s arrest.",

Some people waited overnight to be first in the queue forthe ceremony, which will be attended byworld leaders. The Argentinian pontiff, whodied on Mondayaged 88, sought to steer the centuries-old church into a more inclusive direction during his 12-year papacy. Some 250,000 people paid their respects before his coffin during its three days of lying in state at St Peter’s Basilica, and huge numbers gathered from dawn on Friday to attend his final send-off. “He was not just the pope, he was what the definition of being human is,” said Andrea Ugalde, 39, who flew from Los Angeles to attend Saturday’s mass. Italian and Vatican authorities have mounted a major security operation for the ceremony, with more than 50 heads of state on the guest list. A no-fly zone is in place, fighter jets are on standby and snipers will be positioned on roofs surrounding the tiny city-state. “We spent the whole night here in the car with the children,” said Peruvian Gabriela Lazo, 41. “We are very sorry for what happened to him because we hold a South American pope in our hearts.” The funeral sets off the first of nine days of official Vatican mourning for Francis, who took over following the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI in 2013. After the mourning, cardinals will gather for the conclave to elect a new pope to lead the world’s 1.4 billion Catholics.",

    "title": "Epstein, Prince Andrew accuser Virginia Giuffre dies by suicide: Family",
    "article_text": "Virginia Giuffre – who accused Jeffrey Epstein andPrince Andrew of sexual abuse– has died by suicide at the age of 41, her family has said. Giuffre was one of the most prominent victims of convicted sex offenders Epstein and his former partner, Ghislaine Maxwell. She claimed they trafficked her to the Duke of York when she was 17 – an allegation Prince Andrew has consistently denied. Her family said she died on Friday in Western Australia, where she had been living for several years. “Virginia was a fierce warrior in the fight against sexual abuse and sex trafficking. She was the light that lifted so many survivors,” the family said in a statement. “Despite all the adversity she faced in her life, she shone so bright. She will be missed beyond measure.” Police in Western Australia said they were called to a property in Neergabby – a rural area on the outskirts of Perth – late on Friday. They confirmed the death of a 41-year-old woman, who was not named, and said attempts to revive her were unsuccessful. No foul play is suspected. Giuffre, who was born in the United States, had been living with her husband Robert and their children in the suburb of North Perth. However, recent reports suggested the couple had separated after 22 years of marriage. Three weeks ago, Giuffre posted on Instagram saying she had been seriously injured in a car accident. Her family later said she had not intended for the post to become public, while local police disputed the severity of the incident. Court documents released in 2019 suggest Giuffre met Ghislaine Maxwell in the early 2000s while allegedly working as a spa attendant at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Between 2000 and 2002, she spent time with Epstein and Maxwell – travelling between Epstein’s homes in Palm Beach and Manhattan – and making visits to his ranch in New Mexico and private island, Little Saint James. Around this time, Giuffre allegedly met Prince Andrew. In March 2001, the now-infamous photo was taken of her standing next to Andrew, with his arm around her bare midriff, in Maxwell’s London townhouse. Giuffre was among the earliest voices calling forEpstein’s criminal prosecution. He was eventually charged with sex trafficking in July 2019, and authorities say he died by suicide weeks later in his New York prison cell. Ghislaine Maxwell was found guilty of aiding Epstein’s abuse of teenage girls and is currently serving a 20-year sentence at a Florida prison. In 2022, Giuffre settled a civil lawsuit against Prince Andrew, reportedly worth $12m, without any admission of liability from the prince, who has consistently denied the allegations. US President Donald Trump pledged to release all documents relating to Epstein’s case, including names of powerful associates. The first batch of files was made public in February but contained no major revelations. Trump, himself, has been named as an associate of Epstein. Following her public accusations, Giuffre became a prominent campaigner and a central voice in the Me Too movement.",

Not to mention some sci-fi retro-cool imagery of the inside of a Weyland-Yutani ship. byWes Davis It’s been a busy week forAlien: Earth’s marketing team, having released three new teasers over the last few days. The longest of them — titled “Gestation Complete” — spends two whole minutes on the gestation and birth of an alien creature. Another, “Crate,” gives hints that Earth could be facing more than just a xenomorph, the franchise’s shiny, acid-spitting ancient aliens. Both teasers were released today, following a goofynature documentary-themed Earth Day teaserearlier this week. “Gestation Complete” is worth sitting through if you were a fan of the look of the 1979Alienmovie that kicked off the franchise. After the creepy alien birth, you’re treated to shots of the inside of the Weyland-Yutani ship that’s carrying the alien, complete with the retro-future CRT-style displays and blinking buttons from the ship’s Mother’s chamber — the room housing the ship’s AI computer system interface. On one of the displays, an ominous message reads: “NEW SPECIES DETECTED.“ The other, shorter trailer hints at what else the series might have in store, with a narrator speaking over footage of shadowy aliens behind foggy yellow containment module windows: This ship collected five different life forms from the darkest corners of the universe. Each one, a unique, deadly species. Monsters. The ship in question is headed for a crash-landing on Earth.

    "title": "Here’s how you can prepare for the next round of Nintendo Switch 2 preorders",
    "article_text": "Nintendo’s latest console is sold out, though there are ways to set yourself up for future success. Nintendo’s latest console is sold out, though there are ways to set yourself up for future success. byBrandon Widder If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. Following abrief delaystemming from the Trump administration’s on-again, off-again tariff policy, Nintendo officially opened up preorders for the Nintendo Switch 2. As expected, the initial rollout process at Walmart, Best Buy, and other retailers on April 24thwas an absolute mess— and GameStopdidn’t fare much betterlater in the week. As of right now, none of the aforementioned retailers are accepting reservations for the $449 gaming console ahead of its release on June 5th. Nintendo is stillaccepting sign-upsfor those looking to secure a Switch 2, though, if you do go that route, be aware thatthere are strict requirements. Nintendo alsocan’t guarantee an inviteahead of launch due to “the very high demand” for the console. Surprising, I know. We don’t know when the next Switch 2 preorders will open up, at least at traditional US retailers. Additional preorder inventory has popped up intermittently at Walmart and GameStop in recent days; however, so far, none of the major retailers have announced when they will resume accepting preorders, if at all. That being said, if you’re trying to secure a Switch 2, we suggest keeping an eye on the retailers below and taking a few steps to ensure you’re set up for success if they re-open. At launch, the Nintendo Switch 2 will be available in two distinct configurations: a $449.99 standard version and a $499.99 bundle that includes the latestMario Karttitle,Mario Kart World. Nintendo ison record sayingthe bundle will only be available through fall 2025 (or while supplies last), which is a shame, considering picking up the console / game combo saves you $30 on what is easily the Switch 2’s biggest launch title. If you don’t manage to secure the bundle, you’ll have to pick upMario Kart Worldseparatelyfor a whopping $79. It’s also worth noting that prices could change down the line. Nintendorecently raised the priceof theSwitch 2 Joy-Consand theSwitch 2 Pro Controllerin response to tariffs, and has said that “other adjustments to the price of any Nintendo product are also possible in the future depending on market conditions.” The starting price of the Nintendo Switch 2 remains unchanged, but at this point, it feels like the only way to guarantee a console at $449.99 is to purchase one at launch. If the initial preorder launch of the Switch 2 is any indication, retailers are woefully under-equipped to handle the massive influx of interest in console preorders. Inventory for the Switch 2 seems to be limited despite the fact Nintendo supposedly had time tobuild up an inventoryof the next-gen system “on a global basis.” That being the case, we suggest taking a few steps to set yourself up for successaheadof when preorders drop next. We’ll continue to do our best to let you know which retailers have inventory as we approach June 5th, but in the meantime, we’ve rounded up a few helpful tips that should help you improve your chances. First things first: create accounts at Walmart, GameStop, Best Buy, and other retailers if you haven’t done so already. Both Best Buy and Walmart implemented a queue system when taking Switch 2 preorders in an effort to deter scalpers — a tactic also employed during the rollout of the PlayStation 5. That’s why it’s in your best interest to ensure your account is set up with the appropriate credentials. Confirm your location and delivery info, get your payment details in order, and log in to your account prior to making your purchase. ... most retailers won’t hold your console while you’re in the checkout line Setting up and verifying this information in advance will help streamline the checkout process, thus allowing you to save precious seconds. This is crucial, given most retailers won’t hold your console while you’re in the checkout line. If you own a smartphone, we recommend downloading — and logging into — the respective retailer apps for Walmart, Amazon, GameStop, Best Buy, and Target. In the past, we’ve found that the dedicated mobile apps for various retailers are faster than using a traditional browser; they also provide an additional means of procuring a console, thus increasing your chances of securing a Switch 2 at launch. A couple of retailers, specificallyBest BuyandGameStop, allow you to sign up for preorder updates regarding the Nintendo Switch 2, games, and accessories. So far, neither retailer has divulged much beyond what is available on their retail sites; however, they do serve as yet another opportunity to stay informed regarding how each retailer plans to handle the Switch 2 rollout going forward. Nintendo will have a raft of new accessories available for the Switch 2 at launch, including a Switch 2 Pro Controller, carrying cases, and even acamera accessory for video chats. And while it might be tempting to stack your cart with add-ons, preordering Nintendo’s first-party peripherals takes time that’s better spent on securing a console. Plus, accessory preorders don’t typically sell out nearly as fast as consoles, meaning you can always circle back for extras at Walmart, Best Buy, and other retailers once you’ve managed to reserve your Switch 2. This might come as a surprise in 2025, but preorders aren’t only available online. A handful of retailers, including Best Buy and GameStop, opened in-store preorders for the Switch 2 shortly following their online release. Each store has only been allocated a handful of launch units — theGameStop location our own Ash Parrish visitedhad been allotted 44 bundles and 19 regular Switch 2 consoles — so it can’t hurt to ask the folks at the store nearest you if they’re still accepting preorders. The chances are slim, sure, but who knows? You might get lucky. As you might expect, we’ll be closely monitoring Switch 2 inventory over the next month or so — or longer if it remains unavailable following its release on June 5th. Bookmarkour main deals hub, and if you haven’t already, subscribe toour Verge Deals newsletter! We’ll be sending special alerts as preorders become available; it’s also a great way to stay in the know regarding the latest deals and discounts, all of which come from aVergestaffer. A number of other social media accounts — includingWario64,IGN, andMatt Swider ofThe Shortcut— are likely going to be tracking preorder inventory for the foreseeable future as well, if you’re looking for additional publications / users to follow in the run-up to the Switch 2 launch. Right now, the only confirmed retailers for the Nintendo Switch 2 are Walmart, GameStop, Best Buy, Target, Newegg, and Sam’s Club. We anticipate Amazon opening preorders at some point, but based on previous console launches, the rollout at Amazon is likely to be sporadic and unpredictable. Either way, we’ll update this post accordingly if Amazon and other retailers begin offering preorders. Unsurprisingly, one of the few confirmed retailers is theMy Nintendo Store, which comes with a string of eligibility requirements — one of which requires you to register your interest in advance. To do so, you’ll need to sign in with your Nintendo account and select the console configuration you prefer, along with any desired accessories. Then, you’ll receive an invitation email when it’s time to buy it, assuming you’ve satisfied several other conditions. Currently, the reservation process is limited to Nintendo account holders in the US and Canada who are at least 18 years of age. Invitations will be valid for 72 hours and will be “prioritized on a first-come, first-served basis,” according to Nintendo; you’ll also need to have purchased a Nintendo Switch Online membership for a minimum of 12 months and have logged 50 hours of gameplay on the original Switch as of April 2nd, 2025, to be eligible. What’s more, you must have opted in tosharegameplay data with Nintendo (you can see if you’ve done soin the privacy sectionwhen logged into your account). Console and accessory purchases will be limited to one per eligible account … Once invitations have been sent to account holders who have met these criteria, Nintendo says it will send invitations to “remaining eligible registrants” on a first-come, first-served basis. The invitations will be nontransferable and sent to the email address you provided while registering your interest with Nintendo. Console and accessory purchases will be limited to one per eligible account, at least during the initial invitation period, which will begin with the first batch of invitations on May 8th. Additional invitations will follow periodically, though Nintendo hasn’t specified details beyond that. However, ina recent update to its site, Nintendo specified that, due to “the very high demand” for the console, “delivery by June 5 is not guaranteed” and that “your invitation email may arrive after the Nintendo Switch 2 launch.” Walmart is no longer accepting preorders for thestandalone Switch 2($449) or theMario Kart Worldbundle($499), though you can still preorder games likeDonkey Kong Bananza($69) and accessories like theSwitch 2 Carrying Case & Screen Protector($39.88). That being said, Walmart’s website still indicates that, if you manage to preorder a console before 8AM ET on June 4th, you should receive it before 9AM ET on June 5th. GameStop currently isn’t accepting preorders for thestandalone consoleor theMario Kart Worldbundle. If you’re looking to bring the cost down in the future, though, it offers up to $175 off a Switch 2 when you trade in a Switch OLED, or up to $125 off when you trade in a regular Switch. In both instances, you’ll need everything that came with your console — specifically the Switch, its dock, two working Joy-Con controllers (with wrist straps), an HDMI cable, and a power cord. GameStop alsoconfirmed toGizmodothat the exact valuation will depend on the condition of your console, including whether your Joy-Cons are experiencing the dreaded stick drift. Best Buy isn’t accepting online preorders for thestandalone consoleor theMario Kart Worldbundleright now, but if you do manage to reserve a console through Best Buy, the retailer has announced that most stores in the US will open at 12AM ET, 11PM CT, 10PM MT, and 9PM PT on June 5th for preorder pickup. Additionally, if you’re a My Best Buy Plus or Total member, you can currently score $20 in credit for every $150 you spend (up to $100) on Nintendo games and gear (excluding all Switch and Switch 2 hardware). That privilege willrun you at least $49.99 a year, though both membership tiers also grant you access to a number of exclusive perks, including limited-time discounts and free two-day shipping. Target has sold out of its initial preorder stock for both thestandalone Switch 2and theMario Kart Worldbundle, along with many accessories. Some games, including the Switch 2 Edition ofThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild($69.99), are still available. As far as we know, neither Newegg nor Sam’s Club opened preorders on April 24th. However, Newegg has published a landing page for both thestandalone consoleand theMario Kart Worldbundle, indicating it will have Switch 2 stock at some point. The same applies to Sam’s Club, which currently hasa retail listing for the bundle. You’ll needa Club membership($50 a year) to take advantage of the latter; however, given Sam’s Club requires you to sign up for a premium subscription to shop, you might have better luck when preorders do open.

One of the most frustrating realities about modern technology products is that while so many of them can get exciting new features via the internet, they can lose them just as easily. That happened to owners of Nixplay smart digital photo frames this week when they were hit with apreviously announcedupdate the company said would “remove premium features and reduce limits,” including dropping cloud photo and video storage to just 500MB. Nixplay has offered free cloud storage for a long time — here’s a2016PCMagreviewthat mentions an 8-inch frame that came with 10GB of space for no extra charge. In addition to losing higher storage limits, the company has also nixed thepreviously free abilityto sync a single Google Photos album. The company’s announcement said that those whose existing free accounts already exceed the new 500MB limit would see some content “restricted from sharing or viewing on a frame without editing your content or upgrading your subscription.” People on theNixplay subredditaren’t happy about the change, with posts complaining about the changesaffecting existing customersrather than only new ones orcalling it a scam. One user’sbegrudging postsays they’ll subscribe, but that they’re only doing so because they’ve accrued “a few thousand photos in the cloud” and don’t want to teach their partner, who hates computers, how to use a new app. Nixplay’spaid subscriptionscost either $19.99 a year for 100GB of photo storage (Nixplay Lite) or $29.99 per year for unlimited photo storage (Nixplay Plus). Both tiers also include the ability tosync with Google Photos, although it’s not clear if that feature works the same as it did before, given a recent change Google made thatbroke how many digital frames syncwith its photos service.

    "title": "Is Google’s smart tag network any good yet?",
    "article_text": "﻿I tested trackers from Motorola, Pebblebee, and Chipolo to find out what’s changed in the 12 months since launch. byDominic Preston ﻿I tested trackers from Motorola, Pebblebee, and Chipolo to find out what’s changed in the 12 months since launch. byDominic Preston When Google launched its long-awaited Find My Device networkin April 2024, it arrived to… well, what’s the opposite of “fanfare”? A slow network rollout and damning reviews dampened enthusiasm for what was supposed to be a wave of Android-powered rivals to Apple’s AirTag. But a year’s a long time in tech, and Google has been promising improvements almost since Find My Device was first switched on. I wanted to know: have things gotten any better? To find out, I set about testing the latest trackers from the three main companies that make compatible models: Pebblebee, Chipolo, and Motorola. For now Google doesn’t make its own Pixel or Nest-branded tracker, and Samsung’s SmartTags use its own SmartThings Find network, not Google’s. In the name of science, I also got hold of an Apple AirTag and a Tile tracker to serve as reference points forGoogle’s chief competitors. I found a network that’s clearly improved in the year since launch, one that in good conditions — a busy city, a tracker that’s not moving — is every bit as good as Apple’s and Tile’s. It’s when tracking gets trickier, in rural settings or with moving tags, that a gap between Google and the competition still opens up. The strange part is, that might well be by design. In its broad strokes, the Find My Device network works pretty similarly to Apple’s Find My network. You can use it to locate dedicated smart tracking tags, along with offline phones and tablets, or one of a small selection of third-party devices with built-in Bluetooth tracking, including certain Sony headphones and earbuds. Trackers and lost devices use Bluetooth to connect to passing Android devices, which in turn share their encrypted location with the network, so that you can, in theory, see its location on a map. Then it’s just a matter of heading there to find it. I say “in theory” because things aren’t quite so simple, and they certainly weren’t when Google’s network first launched. While Apple’s Find My network will tell you where your tech is so long as a single nearby iPhone makes Bluetooth contact, Google has been more cautious about how it uses location data. To avoid sharing the location data of individual nearby Android devices that have found a tracker — even anonymized, and encrypted — the Find My Device network defaults to aggregating location data. That means it requires multiple Android devices to make Bluetooth contact with a tracker, before sharing a single location calculated using the separate devices, so no individual user’s location data is shared unless they opt in to more permissive privacy settings. Making matters worse, Bluetooth pings are intermittent, not constant, which means a passing Android phone isn’t guaranteed to successfully make contact, adding to just how many people you’d need to pass by your lost belongings to get a successful location. Even a few months after the network came online, the result was that Google’s tracker network wasn’t very good at tracking. In a review of the Pebblebee Tag in June 2024,Android Policewent a full day without getting a location ping on a “lost” tracker. Around the same timeAndroid Centraltested both Pebblebee and Chipolo trackers — they went three days without an alert. Google acknowledged the issues,promising that Junethat it was “actively working to roll out enhancements” to improve the speed and accuracy of tracking. Android product manager Angela Hsiao told me that Google’s internal testing shows that on average items are now found four times faster than at launch, and in follow-up testing this JanuaryAndroid Policeagreedthat the trackers “suddenly work great.” So, what changed? Any improvements come in two parts. First up, Hsiao says that Google has been making “continuous algorithm and technical under-the-hood improvements” since the network’s launch, doing things like tweaking Bluetooth scanning frequency and duration to improve the odds of two devices making the Bluetooth connection necessary to trigger a connection. User behavior has changed, too. While the default settings rely on aggregated data to protect individual users’ privacy, those who are willing can switch from this “high-traffic areas” setting to an “all areas” option. The names are needlessly confusing, but what it really means is letting Google use your phone’s location data individually to track other devices — just like Apple’s network does — without waiting for other phones to come along. With every device on default settings at launch, no-one had this enabled. Hsiao wouldn’t specify how many users have opted in over the last year, only telling me that there are “more” than before, though with the option buried in the Find Device app’s settings it’s hard to imagine it’s any more than a small minority. So is Google overselling its improvements, or is its Find My Device network really up there with Apple’s Find My by now? Before that, it’s worth a quick rundown of exactly what I’ve been testing. Pebblebee, Chipolo, and Motorola are the three big manufacturers of dedicated Find My Device trackers in North America and Europe, at least until Google decides to get involved for itself, so I tested them all. Pebblebee offers three models: theClip, Tag, and Card. I focused on the Clip, a circular tracker a little larger than an AirTag, but with a built-in hole for attaching to key rings. It has a Bluetooth range of up to 500 feet — though this assumes open line of sight and ideal conditions, so practical range will be much shorter — and, uniquely, it’s USB-C rechargeable (apparently lasting a year between charges), so it won’t generate undue e-waste. The Tag is a smaller model with a shorter range, while the Card is designed to slip into your wallet. All three support both Google and Apple’s tracker networks, though only one at a time. But it does mean that if you change phones you can keep using the same tracker. Chipolo used to offer both a round tracker and a card, but in the course of my testing the company simplified its range: there’s now only the circularChipolo Pop, which like Pebblebee trackers will work with either Android or iOS. It comes in a range of bright colors — ideal if you want to pick up a few for the family without mixing them up — but top Bluetooth range is a little shorter at 300 feet. You also can’t recharge these, though the standard CR2032 battery should be easy enough to replace when it dies after a year or so of use. Then there’s the Moto Tag. It’s strictly Android-only, but it’s also themost Apple-y tracker of them all— Motorola sneakily designed it in almost the exact same proportions as the AirTag, deftly piggybacking on that existing accessory market. Its Bluetooth range is similar to the Chipolo Pop’s, it uses the same replaceable battery, and its IP67 rating is the best water-protection across any of the Google-powered options. This is also the only one to include support for ultra wideband (UWB), enabling precision tracking from a compatible phone when you’re in short range… or at least it would, if Google had enabled UWB support on the network. Until it does — and for what it’s worth, Hsiao told me that Google will have more to share on that “very soon” — the Moto Tag’s UWB support is strictly theoretical, but a welcome bit of futureproofing. What about the competition? TheAirTagonly comes in one size and shape, and Apple doesn’t quote an official range on its Bluetooth. Like the Moto Tag it’s IP67-rated, and uses CR2032 batteries, too. It also boasts UWB support, and it actually works. One handy feature that Apple offers and Google doesn’t is separation alerts, notifying you when you’re walking away from a device to prevent you losing it in the first place. Finally, I tested a Tile Mate, too. The OG tracker giantupdated its range in 2024, but still leverages its own network of Tile devices, rather than using Google’s or Apple’s. There’s no UWB support, but there is a range of four styles: the regular Mate, more powerful Pro, card-shaped Slim, and the small Sticker, which can attach directly to whatever you want to track. The big downside to Tiles is that unless you buy the Pro, the batteries are non-replaceable — meaning when they die, they die, and you’ll have to buy a new one. I set out to test how this range of trackers handled three basic things: To test the first, I dropped off my bundle of trackers in a small park across from a popular cafe in Islington, London — a spot with moderately heavy footfall, but some way short of what you’d find at a central tube station. I hid them behind a low brick wall, purposefully making conditions suboptimal for the Bluetooth. Then I headed back home, marked each tracker as lost, and waited. The Tile Mate popped up first, 15 minutes after I’d marked it lost, and marked the location just a few feet from where I knew I’d left the tags. Another 15 minutes later, the AirTag and the Google trio all popped up at about the same time, but with one big difference: Apple’s location pin was just as accurate as Tile’s, but the three Google trackers all showed me a search radius of 20 feet or so, and the tracker was actually located just outside that circle. When I checked again a few hours later the pin was in the perfect spot, but it took the network a little longer than the others to get there. I tried the same thing outside of London, along a secluded trail in the suburbs. This is a spot with minimal foot traffic outside of a few dog walkers and joggers, making it more of a challenge for the tracker networks. This time Apple came in first, taking just 15 minutes to let me know my AirTag had been found — quicker than it had actually managed in the city, and the pin was just as precise. Tile took a little over an hour to find my Mate, though it thought it was about 50 feet down the road, meaning I’d probably never have really found it. Across the four hours I spent in the area, none of the trackers on Google’s network popped up at all. What about when you actually get to wherever your tracker supposedly is, but need to know exactly where it is? I expected Apple to have an easy upper hand here, its UWB support giving precise(ish) directions to your iPhone, so that you know which direction to walk and how close you are. Once you’re close enough, you can tell the AirTag to start ringing an alarm so you can find it by sound. While none of the Chipolo, Pebblebee, or Motorola tags support UWB properly just yet, they’re actually easier to find than the AirTag, thanks to one clever little technological trick: they’re really, really loud. UWB or not, all three of the Google-powered tags I tested packs a speaker far louder than Apple’s, audible from several rooms away, which is really all you need so long as the tracking network can get you close enough in the first place. But there’s the rub. Across several weeks of testing tracking, the story was similar: in busy areas Google’s network was about as fast as Apple’s to track and find devices, but it was often less precise. This is especially true for moving targets: when my partner carried my assortment of trackers with her on a night out (consensually!), the Find My Device network succeeded at identifying her location when she was hanging out in a bar, but it offered hopelessly broad search areas — sometimes whole city neighborhoods — whenever she was on the move. That’s a direct result of Google’s choice to rely on aggregated data. Unless a tracker is picked up by multiple devices simultaneously, any tracking will rely on aggregating pings from across a period of time. If the tracker is moving, that means each device it connects to will report a different location, and as a user you get shown a pretty large area to search. Leave your backpack behind in a bar and Google’s network will help you find it; leave it in a cab and you might be in trouble. In Google’s defense, that’s a feature, not a bug. Hsiao told me that the network “is intentionally designed with a balance that prioritizes safety over continuous, real-time tracking capabilities.” That’s safety for individual users’ location data, but also safety for potential stalking victims, as there’s no useful live feed of a tracker’s location. The other side of stalking protection is unknown tracker alerts, and the bad news here is that no one seems to be getting this right. Tile doesn’t offer the feature at all, and in fact advertises on that basis — not in the name of easier stalking, but so that would-be thieves don’t get alerts that you might be tracking them as they run off with your gear. Interoperability seems to be the problem elsewhere: friends’ iPhones would reliably detect my rogue AirTag if I sent it out with my partner, and Android phones would usually warn about the Find My Device tags, but it was rare for either type of phone to detect a tracker from the other network. That ain’t great, but it seems to be Apple’s problem as much as Google’s — the two companies worked together tocreate an industry standard for detecting unwanted trackers, but it doesn’t seem to actually work all that well. Even after 12 months of work, it’s pretty inarguable that Google’s Find My Device network still isn’t as good as Apple’s Find My at actually finding stuff. The difference now is that the disparity is philosophical, not technological: Google doesn’t seem towantto offer precise real-time tracking, and so it’s built its network to be more private, but less effective. For those who want to actually track their lost tech, that’s a big potential downside — Apple’s AirTag will often do a better job, and even Tile’s network is occasionally more accurate. Google’s big bet is that “good enough” will be good enough, that finding lost belongings most of the time, pretty accurately, and fairly fast is all people really need, and that they’re willing to give up on those edge cases in return for a network that’s safer and more private than the competition. Quite simply, it’s not very Google. This is not a company known for sacrificing functionality in the name of privacy, and certainly not one you’d expect to claw at less data than Apple does at the same game. And so whatever the Find My Device network’s faults, there’s something to celebrate in its compromises.

    "article_text": "﻿Gemini’s place as a preinstalled, default AI assistant on the Galaxy S25 came with a check attached. ﻿Gemini’s place as a preinstalled, default AI assistant on the Galaxy S25 came with a check attached. byWes Davis Testimony this week from Google’s antitrust trial shows that Google gives Samsung an “enormous sum of money” each month to preinstall the Gemini AI app on Samsung devices,reportsBloomberg. Now that Judge Amit Mehta has ruled Google’s search engine is an illegal monopoly, its lawyers are sparring with the DOJ over how severe a potential penalty should be. Peter Fitzgerald, Google’s vice president of platforms and device partnerships, testified on Monday that Google’s payments to Samsung started in January. That’s after Google wasfound to have violated antitrust law, partially due to similar arrangements with Apple, Samsung, and other companies for search. When Samsung launched the Galaxy S25 series in January, it alsoadded Gemini as the default AI assistantwhen long-pressing the power button, with its own Bixby assistant taking a back seat. The Informationreports that today Fitzgerald testified that other companies had pitched Samsung on deals to preinstall their AI assistant apps, including Perplexity and Microsoft. But a DOJ lawyer pointed out that Google’s letters attempting to amend its deal with phone makers, which the company presented at the hearing, were only sent last week, just ahead of the trial. Also, internal slides presented today apparently showed that Google “was considering more restrictive distribution agreements that would have required partners to preinstall Gemini alongside Search and Chrome,”The Informationwrites. According toBloomberg, Fitzgerald said the Gemini deal is a two-year agreement that, along with fixed monthly payments, sees Google giving Samsung a percentage of its subscription revenue for the Gemini app. Department of Justice (DOJ) lawyer David Dahlquist called the fixed monthly payment an “enormous sum,”Bloombergsays. Exactly how enormous isn’t known. If theDOJ has its way, the results of these hearings could mean Google is forbidden from striking default placement deals in the future, wouldsell Chrome, and would be forced to license the vast majority of the data that powers Google Search. Google has argued that it should only have to give up the default placement deals.

    "title": "Bionic Bay mixes floppy physics with hard sci-fi",
    "article_text": "The new platformer is equal parts atmospheric and demanding. The new platformer is equal parts atmospheric and demanding. byAndrew Webster Wandering throughBionic Bay’s dark alien world is unsettling and awe-inspiring. There are massive structures with no clear purpose and autonomous factories filled with whirring saw blades and devastating lasers. It’s grim and unforgiving, with little light and harsh shadows that give everything a sinister tone. But then you step on a bomb and your character bounces off of walls like a pinball, and you realize it’s a game of contrasts. Bionic Bayis a curious blend of two very different genres. On the one hand, it’s an atmospheric side-scrolling adventure in the mold ofInsideandLimbo, filled with disturbingly stunning environments to explore. At the same time, it’s a hard-as-nails platformer likeSuper Meat Boy, with elaborate physics that will have you dying repeatedly while trying to find the best route through deadly obstacles. Somehow, the disparate vibes come together surprisingly well. What first drew me toBionic Baywas that dark world. It’s mysterious to the point that I still don’t actually know what it is you’re doing or why. But that mystery is a large part of the appeal. As you make your way through its levels, you’re subject to some incredible and intimidating environments, and it’s largely up to you to figure out what story the world is trying to tell. There are fiery factories, green areas where organic life merges with technology and architecture in disturbing ways, and dank sewers lit up by dripping bioluminescent goo. All of these spaces make you feel minuscule in comparison. It’s the kind of game where almost every moment makes for a great screenshot. In order to see it all, though, you have to deal with a very tough game. While there is some relatively simple platforming at first, you’re soon presented with seemingly insurmountable tasks, like a series of spinning saw blades that require exacting jumps to get through. But it’s not as precise as it may seem. One of the more unique elements ofBionic Bayis its physics; the little guy you control is very sturdy and can survive being bounced around, so you can sometimes flop your way through trickier areas. Bionic Bayis also something of a puzzle game. You have access to multiple powers, like the ability to swap places with an inanimate object or slow down time (though you can only actively be using one). Combine these tools with the floppy physics and there are a lot of creative ways to get through the game. Key to this is thatBionic Bayencourages experimentation. You will die a lot, but because the game has such a forgiving checkpoint system, there’s rarely much punishment for failure. Being able to quickly retry a jump keeps the game from being too frustrating while also making it easier to find a route that actually works. And if you have a wild idea about, say, riding on the back of a rocket to avoid killer laser beams, there’s no harm in trying. The game isn’t easy. I’ve found myself stuck on a few occasions.

    "title": "Kuxiu’s ‘world first’ solid-state power bank costs more but lasts much longer",
    "article_text": "The S2 costs up to 60 percent more, but it’s safer and can be cycled 1,000 times before battery life starts degrading. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. byThomas Ricker If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. Solid-state batteries are the future. They’re more powerful, compact, safe, and sustainable than Lithium-ion alternatives, but trueall-solid state batteries can’t be mass-produced cost-effectively. That’s whyKuxiuhas gonesemi-solid state for what it calls the “world’s safest” power bank, while calling dibs on it being a world first. Kuxiu’s $79.99S2 Qi2 5000mAh MagSafe Solid-State Power Banksupports Qi2 for 15W wireless charging. And with a 5,000mAh at 3.8V (19Wh) capacity, it holds enough energy to charge the smaller iPhone models from zero to full. And despite using the truncated “solid state” in the S2 name and product page, the company confirmed to me that it’s built around a semi-solid state battery and that distinction matters. I’ve been carrying the Kuxiu S2 for the past few weeks. While I didn’t hammer, pierce, or tear the battery apart or expose it to fire like Kuxiu did, I can at least confirm that it otherwise works as expected. “Solid state” ambiguity It’s not just you, the battery industry itself can’t seem to agree on what qualifies as a solid-state battery. There’s all-solid state, semi-solid state, and quasi-solid state, to name just a few of the more popular terms. All-solid state is where the hype is and it’s the liquid-free battery of the future. But getting there at scale will likely require a few go-between steps. Solid-state batteries use a solid electrolyte — the component responsible for transferring electrically charged particles between the two terminals — but differ in terms of the amount of liquid present. If the amount of the liquid electrolyte is between 5 and 10 percent of the weight of the active part of the battery then it’s typically classified as semi-solid state. Less than 5 percent and it’s quasi-solid state. 0 percent, you guessed it: all-solid state. The battery inside the Kuxiu S2 contains a solid-liquid mixed electrolyte that forms a gel-like consistency that’s visible in the video above. It therefore fits the definition of semi-solid state, according to the company. So why is “Battery Type: Li Polymer Battery” listed in the fine print on the label stamped onto Kuxiu’s S2 power bank? LiPo batteries have been around in power banks for years, and suffer from relatively short lifespans and low energy densities — exactly the opposite of what Kuxiu claims for the new S2. Turns out that the solid electrolyte inside solid-state batteries can be made from various materials like ceramics and yes,polymers. So Kuxiu’s claim is likely true, the S2 is a Li Polymer battery that’s also a solid-state battery, or semi-solid state to be precise. Therefore, it may very well be the world’s first power bank to use a solid-state battery as the company says. For comparison, the Lithium-ion battery found in the power bank you likely have laying around at home contains over 25wt percent liquid, making it more prone to leakage, thermal runaway, and fire than the S2. Kuxiu’s power bank doesn’t benefit from every advantage of going solid state — like ever higher energy densities and greater safety achieved with all-solid state batteries — but it’s a step in the right direction. Notably, Kuxiu can mass produce the S2 today using many existing manufacturing processes to help keep costs down. Companies likeAnker will tell youthat a typical 5,000mAh power bank usually starts to degrade after 300–500 charging cycles. At that point, it’ll only hold about 60 to 80 percent of the original capacity. Kuxiu tells me that the S2 is good for 1,000 charging cycles before capacity drops to 80 percent. So, while it costs about 60 percent more than a comparable liquid-based power bank from companies like Anker or EcoFlow, it should easily last twice as long before you see any noticeable degradation. Kuxiu claims an improved 360Wh/kg energy density compared to 300Wh/kg for liquid cells. The S2 is certainly compact and lightweight at 10.4 x 6.7 x 1.0cm / 145g, which makes it more portable than EcoFlow’s direct competitor which measures 10.8 x 7.0 x 1.44cm / 180g. ButEcoFlow’s 5,000mAh power bankalso includes a kickstand and 30W of more powerful bidirectional wired charging. Anker, however, edges out the S2 in size and weight with its5K power bankmeasuring 10.2 x 7.0 x 0.9cm / 120g. But that likely says more about the materials used to decorate and protect the batteries than their respective energy densities. Performance As a MagSafe-compatible Qi2 power bank, the Kuxiu S2 automatically starts charging as soon as its 16 N52 magnets grab hold of my iPhone 15 Pro. Those magnets are strong and maintain the bond even as I slip the combo into a loose pocket or bag. Still, they’re not immune to a well-placed bump that could send the battery to the floor. That could spell trouble for the aluminum S2 sandwiched between two sheets of Corning Gorilla Glass, each protected by an “explosion-proof film.” After three weeks of careless handling, my S2 review unit has a small but noticeable nick on the shell, but otherwise looks new. Kuxiu says that the S2 power bank “provides approximately 1.2 full charges for an iPhone.” I saw slightly less than that when testing it with my iPhone 15 Pro. When attached magnetically, the fully charged S2 brought my empty iPhone up to 98 percent before the power bank was depleted. Sadly, the bottom of the battery extends beyond my iPhone 15 Pro to upset the symmetry I’d likely enjoy when paired with one of Apple’s larger Qi2-compatible iPhones. At least the cameras aren’t obscured. I could also do without all the specs listed on the outside of the unit. The power bank does work with or without a MagSafe-compatible case on my iPhone, but the case does cause the S2 to heat up slightly (making it less efficient) to help overcome the gap. The USB-C port on the bottom of the S2 features passthrough, so you can charge the power bank and a magnetically attached iPhone or AirPods at the same time. Charging the S2 solo from my MacBook’s wall charger took the power bank from zero to full in a rather slow 90 minutes. The power bank can also charge non-Qi2 devices thanks to its bidirectional USB-C port. That’s useful to juice up devices like over-the-ear headphones and Android phones at up to 20W. The S2 also proved capable of topping up my beefy 14-inch MacBook Pro, albeit very,veryslowly. A double-tap on the button along the bottom edge puts the power bank into a low-current mode. That way, the S2 can charge small devices like smart rings and wireless earbuds while bypassing automatic shutoff mechanisms designed for more power-hungry devices. Smart, but not unique to the S2. I do wish that Kuxiu put a kickstand on the S2 like so many of its competitors. At least it’s available in both black and titanium colors to better match your phone. Misleading battery marketing aside, I’m very impressed by the Kuxiu S2 Qi2 5000mAh MagSafe “Solid-State” Power Bank in terms of what it is and what it promises. Yes, it’s more expensive than similarly specced power banks using traditional liquid electrolytes, but the S2’s semi-solid state battery should prove to be safer and cheaper than competitors over its much longer lifetime.

    "article_text": "Nvidia and AMD GPUs: so much for MSRP! Nvidia and AMD GPUs: so much for MSRP! bySean Hollister Every so often, Central Computers — one of thelast remainingdedicated Silicon Valley computer stores — lets subscribers know it’s managed to obtain a small shipment of AMD graphics cards. Today, it informed me that I could now purchase a $600 Radeon RX 9070 XTfor $850— a $250 markup. It’s not alone. I just checked every major US retailer and street prices on eBay, and I regret to inform you:the great GPU shortagehas returned. Many AMD cards are being marked up $100, $200, $250, even $280. The street price of an Nvidia RTX 5080 is now over $1,500, a full $500 higher than MSRP. Andan RTX 5090, the most powerful consumer GPU? You can’t even get the $2,000 card for $3,000 today. Here, I’ve built tables to show you: You shouldn’t just blame tariffs for these price hikes. In early March,we found retailers were already scalpingtheir supposedly entry-level MSRP models of the new AMD graphics cards. Nor is this likely to just be high demand, given how few cards are changing hands on eBay: only around 1,100 new Nvidia GPUs, and around 266 new AMD GPUs were listed there over the past 30 days. But tariffs may have an greater impact soon: on May 2nd,the de minimis exemption will no longer apply, meaning shipments valued at $800 or less can be taxed, and many more shipments will likely get hit as a result. Stores likeShein and Temu have already raised pricesin anticipation. Here’s a deeper dive on the “MSRP” models of the AMD cards, which were all originally listed at $549 or $599: I’ve focused this table on Newegg and Micro Center since they carry more models than any other retailer, though I also spotted “MSRP” 9070 XT cards at $800 and $850 at Amazon today, and an $830 card at Best Buy. Otherwise, these are the new sticker prices, not necessarily attainable prices, as most were out of stock. From December 2020toJuly 2022, I periodically tracked the prices of game consoles and GPUs during the covid-19 pandemic, when they were incredibly expensive to obtain. At one point,some GPUs were worth triple their MSRP. I’d love to hear fromVergesubscribersin particular: is this a valuable service we should continue in the tariff era? Or do you just want to know when it’s safe to enter the water again?

    "title": "Bending to industry, Donald Trump issues executive order to “expedite” deep sea mining",
    "article_text": "The Trump administration is trying to bypass international talks on deep sea mining. The Trump administration is trying to bypass international talks on deep sea mining. byJustine Calma If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. Donald Trump wants to mine the depths of the ocean for critical minerals ubiquitous in rechargeable batteries, signing anexecutive orderon Thursday to try to expedite mining within US and international waters. It’s a brash move that critics say could create unknown havoc on sea life and coastal economies, and that bucks international agreements. Talks to develop rules for deep-sea mining are still ongoing through the International Seabed Authority (ISA), a process that missed an initial2023 deadlineand has continued to stymie efforts to start commercially mining the deep sea. “A dangerous precedent” “Fast-tracking deep-sea mining by bypassing the ISA’s global regulatory processes would set a dangerous precedent and would be a violation of customary international law,” Duncan Currie, legal adviser for the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition that has advocated for a moratorium on deep sea mining, said in a press statement. The ISA was established by the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. More than 160 nations have ratified the convention, but the United States has not. Ignoring the convention, the executive order Trump signed directs federal agencies to expedite the process for issuing licenses to companies seeking to recover minerals “in areas beyond national jurisdiction” in accordance with the1980 US Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act. A country’s territorial jurisdiction only extends roughly200 nautical milesfrom shore. The Trump administration wants to work with industry “to counter China’s growing influence over seabed mineral resources,” the executive order says. However, no country has yet to commercially mine thedeep oceanwhere depths reach about 656 feet (200 meters) in international waters. There have already been efforts toexploreparts of the ocean floor rich in nickel, copper, cobalt, iron, and manganese sought after for rechargeable batteries, though, and China is aleading refiner of many critical minerals. China responded on Friday: theBBC reportedChinese foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun as saying that Trump’s move “violates international law and harms the overall interests of the international community.” The Metals Companyannouncedin March that the Canadian company had already “met with officials in the White House” andplanned to apply for permitsunder existing US mining code to begin extracting minerals from the high seas. California-based companyImpossible Metals askedthe Trump administration earlier this month to auction off mining leases for areas off the coast of American Samoa, which would be within US-controlled waters. Trump’s executive order also directs the Secretary of the Interior to expedite the process for leasing areas for mining within US waters. Companies seeking to exploit offshore mineral resources argue that it would cause less harm than mining on land. Their opponents contend that there’s still too little research to even understand how widespread the effects of deep sea mining could be on marine ecosystems and the people who depend on them. Recent studies have warned of“irreversible” damageand loudnoise affecting sea life, and onecontroversial studyraises questions of whether the deep sea could be an important source of “dark oxygen” for the world. More than30 countries— including Palau, Fiji, Costa Rica, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, New Zealand, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom — have called for a ban or moratorium on deep-sea mining until international rules are in place to minimize the potential damage. “The harm caused by deep-sea mining isn’t restricted to the ocean floor: it will impact the entire water column, top to bottom, and everyone and everything relying on it,” Jeff Watters, vice president for external affairs at the nonprofit Ocean Conservancy said in a press release.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 26, 2025 / 7:40 PM EDT/ CBS News Washington— Inside the kitchen at the Washington Hilton ahead of Saturday night's White House Correspondents' Dinner are frenetic dinner preparations for about 2,600 people. \"So, if it's a three-course, you multiply that by three, we could walk away doing almost 10,000 plates in the kitchen as a whole,\" Daniel Bennett, the hotel's executive chef, tells CBS News. Thecorrespondents' dinnerhas been an annual tradition since 1921, bringing togetherpresidential comedyand the press corps, and the Hilton has been its home for 57 years. The Washington Hilton is also known for one of the darkest moments in presidential history. On March 30, 1981, President Ronald Reagan had just finished speaking at a union convention and was emerging from the hotel when he was struck by a bullet fromwould-be assassin John Hinckley Jr.. Reagan survived and returned to the hotel less than six months later. Now, there is a plaque that commemorates the assassination attempt. Shortly thereafter, a garage was constructed with a secure door so the presidential limousine can enter and exit with absolute security.The garage entrance leads to a long hallway adorned with photos of each president and first lady. Every president since Lyndon Johnson has spoken here, often making several trips a year for fundraisers, conferences, and the National Prayer Breakfast. President Richard Nixon attended an inaugural ball at the Hilton in 1969, as did President Barack Obama 40 years later. When the hotel opened in 1965, its double-arc design was an architectural anomaly in a staid capital city. Its 30,000-square-foot ballroom is one of the largest indoor gathering spaces in D.C. It's big enough to host concerts, including the likes of The Doors in 1967 and Jimi Hendrix a year later. Saturday night's correspondents' dinner will look a bit different. There willbe no featured comedian, and President Trump,who skippedevery correspondents' dinner in his first term, will not attend. Writer and performer Amber Ruffin had been announced as the night's entertainment in February. However, Ruffin who has been critical of Mr. Trump, was pulled from the event in March. Despite the controversy, for the Hilton, that doesn't change the imperative to serve. \"Pretty much, the day the event ends, we're already planning for the next event,\" hotel general manager Ken Jarka said. And what will define a successful correspondents' dinner for the Hilton? \"No one is writing about us the next morning. How's that?\" quipped Jarka.Not an easy feat in a roomful of journalists.

Giuffre died at her farm in Western Australia, her family said. She was 41. \"She lost her life to suicide, after being a lifelong victim of sexual abuse and sex trafficking,\" her family's statement read. \"Virginia was a fierce warrior in the fight against sexual abuse and sex trafficking. She was the light that lifted so many survivors. Despite all the adversity she faced in her life, she shone so bright. She will be missed beyond measure.\" In a statement provided to CBS News' partner, Network 10, Australian police said a woman was found unresponsive Friday night at a residence in Neergabby, without confirming Giuffre's name due to their policy. Officers provided emergency first-aid, but the 41-year-old was declared deceased at the scene, police said. Her death is being investigated by local police detectives, but authorities indicated that the death was not suspicious in nature. About a month before her death, Giuffrewas seriously injuredwhen a car she was riding in was hit by a school bus in Western Australia. Giuffre had alleged that Epstein sexually trafficked her to Britain's Prince Andrew and others. Prince Andrew hasdeniedthose claims. Giuffre filed alawsuit against Andrewin 2021, alleging that she was sexually abused by Andrew when she was 17. Anout-of-court settlementwas reached in 2022. \"Virginia was much more than a client to me; she was a dear friend and an incredible champion for other victims,\" her attorney, Sigrid McCawley, said in a statement. Her courage pushed me to fight harder, and her strength was awe-inspiring. The world has lost an amazing human being today. Rest in peace, my sweet angel.\" Giuffre was born in California and in grade school she moved to Florida with her family. Giuffre experienced a troubled childhood growing up, tellingthe Miami Heraldthat at age 7, she was first molested by a family friend. She said the abuse \"turned my entire life around. Everything changed.\" GiuffremetBritish socialiteGhislaine Maxwellin the early 2000s when working as a locker room attendant at President Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, where her father was a maintenance supervisor. Giuffre said Maxwell connected her with Epstein and others. In 2019, Epstein, a convicted sex offender, wasarrestedon federal sex trafficking charges. A month after he was arrested, Epstein wasfound deadin his cell at a Manhattan jail as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges. Hisdeathwas ruled a suicide. Giuffre had also accused Epstein's former girlfriend, Maxwell, of grooming and abusing her when she was 17,telling CBS News in 2020that Maxwell \"was the guy controlling Jeffrey.\" Maxwell was convicted in 2022 and sentenced to20 years in prisonfor helping Epsteinsexually abuseunderage girls for at least a decade.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 26, 2025 / 7:22 PM EDT/ CBS News A federal judge says a 2-year-old Louisiana girl and U.S. citizen may have been deported to Honduras this week with her mother and 11-year-old sister without due process, according to court documents obtained by CBS News. In an order Friday, Judge Terry Doughty, who sits on the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, wrote there was a \"strong suspicion that the Government just deported a U.S. citizen with no meaningful process.\" When Doughty, appointed to the bench by President Trump during his first term, sought Friday afternoon to arrange a phone call with the mother of the girl, Justice Department lawyers informed him that a call with the child's mother \"would not be possible because she (and presumably VML) had just been released in Honduras.\" The girl is identified in court documents as VML. The immigration status of the girl's father, mother and sister was unclear. The girl was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in January 2023, according to the filing. \"The parent made the decision to take the child with them to Honduras. It is common that parents want to be removed with their children,\" Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to CBS News Saturday. According to a petition filed Thursday by Trish Mack, a friend of child's mother, the girl, her 11-year-old sister and mother were taken into custody Tuesday morning while attending a routine check-in with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents at an ICE office in New Orleans. The mother had attended meetings like this regularly for four years, often bringing her daughters with her. They were taken to the meeting by the girl's father, the petition reads. After being detained, the mother and her two daughters were transported to an ICE field office in New Orleans, court documents state. When the father arrived at that office, ICE officers gave him papers stating that the mother \"was under their custody,\" documents read, and that she \"would call him soon.\" That day, an attorney for the family contacted ICE and informed authorities that the girl was a U.S. citizen, the petition said, and also emailed a copy of the girl's U.S. birth certificate to ICE. But that night, an ICE agent called the father and informed him that \"they were going to deport his partner and daughters,\" documents read. In an effort to halt the deportation of the two daughters, the father on Tuesday filed for a temporary transfer of legal custody, which under Louisiana law would give his sister-in-law, a U.S. citizen who resides in Baton Rouge, custody of both. On Wednesday, an ICE agent spoke with the family's attorney, and \"refused to honor a request to release\" the girl \"to her custodian, stating that it was not needed because\" she \"was already with her mother,\" court documents read. The ICE agent further said that the \"father could try to pick her up, but that he would also be taken into custody.\" Doughty has scheduled a hearing for May 16 in the case. Since beginning his second term in January, President Trumphas pursuedan aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration that has sparked a flurry of lawsuits and prompted scrutiny over whether it is violating federal law. The Trump administration is facing criticism overthe deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man who was living in Maryland and   who the Justice Department has admitted was mistakenly deported to El Salvador last month. Despite aSupreme Court rulingthat stated the Trump administration must facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S., Mr. Trump in aninterview published Fridayin Time magazine said he has not reached out to Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele to do so.

Though thefamously humble pontiffrequested simplicity in his wooden coffin andfinal resting place, the funeral Mass still reflected the grandeur and traditions of the Vatican. See photos below of some of the highlights of the day honoring the leader known as\"the People's Pope.\" An estimated 250,000 people attended the funeral service outside St. Peter's Basilica at the Vatican. The Vatican said delegations from about 130 countries would attend the ceremony, including about 50 heads of state and 10 reigning monarchs. President Trump and first lady Melania Trump were there, andformer President Joe Bidenalso attended. Before the funeral, Mr. Trump met privately withUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The Mass was led by Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, the 91-year-old dean of theCollege of Cardinals, who also delivered a highly personalhomily. \"He was a pope among the people, with an open heart towards everyone,\" Re said of Pope Francis, whodied at the age of 88. \"The guiding thread of his mission was also the conviction that the church is a home for all, a home with its doors always open.\" After the funeral Mass, the coffin of Pope Francis was taken in a procession aboard the popemobile through the streets of Rome to his final resting place, the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore (St. Mary Major).

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 26, 2025 / 6:29 PM EDT/ AP The wife of an active-duty Coast Guardsman was arrested earlier this week by federal immigration authorities inside the family residential section of the U.S. Naval Air Station at Key West,Florida, after she was flagged in a routine security check, officials said Saturday. \"The spouse is not a member of the Coast Guard and was detained by Homeland Security Investigations pursuant to a lawful removal order,\" said Coast Guard spokesperson Lt. Cmdr. Steve Roth in a statement confirming Thursday's on-base arrest. \"The Coast Guard works closely with HSI and others to enforce federal laws, including on immigration.\" According to a U.S. official, the woman's work visa expired around 2017, and she was marked for removal from the United States a few years later. She and the Coast Guardsman were married early this year, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an enforcement incident. Though the Trump administration has made immigration arrests a top priority for federal law enforcement, it did not immediately appear the on-base arrest of the military spouse was part of abroader sweep. The official said that when the woman and her Coast Guard husband were preparing to move into their on-base housing on Wednesday, they went to the visitor control center to get a pass so she could access the Key West installation. During the routine security screening required for base access, the woman's name was flagged as a problem. Base personnel contacted the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, which looked into the matter, said the official. NCIS and Coast Guard security personnel got permission from the base commander to enter the installation and then went to the Coast Guardsman's home on Thursday, the official said. They were joined by personnel from Homeland Security Investigations, a unit within Immigration and Customs Enforcement. HSI eventually took the spouse into custody, and the official said they believe she is still beingdetained. Officials did not provide the name of the country she is from. The Coast Guard referred questions about the woman's identity, immigration status and charges to ICE, which did not respond to a request for comment on Saturday. The Department of Homeland Security also did not respond to a request for comment. The husband of the arrested woman is a Coast Guardsman assigned to the USCGC Mohawk, a 270-foot-long cutter based at Key West. The couple was moving into U.S. government housing at the nearby Naval Air Station. An online database that tracks ship movements shows the Mohawk has been docked in its home port since mid-March. A March 16 media release says the ship had recently returned following a 70-day deployment to the Eastern Pacific Ocean on a mission to intercept shipments of illegal drugs. In a statement, the Navy said that it \"fully cooperated with federal law enforcement authorities on this matter. We take security and access at naval installations seriously.\" © 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

    "title": "Trump's third-term talk freezes the potential 2028 Republican field",
    "article_text": "WASHINGTON — The merch is out and available for a price on theTrump Organizationwebsite: $50 for a “Trump 2028” hat; $36 for a shirt that reads “Trump 2028 (Re-write the Rules).” The rules aren’t so easily undone. Donald Trump can’t be elected again in 2028 under the constitutional amendment limiting presidents to two terms. Any number of Trump’s Republican allies will tell you that a third term is inconceivable given theenormous hurdlesrequired to pass a new amendment. “He’s not going to run for another term,” former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich told NBC News. But, he added, Trump has reason to talk about it: “Don’t underestimate the degree to which he believes any Trump-centered noise is good, because it starves his opponents.” Yet Trump continues to flirt with the prospect of serving until 2033, when he would be 86 years old. Whether he’ll follow through or not, his assertion that a third term isno jokeis something that would-be contenders ignore at their own peril. Teasing a third term freezes the 2028 GOP presidential field until aspiring candidates have a clearer understanding of whether and how far Trump intends to push the limits of the Constitution. Anyone who front-runs Trump and mounts a campaign before he declares his intentions might offend the MAGA movement. Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Josh Hawley of Missouri, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis — none are likely to start building a campaign unless and until Trump concedes this term is his last. Doing so would invite “total and complete rejection,” said Steve Bannon, a senior White House official in Trump’s first term who is exploring ways for Trump to serve a third term. “Trump is MAGA; MAGA is Trump.” Asa Hutchinson, a former Arkansas governor who ran against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, said Trump’s third-term musings “particularly impact JD Vance and Ron DeSantis and anyone else who wants the favor of Donald Trump. They know they have to stay out of the mix until Donald Trump gives the blessing to go after it and says that he would not be seeking a third term.” That’s not likely to happen any time soon. The party expects Trump to draw out an announcement about his future as long as he can, according to a Republican who is close to possible 2028 candidates. The more Trump delays, the more he commands attention and averts the perception that he’s a lame duck. The White House has considerable leverage at this point. No serious GOP presidential hopeful would want Trump’s ire. Consider the case of DeSantis. Trump endorsed him in the 2018 Florida gubernatorial primary and viewed his subsequent 2024 presidential primary challenge as a betrayal. On top of that, Trump’s political base began to distrust DeSantis after he jumped in the race against Trump, a sentiment that hasn’t subsided. Before the GOP Iowa caucuses last year, Laura Loomer, one of Trump’s most vocal supporters, told DeSantis in the lobby of a hotel: “You killed your political career, and I hope you’re happy.” The best way for putative candidates to stay on the right side of Trump is by going along with the notion that he might indeed run, a Trump political adviser said. “I think anyone looking to 2028 is probably the first person to purchase one,” said the adviser, referring to the “Trump 2028” hat, who was granted anonymity to share internal thinking. Vance may be better positioned than most rivals as Trump floats the idea of a third term. He has a built-in platform as a sitting vice president, complete with the perks that the job brings. At his disposal is a taxpayer-funded staff and an airplane that he can use to build his foreign policy bona fides. It helps that his boss is a bit ofa homebodyand has eschewed extensive travel. This month, Vance met with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni in Rome to discuss tariffs. He had an audience with Pope Francis shortly before the pontiff’s death. With Trump controlling the Republican National Committee, Vance last month became the group’s finance chairman, allowing him to befriend well-heeled donors who can be helpful to a future campaign. Vance has made no movements toward his own presidential run and has yet to seriously think about the idea, a source close to the vice president said. When asked if he views himself as Trump’s successor, Vance insisted last month that his own White House bid was not an urgent priority but acknowledged the circumstances under which he’d become a strong candidate. He also suggested that any serious moves would come after the 2026 midterm elections. “If I do really well for the next four years, everything else will take care of itself,” Vancesaid in an interview with NBC News. “Now, like, yeah, in two and a half years, will that become harder? Will people be more focused on politics than on what the White House is maybe doing that particular day? Maybe.” Others can’t be as confident. DeSantis faces term limitations and will be out of office in 2027, so he won’t have the stage that the Florida governor’s office provides. Still, that might not dampen his ambitions. “He absolutely believes he can still be president. While most on the outside looking in do not think he has viability, that’s just not how he thinks. It’s not how he views the world,” a longtime DeSantis ally said. If Trump finds a way to run, though, his grip on the GOP is such that  serious opposition may well evaporate. The most direct way for Trump to circumvent the 22nd Amendment is to change it. But that’s nearly an insurmountable obstacle in these polarized times, requiring three-quarters of the states to go along, for starters. More fanciful ideas for overcoming the legal barrier involves a scenario in which Vance runs for president and picks Trump as his running mate. If they win, Vance then steps aside and Trump becomes president again. Were Vance to go along with that, attention might turn from the 22nd Amendment to the 12th.That amendmentstates that no one who is ineligible under the Constitution to be president shall be eligible to serve as vice president. So the question then becomes, is Trump ineligible to be Vance’s running mate given that he’s barred under the 22nd Amendment from being elected to a third term? And, here, the answer may come down to a careful textual reading of the two amendments at issue. An argument might be made that because the 22nd Amendment says only that Trump can’t beelectedpresident a third time, that doesn’t mean he can’tbepresident if Vance were to resign and turn the job over to him. Such a scenario “is contrary to the intent of the amendments” but is not “squarely foreclosed by the words,” said Kermit Roosevelt, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School (and the great, great grandson of former President Theodore Roosevelt). Whether Vance would go along is a mystery. He has not publicly discussed the possibility, and spokespeople and advisers have declined requests to elaborate on what Vance is thinking about such a 2028 calculus. In an interview with Trump on April 22,Time magazineasked his thoughts about a swap with his No. 2. “I don’t know anything about, what, look, all I can say is this: I am being inundated with requests,” he said. “I’m doing a good job.” While “there are some loopholes that have been discussed that are well known,” he said, “I don’t believe in loopholes. I don’t believe in using loopholes.” Keeping the nation guessing, it turns out, is paying off. On Thursday, none other than the president’s second-oldest son, Eric Trump,posed for a picture on X, smiling and sporting a “Trump 2028” hat.",

    "article_text": "Town halls warning of layoffs. Medical leaves for mental health. Students readying for deportation. These are the grim signs of a campus under siege. But it’s not just any campus. Harvard University, America’s oldest and wealthiest institute of higher learning, is at a crossroads as it weathers the Trump administration’s attacks. Outwardly, the university hasbecome a symbolof defiance for refusing to cave to the administration’s demands, but on campus, many say the mood is one of frustration and fear, particularly for international students and faculty. Though reactions to the clash vary, many worry that Harvard will no longer be Harvard if President Donald Trump follows through on his threats. \"Students are unsure whether they can publish, whether they can travel, and wondering whether they can finish their degree,” Jocelyn Viterna, the chair of studies of women, gender and sexuality and a sociology professor at Harvard, said about international students. “I know students are also afraid that they might end up in a Louisiana prison because of something they happen to like once on Facebook.” Two dozen faculty, students and staff described in interviews this week how their lives have been upended by the showdown. Some faculty are now communicating by Signal, which encrypts and auto-deletes messages, worried that their texts could be shared with the government. Some international students are now walking in groups, for fear of being yanked off the street by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. At a recent university-run webinar, an attorney warned that international visa revocations “potentially could skyrocket.”",

    "article_text": "The Cleveland Browns selected Coloradoquarterback Shedeur Sanderswith the 144th pick in the fifth round ofthe NFL drafton Saturday, a surprising slide down the boards for a prospect considered by many a first-round lock. Sanders was a lightning rod during draft season. While many projected him as a first-round selection — anywhere as high as No. 3 to the New York Giants or No. 21 to the Pittsburgh Steelers — he went undrafted onthe first two nights. Ultimately, he was selected in the fifth round by Cleveland. Five quarterbacks — Miami’s Cam Ward, Ole Miss’ Jaxson Dart, Louisville’s Tyler Shough, Alabama’s Jalen Milroe and Oregon’s Dillon Gabriel — went ahead of Sanders. Minutes after the pick was made, Sandersposted to X, simply saying, “Thank you GOD.” The Browns shortly afterward posted a sizzle reel of Sanders with the caption, “Another playmaker in the mix.” “We felt like he was a good solid prospect at the most important position,” Andrew Berry, Browns executive vice president and general manager, said ina statementissued by the team. “We view him as a highly accurate pocket passer who does a good job of taking care of the ball ... We’re excited to work with him.” Sanders joins a crowded quarterback room in Cleveland and is the second play caller picked by the Browns this draft, after Dillon Gabriel. Veteran QBs Joe Flacco and Kenny Pickett are already on the roster. Entering Saturday, Sanders was the best prospect still available,according to NBC Sports’ Connor Rogers, who ranked Sanders 30th on his NFL draft board. Sanders, the son of NFL Hall of Famer and Buffaloes coach Deion Sanders, began his collegiate career at Jackson State in 2021 when his father was the head coach. Both left for Colorado after the 2022 season, and Shedeur Sanders spent his final two years in college with the Buffaloes. In his senior season, Sanders won Big 12 offensive player of the year,  completing 74.0% of his passes, with 37 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. He also threw 4,134 yards. Sanders was a key figure in Colorado’s turnaround as a football program. The school won only one game the season before his arrival. In 2024, the Buffaloes won nine games for the first time since 2016. In the lead-up to the draft, Sanders was the target of several scouts and coaches, with his character off the field often being called into question.",

    "title": "When the F-word is 'fluoride.' Florida may be next to ban the mineral from water supplies.",
    "article_text": "Florida is poised to become the second state to ban the long-standing practice of adding fluoride to public water systems. State senators have already cleared a bill that would prohibit community water fluoridation, and Florida’s House is expected to vote on a similar bill in the coming week. The word “fluoride” isn’t found anywhere in the Florida Farm Bill, but it would be included because the legislation aims to ban “the use of certain additives in a water system” throughout the state. If Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, signs the bill, Florida will become the second to ban fluoride from water supplies. Utah’s Gov. Spencer Cox, also a Republican, signed a bill in late March that prohibits any person or government entity fromadding the cavity-fighting mineral from the state’s water systems. The Utah rule will go into effect on May 7. Similar legislation is making its way through other states, includingKentucky,MassachusettsandNebraska. In Wisconsin, nearly 80 communities have already voted to stop adding fluoride, according to the state’s Department of Natural Resources, and others in the state are considering a ban. AndUnion County in North Carolinavoted last year to remove fluoride from drinking water. Like the anti-vaccine movement, the push to pull fluoride from water has been gaining momentum for several decades. It’s grown more powerful with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as head of the Department of Health and Human Services. Earlier this month, Kennedy said he was planning to tell the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tostop recommending fluoridebe added to water supplies. The agency doesn’t make official recommendations on fluoride, however. Those come from the U.S. Public Health Service, composed of members from various federal health public health agencies. He also said at the event, without providing evidence, that “we know that there is no systemic advantage” to preventing tooth decay by drinking fluoridated water. “You can achieve that benefit from brushing teeth.” Water fluoridation has long been heralded as one of the top public health initiatives of the last century for its ability to drive down tooth decay. While defending fluoride in a Florida Senate debate on April 16, Sen. Tina Scott Polsky, a Democrat, said, “Find me a dentist who thinks we should get rid of fluoride.” The bill passed the Senate on April 16. The Florida House is controlled by Republicans and is expected to vote against fluoridation. Lorna Koci, head of the Utah Oral Health Coalition, an advocacy group that promotes oral health initiatives among Medicaid beneficiaries, said the movement against fluoride has nothing to do with health and science. “It really is a political issue,” she said. Kennedy, who has no training in medicine or dentistry, has previously referred to fluoride as “industrial waste” on thesocial media platform Xand said onMSNBCthat the faster the mineral goes away, the better. Historically, dentists and other oral health experts would have been vocal defenders of fluoride. Now, many feel that they’re in a losing battle against the anti-fluoride movement and worry about speaking publicly in favor of the mineral. “It’s like a four-letter word,” a public health dentist in the Southeast said. The mere mention of fluoride, even in the context of public education, is forbidden by superiors, the staffer said. “We can’t defend the science we believe in,” said another public health dentist in the Upper Midwest. Opposition to both fluoride and vaccines has become more vocal locally because of what’s happening on the national level, he said. “It’s basically giving them a boost.” Public health dentists work with a state or county to increase dental care access in underserved communities and promote oral health overall. Last month, the Trump administrationpulled more than $11 billionearmarked for state public health departments. As part of the mass layoffs at health agencies ordered by Kennedy, HHSgutted the CDC’s oral health division, which provides funds to states and local jurisdictions to promote good dental health practices, including the use of fluoride. Dentists argue that while fluoridated toothpaste is critical in preventing cavities, underserved communities may not be able to afford it. Many, they say, are unable to go to a dentist for fluoride treatments. Dr. Johnny Johnson, a pediatric dentist and president of the American Fluoridation Society, a fluoride advocacy group, said legislators opposed to water fluoridation “need to be skewered over total disregard for our residents’ health.” An HHS spokesman didn’t respond to a question about how the federal government might address those disparities. Speaking publicly about the benefits of the mineral might result in a target on the backs of health departments already strapped for cash, fluoride advocates say. A year ago, “fluoride was fine to bring up” in discussions with public health leaders, said Koci. Now, “I think many people in public health are feeling like they need to just lay low. It’s probably very risky to be taking a position on a topic that is so political and controversial.” Major public health groups, including theAmerican Dental Association, theAmerican Academy of Pediatricsand theCDC, support the use of fluoridated water. All cite studies that show it reduces tooth decay by 25%. Before the Florida Senate vote, more than a dozen jurisdictions in the state, including Seminole County, had banned water fluoridation despite decades of the mineral being safely used in the water supply and evidence that it fights cavities. In November 2024, the state’s surgeon general, Joseph Ladapo, saidcommunities should stop adding fluoride to drinking waterbecause of what he called “neuropsychiatric risk.” At least one of those bans has been overruled.Miami Mayor Daniella Levine Cava promised to vetoher county commissioners’ vote to remove fluoride. “While it may be relatively simple to stop adding fluoride as directed in the resolution, the long-term effects of doing so are anything but simple, and so we must consider the long-term consequences,” Levine Cava said during a news conference earlier this month. “Ending fluoridation could have real and lasting harm, especially for children and families who cannot afford regular dental care.” Similar to the anti-vaccine movement, which has focused on widely debunkedresearch associating the mumps, measles and rubella shots with autism, groups opposed to fluoride tend to seize on a study that suggests the mineral is a neurotoxin that lowers children’s level of intelligence. Astudy published in 2019suggested that IQ levels were slightly lower in kids whose mothers had higher measures of fluoride in their urine during pregnancy. The research wasfar from conclusive. Other studies looking athow fluoride affects children’s brainshave been called “low quality” by health scientists and were conducted in other countries. Another public health dentist said that faced with extensive funding cuts for any public health measures, fluoride isn’t “the hill they want to die on.” Dentists predict they’ll see a jump in dental decay, especially among kids, in the coming years. Dr. Tom Reid, president of the Wisconsin Dental Association, said that within the next three to five years, those towns can expect to see a significant increase in rates of tooth decay. “It’s disheartening,” Reid said. Dentists aren’t pushing for fluoride for their own benefit, he said. “We’re really trying to act in what is the best for the health of our patients, for the health of our communities.” It’s what happened in the Canadian city of Calgary, for example, after leaders there voted to remove fluoride from public water in 2011. A decade later, they voted to reinstate community water fluoridation amid a significant rise in cavities among kids. In Seminole County, Florida, which voted earlier this month to get fluoride out of the water system, utilities director Johnny Edwards said during the meeting that it would save the county at least $100,000. When asked whether the county would set aside that money to treat a potential increase in cavities, Chris Patton, a spokesman for the county, chuckled. No, he said, it will simply be reabsorbed into the county’s utilities department.",

Diddy’s trial appears to be the most high-profile judicial assignment to date for Subramanian, who once clerked for the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg before working at the white shoe Manhattan law firm Susman Godfrey. Diddy’s lead attorneys are no strangers to high-profile cases.Marc Antony Agnifilo, a veteran criminal defense lawyer, previously represented NXIVM sex cult leader Keith Raniere, former Goldman Sachs banker Roger Ng, former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn and “Pharma Bro” Martin Shkreli. Agnifilo will be joined byTeny Geragos,one of the partners at his firm. She is “particularly experienced in defending and investigating allegations of sexual misconduct,” the firm’s website says. She is also the daughter of famed defense lawyer Mark Geragos, whose clients have included artists Michael Jackson and Chris Brown. The court docket lists five other attorneys on Diddy’s side, includingAlexandra ShapiroandBrian Steel. Steel, who recently joined the defense team, represented rapper Young Thug in Georgia’s longest-running criminal trial. The same docket lists eight lawyers for the federal government, five of whom are designated as leads for the prosecution. They includeEmily Anne Johnson,Madison Reddick Smyser,Mary Christine Slavik,Meredith FosterandMitzi Steiner. The prosecution’s side featuresMaurene Ryan Comey, too. She’s a veteran of the Southern District who helped secure a conviction against British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell for conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein. Maurene Comey is the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey.",

    "title": "Letter written onboard the Titanic before it sank sells for almost $400,000 at auction",
    "article_text": "LONDON — A lettercard penned by one ofthe Titanic’s most well-known survivors from onboard the ship, days before it sank, has sold for $399,000 (300,000 pounds) at auction. In the note, written to the seller’s great-uncle on April 10, 1912, first-class passengerArchibald Graciewrote of the ill-fated steamship: “It is a fine ship but I shall await my journeys end before I pass judgment on her.” The letter was sold to a private collector from the United States on Saturday, according to auction house Henry Aldridge & Son in Wiltshire, England. The hammer price far exceeded the initial estimate price of 60,000 pounds. The letter is believed to be the sole example in existence from Gracie from onboard the Titanic, which sank off Newfoundland after hitting an iceberg, killing about 1,500 people on its maiden voyage. Auctioneer Andrew Aldridge described it as an “exceptional museum grade piece.” Gracie, who jumped from the ship and managed to scramble onto an overturned collapsible boat, was rescued by other passengers onboard a lifeboat and was taken to the R.M.S. Carpathia. He went on to write “The Truth about the Titanic,” an account of his experiences, when he returned to New York City. Gracie boarded the Titanic in Southampton on April 10, 1912, and was assigned first-class cabin C51. His book is seen as one of the most detailed accounts of the events of the night the ship sank, Aldridge said. Gracie did not fully recover from the hypothermia he suffered, and died of complications from diabetes in late 1912. The letter was postmarked Queenstown, Ireland, one of two stops the Titanic made before sinking.",

    "article_text": "Wrexham AFC is just one step away from English soccer's Premier League after being promoted into the system’s second tier — the Red Dragons' third straight promotion. The Welsh soccer team,owned by Hollywood stars Ryan Reynoldsand Rob McElhenney, advanced to the top tier of the English Football League — or the Championship — after beating Charlton 3-0 on Saturday. Reynolds and McElhenney celebrated the win alongside thousands of fans who stormed the home field, despite police warnings for those who invaded the pitch. “It just seemed like an impossible dream,” Reynolds said after the win,according to the Associated Press, reflecting on his team’s third promotion in three seasons. “We said five years ago our goal was to make it to the Premier League. There were understandably a lot of laughs, but it feels like a thing that could make it to fruition right now.” Wrexham kicked off Saturday’s game withtwo goals in three minutes, leaving them with a comfortable lead early on. Striker Sam Smith sealed the dealwith the third goalin the 81st minute of play. The team — the oldest in Wales and third-oldest soccer team in the world — will spend next season sitting just below the coveted Premier League. When Reynolds and McElhenney took the reins in 2021, Wrexham was in the National League, making it seem unlikely that the team would so quickly be within spitting distance of the top tier of English soccer. “The owners have come in and done an amazing job. I’m so pleased for them because they deserve it,” manager Phil Parkinson said, according to the AP. “They’re invested in all the decisions, but they trust us in in our decision making and that’s why we’ve had success over the last three years.\"",

    "title": "'Master of Mutilation' charged with supporting Cameroon separatist groups",
    "article_text": "A federal grand jury has indicted a Maryland man on charges of making threatening communications to kidnap and injure Cameroon citizens and providing material support to separatist groups,federal prosecutorsannounced Friday. Eric Tataw, 38, of Gaithersburg, who  allegedly refers to himself as the \"Garri master\" a term he coined referring to mutilation, ordered violent groups to murder, kidnap and maim civilians in support of the  violence separatist fighters use against the Cameroonian government, prosecutors said. A Cameroonian national, Tataw surrendered and was set to make his initial court appearance on Friday, the department said. \"The defendant is alleged to have ordered horrific acts of violence, including severing limbs, against Cameroonian civilians in support of a violent secessionist movement,\" said Matthew Galeotti, head of the Justice Department's Criminal Division, in the release. Tataw allegedly referred to the dismemberment as \"Garriing,\" using the phrase \"small Garri\" for smaller appendages and \"large Garri\" for limbs or murder, prosecutors said. He allegedly referred to himself as the \"Garri master.\" The separatist fighters, referred to as \"Amba Boys,\" are calling for the Northwest and Southwest regions to form a new country called \"Ambazonia,\" prosecutors said. The Amba Boys' strategies include attacking the Cameroonian military and civilians in efforts to pressure the government into allowing the regions to secede. The violence in the western regions of Cameroon sparked in 2016, when French-speaking judges and teachers were sent to English-speaking regions, sparking Anglophone demonstrations and protests that Francophones were attempting to reduce their political and cultural significance, according to theU.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants. Cameroon inheritedtwo legal systems— English common law and French civil law — following split colonial rule in the early 20th century. When military forces violently broke up the protests in 2016, the current “Anglophone crisis” began. The indictment alleges that Tataw began to raise funds in April 2018 to finance the Amba Boys’ attacks in the western regions. Prosecutors said Tataw, with a large social media following, wrote hundreds of posts across Facebook, YouTube and Twitter calling for the civilian attacks and seeing funds to arm the Amba Boys. The posts regularly received tens of thousands of views, and the Amba Boys, and Tataw allegedly directed other third parties to circulate the posts further, the department said. \"From about September 2018 through December 2020, Tataw and his co-conspirators raised more than $110,000,\" the release stated. \"Tataw and co-conspirators transferred portions of these funds — either directly or through intermediaries — to Amba Boys located in Cameroon and neighboring Nigeria.\" Any alleged co-conspirators were not named in the release. The \"National AK Campaign\" sought to arm each Amba Boy with an AK-47 rifle in Cameroon, the department said. Prosecutors said funds supplied Amba Boys with explosive materials and items for enforced lockdowns or \"ghost-town\" orders. Tataw is alleged to have communicated with the Amba Boy leaders directly, repeatedly taking personal credit for the group's murders and kidnappings, the release stated. Tataw allegedly threatened and targeted people he believed were cooperating with the Cameroonian government, such as municipal officials and traditional chiefs, the release stated. Employees of the Cameroon Development Corporation, a public company that grows, processes and sells products like bananas and rubber, were also target, prosecutors said. Tataw also called for public, educational and cultural properties to be destroyed, according to the release. \"Tataw and his co-conspirators masterminded and financially supported a vicious scheme to overthrow a foreign government,\" said U.S. Attorney Kelly O. Hayes for the District of Maryland in the release. \"They resorted to an unthinkable level of violence while instilling fear in innocent victims to advance their political agenda.\" Tataw is charged with four counts of interstate communication of a threat to harm and one count of conspiracy to provide material support. If convicted, he could face a maximum penalty of five years on each count of communication of threat to harm, and up to 15 years on the material support count.",

    "title": "World Pride event organizers change venues after Trump's Kennedy Center takeover",
    "article_text": "Several LGBTQ+ pride events to be held as part of Washington, D.C.’s World Pride celebrations in May and June have been relocated from the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. The affected events include an International Pride Orchestra concert, a drag story hour and Pride-related art exhibits, including one featuring panels from the AIDS Memorial Quilt. The Associated Press wasthe first to reporton the changes. Event organizers say some were moved after the Kennedy Center informed them that it would not move forward with contracts to host them, while others were moved proactively after President Donald Trumpabruptly firedseveral members of the Kennedy Center Board of Trustees in February and made himself chairman. The presidentwrote in a Truth Social postat the time, “Just last year, the Kennedy Center featured Drag Shows specifically targeting our youth — THIS WILL STOP.” Ryan Bos, executive director of the Capital Pride Alliance, a group that is one of the main organizers of World Pride, described the post as the “writing on the wall” that prompted his group to move the gatherings it planned to host at the Kennedy Center elsewhere. “The Kennedy Center, as an arts and cultural institution, this is a type of space that has been a safe haven for our communities from the dawn of time,” Bos told NBC News, adding that Trump’s message “goes counter to what pride is about.” Now, the group’s programming will take place at its World Pride Welcome Center in downtown Washington. Another event — the International Pride Orchestra’s Pride Celebration concert — will now take place at Strathmore, a concert venue in Bethesda, Maryland. The orchestra’s leaders were informed via email on Feb. 12, just days after Trump’s announcement, that it would not be performing at the venue. “We are not in a position at this time to advance a contract,” the email said, according to a press release from the International Pride Orchestra. That same month, the Gay Men’s Chorus of Washington, D.C., and the National Symphony Orchestrawere also informedthat an event they were planning to host at the Kennedy Center in May would not move forward. The Kennedy Center did not immediately respond to NBC News’ request for comment on this article. In a statement, Michael Roest, the founding artistic director of the International Pride Orchestra, said orchestra members were “heartbroken” when they realized they would not be able to perform at the Kennedy Center during World Pride. His statement also thanked Strathmore for opening its doors, saying, “Their willingness to host our Pride Celebration Concert ensures that our message of love, pride, and resilience will be heard on the doorstep of the nation’s capital.” Capital Pride’s Bos echoed Roest, emphasizing the importance of moving forward with plans for World Pride, especially in Washington, as the nation’s capital celebrates 50 years of hosting annual Pride celebrations. “World Pride is not canceled,” Bos said. “Every year World Pride is important, but this year there’s a very strong historic moment that we must meet … to ensure our community is not scared back into the closet.”",

    "title": "More Americans are financing groceries with buy now, pay later loans — and more are paying those bills late, survey says",
    "article_text": "A growing number of Americans are using buy now, pay later loans to buy groceries, and more people are paying those bills late, according to new Lending Tree datareleased Friday. The figures are the latest indicator that someconsumers are crackingunder the pressure of an uncertain economy and are having trouble affordingessentials such as groceriesas they contend with persistent inflation, high interest rates andconcerns around tariffs. In a survey conducted April 2-3 of 2,000 U.S. consumers ages 18 to 79, around half reported having used buy now, pay later services. Of those consumers, 25% of respondents said they were using BNPL loans to buy groceries, up from 14% in 2024 and 21% in 2023, the firm said. Meanwhile, 41% of respondents said they made a late payment on a BNPL loan in the past year, up from 34% in the year prior, the survey found. Lending Tree’s chief consumer finance analyst, Matt Schulz, said that of those respondents who said they paid a BNPL bill late, most said it was by no more than a week or so. “A lot of people are struggling and looking for ways to extend their budget,” Schulz said. “Inflation is still a problem. Interest rates are still really high. There’s a lot of uncertainty around tariffs and other economic issues, and it’s all going to add up to a lot of people looking for ways to extend their budget however they can.” “For an awful lot of people, that’s going to mean leaning on buy now, pay later loans, for better or for worse,” he said. He stopped short of calling the results a recession indicator but said conditions are expected to decline further before they get better. “I do think it’s going to get worse, at least in the short term,” said Schulz. “I don’t know that there’s a whole lot of reason to expect these numbers to get better in the near term.” The loans, which allow consumers to split up purchases into several smaller payments, are apopular alternative to credit cardsbecause they often don’t charge interest. But consumers can seehigh fees if they pay late, and they can run into problems if they stack up multiple loans. In Lending Tree’s survey, 60% of BNPL users said they’ve had multiple loans at once, with nearly a fourth saying they have held three or more at once. “It’s just really important for people to be cautious when they use these things, because even though they can be a really good interest-free tool to help you kind of make it from one paycheck to the next, there’s also a lot of risk in mismanaging it,” said Schulz. “So people should tread lightly.” Lending Tree’s findings come afterBillboard revealedthat about 60% of general admission Coachella attendees funded their concert tickets with buy now, pay later loans, sparking a debate on the state of the economy and how consumers are using debt to keep up their lifestyles. A recent announcement from DoorDash that it wouldbegin accepting BNPL financing from Klarnafor food deliveries led to widespread mockery and jokes that Americans were struggling so much that they were now being forced to finance cheeseburgers and burritos. Over the last few years, consumers have held up relatively well, even in the face of persistent inflation and high interest rates, because the job market was strong and wage growth had kept up with inflation — at least for some workers. Earlier this year, however, large companies includingWalmartandDelta Airlinesbegan warning that the dynamic had begun to shift and they were seeing cracks in demand, which was leading to worse-than-expected sales forecasts.",

    "title": "What student loan forgiveness opportunities still remain under Trump",
    "article_text": "Under the Biden administration, the U.S. Department of Education maderegular announcementsthat it was forgiving student debt for thousands of people under various relief programs and repayment plans. That’s changed underPresident Donald Trump. In his first few months in office, Trump — who has long been critical of education debt cancellation — signed an executive order aimed atlimiting eligibility for the popular Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, and his Education Department revised somestudent loan repayment plansto no longer conclude in debt erasure. “You have the administration trying to limit PSLF credits, and clear attacks on the income-based repayment with forgiveness options,” said Malissa Giles, a consumer bankruptcy attorney in Virginia. The White House did not respond to CNBC’s request for comment. Here’s what to know about the current status of federal student loan forgiveness opportunities. The Biden administration’s new student loan repayment plan,Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, isn’t expected to survive under Trump, experts say. A U.S. appeals court alreadyblockedthe planinFebruary after a GOP-led challenge to the program. SAVE came with two key provisions that lawsuits targeted: It had lower monthly payments than any other federal student loan repayment plan, and it led to quicker debt erasure for those with small balances. “I personally think you will see SAVE dismantled through the courts or the administration,” Giles said. But the Education Department under Trump is now arguing that the ruling by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals required it to end the loan forgiveness under repayment plans beyond SAVE. As a result, the Pay As You Earn and Income-Contingent Repayment options no longer wipe debt away after a certain number of years. There’s some good news: At least one repayment plan still leads to debt erasure, said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. That plan is called Income-Based Repayment. If a borrower enrolled in ICR or PAYE eventually switches to IBR, their previous payments made under the other plans will count toward loan forgiveness under IBR, as long as they meet the IBR’sother requirements, Kantrowitz said. (Some borrowers may opt to take that strategy if they have a lower monthly bill under ICR or PAYE than they would on IBR.) Despite Trump’s executive order in March aimed at limiting eligibility forPublic Service Loan Forgiveness, the program remains intact. Any changes to the program would likely take months or longer to materialize, and may even need congressional approval, experts say. PSLF, which President George W. Bush signed into law in 2007, allows many not-for-profit and government employees to have their federal student loans canceled after 10 years of payments. What’s more, any changes to PSLF can’t be retroactive, consumer advocates say. That means that if you are currently working for or previously worked for an organization that the Trump administration later excludes from the program, you’ll still get credit for that time — at least up until when the changes go into effect. For now, the language in the president’s executive order was fairly vague. As a result, it remains unclear exactly which organizations will no longer be considered a qualifying employer under PSLF, experts said. However, in his first few months in office, Trump has targeted immigrants,transgender and nonbinary peopleand those who work to increase diversity across the private and public sector. Many nonprofits work in these spaces, providing legal support or doing advocacy and education work. For now, those pursuing PSLF should print out a copy of their payment history onStudentAid.govor request one from their loan servicer. They should keep a record of the number of qualifying payments they’ve made so far, said Jessica Thompson, senior vice president of The Institute for College Access & Success. “We urge borrowers to save all documentation of their payments, payment counts, and employer certifications to ensure they have any information that might be useful in the future,” Thompson said. Federal student loan borrowers also remain entitled to a number of other student loan forgiveness opportunities. TheTeacher Loan Forgiveness programoffers up to $17,500 in loan cancellation to those who’ve worked full time for “complete and consecutive academic years in a low-income school or educational service agency,” among other requirements, according to the Education Department. (One thing to note: This program can’t be combined with PSLF, and so borrowers should decide which avenue makes the most sense for them.) In less common circumstances, you may be eligible for a full discharge of your federal student loans underBorrower Defenseif your school closed while you were enrolled or if you were misled by your school or didn’t receive a quality education. Borrowers may qualify for aTotal and Permanent Disabilitydischarge if they suffer from a mental or physical disability that is severe and permanent and prevents them from working. Proof of the disability can come from a doctor, the Social Security Administration or the Department of Veterans Affairs. With the federal government rolling back student loan forgiveness measures, experts also recommend that borrowers explore the manystate-level relief programsavailable. The Institute of Student Loan Advisors hasa databaseof student loan forgiveness programs by state.",

    "title": "Health program for 9/11 illnesses faces uncertain future after federal staffing cuts",
    "article_text": "More than 23 years after the Twin Towers collapsed, blanketing lower Manhattan in toxic dust and debris, the number of people diagnosed with 9/11-related illnesses is still growing. Since 2011, the main resource for people exposed to the fumes has been the World Trade Center Health Program, which covers treatment for cancer, asthma and post-traumatic stress disorder, among other health conditions. Of the roughly 132,000 peopleenrolled in the programas of December, 64% have at least one condition linked to 9/11. Cancer is the most common, affecting more than 40,000 members. Some people join the program after an illness has developed, while others join to receive annual screenings that could detect illnesses in the future. The program’s fate has seesawed over the past 10 weeks as the Trump administration fired and rehired certain staffers, only to terminate them again last month, according to lawyers and advocates for people with 9/11-related exposures. They added that the staffing cuts have made it harder to enroll members or confirm that their treatment is covered by federal funding. “These cuts are going to potentially delay treatment, delay diagnosis and early detection of their cancers, and it’s going to cost lives,” said Todd Cleckley, a nurse medical specialist at Barasch & McGarry, a law firm representing 9/11 responders and survivors. “The health program already operated on a very slim staffing margin,” he added. “We’re only beginning to see what those negative impacts will be.” Sixteen of the program’s staffers were swept up in the Trump administration’sfiring of probationary workersin February. The administration reinstated the positions roughly a week later, following outcry from bothRepublicansandDemocratsin Congress. Then in late March the Department of Health and Human Services announced it was laying off around 20,000 federal employees. Those layoffs again included 16 staffers at the World Trade Center Health Program, plus the program’s director, according to lawyers and advocates. The director was reinstated on April 5 aftermore bipartisan opposition, they said, but the staffers were not. The HHS layoffs were part of a massive restructuring that gutted the agency responsible for the World Trade Center program, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). In addition to the 16 staffers, HHS terminated other institute employees in charge of certifying that patients’ 9/11-related illnesses were eligible for federal funding, lawyers and advocates said. “They weren’t on the World Trade Center Program payroll, but they did things that are essential to the program running,” said Benjamin Chevat, executive director of 9/11 Health Watch, a nonprofit group that helps ensure people have access to the program’s services. Lawyers and advocates plan to visit Capitol Hill on Tuesday to ask lawmakers to reinstate staffers. HHS did not respond to a request for comment. New York City Mayor Eric Adams said that his office has reached out to the federal government “about restoring these important resources.” “New York City is dedicated to providing quality health care to the heroes who responded on 9/11 and the survivors of the most tragic day in America’s history,” Adams said in a statement. “Our partnership with the federal government to deliver these services is vital, providing access to life-saving, time-sensitive treatment for every firefighter, police officer, volunteer, and everyday New Yorkers who remember that day, and remember what it took to rebuild the next morning.” Before the staffing cuts, 9/11 responders and people who lived, worked or attended school or day care in the disaster area could apply to join the program and typically get accepted within a few weeks. But Chevat said no one has been enrolled since April 1. The programusually enrolls around 200 people per month, on average. Michael Barasch, a partner at Barasch & McGarry, said he’s still submitting applications on behalf of his clients, but “they’re not hearing from the health program, so we don’t know if or when they will ever get an appointment.” Members of the program receive annual screenings at certified health clinics, which are largely concentrated in the New York area. There, doctors evaluate people fora host of mental and physical illnesseswith known ties to 9/11. If a doctor determines there’s a link, the clinic submits paperwork to federal employees, who must certify that the condition is eligible for funding before patients can be treated at no cost. More than 8,200 cancer diagnoses were certified last year. New certifications haven’t been issued since the start of April, shortly after HHS announced it was dismantling NIOSH, Chevat said. The delays could have dire consequences for people who were exposed to toxic dust and debris, lawyers and advocates said. Many cancers — once identified — must be treated right away. “You’ll never hear me say something inflammatory just to make a headline, but it is a fact: People will die because of these decisions,” Barasch said. The collapse of the Twin Towers released cancer-causing chemicals such as asbestos, benzene and dioxins that lingered in the air for days to weeks. A10-year studyfound an elevated risk of leukemia and prostate and thyroid cancers among rescue and recovery workers who responded to the disaster. Other cancers, such as lung cancer and mesothelioma,may develop decades after exposure to asbestos, so future diagnoses are expected. “We were breathing in glass and asbestos and everything else that you could imagine,” said Michael O’Connell, who assisted with search-and-rescue operations as an early-career firefighter after 9/11. “We slept in it, we ate in it, we bled in it. We didn’t leave it. We were in that zone for almost nine months.” Roughly six years later, O’Connell was diagnosed with a rare inflammatory disease called sarcoidosis that caused debilitating pain in his joints and skin. He received treatment through the World Trade Center Health Program, which he credits for helping him manage his symptoms. The idea that new members might not be able to enroll or receive treatment is “deeply disturbing,” he said. If the NIOSH staffers aren’t reinstated, lawyers and advocates said, hospitals may not get reimbursed for chemotherapy or surgeries and eventually may stop offering them to patients. Barasch said he has already received calls from clients worried about whether they can continue to get chemo. ‘“It’s bureaucratic cruelty,” he said. “They’re trying to save money, which is fine, but don’t do it on the backs of the 9/11 community.” Mariama James, a lower Manhattan resident who was pregnant with her third child during 9/11, said she has been waiting to see if the program will cover a treatment for her sleep apnea. She now expects that process to be delayed. “How are they going to get a new medication covered if the doctors from NIOSH have been fired?” James said. “I’ll be waiting forever for that medication.” The World Trade Center Health Program was already vulnerable before the layoffs due to budgetary constraints, Barasch added. In December, Congress opted not to include a long-term funding package for the program in a bipartisan spending deal. Several lawmakers anticipate that the budget shortfall could force the program toclose enrollment or scale back treatmentfor current members starting in October 2028. A bipartisan billintroduced in the Senate in Februarycalls for more funding to be made available until the program expires in 2090. In addition to lobbying for program staffers to be rehired, lawyers and advocates will ask legislators on Tuesday to back the bill.",

    "article_text": "MUSCAT, Oman — A massive explosion and fire rocked a port Saturday in southern Iran purportedly linked to a shipment of a chemical ingredient used to make missile propellant, killing 14 people and injuring more than 750 others. Helicopters dumped water from the air on the raging fire hours after the initial explosion, which happened at the Shahid Rajaei port just asIran and the United States metSaturday in Oman for the third round of negotiations over Tehran’s rapidly advancing nuclear program. No one in Iran outright suggested that the explosion came from an attack. However, even Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who led the talks, on Wednesday acknowledged that “our security services are on high alert given past instances of attempted sabotage and assassination operations designed to provoke a legitimate response.” Iranian Interior Minister Eskandar Momeni gave the casualty figure in an interview on state television. But there were few details on what sparked the blaze just outside of Bandar Abbas, which burned into Saturday night, causing other containers to reportedly explode. The port took in a shipment of “sodium perchlorate rocket fuel” in March, the private security firm Ambrey said. The fuel is part of a shipment from China by two vessels to Iran first reported in January by the Financial Times. The fuel was going to be used to replenish Iran’s missile stocks, which had been depleted by its direct attacks on Israel during the war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip. “The fire was reportedly the result of improper handling of a shipment of solid fuel intended for use in Iranian ballistic missiles,” Ambrey said. Ship-tracking data analyzed by The Associated Press put one of the vessels believed to be carrying the chemical in the vicinity in March, as Ambrey said. Iran hasn’t acknowledged taking the shipment. The Iranian mission to the United Nations didn’t respond to a request for comment on Saturday. It’s unclear why Iran wouldn’t have moved the chemicals from the port, particularly after the Beirut port blast in 2020. That explosion, caused by the ignition of hundreds of tons of highly explosive ammonium nitrate, killed more than 200 people and injured more than 6,000 others. However, Israel did target Iranian missile sites where Tehran uses industrial mixers to create solid fuel. Social media footage of the explosion on Saturday at Shahid Rajaei saw reddish-hued smoke rising from the fire just before the detonation. That suggests a chemical compound being involved in the blast — like in the Beirut explosion. “Get back get back! Tell the gas (truck) to go!” a man in one video shouted just before the blast. “Tell him to go, it’s going to blow up! Oh God, this is blowing up! Everybody evacuate! Get back! Get back!” On Saturday night, the state-run IRNA news agency said that the Customs Administration of Iran blamed a “stockpile of hazardous goods and chemical materials stored in the port area” for the blast, without elaborating. An aerial shot released by Iranian media after the blast showed fires burning at multiple locations in the port, with authorities later warning about air pollution from chemicals such as ammonia, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide in the air. Schools in Bandar Abbas will be closed Sunday as well. Shahid Rajaei has been a target before. A 2020 cyberattack attributed to Israel targeted the port. It came after Israel said that it thwarted a cyberattack targeting its water infrastructure, which it attributed to Iran. Israeli officials didn’t respond to requests for comment regarding Saturday’s explosion. Social media videos showed black billowing smoke after the blast. Others showed glass blown out of buildings kilometers, or miles, away from the epicenter of the explosion. State media footage showed the injured crowding into at least one hospital, with ambulances arriving as medics rushed one person by on a stretcher. Hasanzadeh, the provincial disaster management official, earlier told state television that the blast came from containers at Shahid Rajaei port in the city, without elaborating. State television also reported that there had been a building collapse caused by the explosion, though no further details were offered. The Interior Ministry said that it launched an investigation into the blast. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian also offered his condolences for those affected in the blast. Shahid Rajaei port in Hormozgan province is about 1,050 kilometers 650 miles southeast of Iran’s capital, Tehran, on the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which 20% of all oil traded passes.",

    "title": "Trump questions Putin's commitment to ending Ukraine war",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump on Saturday questioned Russian President Vladimir Putin’s commitment to ending the war in Ukraine after Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the sidelines of Pope Francis’ funeral in Rome. “There was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days,” the U.S. president wrote in a post on Truth Social, referencingthe Russian military strikesin Ukraine this week that killed and wounded dozens of people. “It makes me think that maybe he doesn’t want to stop the war, he’s just tapping me along,” Trump added, suggesting that maybe Putin “has to be dealt with differently, through ‘Banking’ or ‘Secondary Sanctions?’” Imposing further sanctions on Russia is an idea that has bipartisan support in the U.S., with a bipartisan group of 50 senators — 25 Democrats and 25 Republicans — earlier this monthintroducing a billthat would impose additional sanctions on Russia. Trump has for weeks been advocating in favor of a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, and on Friday hehintedthat a deal could be close to the finish line,urging Russia and Ukraine to meet for “very high level” talks. Earlier in the week, Trump hadslammed Zelesnkyyfor rejecting the terms of any peace deal that would allow Russia to retain control ofCrimea, which it annexed against Ukraine’s will in 2014. In apost on Xafter meeting with Trump in Rome, Zelenskyy thanked the American president and called the meeting “good” and “symbolic.” The Ukrainian president added that he is “hoping for results on everything we covered,” which included: “Protecting lives of our people. Full and unconditional ceasefire. Reliable and lasting peace that will prevent another war from breaking out.” Zelenskyy added that the exchange with Trump has the “potential to become historic, if we achieve joint results.” In his Truth Social post on Saturday, Trump blamed his predecessors, Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, for allowing Russia to annex Crimea. “It was Obama who made it possible for Russia to steal Crimea from Ukraine without even a shot being fired,” Trump wrote, adding later in the post: “I’m just trying to clean up the mess that was left to me by Obama and Biden, and what a mess it is.” Trump and Zelenskyy’s meeting in Rome was their first face-to-face interaction since the Ukrainian president’svisit to the White Housein February. During that visit,an Oval Office meeting devolved into a shouting match between Trump, Zelenskyy and Vice President JD Vance, with Trump and Vance telling Zelenskyy he wasn’t grateful enough for the United States’ continued support in the war. While in Rome, Zelenskyy also met with European leaders, including U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron, who wrote in French on X that he had a “very positive exchange today” with Zelenskyy. “Ending the war in Ukraine is the goal we share with President Trump. Ukraine is ready for an unconditional ceasefire. President Zelensky reiterated this to me today. He wants to work alongside the Americans and Europeans to implement it. Now it’s up to President Putin to prove that he really wants peace,” Macron added. Zelenskyy said his discussion with Starmer focused on “the steps necessary to establish a full, unconditional ceasefire and to develop further security guarantees.”",

In 1977, when Herman was 29 years old, then-President Jimmy Carter selected her to lead the Women's Bureau at the Department of Labor. In a 1977 interview with NPR, Herman described the bureau's mission to serve women in the workplace. \"That means help women to get jobs,\" Herman said. \"That means to help women find out about opportunities for jobs. That means informing women of their rights if they're being discriminated against.\" Herman went on to work on the 1988 presidential campaign of civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, and in 1992, she became the first Black woman to hold the position of CEO of the Democratic National Convention before joining the Clinton administration. \"I believe that our lives are a gift from God. And what we do with our lives is a gift to God,\"Herman saidafter receiving an award from the National Political Congress of Black Women in 1996. \"I have been very blessed to have been used as an instrument for change in our ongoing collective struggle, for us as Black women, to say that we, too, 'sing America.'\" At her confirmation hearing for secretary of labor, Herman received strong bipartisan support, including from staunch conservatives like former Republican Sens.

    "article_text": "By Alana Wise Demonstrators gather to protest on Thursday against the deportation of immigrants to El Salvador outside the Permanent Mission of El Salvador to the United Nations in New York City.Michael M. Santiago/Getty Imageshide caption A Trump-nominated federal judge in Louisiana said that a 2-year-old American citizen appears to have been deported \"with no meaningful process.\" This comes as the Trump administration has faced growing criticisms for its hurried proceedings to remove as many noncitizens from the country as quickly as possible. U.S. District Judge Terry Doughtywrotethat the toddler, identified as VML, had been sent to Honduras on Friday, alongside her mother and sister, even as the court had sought to clarify the girl's status. He set a hearing on the case for May 16 \"in the interest of dispelling our strong suspicion that the Government just deported a U.S. citizen with no meaningful process.\" On Friday afternoon, Doughty had called counsel for the federal government to try to speak with VML's mother and better understand the child's situation, but VML and her family were already \"above the Gulf of America,\" the judge wrote, using President Trump's preferred term for the Gulf of Mexico. \"The Government contends that this is all okay because the mother wishes that the child be deported with her,\" Doughty wrote. \"But the Court doesn'tknowthat.\" According toa lawsuitfiled on VML's behalf, she and her family were taken into U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody on Tuesday while attending a routine check-in with the mother's Intensive Supervision Appearance Program (ISAP). ISAP isan alternativeto detention for noncitizens who are in the country unlawfully. It is not immediately clear what was flagged during that meeting to trigger deportation proceedings for VML's mother and sister. But according to a court petition, her father, who had dropped the trio off at the meeting, was informed about an hour after the start of the meeting that his partner and two daughters had been taken into custody. The suit alleges that ICE agents repeatedly refused to give VML's father her location and denied him the opportunity to speak for more than a minute to VML's mother. \"V.M.L.'s father received a call from an ICE officer, who spoke to him for about a minute,\" the filing said. \"The officer said that V.M.L.'s mother was there, and that they did not have much time to speak to each other and that they were going to deport his partner and daughters. V.M.L.'s father was able to speak with his partner for only about or less than a minute. He heard his daughters crying and his partner crying,\" the filing said. According to the suit, at one point as VML's father tried to secure her release, New Orleans ICE Field Office Director Mellissa Harper began interrogating the family's attorney about the father's immigration status and attempted to lure him into custody as well. In an emailed statement to NPR, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversees ICE, defended its decision. \"The parents made the decision to take the child with them to Honduras. It is common that parents want to be removed with their children,\" said Tricia McLaughlin, DHS' assistant secretary for public affairs. The agency did not respond to further request for comment as to why McLaughlin implied that both parents had supported VML's deportation to Honduras when her father ostensibly remains in the United States. VML is just the latest to be ensnared in the messy legal process as the Trump administration has rushed to remove as many undocumented immigrants as it can. Last month, a Maryland man,Kilmar Abrego Garcia, wasillegally deportedto El Salvador and sent to the notorious CECOT megaprison \"due to an \"administrative error.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "article_text": "By The Associated Press In this photo provided by Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA), firefighters work as black smoke rises in the sky after a massive explosion rocked a port near the southern city of Bandar Abbas, Iran on Saturday.Mohammad Rasoul Moradi/IRNA via APhide caption MUSCAT, Oman — A massive explosion and fire rocked a port Saturday in southern Iran purportedly linked to a shipment of a chemical ingredient used to make missile propellant, killing 14 people and injuring around 750 others. Helicopters dumped water from the air on the raging fire hours after the initial explosion, which happened at the Shahid Rajaei port just as Iran and the United States met Saturday in Oman for the third round of negotiations over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program. No one in Iran outright suggested that the explosion came from an attack. However, even Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who led the talks, on Wednesday acknowledged that \"our security services are on high alert given past instances of attempted sabotage and assassination operations designed to provoke a legitimate response.\" Iranian Interior Minister Eskandar Momeni gave the casualty figure to state media.

    "article_text": "Scott Simon Pope Francis washes the feet of migrants at a refugee center near Rome in March 2016.AP/L'Osservatore Romanohide caption Pope Francis was one of the most exalted people on earth, yet he often reminded people he was the child of immigrants. He raised his voice on behalf of migrants from his first days as pope, 12 years ago, to almost his last breath. The pope's father, Mario Bergoglio, was just 21 when he boarded a ship in Genoa in 1929 to cross the ocean for South America, in flight from the rise of fascism in Mussolini's Italy. \"Migrants and refugees are not pawns on the chessboard of humanity,\" Francis said in his 2013 message for the Vatican's World Day of Migrants and Refugees. \"They are children, women, and men who leave or are forced to leave their homes for various reasons, who share a legitimate desire for knowing and having, but above all for being more.\" Francis was also the first pope from the Americas. When he came to the United States in 2015, he told a White House audience, \"As a son of an immigrant family, I am happy to be a guest in this country, which was largely built by such families.\" And the very next day, he reminded a joint meeting of the U.S. Congress that as his family had come to Argentina from Italy, today many migrants came to the U.S. through long, hard journeys up from South America, \"…in search of a better life for themselves and for their loved ones, in search of greater opportunities,\" said Francis. \"Is this not what we want for our own children?\" And as recently as this February, just a few days before he was admitted to the hospital, Pope Francis addressed a letter to U.S. Bishops about what he called \"these delicate moments that you are living…\" Mass deportations of migrants had begun. He cited lives of people of the Bible who had been expelled from or fled from their lands, and said he also understood that new arrivals could disrupt the lives of those already there. \"The true common good,\" Pope Francis wrote in one of his last messages, \"is promoted when society and government… welcomes, protects, promotes and integrates the most fragile, unprotected and vulnerable.\" The words of Pope Francis may sound compellingly personal on this day, as a son of immigrants is laid to rest before the world.

    "title": "Built on a rich coffee history, Yemeni cafes find U.S. success and new challenges, too",
    "article_text": "Neda Ulaby \"I get really emotional when I walk into these cafes and I see Yemen coffee becoming a thing,\" says coffee entrepreneur Mokhtar Alkhanshali.Port of Mokhahide caption \"Yemeni coffee is number one,\" announced Ibrahim Alhasbani, who foundedQahwah Housein 2017, soon after immigrating to the U.S. Alhasbani's rapidly expanding chain of Yemeni coffee shops now includes 23 locations from Texas to New York. Over pistachio lattes at a Qahwah House in Dearborn, Mich., he explained that Qahwah is the Arabic word for coffee. \"I want to share the culture. I want to share the coffee. I want to share the history,\" Alhasbani said. Hundreds of Yemeni coffee shops have opened in recent years on city blocks and in strip malls all over the U.S. Other chains include Haraz, MOKAFÉ and Qamaria Yemeni Coffee Co. Yemen is an ancient birthplace of the coffee trade, and immigrants fleeing its civil war have brought their culture here in the form of cafes. This wave of Yemeni coffee houses is distinctive for their beautiful designs, late hours, coffee drinks with cardamom and ginger, and desserts that range from hazelnut kunafa cheesecake (made with thin shreds of pastry dough) to decadent chocolate-dipped cakes. \"The desserts are just phenomenal,\" said Fionn Pooler. He covers the specialty coffee industry in his newsletter,The Pourover. Pooler, who is based in Scotland, has followed the rise of Yemeni coffee shops in the U.S. and the U.K. He was particularly impressed by the pastries he experienced at London's Qima Café. \"Most coffee shops, you get nice pastries but not really to the same kind of level,\" he said. As for the coffee, Yemeni beans enjoy a mystique among connoisseurs because of their rich history and flavors, Pooler said, and what he's tasted lives up to the hype. \"I think probably that is partly because the coffee that's made it to us recently has been really the best of the best,\" he said. \"Only the best coffee is getting out.\" Coffee prices have skyrocketed worldwide because of climate change, affecting exports everywhere. \"There's like hijackings,\" Poole said. \"There's people holding on to coffee because they don't want to sell it, because obviously, the price can keep going up.\" Most coffee consumed in the U.S. comes from Brazil and Colombia. It's subject to the same 10% tariffs as coffee from Yemen. Alhasbani imports his coffee from a family farm near the capital, Sanaa. He said getting it to the port in Aden, hundreds of miles south, has become increasingly difficult. \"Before the war, it was like 10 hours driving to take the shipment from Sanaa to the port,\" he said. \"With the war, it's like two days sometimes.\" And there's no guarantee that a shipment of Yemeni coffee — which can represent a farm's entire growing season — will even make it, added coffee entrepreneur Mokhtar Alkhanshali. He grew up in coffee-obsessed San Francisco, at a time when few people outside the Yemeni community knew much about the country's coffee. These days, the Bay Area enjoys a wealth of Yemeni coffee houses, including Delah Coffee, Heyma Yemeni Coffee and Mohka House. \"The Yemeni cafe movement is very, very new,\" Alkhanshali said. He runs a coffee business calledPort of Mokha.(The drink known as \"mocha\" derives its name from the old Yemeni port of Mokha.) \"I get really emotional when I walk into these cafes and I see Yemen coffee becoming a thing.\" Alkhanshali is the hero ofThe Monk of Mokha,a 2018 nonfiction bestsellerby Dave Eggers. It followed his quest to bring single-origin Yemeni coffee to the United States. Now, he says, he fears for the fragile economic balance helping rural families in a county suffering from poverty and widespread food insecurity. \"Most farmers in Yemen are smallholder farmers. They rely on these coffee trees in their villages,\" he says. \"This thing is just kicking off, and it could be blocked because of unfortunate policies.\" U.S. policies regarding Yemen have gone back and forth over the past decade. The Trump administration first designated the Houthi rebelsas a terrorist organization in 2021, but the designation was revokedby Democratic President Joe Biden, largely to assist with Yemen's humanitarian crisis, often described as one of the worst in the world.President Trump redesignated the Houthisas a terrorist organization last month, in March. This means sanctions and penalties for anyone providing material support to the group. \"Ninety percent of Yemen coffee, I would say, comes from the territories that are controlled by the Houthis in Yemen, the mountain regions across Ibb, in Sanaa and these provinces,\" Alkhanshali said. \"What this means is that any trader or exporter or importer buying coffee from these regions could technically be categorized as supporting terrorism, because it could trickle back down to this organization.\" \"We are behind every smile in the morning,\" says Ibrahim Alhasbani, founder of Qahwah House.Neda Ulaby/NPRhide caption At one of his Qahwah House coffee shops in Dearborn, Ibrahim Alhasbani said he was more concerned about high tariffs on Chinese-made paper coffee cups and Indian cardamom than legal imports of Yemeni coffee. But the war has affected everyone, he added. His mother and sister both recently died because the country's infrastructure has been shattered, and they were unable to receive adequate medical care for treatable problems. The war has killed arounda quarter of a million people,according to the United Nations, many thousands of them civilians. Whenpolitical commentators and comedians joked abouta journalist accidentally being included in an unofficial groupchat with high-ranking U.S. officials using emojis to celebrate airstrikes,including in the city of Sanaa, Moktar Alkhanshali was heartsick. \"That terrified my family,\" he said. \"And you're talking about a city that has over 3 million people who live in it. Sanaa was attacked in really high-density residential neighborhoods, which hadn't happened that way in a long time, actually.\" U.S. airstrikes continue to pound Yemen,with dozens of civilian casualties over the past weeks. Ibrahim Alhasbani observed that it is easier to see people as human beings when you actually see them. He wants Qahwah House, he said, to be a welcoming place that helps Americans recognize Yemenis not as people associated with war and famine, but as the people who brought the world coffee. \"We are behind every smile in the morning,\" he said with pride.

Photos released by the Ukrainian government on Saturday showed the leaders in a private one-on-one discussion, as well as speaking with French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who have been leading European efforts on a peace agreement.

Protecting lives of our people. Full and unconditional ceasefire. Reliable and lasting peace that will prevent another war from breaking out.\" White House communications director Steven Cheung told reporters that Trump and Zelenskyy \"had a very productive discussion\" and said more details about the meeting would follow. Trump and Zelenskyy's meeting comes a day after U.S. envoySteve Witkoffmet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. Trump aide Keith Kellogg also met this week with Ukrainian and European officials in London. Late Friday, Trump expressed optimism onsocial media, saying most major issues had been agreed to and that \"the two sides should now meet, at very high levels\" to finish a deal. Trump officials have presented Ukraine and Russia with options for a peace deal. They have not been made public, but Zelenskyy has said one of the ideas — ceding Crimea to Russia — was \"against our constitution.\" Trump had expressed frustration with Zelenskyy for those comments, saying that Crimea had been effectively lost long ago and should not be the deal-breaker. He also said he was \"not happy\" about Russian strikes on Kyiv this week. He repeated his concerns about the timing of Putin's strikeson social mediaon Saturday. \"It makes me think that maybe he doesn't want to stop the war, he's just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through \"Banking\" or \"Secondary Sanctions?\" Trump said in his post.

    "title": "Why judges blocked the Trump admin's school DEI crackdown",
    "article_text": "Cory Turner President Trump and his education secretary, Linda McMahon, have said repeatedly that they want to send education \"back to the states.\" But in recent lawsuits, the administration is accused of doing the opposite: wielding the power of the federal government to tell schools what they can and cannot teach.Alex Brandon/APhide caption Three federal judges, in Maryland, New Hampshire and Washington, D.C., ruled Thursday that the Trump administration had overstepped when itordered the nation's schoolsto stop all diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs as well as classroom teaching the administration might consider discriminatory. For the moment, this means the U.S. Department of Education cannot make good on its threat to punish noncompliant districts by withholding vital federal funding, including dollars that help K-12 schools serve low-income students and children with disabilities. U.S. District Judge Landya B. McCafferty, an Obama appointee in New Hampshire, began her opinion by noting the importance of safeguarding academic freedom in the U.S. and of exposing students to a multitude of viewpoints. \"In this case, the court reviews action by the executive branch that threatens to erode these foundational principles,\" McCafferty wrote. U.S. District Judge Stephanie A. Gallagher, a Trump appointee in Maryland, wrote, \"This Court is constitutionally required to closely scrutinize whether the government went about creating and implementing [policies] in the manner the law requires.\" \"The government did not,\" she found. Gallagher issued a temporary stay preventing the Trump administration from enforcing its threat against schools, while McCafferty blocked enforcement in any school that employs a teacher from one of the groups that brought the New Hampshire suit, including the National Education Association, the nation's largest teachers union. The Education Department did not respond to an NPR request for comment. The three opinions, in three separate cases, raise similar concerns – and suggest the Trump administration has work to do to convince the courts its anti-DEI efforts are legal. McCafferty, in New Hampshire, faulted the Trump administration for its vagueness. In her decision, McCafferty criticized a Feb. 14\"Dear Colleague\" letterfrom the U.S. Education Department. The letter argues that schools, in the name of DEI, \"have toxically indoctrinated students with the false premise that the United States is built upon 'systemic and structural racism' and advanced discriminatory policies.\" But, McCafferty wrote, \"The Letter does not even define what a 'DEI program' is.\" This vagueness was a common theme among the rulings. \"Although the challenged documents place a particular emphasis on 'certain DEI practices,' they fail to provide an actionable definition of what constitutes 'DEI' or a 'DEI' practice,\" wrote U.S. District Judge Dabney L. Friedrich in Washington, D.C. Friedrich is also a Trump appointee. In that case, brought by the NAACP, Friedrich agreed to a preliminary injunction. In Maryland, Gallagher criticized the administration for filling its \"Dear Colleague\" letter with broad claims about harmful, discriminatory teaching, but neglecting to include \"any factual citations or references to any facts supporting its assertions.\" On Feb. 27, that \"Dear Colleague\" letter was followed by the creation of a department portal through which parents were encouraged to report teaching or policies they consider discriminatory. Theofficial release announcingthe portal quotes Tiffany Justice, co-founder of the conservative-leaning Moms for Liberty: \"Parents, now is the time that you share the receipts of the betrayal that has happened in our public schools.\" And then on April 3, the Education Department went further: requiring K-12 school districts tocertify, in writing, that they are in compliance with the department's expanded interpretation of federal anti-discrimination law, or risk losing their federal funding. Districts are already required to certify their compliance with existing federal law, something Gallagher noted in her ruling. The administration argues its interpretation is not new – that many DEI policies violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and that the government's recent anti-DEI efforts are allowable because they're simply enforcing pre-existing federal law. Gallagher, in Maryland, found that argument \"unpersuasive.\" \"If the ['Dear Colleague' letter] said nothing new,\" Gallagher wrote, \"then why does it link to a new reporting portal specifically looking for instances of 'divisive ideologies' and 'indoctrination,' when there has always been a portal for anyone to report race discrimination or racially hostile environments?\" Tying a consequence so severe – the loss of federal funding – to a new and ill-defined set of policies and behaviors could have a chilling effect on schools, McCafferty warned. As an example, she imagined \"an elementary school teacher could seek to establish a class culture of equitable and inclusive treatment by asking her students to sign a collective pledge to follow the 'Golden Rule' for the entire school year. It is more than arguable that such a practice would come within the ocean-wide definition of DEI set forth above.\" Or, how should the nation's history teachers approach America's fraught racial past, given the department's contention that talk of \"systemic and structural racism\" has \"toxically indoctrinated\" students? McCafferty noted the story of one NEA-member middle school history teacher in New Hampshire: \"Discussing the … enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, the Jim Crow south, the founding of the KKK, and the Tulsa Race Massacre—necessarily entails discussions of race and how race and perceptions toward different racial groups has shaped American history,\" McCafferty wrote. But \"this teacher now fears being accused of engaging in discrimination for doing no more than teaching historical facts.\" The threat to schools' federal funding, coupled with the DEI portal for parents to report teachers they believe have crossed the line, \"raise the specter of a public 'witch hunt' that will sow fear and doubt among teachers,\" McCafferty warned. Trump and his education secretary, Linda McMahon, have said repeatedly that they want to eliminate the U.S. Department of Education and send education\"back to the states.\"But, in these lawsuits, the administration is accused of doing the opposite: wielding the power of the federal government to tell schools what they can and cannot teach. Two of Thursday's rulings note thatfederal lawexpressly prohibits the U.S. Department of Education from exercising \"any direction, supervision, or control over the curriculum, program of instruction, administration, or personnel of any educational institution, school, or school system.\" The department has argued its efforts are legal because they are enforcing federal anti-discrimination law, but McCafferty found that argument \"insufficient.\" \"While it may be true that a line must be drawn somewhere between the Department's lawful prerogative to enforce anti-discrimination law and its prohibition from controlling curriculum, the Letter and its associated documents do not toe that line.\" As for whether the letter exceeds the Education Department's legal authority, Gallagher wrote, the Trump administration insists it \"merely informs schools that they must not discriminate among students when implementing their curricula and must avoid stereotyping and stigmatizing based on race.\" Gallagher's skeptical response: \"This Court must concern itself with what the Letter actually says, not what the government says the Letter says.\" As such, \"by declaring broad categories of classroom speech discriminatory,\" Gallagher wrote, \"in the context of a Letter threatening enforcement actions for discriminatory practices, DOE is exercising 'direction, supervision, or control' over 'the curriculum, program of instruction, administration, or personnel of [schools.]'\" In short, the Education Department appears to be doing precisely what federal law says it cannot. \"The government cannot proclaim entire categories of classroom content discriminatory to side-step the bounds of its statutory authority,\" Gallagher ruled. The Trump administration is likely to challenge all three rulings. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Is The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion still fun for a first-time player in 2025?",
    "article_text": "How does a fresh coat of paint help this 19-year-old RPG against modern competition? For many gamers, this week'srelease ofThe Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remasteredhas provided a good excuse to revisit a well-remembered RPG classic from years past. For others, it's provided a good excuse to catch up on a well-regarded game that they haven't gotten around to playing in the nearly two decades since its release. I'm in that second group. While I've played a fair amount ofSkyrim(on platforms ranging from the Xbox 360 toVR headsets) andStarfield, I've never taken the time to go back to the earlier Bethesda Game Studios RPGs. As such, my impressions ofOblivionbefore thisRemasterhave been guided byold critical reactionsand themanymemescalling attention to the game's somewhat janky engine. Playing through the first few hours ofOblivion Remasteredthis week, without the benefit of nostalgia, I can definitely see whyOblivionmade such an impact on RPG fans in 2006. But I also see all the ways that the game can feel a bit dated after nearly two decades of advancements in genre design. From the jump, I found myself struggling to suspend my disbelief enough to buy into the narrative conventionsOblivionthrows at the beginner player. The fact that the doomed king and his armed guards need to escape through a secret passage that just so happens to cut through my jail cell seems alittletoo convenient for my brain to accept without warning sirens going off. I know it's just a contrivance to get my personal hero's journey story going, but it's a clunky way to dive into the world. The same goes for the way the king dies just a few minutes into the tutorial, and his willingness to trust me with the coveted Amulet of Kings because the \"Dragonblood\" let him \"see something\" in me. Even allowing for some amount of necessaryChosen One trope-inessin this kind of fantasy story, the sheer speed with which my character went from \"condemned prisoner\" to \"the last hope of the dying king\" made my head spin a bit. Following that pivotal scene with a dull \"go kill some goblins and rats in the sewer\" escape sequence also felt a little anticlimactic given the epic responsibility with which I was just entrusted. To be sure, Patrick Stewart's regal delivery in the early game helps paper over a lot of potential weaknesses with the initial narrative. And even beyond Stewart's excellent performance, I appreciated how the writing is concise and to the point, without the kind of drawn-out, pause-laden delivery that characterizes many games of the time. Once I escaped out into the broader world ofOblivionfor the first time, I was a bit shocked to open my map and see that I could fast travel to a wide range of critical locations immediately, without any need to discover them for myself first. I felt a bit like a guilty cheater warping myself to the location of my next quest waypoint rather than hoofing through the massive forest that I'm sure hundreds of artists spent countless months meticulously constructing (and, more recently, remastering). I felt less guilty after accidentally stealing a horse, though. After a key quest giver urged me to go take a horse from a nearby stable, I was a bit shocked when I mounted the first horse I saw and heard two heavily armed guards nearby calling me a thief and leaping into pursuit (I guess I should have noticed the red icon before making my mount). No matter, I thought; they're on foot and I'm now on a horse, so I can get away with my inadvertent theft quite easily. Determined not to just fast-travel through the entire game, I found that galloping across a rain-drenched forest through the in-game night was almost too atmospheric. I ended up turning up the recommended brightness settings a few notches just so I could see the meticulously rendered trees and rocks around me. After dismounting to rid a cave of some pesky vampires, I returned to the forest to find my stolen horse was nowhere to be found. At this point, I had trouble deciding if this was simply a realistic take on an unsecured, unmonitored horse wandering off or if I was the victim of a janky engine that couldn't keep track of my mount. The jank was a bit clearer when I randomly stumbled across my first Oblivion gate while wandering through the woods. As I activated the gate to find a world engulfed in brilliant fire, I was surprised to find an armed guard had also appeared, seemingly out of nowhere, and apparently still mad about my long-lost stolen horse! When I deactivated the gate in another attempt to escape justice, I found myself immediately stuck chest deep in the game's scenery, utterly unable to move as that hapless guard tried his best to subdue me. I ended up having to restore an earlier save, losing a few minutes of progress to a game engine that still has its fair share of problems. So far, I'm of two minds aboutOblivion's overall world-building. When it comes to the civilized parts of the world, I'm relatively impressed. The towns seem relatively full during the daytime—both in terms of people and in terms of interesting buildings to explore or patronize. I especially enjoy the way every passerby seems to have a unique voice and greeting ready for me, even before I engage them directly. I even think it's kind of cute when these NPCs end a pleasant conversation with a terse \"leave me alone!\" or \"stop talking to me!\" Even the NPCs that seem least relevant to the story seem to have their own deep backstory and motivations; I was especially tickled by an alchemist visiting from afar who asked if I knew the local fine for necrophilia. (It can't hurt to ask, right?) And discussing random rumors with everyone I meet has gone a long way toward establishing the social and political backstory of the world while also providing me with some engaging and far-flung side quests. There's a lot of depth apparent in these interactions, even if I haven't had the chance to come close to fully exploring it yet. On the other hand, the vast spaces in between the cities and towns seem like so much wasted space, at this point. I've quickly learned not to waste much time exploring caves or abandoned mines, which so far seem to house a few middling enemies guarding some relatively useless trinkets in treasure chests. The same goes for going out of my way to activate the various wayshrines and Ayelid Wells that dot the landscape, which have hardly seemed worth the trip (thus far, at least). Part of the problem is that I've foundOblivion's early combat almost wholly unengaging so far. Even at a low level, my warrior-mage has been able to make easy work of every random enemy I've faced with a combination of long-range flare spells and close-range sword swings. It definitely doesn't help that I have yet to fight more than two enemies at once, or find a foe that seems to have two strategic brain cells to rub together. Compared to the engaging, tactical group combat of modern action RPGs likeElden RingorAvowed, the battles here feel downright archaic. I found this was true even as I worked my way through closing my first Oblivion gate, which had recently left the citizens of Kvask as sympathetic refugees huddling on the outskirts of town. Here, I thought, would be some battles that required crafty tactics, powerful items, or at least some level grinding to become more powerful. Instead, amid blood-soaked corridors that wouldn't feel out of place in aDoomgame, I found the most challenging speedbumps were mages that sponged up a moderate amount of damage while blindly charging right at me. While I'm still decidedly in the early part of a game that can easily consume over 100 hours for a completionist, so far I'm having trouble getting past the most dated bits ofOblivion's design. Character design and vocal production that probably felt revolutionary two decades ago now feel practically standard for the genre, while technical problems and dull combat seem best left in the past.

    "title": "Weapons of war are launching from Cape Canaveral for the first time since 1988",
    "article_text": "Unlike a recent hypersonic missile test, officials didn't immediately confirm Friday's flight was a success. The US military launched a long-range hypersonic missile Friday morning from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida on a test flight that, if successful, could pave the way for the weapon's operational deployment later this year. The Army's Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon fired out of a canister on a road-mobile trailer shortly after sunrise on Florida's Space Coast, then headed east over the Atlantic Ocean propelled by a solid-fueled rocket booster. Local residents shared images of the launch on social media. Designed for conventional munitions, the new missile is poised to become the first ground-based hypersonic weapon fielded by the US military. Russia has used hypersonic missiles in combat against Ukraine. China has \"the world's leading hypersonic missile arsenal,\" according to a recent Pentagon report on Chinese military power. After a successful test flight from Cape Canaveral last year, the long-range hypersonic weapon (LRHW)—officially named \"Dark Eagle\" by the Army earlier this week—will give the United States the ability to strike targets with little or no warning. The Dark Eagle missile rapidly gained speed and altitude after launch Friday morning, then soon disappeared from the view of onlookers at Cape Canaveral. Warning notices advising pilots and mariners to steer clear of the test area indicated the missile and its hypersonic glide vehicle were supposed to splash down in the mid-Atlantic Ocean hundreds of miles north and northeast of Puerto Rico. A US defense official did not answer questions from Ars about the outcome of the test flight Friday. \"A combined team of government, academic, and industry partners conducted a test on behalf of the Department of Defense from a test site at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station,\" the official said. \"We are currently evaluating the results of the test.\" Liftoff of the LRHW Dark Eagle this morning 🚀https://t.co/lCJhUXxT84pic.twitter.com/YJXXuSxmJK — Jerry Pike (@JerryPikePhoto)April 25, 2025 This missile launch and a similar one in December are the first tests of land-based offensive weapons at Cape Canaveral since 1988, when the military last tested Pershing ballistic missiles there. The launch range in Florida continues to support offshore tests of submarine-launched Trident missiles, and now is a center for hypersonic missile testing. The Pentagon has a long-standing policy of not publicizing hypersonic missile tests before they happen, except for safety notices for civilian airplanes and ships downrange. But the Defense Department declared the previous Dark Eagle test flight a success within a few hours of the launch, and did not do so this time. Hypersonic missiles offer several advantages over conventional ballistic missiles. These new kinds of weapons are more maneuverable and dimmer than other missiles, so they are more difficult for an aerial defense system to detect, track, and destroy. They are designed to evade an adversary's missile warning sensors. These sensors were originally activated to detect larger, brighter incoming ballistic missiles, which have a predictable trajectory toward their targets after boosting themselves out of the atmosphere and into space. A hypersonic weapon is different. It can skim through the upper atmosphere at blistering speeds, producing a much dimmer heat signature that is difficult to see with an infrared sensor on a conventional missile warning satellite. At these altitudes, the glide vehicle can take advantage of aerodynamic forces for maneuvers. This is why the Pentagon's Space Development Agency is spending billions of dollars to deploy a network of missile tracking satellites in low-Earth orbit, putting hundreds of sophisticated sensors closer to the flight path of hypersonic weapons. Dark Eagle is designed to fly at speeds exceeding Mach 5, or 3,800 mph, with a reported range of 1,725 miles (2,775 kilometers), sufficient to reach Taiwan from Guam, or NATO's borders with Russia from Western Europe. The US military says it has no plans to outfit its hypersonic weapons with nuclear warheads. In a statement on Thursday, the Department of Defense said the weapon's official name pays tribute to the eagle, known for its speed, stealth, and agility. Dark Eagle offers a similar mix of attributes: velocity, accuracy, maneuverability, survivability, and versatility, the Pentagon said. \"The word 'dark' embodies the LRHW's ability to dis-integrate adversary capabilities,\" the statement said. \"Hypersonic weapons will complicate adversaries' decision calculus, strengthening deterrence,\" said Patrick Mason, senior official performing the duties of the assistant secretary of the Army for acquisition, logistics, and technology Dark Eagle is the land-based component of the Pentagon's effort to field hypersonic missiles for combat. The Navy will use the same system on its ships to provide a sea-launched version of the hypersonic weapon called Conventional Prompt Strike, which will be placed on destroyers and submarines. The Army and Navy programs will use an identical two-stage missile, which will jettison after depleting its rocket motors, freeing a hypersonic glide vehicle to steer toward its target. The entire rocket and glide vehicle are collectively called an \"All Up Round.\" \"The use of a common hypersonic missile and joint test opportunities allow the services to pursue a more aggressive timeline for delivery and to realize cost savings,\" the Defense Department said in a statement. TheCongressional Budget Office reported in 2023that purchasing 300 intermediate-range hypersonic missiles would cost $41 million per missile. Dynetics, a subsidiary of the defense contractor Leidos, is responsible for developing the Common Hypersonic Glide Body for the Army's Dark Eagle and the Navy's Conventional Prompt Strike programs. Lockheed Martin is the prime contractor charged with integrating the entire weapon system. The militarycanceled an air-launched hypersonic weapon programin 2023 after it ran into problems during testing. The Pentagon said Army commanders will use Dark Eagle to \"engage adversary high-payoff and time-sensitive targets.\" The hypersonic weapon could be used against an adversary's mobile missile forces if US officials determine they are preparing for launch, or it could strike well-defended targets out of reach of other weapons in the US arsenal. Once in the field, the missile's use will fall under the authority of US Strategic Command, with the direction of the president and the secretary of defense. Defense News, an industry trade publication, reported in February that the Army aimed to deliver the first Dark Eagle missiles to a combat unit before October 1, pending final decisions by the Pentagon's new leadership under the Trump administration. Dark Eagle suffered multiple test failures in 2021 and 2022, according to areport by the Congressional Research Service. Military crewsaborted several attemptsto launch the missile from Cape Canaveral in 2023 due to a problem with the weapon's launcher. The program achieved two successes last year with test flights from Hawaii and Florida. The December launch from Cape Canaveral was an important milestone. \"This test builds on several flight tests in which the Common Hypersonic Glide Body achieved hypersonic speed at target distances and demonstrates that we can put this capability in the hands of the warfighter,\" said Christine Wormuth, then-secretary of the army, in a Pentagon statement announcing the result of the test flight. The Dark Eagle readiness tests build on more than a decade of experimental hypersonic flights by multiple US defense agencies. Hypersonic flight is an unforgiving environment, where the outer skin of glide vehicles must withstand temperatures of 3,000° Fahrenheit. It's impossible to re-create such an extreme environment through modeling or tests on the ground. While the Army and Navy hope to soon deploy the first US hypersonic missile for use in combat, the military continues pursuing more advanced hypersonic technology. In January, the Pentagon awarded a contract worth up to $1.45 billion to Kratos Defense & Security Solutions for the Multi-Service Advanced Capability Hypersonic Test Bed (MACH-TB) program. Kratos partners with other companies, like Leidos, Rocket Lab, Firefly Aerospace, and Stratolaunch, to test hypersonic technologies in their operating environment. The program aims for a rapid cadence of suborbital test flights, some of which have already launched with Rocket Lab's Electron rocket. With these experiments, engineers can see how individual components and technologies work in flight before using them on real weapons. The Biden administration requested $6.9 billion for the Pentagon's hypersonic research programs in fiscal year 2025, up from $4.7 billion in 2023. The Trump administration's budget request for fiscal year 2026 is scheduled for release next month. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "The Robot Vacuum Arms Race Is Over, and the Incredible AI-Powered Roborock Saros Z70 Has Won",
    "article_text": "It’s time to give Roborock a hand, because they’re giving us an arm. The Roborock Saros Z70 is theworld’s first mass-produced robotic vacuum with a foldable mechanical armthat can intelligently identify and remove obstacles from its path, and even put them away for you. It’s the most groundbreaking advance in home cleaning technology in recent memory, and it’s sure to usher in an entirely new era in home robotic appliances and assistants. The Roborock Saros Z70 is now officially available for purchase with a special launch offer:get it for $1,999 instead of $2,599âa 23% discount. Act fast, as only 10 units are released each day, and stock is refreshed every midnight. See Saros Z70 at Roborock.com See Saros Z70 at Roborock.com The world got a sneak preview of the Saros Z70 at CES 2025 in January, and the first demonstration of the mind-boggling AI-powered capabilities of the OmniGrip foldable robotic arm madethis one of the most anticipated new product releases in years. The Saros Z70 is able to accurately see, measure, and recognize its surroundings, and it uses AI to detect new obstacles or if the furniture’s been rearranged, and instantly rewrite its internal maps in real time. And that’s just scratching the surface of the unprecedented feats this ultra-intelligent robotic vacuum/mop combo can perform. Industrial robotic arms have been around for decades, and AI has been a presence in our homes in ways that seem to grow every day. And we’re all very well acquainted with robotic vacuums and mops and other enormously helpful smart home devices. But combining all of those into one enormously intelligent and multi-functional smart cleaning device has been, until now, just a very cool concept. And while the competition is still busy at the drawing board, Roborock is now the first company to take that concept into mass production and make it available to consumers in the form of the Saros Z70. It’s an enormous leap forward in robotic intelligence and capabilities, offering a smart device that’s more autonomous than any of its predecessors, and with the groundbreaking OmniGrip arm, able to perform specific chores and tasks for you. That’s what makes the release of the Saros Z70 such a seismic event. ð Roborock Wins Big at the iF DESIGN AWARD 2025! ð Weâre excited to announce that Roborock has won several prestigious awards for innovative designs like the Saros Z70, Saros 10R, and more. Join us in celebrating this incredible milestone! ð¥³#Roborock#iFDesignAwardpic.twitter.com/jFQW66P107 — Roborock (@roborockglobal)April 2, 2025 The OmniGrip arm would be an amazing innovation in any circumstance, but Roborock hascombined it with AI so advanced that it will redefine the definition of what a household robot can do. The OmniGrip arm of the Saros Z70 does far more than simply grab objects â it can see and think thanks to its precision sensors, dual cameras, and LED light, all of which feed information into the Saros Z70’s AI processor. The OmniGrip arm can identify what’s in its path, whether or not it’s too heavy to pick up, and what to do with it. See Saros Z70 at Roborock.com For example, the Saros Z70 can identify a stray sock in its path, determine that it’s light enough to be picked up (anything roughly 0.6 pounds or less), and know to bring it toward the closet. A crumpled piece of paper or tissue can be brought to the trash can. Other objects without obvious homes can simply be moved out of the way, and the Saros Z70 knows to double back to that spot for a second round of cleaning. The intelligence level of the Saros Z70 is so great that it can identify and remember up to 108 household objects, 50 of which you can customize with labels in the Roborock app, and what to do with them. Even if it can’t pick up or move an object, it is able to identify it, and theoretically help you locate something that’s gone missing under a bed or other hidden area. That’s a massive leap forward for cleaning, and it’s even entertaining to teach the Saros Z70 how to interact with random objects and watching it work its magic. We could talk all day about the first-of-its-kind OmniGrip arm and otherwordly intelligence of the Saros Z70, but skipping its ability to actually clean your home would be doing it a huge disservice. The Saros Z70 is a top-notch robot vacuum and mop that would earn its way onto the best-of lists for robotic cleaners even without the OmniGrip arm and advanced AI. The upgraded dock can recharge the Saros Z70 in just 2.5 hours, heat and refill the mop water and then air-dry the mop pads, dispense detergent into the mop water, and even intelligently detect dirt to decide if it needs to re-wash and re-mop. The robot itself is barely 3 inches tall â the thinnest Roborock ever â and that exceptionally low profile enables it to get into areas most competing robot vacuums would simply get stuck in. It has advanced anti-tangle features for hair, and a powerful 22,000Pa of suction to give both hard and carpeted surfaces a truly deep cleaning. The Saros Z70’s FlexiArm Riser Side Brush extends to get into corners and along baseboards, and it’s able to lift itself over small thresholds like doorways or transitions between hard and carpeted surfaces. It can also lift its mop pads nearly a full inch off the floor to keep them off carpets, or remove the mop pads autonomously for vacuum-only tasks, and then replace them for mopping duties. All of these cleaning features, including the self-heating mop water, are backed by AI so the Saros Z70 can learn your cleaning preferences and modify them on the go. The Roborock app allows you to program and personalize all the settings so you can fully entrust the Saros Z70 to give your entire home a thorough cleaning without supervision. In the ever-escalating arms race among robotic home cleaning appliances, the debut of the Saros Z70 is truly the Sputnik moment â first of its kind, bringing abilities and technology out of the development stage and directly into the mass market, and into your home. The Roborock Saros Z70 is now officially available for purchase with a special launch offer:get it for $1,999 instead of $2,599âa 23% discount.

    "article_text": "This article is part of Gizmodo Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. Apple is well-known for keeping its prices tightly fixed – especially for newly released items.Sales of recently released models are virtually non-existenton Apple’s own web site, and when they do happen, it’s typically months or years later (and often only very small ones). So, to discover Amazon offering a brand-new MacBook Air M4 (2025) at a major discount just a few weeks after its launch is a surprise-andit’s safe to say Apple isn’t pleased about it. Amazon is currently offering the2025 MacBook Air 13-inch with the brand-new M4 chip and 256GB storage for $899 which is a full $100 less than its standard $999 price. This is thecheapest price ever for this model(released six weeks ago) and it’s driving consumers crazy: The MacBook Air M4 isthe current best-selling laptop on Amazon, with units selling off virtual shelves in what can only be described as a bloodbath for the competition. See 256GB at Amazon See 256GB at Amazon The15-inch 2025 model is also discounted to $1,499 from $1,599, featuring 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. See 512GB at Amazon See 512GB at Amazon In the past, Apple’s new laptops remain at full price for at least a year. Only when the initial mania has passed and a new generation looms do we see timid discountsâand even then, they’re typically limited to a handful of resellers and taken in a heartbeat. This time, the MacBook Air M4 is being discounted by a huge amount just weeks into its availability, and it’s no small cut.Amazon is pushing the price to levels unimaginable for any new MacBook Air, much less one powered by Apple’s latest silicon chip. The new M4 chip boasts a 10-core CPU, an 8-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine, which provides an enormous performance and efficiency boost. Apple claims up to 1.6 times faster performance in productivity apps and up to twice the speed in creative workflows compared to the M1 chip. Whether youâre editing 4K video or crunching numbers, this processor handles it all with ease. And with 16GB of common memory and a 256GB SSD on sale in this Amazon offering (there is a 512GB version too that is discounted $100…), you’ve got plenty of multitasking heft. The MacBook Air M4 holds on to its mythical thin-and-light status and tips the scales at a mere three pounds and a scant half-inch thickness. The 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display remains as beautiful as ever. The Midnight finish (only available on this deeply discounted model) adds a dash of premium flair. There’s also a 12MP Center Stage camera for sharp video calls, a four-speaker sound system, and Touch ID for secure logins. What you will also love aboutthe 2025 MacBook Air is the inclusion of Apple Intelligence, Apple’s new suite of AI-powered tools built into macOS Sequoia. With the M4’s advanced Neural Engine, you can expect smarter writing capabilities, better organization and more automation. By the way, you can check ourreview on the 2025 MacBook Air here. To see a 10% discount on such a new and great MacBook Air is unheard of, and itâsno surprise that Amazon is selling them by the pallet.

    "title": "Amazon Just Happens to Hold Book Sale During Independent Bookstore Day",
    "article_text": "April 26 is Independent Bookstore Day, an annual tradition organized by the American Booksellers Association that is entering its 12th year and has taken place on the final Saturday of April since its conception. And, wouldn’t you know it, Amazon just so happens to behostingits second annual book sale (two being less than 12, if you’re keeping count) from April 23 through the 28th, encompassing the day that has been claimed by local shop across the country. If you are tempted to give Amazon a pass here for maybe accidentally encroaching upon their competitors’ spaceâand if you are, bless your sweet innocenceâit’s perhaps worth noting that theirfirst big book sale event in 2024took place from May 16 through the 20th, notably a few weeks after Independent Bookstore Day. So, to whatever extent something you’ve done for exactly one year can be called a tradition, the company has already broken that in favor of squeezing indie booksellers. (In astatement to Variety, Amazon said, “The overlap was unintentional. The dates for our sale were set this year to accommodate additional participating countries.â Take that with as many grains of salt as you deem necessary.) You could just say that Amazon is going back to its roots. After all, the companygot its start selling books at a lossto undercut the prices of brick-and-mortar competitors, until it pushed them to the brink of bankruptcy. Then, as if to dance on their graves, itstarted openingup its own physical bookstore locations (which it eventually shuttered without much fanfare because itnever really cared about the productitself). Now that indie booksellers have found a way to carve out a niche, the company looks like it’d like to get back in the business of undermining them. The indies, understandably, aren’t thrilled. More than 1,600 bookstores, including participants in all 50 states, will celebrate Independent Bookstore Day with their local community, but they’ve also taken a deserved moment to side-eye Amazon a bit.Speaking to Variety, booksellers took shots at the retail giant’s decision to hold its book sale at the same time as their annual event. Andy Hunter, founder of Bookshop.org, called it “cynical, manipulative, and cruel.” Leah Koch, owner of the Ripped Bodice, in Los Angeles, California, kept it simple:Â  “Fuck Jeff Bezos,â she told Variety. âMay he be very miserable living alone on the moon.âÂ  Ripped Bodicedoes shipdomestically and internationally, by the way, in case you’re looking for a new book. In a way, Amazon’s sale is more petty posturing than something that will actually impact the indies. Local book shops have managed to have a moment,thrivingdespite the increasing dominance of Amazon online by creating bonds with their local community and offering a shopping experience that Amazon can’t replicate. They’ve alsoadapted to the online ecosystemto stay competitive, while Amazon failed to plant roots with its own brick-and-mortar shops. Remember, you don’t have to wait for a special day to visit your local bookstore. Go any time, shop around, ask for recommendations. You might be shocked to find that you’ll get much more out of picking the brains of your local bookworms than you will from a recommendation algorithm.

    "title": "Reveals Why Yoda Talks Like That, George Lucas Does",
    "article_text": "There’ve been so manyquestionsÂStar WarsÂfans have asked over the years. And sooner or later, one of them is: “Why doesYodatalk like that?” Since his debut inÂEmpire Strikes Back,Âthe old Jedi Master has spoken backwardsâ”How are you doing?” for anyone else is “Doing, how are you?” to him. George Lucas was asked about Yoda’s peculiar speech patterns during a recent anniversary screening forEmpire, and his answer? “I had to figure out a way to get people to actually listen, especially 12-year-olds.” He went on to explain that since Yoda is a philosopher for Luke, the way he spoke had to feel significant. “If you speak regular English, people won’t listen that much,” he continued. “But if he had an accent, or itâs really hard to understand what heâs saying, they focus on what heâs saying.” That’s a really interesting answer, and it’s certainly an effective choice; how many of us out there have a Yoda impression that gets his voice and mannerisms down? Now, if only we knew whether this manner of speaking is specific to all of Yoda’s speciesâwhatever the hell it’s called, whose ranks currently includeYaddle(RIP) andGroguâor how he learned to speak came from whoever raised him. And if it’s the former, there’s one other question to ask: what will Grogu sound like when he inevitably talks? [viaVariety] Want more io9 news?

    "title": "Trump DOJ Threatens Wikipedia’s Nonprofit Status Over Alleged ‘Propaganda’",
    "article_text": "Between scrubbing government websites of information about everything fromvaccine efficacytoLGBT health mattersand the ongoing war with higher education, the Trump administration seems to have a problem with freely available information that doesn’t align with its particular ideology. That war on knowledge appears to have extended to Wikipedia. Earlier this week, a Trump appointed attorneysent a letterto the Wikimedia Foundation accusing it of allowing the spread of propaganda and threatening its nonprofit status. The letterâwhich was sent by Ed Martin, the acting US attorney for the District of Columbia, andfirst obtained by The Free Pressâalleges that Wikipedia’s host organization may be “engaging in a series of activities that could violate its obligations under Section 501(c)(3) of Title 26 of the United States Code”âthe law that allows the organization to operate as a tax-exempt nonprofit. Martin accuses the Wikimedia Foundation of falling short of te requirements to maintain that status because, he claims, Wikipedia is âallowing foreign actors to manipulate information and spread propaganda,â and “permitting information manipulation on its platform, including the rewriting of key, historical events and biographical information of current and previous American leaders, as well as other matters implicating the national security and the interests of the United States.” He also claims that because the foundation’s board is made up of “primarily foreign nationals,” that it is “subverting the interests of American taxpayers.” In order to quell these supposed concerns that read more like a thinly veiled threat to fall in line with the administration’s preferred version of history, Martin requested documents and responses to a slew of questions, including details about the organization’s safeguards to prevent propaganda and processes in place to prevent foreign influence campaigns. The Wikimedia Foundation has until May 15 to respond to the inquiry. This type of attack made on Department of Justice letterhead has become Martin’s calling card, so Wikipedia is in good company for a very bad precedent. Martin also sent letters toCHEST Journal,the New England Journal of Medicine, andObstetrics and Gynecologyin recent weeks, accusing the peer-reviewed scientific journals of being “partisans in various scientific debates” and failing to include scientists with âcompeting viewpoints” in their publications. Martin is also the guy whothreatened to take legal actionagainst publications that reported on employees working for the Department of Government Efficiency anddemandedthat multiple lawmakers who spoke out against Elon Musk’s ongoing dismantling of the federal government clarify their statements that he alleged were threats against him. Given that Musk hasmade Wikipedia a target, calling it “Wokepedia” and claiming that it is âan extension of legacy media propaganda,â it’s no surprise that Martin turned his attention to the free, community-managed online encyclopedia. He’s serving as the government’s attack dog, and frankly he comes off as a petty little tyrant about the whole thing. He’sdrawn the ire of free speech organizationswho see through his pretty transparent efforts to scare people into subduing criticisms of the administration and silencing the spread of anything that may go against the party line.

    "title": "Let the Predator Have a New Video Game",
    "article_text": "What a month it’s been for fans of the Predator. 20th Century Studios offered our best looks yet at the theatrical, Dan Trachtenberg-directedBadlandsand the animated anthologyKiller of Killers. In the comics, the alien’s just kicked off afight with Spider-Manthat’s later going to see thelarger Marvel universecatch hands over the summer. There’s really only one thing missing from this feast, and that would be a video game. Not counting itsmany, many crossoverswithAlien,thePredatorfranchise has a fairly small games presence across its 38-year life. Aside from adaptations for the first two movies and a mobile tie-in for 2010’sPredators,Âthe significant titles have been 2005’sConcrete Jungle,a 2018 VR game, and 2020’s multiplayer-focusedHunting Grounds. But the monster’s most important appearance was as DLC forMortal Kombat X(which also featured the Alien, natch). Yautja are apparently best suited to multiplayer, and it’s easy to see why: they have better technology than whoever they go up against (even themselves), and as in the movies, they’re best asan obstacle to overcome.Hunting Groundsis still being supported with new content, but not every player is willing to jump into a competitive game to fulfill their dreams of being an intergalactic hunter. The Alien has enough terror baked into its premise and concept that allows it to facilitate shooters, real-time tactics, and survival horror (even a Metroidvania, once). By comparison, the Predator is perceived to have such a limited range it can’t even get a single-player game of its own, as no studio’s tried giving the franchise its own equivalent toAlien Isolation.Concrete JungleÂopened to lousy reviews back in the day, and that’s likely the biggest reason why. It starred a disgraced Predator named Scarface looks to regain his honor by hunting down the humans using his people’s technology, which was a decent way to even the odds between hunter and prey. As apparently imperfect as that game was, its existence proves the Predator could be suited to single-player with the proper attention and execution. Part of what makesÂBadlandsÂso intriguing to me is Trachtenberg pulling a perspective switch and turning a Predatorâayoung Yautja outcastnamed Dakâinto the protagonist as he travels to an alien planet to build himself into a proper hunter. That’s a video game-esque premise, right down to Dak wielding a sword and having an android companion. Trachtenberg calledShadow of the Colossusan inspiration on the film, and the decision to give Dak and the film’s other Yautja a complete language to speak feel like choices a game developer would make to provide the immersive experience of being a Predator. Trachtenberg directed a short film forPortalin 2011, then a cinematic intro for Digital Extremes’Warframein 2019, so video games may just inherently be part of his filmmaking language. In between big blockbuster titles from Marvel andStar Wars, Disney’s licensed out its properties to game developers that’ve made some interesting swings, from life sims, to platformers starring Mickey Mouse and friends, and aTronÂvisual novel.RoboCopandTerminatorshow there’sÂ more freedom in what IP-based games can be compared to the old tie-in days, and it seems 20th Century is still trying to feel out how to continuePredatorwithout committing to a long-term plan. If the studio is looking to keep it going in new, interesting directions, a game might be the way, and it deserves some kind of shot to prove itself in the medium. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "How Your Showerhead and Fridge Became Political Statements",
    "article_text": "Efficiency standards for home appliances were once the conversational equivalent of beige â neutral, but aggressively uninteresting. But as political polarization has deepened, dishwashers, laundry machines, showerheads, and other household staples have begun to take on a new charge. With Republicans now in control of the White House and both houses of Congress, rules that quietly save Americans money on utility bills while conserving energy and water are suddenly at risk. Earlier this month, President Donald Trump doubled down on his long-standing complaint about low-flow showerheads taking too long to clean his âbeautiful hair.â Heordered his administrationto repeal a rule, revived by the Biden administration, that aimed to save water by restricting flow from the fixtures. AWhite House fact sheetpromised the order would undo âthe leftâs war on water pressureâ and âmake Americaâs showers great again.â Itâs part of a growing movement targeting efficiency standards â last year, House Republicans passed bills including the âRefrigerator Freedom Actâ and âLiberty in Laundry Act,â though neither succeeded in the Democratic-led Senate. Now in charge of both houses of Congress, Republicans have already passeda resolution to repeal a recent energy-efficiency standardfor gas-powered tankless water heaters, which awaits Trumpâs signature. Efficiency standards used to have bipartisan support. But today, many Republican politicians see restrictions on gas stoves, refrigerators, and laundry machines as symbols of Democratic interference with peopleâs self-determination. Thatâs the idea Trump advanced when he signedan executive ordertargeting efficiency standards for home goods and appliances âto safeguard the American peopleâs freedom to choose.â The message echoes talking points from industry groups that have an interest in keeping homes hooked up to natural gas for stoves and water heaters. âThis isnât the first time that weâve seen efficiency standards thrust into the culture wars,â said Andrew deLaski, the executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project, which advocates for stricter energy-efficiency legislation. âBut President Trump has put that into overdrive.â The push for more efficient appliances began in response to the fuel shortages sparked by the 1973 oil crisis. Republican president Gerald Ford signed the bipartisan Energy Policy and Conservation Act in 1975, laying the groundwork for the government to set standards on household appliances. Butstate laws for more efficient appliancescame first, forcing manufacturers tonavigate a patchwork of rules. So Congress set nationwide efficiency standards forwater heaters, air conditioners, dishwashers, and many other household appliances with the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act in 1987, signed by another Republican president â Ronald Reagan. Congresscontinued to expand those standardswith bipartisan support in 1992, 2005, and 2007. In total, the Department of Energy now oversees standards for about60 categories of appliancesand other equipment in homes and businesses, spanning from toilets to commercial refrigerators. In January, the pre-TrumpDepartment of Energy estimatedthat these rules, taken together, saved the average U.S. household about $576 a year on their bills. They also cut national energy use by 6.5 percent and water consumption by 12 percent, making them a key tool for addressing climate change and drought. Voters are broadly supportive of energy-saving policies, with87 percent of Americanspolled by Consumer Reports in March agreeing that new home appliances should be required to meet a minimum level of efficiency â including 82 percent of Republicans. âPeople arenât clamoring for products that needlessly waste energy and money,â deLaski said. Despite efficiencyâs broad popularity, there have been flare-ups of pushback and public outrage against efficient appliances dating back to the 1980s. Reagan actually vetoed the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act, saying it restricted âthe freedom of choiceavailable to consumers who would be denied the opportunity to purchase low-cost appliances,â the year before he signed it. Ina 1996 episode ofSeinfeld, Jerry, Kramer, and Newman were so fed up with the new low-flow showerheads in their building, they resorted to buying black-market Yugoslavian models from the back of a truck. Another culture war brewed over energy-efficient LED light bulbs in the 2010s as older, incandescent models began to be phased out, with Tea Party Republicans declaring that light bulb choice wasa matter of personal liberty. Matthew Burgess, an environmental economist at the University of Wyoming, said that efficiency rules are most likely to become a cultural flashpoint when people see them directly affecting their lives. âPeople do notice the flow of their showerheads,â he said. âPeople do notice whether their stove is gas or electric.â Some of the political tension over appliances resulted from ambitious changes, he said, such as when Berkeley, California,tried to ban gas connections in new buildings in 2019. âI think that thereâs an impression on parts of the right, thatâs not totally wrong, that elements in the climate community, and on the left, and in certain segments of the Democratic Party want to tell them what to do and what not to do in their households,â Burgess said. Yet the fossil fuel industry has also influenced the conversation: Thereâs been a coordinated campaignto highlight the narrative of âconsumer choiceâfor gas appliances in particular, according to Emilia Piziak, a senior analyst at InfluenceMap, a climate think tank. Last year, for instance, the American Gas Association filed acourt briefchallenging Biden-era Department of Energy efficiency rules on furnaces and water heaters, arguing that Congress âwanted consumers to have the freedom to choose the energy type they prefer.â âThese industry groups and gas utilities, they are working together,â Piziak said. âTheyâre very effective at showing up and driving that messaging home.â The âfreedom to chooseâ narrative has also been echoed by Trump officials. One ofthe top priorities of Trumpâs energy secretary, Chris Wright, is to âpromote affordability and consumer choice in home appliances.â The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers told Grist that while it supports the efficiency standards process, it wants changes. âThe rulemaking process and analysis should focus more on consumer impact, specifically regarding affordability and product choice,â the association said in a statement. âAny standard that is developed should have real, measurable benefits for the consumer.â Though high-efficiency appliances tend to be more expensive up-front, they can save householdsthousands of dollarson bills over the long term. And deLaski argued that efficiency standards also deliver other benefits to consumers. âTodayâs high-efficiency products, whether weâre talking about light bulbs or clothes washers or showerheads, perform as well and in many cases better than the inefficient products that theyâve replaced,â he said. While the Energy Policy and Conservation Actprevents the government from weakening efficiency standardsfor appliances that have already been set, deLaski said heâs concerned that the Trump administration is looking for a way around that. âI think all the standards are at risk of being undercut, circumvented, not enforced,â he said. Recently, Republicans have been targeting the efficiency rules set in place at the end of the Biden administration. Because of the Congressional Review Act, Congress can review and repeal a regulation issued in the last 60 legislative days â a period that extends back into last summer â with a simple majority vote. So far, Republicans have not only voted to repeal efficiency standards forgas water heatersunder this rule, but alsocommercial refrigeration equipmentandwalk-in coolersfor restaurants, convenience stores, and grocery stores. The efficiency rules passed under the Biden administration alone would save households $107 each year over the next two decades, according to anestimate from the Appliance Standards Awareness Project, and collectively save business owners $2 billion each year. These recent moves by Republicans show that what started as a battle over âconsumer choiceâ has expanded into a larger attack on efficiency as an objective. âI donât think walk-in coolers are in the culture war,â deLaski said. âThe attempt to push to eliminate these commonsense standards is really broad, not just about showerheads or refrigerators or dishwashers.â This article originally appeared inGristathttps://grist.org/politics/energy-efficient-appliances-trump-culture-wars/.Â Grist is a nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate solutions and a just future.

While investigating a large collection of fossil insects at the Museum of Zoology at the University of SÃ£o Paulo, researchers in Brazil realized that a 113-million-year-old fossil represents a new ant species and might be the oldest ant specimen known to science. The fossilized ant, named Vulcanidris cratensis, is a member of the extinct ant subfamilyHaidomyrmecinae. Appropriately dubbed “hell ants,” Haidomyrmecinae ants existed during theCretaceous period(145 million to 66 million years ago) and are known to paleontologists for their vicious and highly specialized jaws. “Our team has discovered a new fossil ant species representing the earliest undisputable geological record of ants,” Anderson Lepeco, a researcher from the Museum of Zoology at the University of SÃ£o Paulo, said in a Cell Pressstatement. “What makes this discovery particularly interesting is that it belongs to the extinct ‘hell ant,’ known for their bizarre predatory adaptations.” Lepeco co-authored astudydetailing the discovery, published Thursday in the journal Current Biology. He and his colleagues studied the hell ant, preserved in limestone, via a 3D imaging technique called micro-computed tomography, which reveals the insides of objects. According to their analysis, the ant had impressive mandibles (mouth parts) that poked forward, parallel to the shape of the head in front of the eyes, which were likely used to pin down prey. In contrast, the mandibles on modern ants move sideways. “Finding such an anatomically specialized ant from 113 million years ago challenges our assumptions about how quickly these insects developed complex adaptations,” Lepeco explained. “The intricate morphology suggests that even these earliest ants had already evolved sophisticated predatory strategies significantly different from their modern counterparts.” Furthermore, the researchers concluded that the specimen was closely related to other previously discovered hell ant species preserved in amber in Myanmar. Since the Vulcanidris cratensis came from theCrato Formationâa fossil hot-spot in northeastern Brazilâthis suggests that by 113 million years ago, Haidomyrmecinae ants had already spread all over the world. “When I encountered this extraordinary specimen, we immediately recognized its significance, not only as a new species but as potentially the definitive evidence of ants in the Crato Formation,” Lepeco added. “This finding highlights the importance of thorough examination of existing collections — private or in museums — and brings a spotlight to Brazilian paleontology and the underexplored fossil insect fauna of the country.” The study ultimately reveals that ants had already diversified and expanded across the world 113 million years ago, shedding light on the evolution ofone of the most successful insects on the planet. fossilsInsectsPaleontology Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Every game you play from the card plays just as it would from the internal drive so you have fast load times and great gameplay with no compromise.

    "title": "This Electric Scooter Costs Next To Nothing, Amazon Is Cutting All Its Margin (Record Low Price)",
    "article_text": "This article is part of Gizmodo Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. It is extremely difficult to find a high-quality electric scooter for under $200 anymore, especially in 2025 whenthe most popular ones easily cost over $500. But Amazon is currently offering theMaxshot electric scooter for just $199 which is a huge 29% discount from its regular price of $279. This great deal has made it the#1 best seller in its categoryand shows just how popular (and value-for-money) this scooter is. Also keep in mind that this is the record low price for this model. See at Amazon The Maxshot electric scooter is built to meet the needs of daily commuters and weekend adventurers. It is fitted with8.5-inch tires, for a smooth and stable ride on urban roads and rough surfaces. Thescooter comes in models with a 350W motorwhich allows riders the choice of the power and speed level that suits their lifestyle. At atop speed of 19 to 22 mph, it’s fast enough to keep up with city traffic but slow and safe enough to maneuver for most adults. Depending on your journey,you can ride anywhere between 21 to 28 miles per chargewhich is more than most people commute, run errands or enjoy leisure rides for each day. The dual suspension provides you with a smooth ride even on bumpier roads and holds fold which makes it easy to carry onto public transportation or store in small crevices at home or in the office. The Maxshot scooter also comes equipped with a smart app so that you can monitor speed, battery, and ride statistics from your smartphone. That level of connectivity is typically reserved on much more expensive scooters so it’s even more astonishing to see it featured here at this $200 price point. Safety hasn’t been left behind either: there is decent braking and decent lights for nighttime riding or low-light conditions. If you’ve been waiting for the ideal moment to invest in an electric scooter, this is the opportunity you really don’t want (and should not) to miss. Deals like this, especially on a best-selling and feature-packed model, don’t come around frequently. At $199, this electric scooter offers a combination of performance, range, and smart features that’s practically never found at this price.

    "title": "Rare Exoplanet Orbits Two Stars at a Wild 90-Degree Angle",
    "article_text": "In 2018, astronomers discovered a pair ofbrown dwarfstars orbiting each other in a rare system known as an eclipsing binary. Further observations show that the binary, named 2M1510, is even more unique than previously believed. Researchers are reporting the discovery of an exoplanet, named 2M1510 (AB) b, orbiting its host star at an angle of 90 degreesâcalled a polar orbitâin relation to the brown dwarfs’ orbital plane. The discovery, made with the European Southern Observatoryâs (ESO) Very Large Telescope (VLT), is the first time scientists have documented strong evidence of a “polar planet” orbiting a stellar pair, as detailed in astudypublished Wednesday in the journal Science Advances. âA planet orbiting not just a binary, but a binary brown dwarf, as well as being on a polar orbit is rather incredible and exciting,â Amaury Triaud, a co-author of the study and an astronomer at the University of Birmingham in the UK, said in an ESOstatement. As of now, astronomers have discovered 16 circumbinary planets, according to the study: exoplanets orbiting two stars. However, these planets’ orbits are roughly on the same plane as the binary stars’ orbit around each other. Before the recent discovery, scientists had only theorized the existence of such a system with a circumbinary planet on a perpendicular orbitâalso called a polar orbitâbased on clues such as the detection of perpendicular planet-forming disks around pairs of stars. âI am particularly excited to be involved in detecting credible evidence that this configuration exists,â saidThomas Baycroft, a PhD student in astronomy and astrophysics at the University of Birmingham and lead author of the study. In addition to the exoplanet’s polar orbit, the brown dwarf pair itself is extraordinarily rare. They form an eclipsing binary, meaning their orbital paths make them eclipse each other as we see them from Earth. 2M1510 consists of only the second pair of eclipsing brown dwarfs known to science. While studying these two brown dwarfs, Triaud, Baycroft, and their colleagues noted that their orbital paths were being strangely “pushed and pulled.” This suggested the presence of an exoplanet on an unusual orbital plane, whose gravity the researchers presumably believed was messing with the binary pair, according to the statement. âWe reviewed all possible scenarios, and the only one consistent with the data is if a planet is on a polar orbit about this binary,â Baycroft added. âThe discovery…was serendipitous, in the sense that our observations were not collected to seek such a planet, or orbital configuration. As such, it is a big surprise,â Triaud concluded. âOverall, I think this shows to us astronomers, but also to the public at large, what is possible in the fascinating Universe we inhabit.â Astronomyexoplanets Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "I miss old PopCap like you miss old BioWare",
    "article_text": "Diamonds in my eyes. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. From 2000 to 2010, one of the most important studios in videogames was making the kind of games you'd see dismissed off-hand today. If PopCap released Bejeweled out of the blue right now every YouTube comment would say \"looks like a shit mobile game,\" but instead we live in the reality where PopCap dominated the casual game market for an entire decade, and now almost everything on mobile looks like a shit PopCap game. PopCap was so important there was a Peggle game inthe Orange Box. Valve's massive rectangular mic drop may be remembered for Portal, Team Fortress 2, and Half-Life 2: Episode Two, but it also contained Peggle Extreme—a crossover collaboration where Bjorn the unicorn had a headcrab and each of its 10 Peggle levels was themed around a Valve game. You'd clear a screen of orange pegs and hear the G-Man creepily utter, \"Cleverly done.\" These days Peggle Extreme is availablefree on Steam, where it stands as a glorious reminder of the days when PopCap ruled. It wasn't the only crossover between the casual gaming upstart and a major developer. Gyromancer was the result of a collaboration with Square Enix that married match-3 gem-spinning right out of Bejeweled Twist with JRPG storytelling and Final Fantasy monsters. Gyromancer lacked the PopCap sense of humor, which is probably why it's forgotten today, but it's another sign of an era when PopCap was so culturally significant UNESCO should have slapped World Heritage status on it. Some of PopCap's games were endlessly replayable because they presented simple ideas wrapped in enough color and incident to keep them compelling. Chuzzle is a perfect example, another match-3 game but one where you dragged rows and columns of adorable fuzzballs and L-shaped combos were allowed. I still play it today, and my girlfriend laughs when she pokes her head into the study to see what hardcore PC strategy game I'm playing today only to find I'm Chuzzling again. The best of PopCap's games took those simple ideas and wrung every drop of juice out of them across a mania of modes. Bejeweled 3 has classic mode, timed mode, puzzle mode, and the buck wild \"Zen mode\" where you play endless Bejeweled while being reminded of your breathing as ambient sounds and mantras reinforce your choice of positive thinking, self-confidence, or weight loss. Four more unlockable modes let you match gems to rescue butterflies, prevent ice from freezing your grid, dynamite a mine full of diamonds, or complete poker hands in what is basically a Bejeweled take on Balatro 14 years before Balatro was a thing. And Bejeweled 3 didn't even have one of the story modes where an entire campaign of whimsical oddness linked the levels together. Those really went above and beyond, with Bookworm Adventures having a plot about traveling through different genres of fiction and mythology you wouldn't expect from a word-forming puzzle game. Even Heavy Weapon, a Flash-style arcade sidescrolling shooter, came with a thick parody of \"Red Menace\" propaganda. The jewel in this particular crown was Plants vs. Zombies, which felt like the culmination of everything PopCap had been working toward for the prior decade. While the variety of vegetable defenders made it more complicated than something like Insaniquarium, its lane-based format kept it simpler than the other tower defense games of the time. The story mode was light-touch, told through Crazy Dave's rants and barely literate letters from the undead, and unlocked an incredible variety of minigames and puzzle modes. As well as bowling and a zen garden and survival mode there were recreations of whole other PopCap games with undead theming, Insaniquarium appearing as Zombiquarium and Bejeweled as Beghouled. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The traffic-cone zombies, even more shambling and pathetic than zombies usually are, were a perfect contrast with the bold-faced plants (whose almanac entries were written by cartoonist and PopCap regular Steve Notley, creator of Bob the Angry Flower). The climax of the game being a musical number with a singing sunflower performed by Laura Shigihara was the icing on the cake, but also feels like a relic of a distant time, a whole 'nother era of internet—a relic of a less cynical internet age. PopCap's early games were often built on existing ideas, with Zuma a fairly blatant reskin of '90s arcade game Puzz Loop, while Peggle drew inspiration from pachinko and pinball, and Bejeweled's match-3 mechanics have been traced back to a Russian game calledShariki. But as casual games moved to Facebook and mobile, PopCap became the one to copy, with Candy Crush the most blatant example. When it joined them, trading the world of deluxe casual for freemium, it became just another crab in the bucket. Apparently the studio was planning a shift to mobile and free-to-play games before being bought by EA, but that moment still marks a convenient line. Most of PopCap's games stopped coming out on PC and were full of offputting compulsion mechanics, while Plants vs. Zombies became a skin to stretch over a series of middling multiplayer shooters. Rather than end on a down note, let me point out that the spirit of PopCap is alive and well in idiosyncratic indie games that take one simple idea and rinse it, usually with an offbeat story mode thrown in. There's Donut County, Octogeddon, Grey Alien's Regency Solitaire series,Peglin(basically Peggle with goblins), andCreepy Redneck Dinosaur Mansion 3(basically an imaginary Dino Crisis spin-off from a world where \"survival horror match-3 metroidvania\" is a valid genre). PopCap spent a decade coming up with new ways for us to match three things, whether we spun them in a circle or shot them out of a frog's mouth, and that level of creativity is still with us even if it's spread over a bunch of indie developers. I haven't seen anyone follow up on Bookworm Adventures, but fortunately that one did end up with de facto World Heritage status because you can still find it on theInternet Archive.

    "title": "Because of a Baldur's Gate 3 weapon's deceptive description, it took me nearly two years to realize it's a sleeper beast⁠—and I'm kicking myself because it works the exact same way in Baldur's Gate 2",
    "article_text": "Belm is back, baby. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. While perusing the sickos-only BG3Builds subreddit, I learned something that shocked me thanks to the helpful comment of userArx_724, a bit of knowledge that's been out there in the ether, but was never apparent to this obsessive BG3 power gamer. TheBelmscimitar, obtainable in Act Three, isn't just a fun callback to Baldur's Gate 2, it's extremely powerful in the exact same way as the original, despite what its description indicates. TheOG Belmis a power gamer legend in Baldur's Gate 2, a staple in many builds. The +2 scimitar grants an extra attack per round. What's unstated is that, if you equip Belm in your offhand while dual wielding, the extra attack applies to your main-hand weapon. The killer move is to pair offhand Belm with one of BG2's super strong endgame weapons like theCelestial Furykatana orFlail of Ages, which also reappears in Baldur's Gate 3. You can find the BG3 version of Belm inJaheira's little druid Batcaveunder her house in the Lower City, with it implied to be a memento of her past adventures in the original games. Neo-Belm has the Bonus Action special ability, \"Perfectly Balanced Strike,\" whose description reads: \"Send Belm snaking out with an adder's speed, the very exemplar of swiftness embodied in steel.\" So you can make another attack as a bonus action, but the phrasing \"sendBelm\" made me assume it only worked with the scimitar itself⁠—it sounds even more exclusive than the original weapon's description, which already obfuscated its most powerful feature. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. There was also precedent for assuming it was just a watered-downsuggestionof the original sword:BG3's Flail of Agesis more a riff on thethemeof Flail of Ages, rather than a reprise of that monster weapon. It never occurred to me to just try offhanding Belm anyway, and I take some comfort that the update log for its page on the authoritative, well-maintained BG3 Wiki shows the information wasn't added until March of last year, seven months after BG3's release. Offhand Belm lets you attack with your main hand weapon as a bonus action, which is extremely powerful for characters who can't access theTwo-Weapon Fightingstyle, and/or are using a powerful main hand weapon that could outclass any potential offhand. A prime suspect there isShadow Blade, a weapon summoned through one of Patch 8's most powerful new spells, and the centerpiece of one of my favorite newBaldur's Gate 3 builds. Another strong candidate would be Orin's shortsword,Crimson Mischief. I'm also just excited that I canstillbe surprised by this game after nearly two years, and I love that Belm really was here in all its glory the whole time. Once I make it to the city inmy latest playthrough, I'm making a beeline to Jaheira's house, brushing past her squad of quirky orphans, and stealing her dang sword.

    "title": "Oblivion Remastered hit 4 million players in less than a week, with a big chunk of them buying the game on Steam",
    "article_text": "That overall figure includes PC, PS5, and Xbox sales, as well as Game Pass players. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Update 4/26/25:This article has been updated from its original published version with an addendum about the Palestinian Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) National Committee's call to boycott Xbox, over parent company Microsoft's supply of cloud and AI services to the Israeli military. First reported byEurogamer, Bethesda has publicly celebrated over four million players checking out its recently-launched remaster of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion. Alongside Baldur's Gate 3 Patch 8, the remaster has turned an otherwise-quiet April into boom times for RPG fans. Bethesda broke the news by tweeting the following message onX, \"The Everything App\":\"We are so grateful to the over four million of you that have already ventured into Cyrodiil with Oblivion Remastered. Thank you!\" We are so grateful to the over 4 million of you that have already ventured into Cyrodiil with Oblivion Remastered. Thank you! pic.twitter.com/Fz1lo7XZtMApril 25, 2025 In the context of Xbox's Game Pass service, that number isn't going to be one-to-one with full price sales, but it still indicates a stunning success for the game overall. Absent celebratory messages like these, the top-selling and concurrent player count charts on Steam and SteamDB are one of the few concrete ways we have of determining a game's sales success, but they're only part of the picture for a multiplatform release. Oblivion's presence on PC Game Pass doesn't seem to have hurt its straight up PC sales all that much, though. It currently has the fourth-highest player count on the platform according to bothSteam chartsandSteamDB, nearing 200,000 players at the time of writing. It's also number one on Steam'sofficial top sellerslist, and number two on theSteamDBbest selling tracker. Both assess games by overall revenue (importantly, not number of units sold) over a set period of time⁠—24 hours for Steam's official count, with extra scoring weight applied to sales in the past three hours, according toSteamworks documentation. The fact that it's overall revenue, including DLC and microtransactions, explains how weapon skin micro-economy Counter-Strike 2 and the $400+ Steam Deck remain perennial fixtures, while SteamDB may weight recent sales in a slightly different fashion, explaining the swapped positions of CS2 and Oblivion. Which is all very fascinating to me, and a helpful indicator of how Steam concurrents and best selling status relate to overall sales success for the multiplatform, Game Pass-accessible games coming out of Microsoft. Also, I guess the people wanted more Elder Scrolls. Who could have guessed? I've personally been enchanted by a Microsoft-supplied code of the game, a remaster of a childhood favorite. The celebratory atmosphere has left me feeling conflicted, sometimes even physically queasy, in the context of the Palestinian Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) National Committee'scall to boycott Xbox productsin light of Microsoft's business ties to Israel amid its ongoing genocide in Gaza andillegal occupation of the West Bank. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"[Microsoft] provides the Israeli military with Azure cloud and AI services that are central to accelerating Israel’s genocide of 2.3 million Palestinians in the illegally occupied Gaza Strip,\" reads the announcement on the BDS website. \"After 34 years of deep complicity with Israel’s military, the Israeli army relies heavily on Microsoft to meet technological requirements of its genocide and apartheid regime.\" I don't know what to say to a fellow Elder Scrolls fan looking to join in on this fun—I particularly can't speak from a position of moral authority, having played, enjoyed, and covered the game so much already. But it's ultimately up to Microsoft to cleave its much-beloved games business from deadly serious, real-life politics.

    "title": "The RoboCop: Rogue City expansion that looks like Dredd will bring more trouble to your PC in July",
    "article_text": "Unfinished Business gets a release date. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. RoboCop: Rogue Cityfell a few steps short of great when it released in 2023, but it was a fun enough romp through dystopian Detroit and a vast improvement over Teyon's (bad) Terminator game. So I was pleased to discover that it'sgetting an expansion, which we've now found out will land in July. Titled RoboCop: Rogue City – Unfinished Business, the expansion takes heavy cues from 2012 action film Dredd (which itself is very similar to 2011's The Raid, but Unfinished Business' reveal trailer directly references a line from Dredd, so that seems to be the primary inspiration). It sees Murphy battling through an OmniCorp skyscraper taken over by mercenaries, with interstitial missions that flash back to the days when he was all cop and no robo. The release date announcement was accompanied by a new story trailer, revealing a smidge more info about what's going on at the OmniCorp building. As well as being designed to house Detroit's homeless, it seems the building also contains a machine that can control all OmniCorps devices (presumably including Murphy). The trailer also provides a glimpse of some of the new characters in the expansion. Murphy will be guided through the building by a scientist named Miranda, but her name is about all the trailer tells us about that character.. The leader of the mercenaries also seems to be a figure from Murphy's past—they sound a bit like Max Becker from the original game, though it isn't clear if it's the same character. In any case, I hope Unfinished Business can bring a bit more of the style and satire inherent in Verhoeven's film. Rogue City nailed the character and the vibe of Detroit, and the action wasn't half-bad either. But it didn't quite nail the exuberance and scathing tone of the films. Teyon is improving all the time, though, so I'm looking forward to seeing how Unfinished Business turns out when it launches on July 17. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "Hexblade might the best 1-level dip in Baldur's Gate 3, but going the distance with a full 12 levels and their infinite necrotic ghost turrets has me fixing to finally beat the game without multiclassing",
    "article_text": "I'm Mr. Multiclass, but a full 12 levels of Hexblade is hard to beat. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Last week, my coworker, news writer Harvey Randall, wrote a 100% correct love letter totaking a single level of Baldur's Gate 3's new Hexbladein amulticlass build. Hexblade gets so much at level one⁠—Charisma-based melee attacks, Shield on short rest,Booming Blade, easier critical hits⁠—that almost any melee character could be improved with a cheeky nip of Hexblade. Swashbuckler 11 / Hexblade 1, Paladin 7 / Hexblade 5, Eldritch Knight 11 / Hexblade 1, they all spank. But I'm almost to the end of act one on Honour mode, and I have a crucial message for my fellow power gamers: Hexblade isn't just a single-level side dish, it's worth being your main course. What's more, my Hexblade might be the first character I take all the way through Baldur's Gate 3 without any multiclassing at all. The big impetus, the thing that made me go \"whoah, Hexblade time,\" wasShadow Blade, a completely revamped level two spell that might be one of the most overpowered in the game. It does 2d8+[your damage attribute modifier, here Charisma] psychic damage out of the gate, better than nearly every other melee weapon in act one. But it also gets stronger as you level up, dealing 3d8 damage and finally 4d8 damage with level three and five spell slots respectively. Add in the psychic damage-doublingResonance Stoneand fuhgeddaboudit, Shadow Blade is one of the best weapons you can use in BG3. That committed me to at least nine levels of Hexblade for full-power Shadow Blade, but I was still considering filling the rest with something else⁠—probably Champion Fighter, for even more crits and Action Surge. However, I've seen how great a pure Hexblade can be already after seven levels, and a thread on theBG3Builds subredditon just this subject convinced me to stay Hexy with it: Shadow Blade was just my gateway drug to a full 12 levels of Warlock. At level six, Hexblades unlockAccursed Spectre, which, like theSwashbuckler's Dirty Tricks, is an ability I wrote off as \"neat, but probably not all that powerful\" at first glance. In practice, naturally, it isutterly insaneand feels amazing to use. I'm not sure how intentional it is, but the subclass' Hexed Weapons will apply a Hexblade's Curse debuff far more reliably than the ability description would make you think⁠—pretty much every enemy I attack will be cursed by the time they die. Come level six, Hexblades can use a Reaction to turn nearly any enemy killed while hexed into a freaky ghost to fight by their side. Here's what makes it nutty: Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. You're basically an edgelord melee DPS guy who gets to summon pets every time they kill an enemy, with no downside, and the ghosts also just look and feel so good in action. When you attack an enemy, each ghost in play will magnetize to them and attack at once in a cascade of green damage numbers. It'ssick. There are three big additions at Warlock level 11 and 12 that convinced me to stick with Hexblade all the way: Anextra level five spell slot,Mummy summoning, and a capstone ability I never even realized was in the game calledLifedrinker. At level 11, Warlocks go from casting two spells per short rest, to getting three, for a total of nine level five spell slots per long rest. Warlocks have some juicy spells that can really compliment the Hexblade's melee DPS focus:Hunger of Hadarfor crowd control,Armour of Agathysfor tankiness,Hastefor extra attacks, andDarkness(paired with theDevil's SightInvocation) for tankinessandan accuracy bonus, just to name a few. Warlocks also get to pick from a special selection of level six spells calledMystic Arcanum, cast once per long rest, and for my money the best Hexblade option is Create Undead, which summons a powerful mummy to do your bidding. This one gets points for letting you cast it outside combat, saving your precious actions for more Shadow Blade attacks. Lifedrinker, meanwhile, is a Warlock Invocation (one of their every-few-levels special abilities) that adds your Charisma bonus as Necrotic damage to every melee attack. Stacking the same ability bonus multiple times for damage is one of the strongest buildcrafting moves in Baldur's Gate 3, and with Lifedrinker, a Hexblade will be adding their Charisma bonus to attacks three-to-four times between Hexed Weapon,Diadem of Arcane Synergy, Lifedrinker, and thePotent Robe(on your Booming Blade attacks). So yeah, I've never been a Warlock guy or a single-class guy over 450 hours of BG3 to date, but all of a sudden I'm locked in. 12 levels of what is not only one of the most powerful spellswords in BG3, but also an incredibly cool class fantasy: Dark magic edgy melee damage dealer with a summoned mind blade and undead minions. This might be my favorite BG3 character I've made yet.

    "title": "This upcoming life sim features co-op survival, farming, factory automation, time-travel romance, ghost hunting and mechs, which is probably why it doubled its Kickstarter goal in its first 24 hours",
    "article_text": "Autonomica aims to do it all. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Many games try to stand out by combining ideas from one genre with systemsfrom another, leading to a lot of games on Steam having descriptions that follow the formula \"A + B with C elements\". Upcoming survival game Autonomica represents the logical extreme of this approach, with a list of features so long it risks using up the entire alphabet. Announced way back in 2021 under the initial titleFarm Folks, Autonomica is an open world survival game playable solo or in co-op. The basic premise puts you in the role of a logistics engineer involved in a plane crash, awakening to find themselves stuck in a world where time is broken. At a quick glance, Autonomica looks like a billion other survival games, with a pleasant if rather unremarkable Fortnite-y aesthetic. But it recentlytook to Kickstarterto fund its ongoing development, and the campaign video demonstrates why it's taken so long to develop. For starters, Autonomica features both farmingandfactory automation. Many survival games have farming, while automation is usually the foundation of a game in itself. But Autonomica shamelessly helps itself to both, letting you raise animals and grow over 100 variations of crops while also automating farms and factories using Factorio-style conveyor belts. Such a combination would normally have any game reclining at the dining table patting its distended belly, but Autonomica waddles right back to the virtual buffet to stuff itself with more features. There are numerous vehicles you can pilot, including hoverboards, an offroad buggy and a big stompy mech. There are NPCs who will apparently respond to your actions, and who you can befriend, romance and even marry. And we haven't even got to the weird stuff yet. Nightfall in Autonomica heralds the arrival of eerie phantoms across the land, which you can hunt and capture to \"unlock powerful new technology.\" Finally, the time travel element is more than just narrative wrapping. Players can navigate different timelines and alternate worlds, providing access to new plants and animals while also letting you influence the trajectory of the game's story. It would be hard to believe, were not most of these features visible in action. Even after watching the video, I can't help but be alittlesceptical. Nonetheless, that hasn't stopped Autonomica blasting through its initial Kickstarter goal of $170,000. Indeed, it doubled that figure in less than 24 hours, currently sitting at almost 400,000 simoleons. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Consequently, Autonomica has also smashed through numerous stretch goals, meaning yes,even morefeatures are coming to the game. Unlocked stretched goals include modular aquariums, aquaponic farming, and character heights. At 400k, which Autonomica will almost certainly hit, the game will get pools and ponds, while half a mil of funding will bring underwater exploration. How well all this will fit together remains to be seen, although we won't havethatlong to wait to find out. Developer Crytivo plans to release Autonomica into early access in September this year, with a full release pencilled in for October 2026.

    "article_text": "Amerzone – The Explorer's Legacy is out now. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. PC gamers may be going hog wild over theOblivionremaster right now. But Bethesda's RPG isn't the only game involving people withuncanny facesto get a makeover this week. French publisher Microids just released a very shiny remake of its 1999 gameAmerzone – The Explorer's Legacy, the game that kicked off the Syberia series of adventures. Created by the late French illustrator and game developer Benoît Sokal, Amerzone introduced the world that was later used by the Syberia games, but tells a different, self-contained story. Set in a fictional region of South America inhabited by fantastical creatures, it puts you in the shoes of a nameless journalist tasked with returning the last egg of a species of giant bird to the region, according to the dying wishes of zoology expert Alexandre Valembois. At the time, Amerzone was praised for its advanced 3D visuals and was a big hit for Microids, selling a million copies. Comparisons were drawn to Myst, which Sokol cited as one of his major inspirations for the game. Indeed, I wonder whether it was Cyan Worlds' recentoverhaul of Mystthat prompted Microids to give Amerzone similar treatment. According to Amerzone's Steam page, the remake \"naturally pays tribute to the original game, but also offers a totally new experience of it.\" Primarily, this comes in the form of a significant visual overhaul. There's a gif on the Steam page comparing the old and new versions of the game's Jesuit priest David Mackowski, and it's quite the improvement. The original Mackowski looks like a jump scare, while the new one looks like an actual person. While it's pleasing to see this adventure gaming artefact get a new lease of life, the broader future of the Syberia series looks highly in doubt. Sokol died during the production of 2022'sSyberia: The World Before, and the game is dedicated to his memory. Moreover, Microidsreportedly laid offits entire Paris team—who developed both The World Before and this Amerzone remake, earlier this month. While I wonder how big the audience is for an Amerzone remake in 2025, laying off the development team before the game it made even has a chance to prove itself is brutal. Amerzone – The Explorer's Legacy is available now for $40 (£35). There's also a demo available on the game'sSteam page, if you'd like to try it before you buy.

    "title": "The end of The Long Dark is in sight after over a decade in development, culminating in a fifth and final story episode that is '3 to 4 times as big' as episode 4",
    "article_text": "\"The episode is the most ambitious we've built so far.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The Long Darkhas been in development for a long time. Hinterland's chilly survival game launched into Steam early access way back in 2014, beforeformally releasingthree years later. But the launch in 2017 only represented the completion of the game's survival mode. The episodic story mode, titled \"Wintermute\", has been grinding glacially forward ever since. Now, that journey is nearing its completion. Hinterland hasalready statedthat episode five will release sometime this year. Now, creative director Raphael van Lierop has explained why this final episode of the story has taken so long. Short version, it's a big one. \"The episode is the most ambitious we’ve built so far, and it has quite a few systems we haven’t used in other episodes, so it’s proving to be quite challenging for the team,\" wrote van Lierop in aSteam update. \"We know many of you—like us—have been waiting for years for this story to be completed. And once it’s done, we can never go back. So that’s really on our minds. The episode can’t just be good; it has to be great.\" Van Lierop didn't share too many specifics about what the episode will include, wanting to \"avoid spoilers\". But he did provide a clear estimation of the episode's scope. \"Episode five has between two to three times as much cinematic and story content as Episode Four, which is our largest episode to date,\" he explained. \"The game world you’ll be playing in is about three to four times as big as Episode Four.\" Alongside the size of the episode, van Lierop also detailed its structure, which he says is slightly different from the earlier parts of the story. \"Because of what the story needs, we’ve focused on narrative more than we have traditionally, and the mission flow for Episode Five is probably more linear than previous episodes as a result.\" That said, the places these missions will take you will be brand new to the game. \"Everything in the episode is new to the game and the world, so these will all be places you've never seen before.\" Episode five isn't the only thing van Lierop covers in the update. He also mentions that The Long Dark is getting a bunch of visual enhancements. These are apparently finished and will be coming to PC in late May. Graphical improvements include coloured shadows, ambient particle effects, enhanced draw distance, and improved anti-aliasing. As for what the release of episode five will mean for The Long Dark, Hinterland considers it to be the end of the project, insofar as delivering what they promised for the game. At that point, the studio's priorities will shift toBlackfrost: TheLong Dark 2,which was announced at last year's Game Awards. But the original will continue to receive support, and Hinterland is open to the prospect of adding more to the game in future: Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"We still intend to continue updating the game, but completing story mode has been a point of accountability for Hinterland all these years,\" van Lierop writes. \"With the story mode finished, we are looking forward to having some breathing room to figure out what's next and continue to do our work without the weight of a big promise hanging over us.\" 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Rick has been fascinated by PC gaming since he was seven years old, when he used to sneak into his dad's home office for covert sessions of Doom.

    "article_text": "Challenge accepted. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The internet creates a very strange kind of closeness, doesn't it? There are, on my Steam friends list, numerous people who just dropped off the Earth one day. One guy has been gone for a year. Another, 3646 days. If these were people I knew in real life, this kind of thing would have me filing a police report. The distance of a computer screen means that these people I used to see and perhaps speak to every day are just gone now. I hope they return. But it happens outside the confines of my Steam friends list, too. Two years ago games YouTuber/Bethesda shitposter Micky D uploaded a Fallout video and promptly vanished, only rearing his head again a few days ago to celebrate the Oblivion remaster before dropping an unhinged new video: Can You Play Daggerfall Without Leaving Daggerfall? The premise is simple enough: fire up The Elder Scrolls 2: Daggerfall, sprint out of the opening dungeon, make your way across the game's absurdly enormous map (literally the size of Great Britain) to the titular city, then lock yourself inside and never come out. The goal is to somehow amass a million gold—enough to buy the most expensive house in town—without ever stepping outside. This is a painful process. I am glad I did not have to do it but instead just watched a very amusing video about it. 2025 games: Upcoming releasesBest PC games: All-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Micky D eventually accomplished his happy task, although he ended up trapped in his new home's loft by a disappearing staircase bug that feels like some kind of message from god. But the experience sent me down a rabbit hole of challenge videos for Elder Scrolls games that I've not thought about in a very long time. Like the guys who play the first part ofMorrowind without being able to see, orwithout walking, or who try to literally kill god atlevel 1. Ilovethis stuff, even though it's not the kind of thing I would ever do myself (well,maybe for content). It feels like a kind of stress testing: forcing a game into an entirely new shape and seeing if it holds up, and at the same time revealing entirely new qualities in it that you might not even have noticed before. For instance, that if you have a good enough knowledge of the layout of Morrowind's opening level, you can finagle your way out of it blind by paying attention to where the directional audio cues come from (or, well, almost. Our hero eventually had to write out the necessary keystrokes step-by-step, but the principle is sound). Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. It's a testament to the flexibility and, well, admirable brokenness of these classic Elder Scrolls games, and that's before you get into adding in mods that let you do things like makeeveryone in the game a zombie. You're notmeantto be able to murder a god at level 1 and you're not meant to be able to spend your entire life amassing a fortune in a single town in a map the size of Britain, but these games' systems are so slippery, so strange, and so unrestricted that it becomes doable anyway. I imagine wiser developers might never put a set of arrows in that could kill literally anything in one hit, nor would they let you permanently kill someone integral to the main plot. But the fact that they did, in a fit of youthful indiscretion, means players are still layering on absolutely baffling challenges atop the game the devs actually meant to make two decades (or more) after they came out. I can't help but love those imperfections. One of Josh's first memories is of playing Quake 2 on the family computer when he was much too young to be doing that, and he's been irreparably game-brained ever since. His writing has been featured in Vice, Fanbyte, and the Financial Times. He'll play pretty much anything, and has written far too much on everything from visual novels to Assassin's Creed. His most profound loves are for CRPGs, immersive sims, and any game whose ambition outstrips its budget. He thinks you're all far too mean about Deus Ex: Invisible War.

As always we've got some great tips that'll help at any point in Saturday's game, as well as the April 26 (1407) answer ready to go. Today's game didn't get off to a great start—hi there, grey letters—but it soon turned into something with a little potential, and before I knew it I had the solution all laid out in a nice green-coloured row. It was the perfect weekend game in a way, flirting with disaster long enough to make me worry, but not long enough to turn my hair grey. Any sort of strong conflict could be called this. It doesn't have to be physical—colours and ideas can do this too. No, there is not a double letter in today's puzzle. A good starting word can be the difference between victory and defeat with the daily puzzle, but once you've got the basics, it's much easier to nail down those Wordle wins. And as there's nothing quite like a small victory to set you up for the rest of the day, here are a few tips to help set you on the right path: There's no racing against the clock with Wordle so you don't need to rush for the answer. Treating the game like a casual newspaper crossword can be a good tactic; that way, you can come back to it later if you're coming up blank. Stepping away for a while might mean the difference between a win and a line of grey squares. Enjoy another win. The answer to the April 26 (1407) Wordle isCLASH. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Past Wordle answers can give you some excellent ideas for fun starting words that keep your daily puzzle-solving fresh. They are also a good way to eliminate guesses for today's Wordle, as the answer is unlikely to be repeated. Here are some recent Wordle answers: Wordle gives you six rows of five boxes each day, and you'll need to work out which secret five-letter word is hiding inside them to keep up your winning streak. You shouldstart with a strong wordlike ARISE, or any other word that contains a good mix of common consonants and multiple vowels. You'll also want to avoid starting words with repeating letters, as you're wasting the chance to potentially eliminate or confirm an extra letter. Once you hit Enter, you'll see which ones you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second guess should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. With a bit of luck, you should have some coloured squares to work with and set you on the right path. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it wassold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes. When baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do. She's now PC Gamer's word game expert, taking on the dailyWordlepuzzle to give readers a hint each and every day. Her Wordle streak is truly mighty. Somehow Kerry managed to get away with writing regular features onold Japanese PC games, telling today's PC gamers about some of the most fascinating and influential games of the '80s and '90s.

    "article_text": "Nvidia’s 96GB RTX PRO 6000 is massive - AMD might be choosing battles wisely When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. AMDis set to expand itsworkstationGPU lineup with the imminent release of the new Radeon PRO W9000 series, built on the RDNA 4 architecture. This chip is aimed at professionals working in demanding fields such as video editing, 3D rendering, and AI development. A leak fromHoang Anh Phuclaims the lineup will include a 32GB model based on the new Navi 48 XTW architecture. AMD is supposed to be chasingNvidia, but the RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell boasts an enormous 96GB frame buffer and 24,064 CUDA cores. This is far beyond the 32GB configuration that AMD appears to be offering, suggesting the Radeon PRO W9000 may be targeting professionals who don’t require large datasets and instead value performance per dollar, along with efficiency and affordability. As with all unconfirmed rumors, the details should be taken with a grain of salt - but if accurate, the leak suggests a shift in how AMD prioritizes performance relative to cost. The previous-generation Radeon PRO W7900 featured 48GB of memory, so the 32GB - likely GDDR6 - is a reduction. While the capacity is lower, the Navi 48 XTW die, measuring 356mm², is still expected to deliver performance improvements across a wide range of tasks. It is also likely to bring benefits to CAD workloads, CGI rendering, and real-time simulations, areas where the best laptops forvideo editingorPhotoshopalso show gains. The chip is expected to come in XL, XT, and XTX variants, each tuned for different professional needs. The XTW model is believed to feature hardware enhancements optimized for pro workflows, making it a strong option for users needing aGPUfor production-grade tasks.

As Phu, a known hardware leaker, noted, “It’s not as beefy as the last generation, but pricing remains key.” One remaining question is software support. RDNA 4 does not yet have full integration with AMD’s ROCm platform, which is critical for AI and machine learning developers. Although final specs and an official name are still under wraps, all signs point to a strategic reveal aligned with Computex 2025 and AMD’s “Advancing AI” event in June 2025.

    "title": "Faster than SRAM! New flash memory tech from China is millions of times faster than NAND rivals from US, Japan or Korea - but please change its name",
    "article_text": "New graphene-based PoX memory writes in 400ps When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A research team in China has developed what claims is the fastest reported non-volatile semiconductor memory device to date, with a write speed of one bit every 400 picoseconds. The unfortunately named “PoX” (Phase-change Oxide), is a two-dimensional graphene-channel flash device developed at Fudan University in Shanghai. The team built the device using a Dirac graphene channel combined with a charge-trapping stack. It operates faster than the system-level access times typically associated with volatile memory types like SRAM and DRAM, which usually fall between 1 and 10 nanoseconds. A picosecond is one-thousandth of a nanosecond. Volatile memory like SRAM and DRAM offers high speed but loses data when power is removed. Non-volatile flash retains data without power but tends to operate at higher latencies, often in the tens of microseconds at the NAND level. This makes it less suited for low-latency workloads such as AI inference. The PoX device aims to bridge that gap by combining speed and persistent storage. The graphene-based device uses a two-dimensional hot-carrier injection mechanism. Its thin-body structure enhances horizontal electric fields, improving carrier acceleration and injection efficiency. At 5V, it achieved write speeds of 400ps and maintained performance over 5.5 million cycles. Long-term retention tests showed data stability over a simulated 10-year period. “By using AI algorithms to optimize process testing conditions, we have significantly advanced this innovation and paved the way for its future applications,” said Zhou Peng, lead researcher of the study. \"Our technology breakthrough is expected to not only reshape the global storage technology landscape, drive industrial upgrades, and foster new application scenarios, but also provide robust support for China to lead in relevant fields.\" Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Liu Chunsen, also involved in the research, said the team has created a fully functional chip and now aims to integrate it into existing devices. “The next step involves integrating it into existing smartphones and computers,” he said. “This way, when deploying local models, we will no longer encounter bottlenecks such as lagging and heating caused by existing storage technology.” ViaNature Wayne Williams is a freelancer writing news for TechRadar Pro.

    "article_text": "Businesses risk data breaches as millions of PCs face end of Windows 10 updates When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Microsofthas repeatedly announced it will end support forWindows 10 on October 14, 2025- however, a surprising number of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) are still unprepared. A poll conducted byCanalysrevealed over a third (35%) of channel partners said their SMB customers are either unaware of theWindows 10end-of-service (EoS) deadline or have no plans to upgrade their PCs. Of that 35%, 21% of SMB customers are aware of the impendingWindows 10 EoSbut have no upgrade plans, while 14% are completely unaware. Given the security and compliance risks of operating outdated systems after support ends, this lack of awareness and preparation is alarming. On the other side of the spectrum, 30% of SMB customers are aware and currently evaluating upgrade options, while only 35% have actively planned to upgrade their systems. This means nearly two-thirds of SMBs remain passive or uncertain in their approach to the upcoming change. Unfortunately, many businesses do not treat EoS management as an ongoing responsibility, an outlook that urgently needs to shift. “For customers in these situations, the delay in planning means they are likely to face a higher cost environment when the time comes to refresh their PC fleets,” said Ishan Dutt, Principal Analyst at Canalys. The firm added globalbusiness PCshipments rose 9.4% year-on-year to reach 62.7 million units in Q1 2025, but despite this hardware growth, many businesses are still lagging behind in software preparedness.

The end-of-service will leave millions ofbusiness laptopswithout updates or security patches. Dutt also warned that, as higher tariffs take effect, \"subsequent quarters this year are likely to see a slowdown\" as prices rise and demand softens. Businesses waiting much longer may face supply constraints just as endpoint security becomes more critical than ever.

    "article_text": "Upgrade discounts available When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. There are a couple of pieces ofGoogleNest thermostat news to bring you this weekend: support is ending for the older 1st and 2nd-gen models, while Google is going to stop selling the thermostat in the EU completely. First, the end of support for the 1st-gen Nest thermostat (launched in 2011), and the 2nd-gen Nest thermostat (launched in 2012).Google says(via9to5Google) that there will be no more software updates issued for these devices, from Saturday, October 25, 2025. At that point you'll no longer be able to control the thermostats from your phone either, and Home/Away modes will stop working too. You'll still be able to adjust modes, schedules, temperatures, and settings on the actual devices, however. To help soften the blow, Google is offering some upgrade discounts on the latest4th-gen Nest thermostatfor those who have older models: if you're in the US, you can get $130 off, which is almost half price. The second bit of news here is that there will be no more new Nest thermostats sold in Europe going forward. The3rd-gen modeland theNest Thermostat E, which launched in 2015 and 2017 respectively, are going to be all you can get hold of now. \"Heating systems in Europe are unique and have a variety of hardware and software requirements that make it challenging to build for the diverse set of homes,\" saysthe statement from Google.

    "title": "‘It's like magic and everything just works’: We spoke to Adobe’s AI maestro to find out what’s new with Firefly and how it levels up creativity for all",
    "article_text": "We chatted with Alexandru Costin about the new innovations coming to Firefly When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Alexandru Costin is Vice President, Generative AI and Sensei at Adobe. There was no getting away from Firefly at this year’sAdobe Max London. Already infused across the Creative Cloud suite, the AI image and video generator has been massively upgraded with new tools and features. Ahead of the events, we sat down with Alexandru Costin, Vice President, Generative AI and Sensei at Adobe, to explore what’s new with Firefly, why stories matter when using thebest AI tools, and how professionals can use it to enhance creativity across the board. At Max, we have the next generation of our image model, two versions of it. We have a vector model, we have the video model. So, a lot of progress on the model from Adobe, commercially safe, high quality, amazing human rendering. A lot of control and a great style engine, et cetera. We are also introducing third-party model integrations. Our customers told us that they want to stay in our tools, in our workflows. They are still using other models for ideation purposes, or for different personalities. So, we’re announcing OpenAI's GPT image integration and Google's Imagen and Veo 2 in Firefly, and Flux integration in Firefly Boards. The third big announcement is Firefly Boards is a new capability in the Firefly web application. We look at it as an all-in-one platform for next generation creatives to ideate, create and produce production content. Firefly Boards is an infinite canvas that enables team collaboration, real-time collaboration, commenting, but also deep Gen AI features stepping in, into all of these first-party and third-party models, new capabilities for remixing images. It’s not easy. We've been working on the project concept for like, a year. Actually, that underlying technology, we've been working on for many years, like real-time collaboration with deep integration, with storage, and innovation in Gen AI user experiences, remixing, auto-describing images to create the prompts for you. There's a lot of deep technology that went into it. It looks like magic, and is very easy [to use]. We hope it's so easy. Our goal is to build a complex layer. So for customers, it's like magic, and everything just works. My favorite feature is integration between image, video, and the rest of the Adobe products. We're trying to build workflows where customers that have an intent in mind, and they want to paint the picture that's in their mind, can use these tools in a really connected way without having to jump through so many hoops to tell their story. Firefly Image 4 offers amazing photo realism, human rendering quality, prompt understanding. You iterate fast. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! With Image 4 Ultra, which is our premium model, you can render your image with additional details, and we can take them into the Firefly video model as a keyframe, and create a video from that whole image. Then you can take that video into Adobe Express and make it like an animated banner, add text, add fonts. In Creative Cloud, we have a lot of capabilities that exist already. We're bringing Gen AI inside those workflows, either in Firefly on the web, or directly as an API integration. But for me, I think the magic is having all of this accessible in an easy way. The Photoshop team is also working on an agentic interface. They call it a new Actions panel. You type in what you want. We have 1000 high-quality actions we've curated for you. There are all these tools in Photoshop that are sometimes hard to discover if you're not an expert, but we're gonna just bring them and apply them for you. I mean, you will learn along the way, but you don't need to know everything before you start. Not only we're helping you achieve your goal, we're also teaching you the ins and outs of Photoshop as we go through this. It is. It's too powerful to some extent. It has so many controls, it might be intimidating, but with the new Actions panel, we want to take a big chunk of that entry barrier away. Everybody will benefit from this technology in different ways. For creative professionals, it will basically remove some of the tedium, so they can focus on creativity. But with things like Firefly Boards, they will be able to work with teams and clients much better. The client can upload in boards some stylistic ideas, and then you can take it and integrate it very fast in your professional workload. For consumers, with people that want to spend seconds to create something, with Firefly, you just type in the prompt and we do it for you. It's a great capability. In the middle, there are the folks learning in their careers, aspiring creative professionals, next generation creatives. And for them, we want to give them both Gen AI capabilities, but also a bridge towards the existing pixel-perfect tools that we have at Adobe. Because we think a mix of those two worlds is the best mix that next generation creatives need to be armed with. For me, a big opportunity is better understanding of humans, like prompt understanding agentic, having a creative partner to bounce ideas off of. Another thing we're announcing is the [upcoming] Firefly mobile app. This is a companion app that can use many of the Firefly app capabilities, generate text, generate video, et cetera. But also, because it's on mobile, you have access to the camera, you have a microphone, there are many new opportunities to make these interactions easier. So, we're looking into that. We do think next generation creatives are a big target market for us because we want to give them the tools of the trade. For us, customers are why we get up in the morning every day, they are telling us what they need, and they told us they want more quality, better humans, more control, better stylization. That's what's behind the image model updates. We just want to make them more usable in more workflows for actual production use-cases. Because our model is uniquely positioned to be safe for commercial use, we want customers to use it everywhere. For video, video is also growing, and many of our customer-base doesn't know how to use the video product. So, making video creation more accessible is another great accelerant for creativity. We want to offer a larger population of people the tools to tap into video and be able to start achieving their goals there. While, of course, inside products like Premiere Pro, we're continuing to integrate deeper, more advanced features, like a couple of weeks ago at NAB, we launched Generative Extend. It won one of the awards. Gen Extend is a 4K extension, enabling professional videographers to basically extend clips so they don't have to reshoot. What motivates us is helping our customers tell stories, better stories, more diverse stories, and be successful in their careers. I think through human creativity and engineering, how do they differentiate today? They're all using Photoshop. They do find ways to differentiate because, in reality, Gen AI is a tool designed, at least from an Adobe perspective, to be of service to the creative community, and we want to give them a more powerful tool that should help them level-up their craft. They're describing it as going from the person editing to a creative director. All of our customers can become directors of these Gen AI tools to help them tell better stories, tell stories faster, et cetera. So, we think the differentiation will still be in the creativity of the human using the tool. And we're seeing so much innovation. We're seeing people using these technologies in ways we haven't even thought about, which is very exciting, always. Mixing them in novel ways. Because that's how you differentiate. And we do think there will always be many ways to express somebody's creativity. We think creativity comes in a variety of ways, and there are different tools creative people will use and mix together to tell better stories and change culture.

    "article_text": "The sounds are silenced When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Watching Netflix with captions on has long been a practice in my home, starting with my youngest, who, as a GenZ, explained how streaming with captions on enables the multi-tasking that is so much a part of their lives. Back when I first learned about this fast-growing habit, I assumed closed captions or subtitles were solely for people with hearing challenges. I knew my child didn't have any, and when I asked why they were watching Netflix with captions on, they looked at me like I had bananas for arms and told me, \"Everyone does it.\" That hyperbole led to some research, discovery, and this postI wrote on Medium. For my daughter and their GenZ cohort, captions helped bridge the distracted divide between the phone in their hands and thebest streamingcontent on their TV. I even spoke to mental health professionals who also noted this was becoming common practice. As I wrote then, my child tried to explain how captions were more than just an aid to understanding: “It helps me with my ADHD: I can focus on the words, I catch things I missed, and I never have to go back,” she replied. “And I can text while I watch.” I got it, but I don't think I fully understood until I turned on my own Netflix closed captions. There were two shows, in particular, that made me a convert. First,Call My Agent, a smart French comedy about a Paris-based talent firm. It ran four seasons, and we got hooked, even though we were reading the whole time. The second show wasPeaky Blinders.Now, this show is in English, but the accents from Birmingham, England, were so thick that when we first tried watching, we gave up halfway through the first episode because we couldn't understand a thing. A few years later, we returned but with captions enabled. That changed everything, and we became huge fans. One thing, though, about Netflix subtitles has always bothered me: descriptions of sounds. You get the idea. These audio cues are crucial for the hearing-impaired, but essentially unnecessary for those with full hearing, like me. Even for GenZers like mine, I don't think the descriptions of these audio-only moments enhanced their viewing experience and, perhaps, were a bit of a distraction. Netflix's decision to finally add an option for subtitles onlyis long overdue. The adjustment appears now as a new option under Audio: \"English\" subtitles, as opposed to \"English (CC)\". It's a small change, I know, but I'm certain my family and I will be using it from now on. At least some of us. You see, while my youngest watcheseverythingwith captions, and my wife increasingly watches almost everything with captions, I still do it less so, and my son never does it and finds them distracting. If I'm being honest, though, I'm finding that captions are useful in more situations than just foreign language and accent-heavy productions. I can no longer quite pick up what people are saying when they're speaking softly, whispering, or, as is often the case, mumbling. Also, sound mixing often overplays sound effects and overwhelms the dialogue. In lieu of a better sound system, a clear caption is an effective solution. And now, without the extraneous text that tells me \"loud explosion,\" this experience is about to get so much better. So, thanks, Netflix, for always supporting the hearing-impaired and for now giving us new captioning devotees a sound-effect-free option. I'll be using it a lot.

The answers to today's Connections, game #686, are… I regularly use a calculator, have copious amounts of hair on my head, love a salty snack, and regularly shop at Ikea, yet I found today’s puzzle utterly baffling. CALCULATOR BUTTONS I got straight away, but then came the collapse. First, I thought that there was a group of Victorian authors that I knew nothing about – so I linked LOCK, THATCH, TAKI and TUFT. I got the \"one away!\" alert, but still didn’t think about hair and instead persisted with my literature hunch and swapped THATCH for RUFFLE. After finally getting AMOUNTS OF HAIR I still faltered with just two groups to get – first thinking there was something about bowls. In my defense, cultural difference again thwarted me, as the majority of the products referenced as a SALTY SNACK UNIT, as well as SWEDISH FISH, are rare delicacies in the UK. How did you do today? Let me know in the comments below. NYT Connections is one of several increasingly popular word games made by the New York Times. It challenges you to find groups of four items that share something in common, and each group has a different difficulty level: green is easy, yellow a little harder, blue often quite tough and purple usually very difficult. On the plus side, you don't technically need to solve the final one, as you'll be able to answer that one by a process of elimination. What's more, you can make up to four mistakes, which gives you a little bit of breathing room. It's a little more involved than something like Wordle, however, and there are plenty of opportunities for the game to trip you up with tricks.

    "title": "I wish phone makers would stop calling budget phone features 'flagship'",
    "article_text": "You can’t just manifest better specs When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Earlier this week, Xiaomi launched the Poco M7 Pro 5G in the UK, the latest entry in the sub-brand’s line of affordable handsets, and a device that brings some neat features to the table for its low £199 price tag. For far less than even some of thebest cheap phones, the M7 Pro 5G offers a 120Hz display, a 5,110mAh battery, and a 50MPSonycamera – nothing about what I’m about to say next suggests that this isn’t solid value for money. However, Xiaomi has insisted on labeling some of the Poco M7 Pro 5G’s features and components as “flagship” – particularly its IP64 dust and water resistance rating. With respect to Xiaomi, which makes some of thebest phonesaround (even if they’re a pain to get your hands on), that description is fresh out of 2012. An IP64 rating is not, under any modern definition, flagship-grade for a phone. The most recent true flagships – like theOnePlus 13– carry IP69 ratings, which promise resistance from powerful jets of heated water and total dust resistance. In fairness, an IP64-rated phone is still dust-sealed, but that standard only protects against splashes of water with some ingress allowed. That just doesn’t match up against theiPhone 16 Pro Max,Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, andGoogle Pixel 9 Prosof the world, all of which can take a dip in fresh water and emerge unscathed thanks to their IP68 ratings (though we'd still never recommend testing this claim for yourself!).Furthermore, press materials seen by TechRadar describe the 2x digital zoom function of the M7 Pro 5G's camera system as \"flagship-level\", and while flagships do utilize in-sensor cropping, the M7 Pro 5G is unlikely to keep up with its relatively smaller 1/1.95-inch sensor. For reference, theiPhone 16sports a 1/1.56-inch sensor, while its Android rival, theGoogle Pixel 9, boasts a 1/1.31-inch sensor. And even if the M7 Pro 5G's 2x digital zoom does somehow match its more expensive rivals, this feature is not described as \"flagship-level\" onthe phone's official web page.That makes me think Xiaomi is either confused about its own product or seeking to influence coverage with terms it won't use in public. Either way, that's an issue. In fact, the only aspect of the Poco M7 Pro 5G I’d call “flagship” quality, at least without having tested one myself, is its 5,110mAh battery – and yet Xiaomi doesn’t call it so. It's not just Xiaomi doing this, either.Oppo's UK website describes the Oppo Reno 12 FS camera system as a \"flagship camera combo\", and as my fullOppo Reno 12 FS reviewdetails, that's flat-out untrue. In fact, the Oppo Reno 12 FS 5G (which otherwise boasts great value for money and serviceable performance) sports a 50MP main camera, an 8MP ultrawide camera, and a2MP macro camera. If theiPhone 17 Pro Maxlaunches with a 2MP lens in tow, I'll happily give Oppo a retroactive pass for this, but until then, that's simply not flagship-grade hardware. What we’re witnessing is a peculiar attempted transformation of language. Flagship was once a literal term, meaning the best phone a company has to offer, but,as I’ve previously discussed,the term has become more vague as companies likeAppleandSamsungdevelop flagshiplineupscomprising several distinct but related models. What companies like Xiaomi are attempting to do is push the term one step further into the abstract; to change the meaning of the word “flagship” to one that simply connotes ideas of better performance and higher status, rather than a title given to certain devices by phone makers to reflect the expectations of consumers. In the plainest terms, these companies would like control of the “flagship” narrative to get you to think better of their mid-range and budget phones. That’s not necessarily as ominous as it sounds – modern tech marketing relies on imaginative storytelling that highlights the position of devices in our lives. Just look at the real-life stories that opened theSeptember 2024 Apple Event. I’ve no problem with phone makers calling their devices essential, or innovative, or brilliant, because most of the time there’s a good bit of truth to these claims. However, when it comes to the term “flagship”, it’s important that brand messaging aligns with user expectations, so that customers aren’t misled. Flagship phones are typically big sellers and a big draw for users, so it’s crucial that customers who may not know too much about tech specs aren’t drawn to products that won’t live up to their needs. The new Poco M7 Pro 5G is a budget phone, through and through – and there’s no shame in that. As much as my magpie-coded brain loves a shiny new flagship, I recommend the Samsung Galaxy A36 to most people I know as they simply don’t care about the latest and greatest specs – I’m sure the Poco M7 Pro will find its own audience of savvy customers, too. But for the buyer who just wants the latest and greatest phone, and is willing to spend up to $1,200 to get that, the least phone makers can do is keep the term “flagship” to its current definition.

    "title": "300 billion and counting: most popular chip designer in the world turns 40, and it all started in a wooden barn",
    "article_text": "Arm’s minimalist chip design became the blueprint for modern computing When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In April 1985, a small team at Acorn Computers in Cambridge, UK, set out to rethink what a processor could be. Engineers Sophie Wilson and Steve Furber developed the ARM1 (it originally stood for Advanced RISC Machines), an unassuming chip with just 25,000 transistors, to power the BBC Micro, crafting a 32-bit processor that emphasized reduced instruction sets for faster, more efficient computation. The design's low power consumption was partially driven by practical constraints, namely the need to run in cheaper plastic packaging. ARM2 soon followed, incorporated into the Acorn Archimedes, the first RISC-based home computer. ARM3 introduced a 4KB cache and further improved performance. After the spin-off from Acorn in 1990,ARMLtd. was founded as a joint venture between Acorn,Apple, and VLSI. One early commercial success was the Apple Newton, followed by widespread adoption in mobile phones like the Nokia 6110, which featured the ARM7TDMI. ARM6, introduced in 1991, brought full 32-bit processing and an MMU, key to powering GSM mobile phones. In 2005, Armv7 architecture debuted with the Cortex-A8 processor, which brought SIMD (NEON) support and powered many early smartphones. In 2011, Armv8 introduced 64-bit support and became the foundation for cloud, data center, mobile, and automotive computing. Features like SVE and Helium pushed performance and AI capabilities further. The 2021 launch of Armv9 marked the architecture's shift into AI-centric workloads. It introduced Scalable Vector Extension 2 (SVE2), Scalable Matrix Extension (SME), and Confidential Compute Architecture (CCA). These features made it suitable for everything from smartphones with advanced image processing to AI servers handling generative workloads. SME accelerates generative AI and MoE models, while SVE2 brings enhanced AI capability to general-purpose compute. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Arm's compute subsystems (CSS), based on Armv9, now serve client, infrastructure, and automotive markets. By integrating CPUs, interconnects, and memory interfaces, these CSS platforms support rapid development of specialized silicon. From the original ARM1 with just 25,000 transistors to today’s Armv9 CPUs packing 100 million gates, the architecture has consistently driven computing forward for four decades. Arm-based chips now power over 300 billion devices worldwide, from tiny embedded sensors to full-scale data centers. With 99% of smartphones running on Arm and growing adoption in IoT, cloud, and AI workloads, the architecture continues to scale thanks to its energy-efficient design and flexible licensing model. Looking ahead, there have been growing rumors that Arm could move beyond licensing andinto chip production, something that would put it in competition with its biggest customers. This speculation intensified recently followingthe acquisition of Ampere Computing, Arm’s only independent server chip vendor, by SoftBank, Arm’s Japanese owner.

    "article_text": "Expect this screen size When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Samsunghas confirmed thatit's working ona tri-fold foldable phone, and while we don't have too many details about it yet, the latest leak around the handset gives us some more information about the screen size. This tip comes from well-known leakerDigital Chat Station(viaNotebookcheck), who says that we're looking at a main screen size of around 9.9 inches. That's a little smaller than the 10.2-inch display sported by the Huawei Mate XT tri-fold. It also lines up rather neatly with previous rumors around this Samsung device:those rumors have predicteda main screen size of 9.96 inches and an outer screen size of 6.49 inches, which also indicates a key difference from the Huawei Mate XT. Whereas the three panels of the Mate XT fold back on each other, leaving a third of the screen visible when it's closed, the Samsung tri-fold isexpected to fold inwards– so all of the main display gets covered up when it's shut, and a second display is needed. This same leak suggests that the Samsung tri-fold will be launching this year. It may show up sometime in July, which is when theSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7andSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 7are expected to be unveiled. Other whispers we've heard around this Samsung tri-fold are that it'lloffer 2,600 nits of brightnesson its screens, which is a very decent figure and matches up with what's already offered by theSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 6. There's also been talk that the tri-fold might end up being calledthe Samsung Galaxy G Fold. That's by no means official yet, but that moniker would fit in neatly with the other foldable phones that Samsung already manufactures.

    "article_text": "Please, Google – fix your subscriptions menu When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. TheYouTubeexperience on TVs has always felt like an afterthought compared to watching it on phones or the web. But with TV recently becomingmore popular than mobilefor watching YouTube in the US, the television experience isfinally going to get a redesign soon– and that's great news, as long as some annoying issues are fixed in the process. Nearly all of my YouTube watching takes place on my TV via theAppleTV app. I thought this made me a streaming dinosaur, but the 2025 stats say different, and that's why YouTube has promised to prioritize the big screen this year in a way that it never has before. This week, to tie in withYouTube's 20th birthday, we heard that the home of short-form video is getting a \"TV viewing upgrade\" that will roll out \"this summer\". Precise details of what that means are scarce, but a teaser image (above) gives us an idea of what to expect, along with a few promised improvements. These include \"easier navigation\" (let's hope that includes an improved search experience), plus some \"quality tweaks\" and a better playback experience. YouTube is also promising \"streamlined access to comments, channel info, and subscribing.\" That last point caught my eye, because a relatively recent change to subscriptions in YouTube's Apple TV app has become a serious pain – and according toReddit threads, I'm not alone in feeling that way. Rather than listing your subscriptions in alphabetical order, the TV app on most services (GoogleTV, Fire TV, and more) now jumbles them up confusingly in order of mysterious \"relevance\" – even though that isn't the case in the mobile app. And it frustrates me almost every time I watch YouTube on the big screen.

Granted, there are bigger complaints about the YouTube experience on TVs – most notably, an increasingly painful ad experience that is making YouTube Premium mandatory, unless you enjoy pressing the mute button every few minutes. But I'm hoping YouTube's promised navigation improvements include bringing back alphabetical subscription lists, or a better way to experience them. I previously used the subscriptions list like an EPG, which helped me quickly find the latest series I was enjoying (my latest obsession beingTrash Theory's excellent music essays). Now, the channels are ordered by what YouTube considers \"most relevant\", which is usually different from what I think is relevant – because YouTube can't (yet) read my mind. This is something you can change when watching in a browser (by going to Subscriptions > Manage > then choosing A-Z from the drop-down menu), but no longer in the many TV apps. There are workarounds like casting from your phone to your TV instead, but I'm a TV native when it comes to YouTube – so I hope the big redesign that's en route also restores some of the functionality that was recently removed in classic Google fashion. There is a danger that these new features will be accompanied by 'upgrades' like \"pause ads\", which is somethingYouTube has been testingwhile drumming its fingers together like Mr Burns. Another feature that has been promised is a \"second screen experience that lets you use your phone to interact with the video you're watching on TV\". I'm realistic – Google and YouTube rarely give us new features without finding ways to simultaneously print more ad money from theone billion hourswe spend watching YouTube content on TVs every day (yes, really). But as long as the TV experience finally feels as polished and user-friendly as the mobile app, I'll likely continue to spend more time on YouTube than thebest streaming services.

    "article_text": "Here's your firmware update for April 26, 2025 When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. This week, we celebrated Earth Day with a suite of sustainability-focused pieces, saw ourLGTVs morph into Xboxes, and got to experience the new Insta360 X5. To catch up on all that and more from the world of tech, scroll down for recaps of the week's seven biggest tech news stories. When you're done, be sure to check out our picks for theseven new movies and TV shows to watch this weekend (April 25). To celebrate Earth Day this year, we've put together a suite of stories from across the tech industry to celebrate, challenge, and highlight all things sustainable. With deep dives intosustainability champions like Fairphone, exciting details on breakthroughs in sustainable tech – like howextreme heat could be the answer to our lithium ion battery woes– and guides onhow to best shop for secondhand tech, we have you covered with articles that are well worth your time if you’re keen to go green. We’ve also published new video content on ourTikTok,Instagram,andYouTubechannels, so make sure you're subscribed on those platforms if you want to see all of our sustainability coverage from this past week. Almost two months after it was announced, Alexa+ still hasn’t appeared on our Echo Show devices. We’re getting impatient, but thankfully, a member ofAmazon’s early adopter program has taken to Reddit to share their experiences with the new voice assistant while we wait. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. It sounds like there are still a few quirks to be worked out (Alexa+ tries to direct users to Amazon Music when they want to play from Spotify), but overall, they were pretty impressed – particularly when it came to interpreting complex questions and synthesizing speech. \"Old Alexa was hot garbage, but this new one was a pleasant surprise,” the tester concluded. High praise indeed. Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders finally went live on April 24 in the US after the unexpected delay that came during the US tariff uncertainty earlier this month. And there were mixed results with how it went, to say the least. Away from Nintendo’s own invite-based pre-order system, three big retailers in Walmart, Target, and Best Buy, all launched their pre-orders at midnight on April 24. There was huge clamour for the product, and while some offered only the standard console andMarioKart Worldbundle, others (Best Buy) crafted a whole heap of bespoke bundles. GameStop opted for going later in the day, releasing in-store pre-orders when shops opened, and choosing to put its online stock live at 11am. However, this method was - from our learned experience, at least - a huge disappointment. The interest was so high that GameStop’s website fully stopped working for large periods of time. Across the board, it was a familiar story in terms of a sought-after hardware launch: some folks were lucky, and some folks were not. Here’s hoping it all levels out soon enough. The UK’s Switch 2 pre-order status is now less hectic, but readily available stock remains hard to come by. This weekMicrosoftcontinued its mission to turn everything into an Xbox, with its latest efforts transforming your LG TV into an Xbox through its cloud gaming service. If you have a WebOS 24 or WebOS 25-compatible TV (i.e. if your LG TV launched in 2022 or after, or if it’s a 2021 StanbyME display) you can install a beta version of the XBox app. All you’ll need then is an Xbox controller and aGame Pass Ultimatesubscription. Just remember that because it’s all happening in the cloud the quality of your experience will be determined by the quality of your internet connection, so if your connection isn’t the most stable your LG Xbox gaming might be a little choppy. The 2025 Motorola Razr family is here, including the new flagship Motorola Razr Ultra, and Motorola is tripling down on its commitment to unique CMF - color, materials, and finish. Besides the unique color options – all straight from Pantone’s color catalog – Motorola is making phones with unique materials like real wood and Italian Alcantara, and offering finish options that make the phones feel like nylon, Acetate, or faux leather. This Razr is truly the antidote for boring phone design, and I had fun flipping through the different looks to decide which I liked best. Spoiler: it’s the Alcantara, which has a luxurious and soft feel; though it’s a toss-up between that Scarab color and the new Mountain Trail wood option. The Razr Ultra is no slouch in the spec department either, and Motorola is finally offering flagship performance in its high-end model. Sadly, that comes with a higher price tag this year, but it could be worth the extra cost if the cameras and battery deliver on their promise. Just over a year ago, we declared the Insta360 X4 is the best 360 camera out there – and this week got a sequel with the inventively named Insta360 X5. This new and improved model can record8K360-degree at 30 frames per second or 5.7K at 60fps – like its predecessor – though with a bigger image sensor it should deliver much better low-light image quality than the X4, and should boast better dynamic range at all resolutions to make the color of your shots appear more vibrant. You’ll also appreciate the bigger battery capacity, efficiencies, and heat dissipation that Insta360 says result in the X5 boasting a 37% longer battery life and the device running less hot – an issue we know some had with the X4 before it. This means you should be able to rely on the X5 to record more of your adventures between charges. The Insta360 X5 Standard Version costs $549.99 / £519.99 / AU$929.99, while the Essentials Bundle costs $659.99 / £609.99 / AU$1,109.99 and includes an extra battery, fast charge case, 114cm invisible selfie stick, standard lens guards, lens cap, and carry case. One of AI’s most useful tricks is acting as a brainstorming sidekick – andAdobehas just launched a new tool that looks ideal for visual creativity sessions. Firefly Boards (which is the new name for ‘Project Concept’) is available to try now in beta and is an infinite canvas for moodboarding where you can use both AI-generated images and your own reference photos to come up with fresh ideas. It’s built for designers, but could also level up your birthday party invitations in a big way. There’s a free version with limited credits, and you can join the waitlist now.

    "title": "I tried using ChatGPT to restore old photos, here’s how to really do it",
    "article_text": "And how to avoid the common mistake When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. There’s a new AI image fad spreading on the internet, one that could bring new life to those dusty shoeboxes and family albums.ChatGPTusers have discovered that the AI assistant can take old photos and mimic a restored, colorized version. I first saw it discussed on aReddit thread, one that was initially skeptical of ChatGPT's restoration ability for good reason. The AI was far more likely to take an old headshot and 'restore' it by making a headshot of someone who might be the cousin of the person in the original photo. Thanks to tips shared by others on Reddit and Instagram on how to make it work properly, I cobbled together a prompt that does a pretty good job of it. The prompt I settled on is:“Please upscale and colorize this photo while keeping it faithful to the time period. Do not change the arrangement, expressions, background, or attire; only add period-accurate color and details. The new photo should overlay the original exactly.\" It's not actually restoring the image, but you might think of it as a recreation by an art forager with a modernist streak. The results are in color, with better resolution, any damage repaired, and even some lost details reimaged. Again, it's important to remember this isn't the same thing as enhancing the actual photo, but it's amusing, and certainly feels less problematic thanswiping Studio Ghibli's style. To test out the trend, I pulled some public domain photos from the Library of Congress, which is truly an amazing resource. Check out some of the results below. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. First up is President Theodore Roosevelt. The photo catches Teddy in the middle of a writing session at his desk. The desk has a large plaque and, a very of the time, liquor decanter with glasses. After ChatGPT does its work, you can see some fine details and colors. Now, not all of those details are right. Hand positions, chairarmshape, a radio replaced with what looks like a large candle, and plenty more. It managed to capture a lot of the man himself pretty well, though. Next came the bicycle delivery boy. Again, the person looked amazingly like the original. The original photo was already lively, with puddles on a street that is clearly filthy. The colorized version decided that meant the street had a nice hardwood floor for some reason. Even so, the sign on the building behind the bicyclist, along with the crowd in the background, all really pop. It even managed to get the reflection of the bicycle on the ground. Moving ahead in time a bit is this soda jerk. A happy fellow smiling while handing over what I can only assume is an egg cream or a root beer float with the flair of a Broadway actor playing “guy who loves seltzer.” ChatGPT delivered a restored version that nailed his face and expression, not to mention the bow tie. Sure, the hair is a little off, and I'm not sure how appetizing the modern drink looks, but it seems like he enjoys his job in the black void behind the counter. Then came the two policemen in their long coats and tall hats. I assume the serious mustaches were part of the uniform. The colorized version brought their uniforms to life with deep navy blue tones and brass buttons that practically gleam. The officers are a little taller than their black and white counterparts, with somewhat better tailoring, but it's a photo that belongs in the same law enforcement portraits. Speaking of mustaches, that's the real star of the last photo. You almost don't even notice the gentleman behind it. It's not just facial hair, it's architecture. The restored version very slightly cleaned up the stray hairs, but otherwise, this was the most impressive result. The face, haircut, coat, and even the crease in the shirt are there. Every bristle is crisp, and wherever he's headed, I'd love to see the rest of the barbershop quartet.

    "title": "Trump demands free passage via Suez Canal",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump has claimed that neither the Panama nor Suez Canal would“exist”without the United States, demanding that American commercial and military vessels be allowed to pass through the crucial waterways totally free of charge. Trump has repeatedly expressed his intention to“take back”control of the Panama Canal, using economic or military means if necessary. On Saturday, the US president’s desire to protect American“national security”interests from Chinese competition extended to another strategic waterway – Egypt’s Suez Canal, which connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea. “American ships, both military and commercial, should be allowed to travel, free of charge, through the Panama and Suez Canals! Those canals would not exist without the United States of America,”the president said in a Truth Social post. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio was already instructed“to immediately take care of, and memorialize [sic], this situation,”Trump added. Trump did not elaborate on how exactly Washington ensured the existence of the Suez Canal, which was conceived, financed and built without US involvement in the 1850s. It operated under French, British, and later Egyptian control, all without American construction or funding. The US, however, led an international mine-clearing effort in the waterway following the Yom Kippur War between Egypt and Israel in 1973. The construction of the Panama Canal, connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, was indeed carried out by the US in the early 20th century after an initial French project stalled. The canal was transferred to Panamanian control in 1999 under the Torrijos-Carter Treaties, which stipulated that it would remain neutral and open to all nations. Trump and US officials have argued that China’s economic activities – including infrastructure projects and port operations – may violate the 1977 Panama Canal Neutrality Treaty, which grants the US the right to“defend”the waterway. Panamanian officials have previously rejected Trump’s assertions and threats, while the Panama Canal Authority maintains that the canal is operated solely by Panamanians, with no evidence supporting claims of Chinese control. President Jose Raul Mulino has stated that the canal is part of Panama’s“inalienable patrimony”and stressed that the country maintains full control over its operations. However, after Rubio personally delivered Trump’s ultimatum to Panama in February, Mulino made a concession to Washington by refusing to renew the country’s 2017 agreements with China under Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative. Earlier this month, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced that multiple US Navy vessels, Coast Guard assets, and aircraft have been deployed in and around Panama as part of“bold first steps to revive our defense and security ties between our countries.”",

    "title": "Estonian president reveals what Trump told him about Ukraine",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has promised not to walk away from the Ukraine peace process, stating that an end to the hostilities was“quite close,”Estonian leader Alar Karis has claimed. The Estonian president revealed he had a conversation with Trump at Pope Francis’ funeral on Saturday, where the two were seated together. Ahead of the ceremony, Trump also had a brief meeting with Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky. Karis said he had urged Trump to keep the Ukraine peace process moving and not to“walk away at some point.”The US president allegedly pledged to stay engaged in the negotiations,“saying we are quite close because he had just met Zelensky. I didn’t ask for many details about what that meeting brought,”Karis told Estonian broadcaster ERR. The two leaders also discussed strained transatlantic relations, with Trump insisting he valued them too, according to Karis.“These are important to both of us, not only from a European perspective but also from the American perspective, and President Donald Trump agreed with that. Now we have to see how to make these relations better than they currently are,”the Estonian president said. Shortly after the Zelensky meeting and the Pope’s funeral, Trump accused Russia of“shooting missiles”into Ukraine for“no reason”and threatened the country with new sanctions. Moscow has maintained that it targets only military installations and facilities used by Kiev’s forces, rejecting accusations of deliberately striking civilian sites. Following a brief lull in fighting during the Easter ceasefire announced by President Vladimir Putin last weekend, the Russian military carried out multiple long-range strikes against Ukrainian military and industrial targets over the week. “There was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities, and towns over the last few days. It makes me think that maybe he doesn’t want to stop the war, he’s just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through ‘Banking’ or ‘Secondary Sanctions’?”Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. The warning came just as the Russian president reiterated Moscow’s readiness for unconditional talks with Kiev. The president reaffirmed the commitment during talks with Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff on Friday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said.",

    "title": "Nordic state to invest millions in ‘war railway’ – media",
    "article_text": "Finland has allocated €20 million for the planning of a new railway line connecting the Nordic nation with neighboring Sweden and Norway that would facilitate the movement of NATO military equipment in the event of war, according to the newspaper Iltalehti. Helsinki abandoned its longstanding policy of neutrality and joined the US-led military bloc in April 2023, citing security concerns over the Ukraine conflict. Sweden followed suit in 2024, citing the same reasons. In response, Moscow vowed to beef up its defensive posture in northwestern Russia. In the article on Wednesday, Iltalehti, citing anonymous government sources, claimed that the rail project is getting underway now that the Finnish government has earmarked the funds for its planning. According to the publication, the cost of the entire undertaking will likely run into billions of euros, with actual construction work expected to“take place well into the 2030s.” The article further claimed that the Finnish government is hoping to secure European Union funding for the project. Explaining the need for the railway project in an interview to Iltalehti back in November, Finland’s minister of transport and communications, Lulu Ranne cited a perceived Russian threat. “Tanks and cannons must be able to be moved in any situation,”she emphasized at the time. According to a NATO policy update published last month, the bloc is“continuing to integrate[its]newest members – Finland and Sweden – into plans, forces, and command structures, including by developing a presence in Finland.” Earlier this week, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stated that with NATO military infrastructure having been“gradually appearing on Finnish territory”in recent years, Moscow is taking“measures to improve its security that our military deems necessary.” Speaking to French weekly Le Point, he emphasized that Russia never had“any problems”with Finland or Sweden joining NATO, and has no intention of attacking them. Russian President Vladimir Putin has rejected allegations that Moscow harbors any aggressive intentions toward NATO countries, calling them“nonsense”designed to alarm Western Europeans and legitimize major increases in defense budgets.",

    "article_text": "North Korea has shown a high level of solidarity with Russia by deploying its forces to help Moscow repel the Ukrainian incursion into Russia’s Kursk Region, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has said. The long-rumored presence of North Korean forces in the area was officially confirmed earlier in the day during a televised meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and the country’s chief of the General Staff, Valery Gerasimov. North Korean forces were deployed into the area under the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership Agreement between Moscow and Pyongyang, which came into force last December. Among other things, the treaty envisions mutual military assistance“by all means available”in the event of an attack, Zakharova noted. “The solidarity shown by our Korean friends is a manifestation of the high, essentially allied level of our relations. We are confident that our ties will continue to strengthen and develop,”Zakharova told the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda. The DPRK troops“demonstrated high professionalism, courage, and heroism in battle,”according to Gerasimov. The Army general hailed the country’s forces for their“resilience”and praised their contribution to the liberation of the area around the town of Sudzha, which was occupied by Ukrainian troops. Kiev and its Western backers had long alleged that North Korean troops were involved in the hostilities in Kursk Region, which was invaded by Ukrainian forces last August. Prior to Saturday, Pyongyang and Moscow neither confirmed nor denied the rumors, while the Russian president had previously said it was up to the two nations to determine how they fulfill their obligations under the partnership pact.",

    "article_text": "At least eight people were killed and more than 700 injured in a massive explosion at the Port of Shahid Rajaee in Bandar Abbas, southern Iran on Saturday, local media reported, citing local officials. The port is located around 23km west of Bandar Abbas and immediately to the north of the Strait of Hormuz, a strategic waterway through which around a fifth of global oil output flows. The facility is Iran’s largest commercial port. Videos circulating online suggest the blast was preceded by a smaller explosion that sparked a fire at the port. They show a large column of smoke and dust towering above the port. The explosion apparently ignited freight containers stored at the port, as another video shows a large wall of thick black smoke above the stockpile. تصاویری از حجم آتش‌سوزی در اسکله شهید رجاییpic.twitter.com/Tfer7zLAvh The blast left the port’s structures badly damaged, with multiple buildings partially collapsed, videos show. Footage captures the aftermath and destruction caused close to the initial explosion site of the Bandar Abbas Blast.Follow Press TV on Telegram:https://t.co/0EMmcJs6DLpic.twitter.com/wt5BnUNwiv The cause of the blast was not immediately known, with Iranian media providing conflicting accounts of the incident from local officials. Some reports suggest the initial blast occurred at an administrative building, while others indicate that a gas tanker may have exploded at the port. Some, however, suggest that the epicenter was located at the freight container stockpile.“The source of this incident was the explosion of several containers stored in the Shahid Rajaee Port wharf area.

    "title": "The Cold War never ended — but Washington’s priorities just did",
    "article_text": "Recent statements from senior American officials have raised eyebrows. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Washington is beginning to better understand Russia’s position as Ukraine negotiations proceed. Simultaneously, Defense Secretary Peter Hegseth declared the era of the US serving as Europe’s sole security guarantor is over. Is this a diplomatic victory for Russia? Not yet. There is still a long road ahead. But these signals from Washington should not be dismissed as mere tactical maneuvers. Rather, they suggest the growing possibility of a strategic compromise – the very goal Russia sought with its European security initiatives in December 2021. Tragically, many lives have been lost to bring the international system to this point, a grim reminder that significant change in global affairs rarely comes peacefully. For 80 years, the European security order has been biased against Russia. Even when the USSR or Russia formally participated, it was merely a mechanism for limiting Russian influence. The entire postwar ‘legitimacy’ of the international order, as the late Henry Kissinger observed, rested on containing Russia. After 1945, Western countries prioritized Russia’s containment above even their own autonomy. To abandon this principle would acknowledge the collapse of the old order and the necessity of constructing a new one. Today’s political upheavals in the US make this shift conceivable, although certainty remains distant. Washington’s erratic policy toward Ukraine is merely a symptom of deeper changes in Europe’s political architecture. It would be naive to believe that earlier American hostility toward Russian interests stemmed from ignorance. Americans have often been stereotyped as crude ‘nouveaux riches’, but the truth is that states act based on calculations of power and interest, not emotions or misunderstandings. For all its peculiarities, America remains a sovereign power. And now, its relative decline forces a reassessment of priorities. Washington no longer has the luxury of fulfilling endless foreign obligations. Its voters – who ultimately foot the bill – demand that their leaders focus on domestic concerns. In such circumstances, the need to freeze the conflict with Russia becomes paramount. Faced with a rising China and diminishing global influence, Washington sees little value in clinging to outdated commitments. Support for European satellites or the Kiev regime has become an unaffordable luxury. In reality, American ‘guarantees’ to Europe were always more myth than substance. Their primary purpose was psychological – to convince Russia that the West is invincible, thereby deterring challenges without having to justify the US military presence in Europe. Even during the Cold War, after the mid-1950s, the USSR had no intention of attacking Western Europe. After 1991, all Russia sought from Europe was commerce and leisure. There was never any real need for an external ‘protector’ on the continent. Moreover, American politicians prioritize their own people. No US government would sacrifice the lives of its citizens to fulfill formal pledges to foreign nations. Even during the past three years, the greatest danger of escalation between the US and Russia stemmed not from a hypothetical defense of Europe, but from direct security risks involving American interests. Western Europeans, of course, have long understood that US security guarantees are a convenient fiction. Even the most Russophobic regimes in the Baltics know this. But for decades, the EU states relied on this myth to justify hostile policies toward Russia while avoiding the burden of real defense expenditures. It became the ideological glue holding the European project together. Without it, they are at a loss: They have no alternative vision for a common order that isn’t based on enmity toward Russia. The likely retreat of American leadership from Europe does not mean Russia should rush forward aggressively. On the contrary, it should proceed with cold-blooded calculation. War has never been the preferred tool of Russian foreign policy. Throughout history, Russia has favored diplomacy, even when progress was slow and interrupted by conflict. Patience has been its great strength. Thus, Russia’s response to American disengagement will be measured and cautious. We are even prepared to assist our American colleagues in ‘explaining’ their evolving position to their allies. After all, a sudden epiphany regarding Russian interests requires careful handling. In the emerging world, change will not be defined by grand declarations, but by the steady reassertion of sovereignty and the quiet death of the illusions that once governed international relations. This article was first published byVzglyadnewspaper and was translated and edited by the RT team.",

    "title": "Zelensky’s backers press for land concessions – WaPo",
    "article_text": "European officials are pressing Ukraine to accept the likelihood that it will be forced to agree to certain territorial concessions to Russia as part of a peace agreement, the Washington Post reported on Friday, citing sources. The issue was reportedly discussed during talks in London involving European and Ukrainian officials, which were, however, downgraded after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced he would not attend. Despite this, one official told the WaPo that the talks“made progress”in terms of convincing Kiev that concessions may be unavoidable. Western negotiators are said to have a sense that Ukraine“may be willing to endure effective Russian control of Crimea,”provided Kiev is not required to legally recognize this reality. The peninsula overwhelmingly voted to join Russia in 2014 following a Western-backed coup in Kiev. Many Ukrainians, however, are reluctant to renounce future claims to Crimea, viewing any territorial compromise as setting a“dangerous precedent”for potential formal recognition of Moscow's control over four other former Ukrainian regions that voted to join Russia in 2022. This comes as the US has clashed with European nations and Kiev over their vision for a Ukraine peace arrangement, with the sides presenting different proposals on the terms for ending the conflict, according to a Reuters report, which was confirmed by the WaPo. In particular, US envoy Steve Witkoff reportedly proposed that Washington recognize Crimea as Russian and accept Moscow’s de facto control over large parts of the other four regions. Meanwhile, Ukraine and its European supporters, however, reportedly continue to resist any mention of territorial recognition in the proposed agreements. Their version of a peace framework postpones territorial issues until after a ceasefire and emphasizes the necessity of strong security guarantees for Kiev. For Europe and Ukraine,“it is not only reasonable but necessary to push back on some elements of the US proposal, as it gives Ukraine practically very, very little. And Russia a lot,”a Western official told the WaPo. The report also noted that Europe is trying to“edge Washington toward a more reasonable agreement,”including the recognition that a ceasefire must be an essential first step. The WaPo report comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin held lengthy talks on Friday with Witkoff at the Kremlin on Friday. Presidential adviser Yury Ushakov described the meeting as“constructive and very useful”in nature,” adding that the talks included the idea of possibly resuming direct negotiations between Moscow and Kiev. Trump, commenting on the state of the negotiations, said Ukraine and Russia“should now meet, at very high levels, to ‘finish it off.’ Most of the major points are agreed to.”",

    "title": "Trump demands Kiev sign minerals deal ‘immediately’",
    "article_text": "Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky is“three weeks late”in signing a minerals deal with the US, President Donald Trump has said. In a post on Truth Social on Friday, he demanded the agreement be signed“immediately.” Washington and Kiev have been negotiating a deal for weeks that would grant the US access to Ukraine’s natural resources, including rare-earth minerals that are vital for high-tech industries. Ukraine hopes the deal will secure the US as a lasting security partner, a commitment that the Trump administration has so far declined to make. Washington insists the deal should compensate America for past aid in the conflict with Russia. Kiev, however, claims the assistance was provided unconditionally. A preliminary Memorandum of Intent was signed last week, according to Ukraine’s first deputy prime minister, Yulia Sviridenko. Trump, however, has complained that the process is dragging on too long. “Ukraine, headed by Vladimir Zelensky, has not signed the final papers on the very important Rare Earths Deal with the United States. It is at least three weeks late. Hopefully, it will be signed IMMEDIATELY,”he wrote. The deal was expected to be signed in February during a visit by Zelensky visit to the White House. The event, however, devolved into a heated spat between the leaders, with Trump accusing Zelensky of disrespecting America and showing ingratitude for US aid, while being reluctant to seek peace with Russia and“gambling with World War III.”Trump later said Zelensky was“trying to back out”of the deal, warning that he faces“big, big problems”if he does. Last week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said White House officials were“still working on the details”of when and where the signing would take place, but expected that negotiations would be completed by April 26. The Memorandum of Intent also outlines this timeline. In his post on Friday, Trump also commented on Ukraine peace efforts, saying“work on the overall Peace Deal between Russia and Ukraine is going smoothly”and that“success seems to be in the future.”In another post, he indicated plans to meet with Russian and Ukrainian representatives on Saturday in Rome, where he is attending Pope Francis’ funeral, which Zelensky also plans to attend. “They are very close to a deal, and the two sides should now meet, at very high levels, to finish it off. Most of the major points are agreed to,”Trump wrote. While the details have not been officially disclosed, the agreement proposed by Washington reportedly includes US recognition of Russian sovereignty over Crimea, a“freezing”of the conflict along the current front lines, acknowledgment of Moscow’s control over large parts of the four former Ukrainian regions that voted to join Russia, and formal opposition to Ukraine’s NATO bid.",

    "title": "Trump responds to Moscow car bombing that killed Russian general",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has promised to look into the assassination of a senior Russian general outside Moscow on Friday, telling reporters“That’s a big one.”The incident took place as Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, arrived in Moscow for high-level talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Yaroslav Moskalik, the deputy chief of operations of Russia’s General Staff, was killed in a car bomb explosion outside his residence in Balashikha, a suburb east of Moscow. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova suggested there is“reason to believe that Ukrainian intelligence services were involved in the assassination,”noting that Moskalik was involved in talks to resolve the Ukraine crisis before the conflict escalated in 2022. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov also blamed Ukraine, saying:“The Kiev regime once again shows its essence,”while accusing the country of continuing to“engage in terrorist activities”inside Russia. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday, Trump, who apparently had not known about the incident until he was asked, said,“That’s hitting close to home, right? That’s a big one.”He added:“I’ll look at it. If I hear anything, I’ll let you know.” The assassination occurred as Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, arrived in Moscow for high-level talks with Putin. Russian presidential adviser Yury Ushakov described the three-hour meeting as“constructive and very useful in nature”, saying discussions focused on restarting direct negotiations between Moscow and Kiev which have been frozen since the spring of 2022. Commenting on the talks, Trump said Russia and Ukraine“are very close to a deal, and the two sides should now meet, at very high levels, to ‘finish it off.’ Most of the major points are agreed to.” The agreement proposed by Washington reportedly includes US recognition of Russian sovereignty over Crimea, as well as“freezing”the conflict along the current front lines and acknowledging Moscow’s control over large parts of the four former Ukrainian regions which voted to join Russia. The deal would also reportedly prevent Ukraine from joining NATO and initiate a phased removal of the sanctions on Russia. Zelensky, however, has ruled out any territorial concessions to Moscow, stressing that Kiev will not even discuss recognizing Crimea as Russian territory.",

    "title": "Epstein and Prince Andrew accuser dies by suicide – family",
    "article_text": "Virginia Giuffre, a prominent survivor of Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking ring and a leading advocate for victims of sexual abuse, has died by suicide at the age of 41, her family said in a statement to NBC News on Friday. Giuffre passed away at her farm in Neergabby, Western Australia, where she had lived with her husband and three children since 2019.​ “It is with utterly broken hearts that we announce that Virginia passed away last night at her farm in Western Australia. She lost her life to suicide, after being a lifelong victim of sexual abuse and sex trafficking,”her family told NBC News. They described her as“a fierce warrior in the fight against sexual abuse and sex trafficking,”adding that“the toll of abuse is so heavy that it became unbearable for Virginia to handle its weight.” Giuffre was instrumental in bringing global attention to Epstein’s abuse network. She provided crucial information to law enforcement that contributed to the conviction of Epstein’s associate, Ghislaine Maxwell. She also filed a high-profile civil lawsuit against Britain’s Prince Andrew, alleging he sexually abused her when she was 17. The case wassettled out of courtin 2022, with Prince Andrew denying the allegations. Jeffrey Epstein died in a New York jail cell in August 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. His death was officially ruled a suicide, though it has remained the subject of intense public scrutiny and widespread speculation given the high-profile figures linked to his case. Court documents unsealed last year also revealed a possible link between Giuffre and Ruslana Korshunova, a Kazakh-Russian model whojumped to her death from her Manhattan apartmentin 2008. Korshunova had reportedly flown on Epstein’s private jet to his private island, Little St. James, two years before her death. Following Korshunova’s death, Giuffre received an email from her attorney inquiring whether she knew the young model. In March, Giuffre revealed on Instagram that she had been involved in a car accident with a school bus and was suffering from renal failure. She stated that doctors had given her“four days to live”and shared a photo of herself with visible bruises. Her family later clarified that she had been hospitalized and was receiving medical care.​ Her brother, Danny Wilson, told NBC News that she had been in“real physical pain”and“suffered from renal failure,”but that“the mental pain was worse.” Giuffre’s attorney, Sigrid McCawley, described her as“a dear friend and an incredible champion for other victims,”while her representative, Dini von Mueffling, said,“Virginia was one of the most extraordinary human beings I have ever had the honor to know.”",

    "article_text": "Vatican officials urged mourners to refrain from taking photographs with the late Pope Francis as he lay in state at St. Peter’s Basilica, stressing the need for solemnity and respect during the period of mourning. The appeal came after images and videos surfaced online showing visitors posing near the casket. Vatican staff instructed the faithful to refrain from using mobile phones and to maintain an atmosphere of prayer and reflection. “Visitors are invited not to take photos,”a Vatican spokesperson told The Times, underscoring the importance of preserving the dignity of the occasion. Since the public viewing began on Wednesday, around 250,000 mourners filed past the late pope’s casket, according to Vatican News. To accommodate the vast crowds, St. Peter’s Basilica remained open overnight. On Friday evening, the Pope’s coffin was sealed during a private ceremony led by Cardinal-Camerlengo Kevin Farrell. Following a centuries-old tradition, a white silk cloth was placed over Pope Francis’ face, and a bag containing coins and medals minted during his pontificate was placed inside the coffin. His casket was sealed, bearing a cross, his coat of arms, and official Vatican seals, in preparation for the funeral scheduled for Saturday morning. The funeral will be attended by thousands of people, including world leaders and dignitaries, paying tribute to the 266th Pope, whose memory, the Vatican said,“remains in the heart of the Church and of all humanity.”",

    "title": "Zelensky demands ‘at least’ Israel-style support from US",
    "article_text": "Kiev expects Washington to provide long-term security assistance modeled on the US relationship with Israel, Vladimir Zelensky has said, after Ukraine’s European backers reportedly rejected several points of US President Donald Trump’s proposed peace plan. Washington presented its draft deal to end the hostilities between Kiev and Moscow during talks in Paris last week. At a follow-up meeting in London on Wednesday – which wasdowngradedat the last minute after Zelenskypublicly rejectedkey US suggestions – Ukrainian officials and their NATO European counterparts reportedly put forward acounterproposal. Speaking to journalists on Friday, Zelensky insisted that any future peace deal with Moscow must be backed by sustained US military, financial, and political support. “Discussions in London have focused on security guarantees from the United States. We hope them to be at least as robust as those provided to Israel. Additionally, we anticipate support from our European partners and are actively developing the infrastructure necessary for these guarantees,”Zelensky said. Deliberations about anIsraeli modelof support for Ukraine first emerged during the presidency of Joe Biden, when Western officials began to acknowledge that Kiev was unlikely to be granted NATO membership. In lieu of collective security guarantees, they sought ways to at least ensure a long-term,uninterrupted flowof Western arms. Zelensky’s comments come amid increasing friction with Washington, as Trump pushes Kiev to accept what media outlets have described as his“final offer”to end the conflict. Reports indicate that Washington’s framework includes freezing the conflict along the current front lines and recognizing Crimea as Russian territory – a condition Zelensky has firmly rejected. Trump stated that“Crimea will stay with Russia”in an interview with Time Magazine on Friday. He argued that Kiev would never have enough weapons or manpower to retake the peninsula, which“was handed over to Russia without a shot being fired.”Crimea officially joined Russia in 2014 after a referendum held following a Western-backed coup in Kiev. “Our position is unchanged,”Zelensky reiterated on Friday, despite acknowledging Kiev’s dependence on continued American support. Trump and other senior US officials have warned that if progress is not made soon, Washington may reconsider its role as mediator and shift its focus to other global priorities. According to reports, Ukrainian officials are already bracing for the possibility of reduced American support should negotiations collapse. Moscow has stated that it is open to negotiations and is grateful for Trump’s peace initiatives. However, the Russian leadership has stressed that it seeks a lasting solution to the conflict, saying a temporary halt in the hostilities would simply allow Ukraine’s Western backers to rearm its military. Any peace deal must acknowledge the territorial reality and address the root causes of the conflict, including Ukraine’s NATO aspirations, Russia has insisted.",

    "article_text": "Experiences Experiences Experiences Experiences Obsessions Obsessions Obsessions Obsessions People People People People Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Experiences Experiences A secret no more. Tucked between lush hills and a serene bay, Seven Secrets by Hanging Gardens in Lombok features eccentric design with sexy beach club ambience. Seven Secrets boasts lush hills as its backdrop with a serene beach on its front yard. (Photo: Seven Secrets by Hanging Gardens) This audio is generated by an AI tool. Bali, as the old saying goes, is the main tourist destination of Indonesia, while its neighbouring island Lombok is the getaway spotfor Balivisitors. However, if youlookcloser, the onsite reality showsa slightly different picture. Lombok, at least during my time as an Indonesia-based travel journalist for over 16 years, has been graduallyelevatingitself to become aworthy toppick for travellers. Since 2011, the islandhas had itsown international airport, with direct flights from Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. A few years back, it officially opened a MotoGP circuit, and not long after more and more new hotels with an independent mindset opened on the island, withthe ambitiontotargetglobalguests, not just those escaping from Bali. Lombok, well-known for its pearls, with Indonesia’s second tallest volcano towering in its centre and gorgeous beaches framingits coastline, isarguably one of the most exciting travel destinations to watch in Indonesia. Today, finding a new hotel in a newly discovered location has become an attraction in itself on the island. In the south, you can findSomewhere Lombokand Indonesia’s latest Pullman outpost. Go tothe southeast cornerand youwill findthe secluded Innit,a fresh addition to Lombok’s hotel design scene. Meanwhile in the northwest, at least three properties have justbegunaccepting bookings in the last few years–Kayana, Sira (part of Marriott’s Luxury Collection), andSeven Secrets by Hanging Gardens, which I visited in early February. Part of the new wave of luxury properties in Lombok, Seven Secrets was initially a member of Small Luxury Hotels of the World. It was ready to welcome guests in 2018, but then an earthquake hit the island, followed by the COVID-19 pandemic, forcing it to go into hiatus. It reopened in the end of 2023, under new management Hanging Gardens, which established its name with a hotel in the north of Ubud in Bali, famous for its outstanding design and services, and of course its iconic pool. Seven Secrets is nestledwithinNipahBay, facing a strait which separates Lombok from Bali. Nicely hidden 250 m away from the main street, a distance away from the main tourist circuit of Senggigi and party island Gili Trawangan, the area isvery quiet. It’s a typically remote resort situated on an off-track corner that makes you too lazy to go anywhere else. Indeed, one of the secrets embodied in the “Seven Secrets” name is its location. I’d be lying if I said Nipah Bay is a complete secret–there are already traditional seafood stalls and a fishing village here. But at least for now, there are no other properties nearby. There was, however, a plan to build a massive 80-room Banyan Tree resort next door, though the project appears to have been either cancelled or postponed. With lush hills as its backdrop and a serene beachon itsfront yard, Seven Secrets meets the basicchecklistof a resort that tourists are craving for in Lombok. Strolling thearea onemorning, I met only a few fishermen relaxing by the sea. Dozens ofjukungoutrigger boats were parked in between coconut trees, along the crescentshapedbeach flanked by handsome rocky shores. During its finest months, especially in mid-year, the majestic figure of Mount Agung in Bali can be seen from the beachfront resort. Unfortunately, I came not long after Chinese New Year, when the strongwaveshit the shore tirelesslyand the cloudyskyturnedtheturquoise sea grey. Mount Agungwasnot visible during my three days here. But not allwasbad. With only afew roomsoccupied and the brown sandy beach largely free of holidaymakers, I couldabsorb the serenity of the place intimately. However, serenity mightnot be theonly thing that this boutique property aims to offer. Entering the resort’s location through the narrow macadam road, where cows were grazing on both sides, I was surprised to be greeted by a strikingly bright complex whichremindedme of sexy party spots in Ibiza or Miami. The beach islinedwith white sun loungers shaded by white Umbrosa parasols. Behind them sits a white wooden deck and an infinity pool,with a swim-upbar and DJ booth on its roof. Upon entering the lobby, I was seatedona Baroque-style high-back velvet chair, and given a welcome drink menu featuring, among other options, the resort’s signature cocktail and sparkling wine. Seven Secrets boasts 24 suites divided into three categories based on the view. The Garden View Suites sit on the lower tier of the resort, although they have the most spacious interiors. The MountainView Suites are abovethe Garden View Suites, while the most expensive category, the12-unit OceanView Suites, are spread into six adjacent two-story white mansions, perched only a few steps away from the pool and main restaurant. I stayed at the Ocean View Suite. It has floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors which open up to a spacious deck with a jacuzzi and day bed. During the night, the deck is illuminated by purple ambience light from the ceiling. Combine all this with music playing from the Marshall Bluetooth portable speaker and Plaga wine from the minibar, this suite has its own allure for a celebratory occasion. Categories aside, all suites share a similar,glamorousdesign. Personally designed by the owner, a Hungarian businessman who fell in love with Lombok, each suite was born from a bold experiment ofcombining Asianelements with European luxury features, and an eccentric tasteindecoration. In between the parquet floors and thatched roof,the rooms are adorned withSwarovski crystal desk lamps, traditionalLoro BlonyoJavanese matrimonial figures, and Roberto Cavalli leopard print wallpaper. The toilet wall is decorated by a huge art print of a womanwearing acolombinamask, while the open-air showerfeaturesa gigantic Buddhist sculpture. At the minibar, directly above the Acala coffee machine, there is a metal wall decoration which looks like it was taken from a sequin disco dress. You can sense how the owner took his time in making sure his property has a distinctive aesthetic character, at least not something you’ve seen before. The resort also has a fitness centre with Technogym gears and a spa with four treatment rooms. There’s no kids club, but a babysitting service is on offer, and the crew is well-trained to be attentive towards young guests. I came with my almosttwo-year-oldson, and he had a great timeafter being handeda box full of toys on the beach. And I felt more comfortable letting himplayas the beach is always clean. Later on, I discovered that this 24-suite resort employs 80staff, a good ratio to maintain the level of service, as well as to keep the beach clean. It's not a dirty little secret: During a strong wave season, lots of beachessuffer fromthe influx of garbage. But this secret location, so it seems, is in good hands. There are two restaurants at Seven Secrets, both helmed by executive chef Fajar Rachmansyah, an alumnus of Anantara Maldives and Keraton at The Plaza Jakarta. The Majesty, a new addition to the island’s fine dining scene, is filled with Baroque-style chairs, illuminated by one of the biggest Swarovski chandeliers I’ve ever seen. It’s currently open during high season or for private bookings only. The second establishment, L’Angelo Bianco, is an all-day dining beachfront restaurant which offers international fares with thoughtful presentation. Fresh seafood, acommon findin Lombok,isthehighlighthere, while a modern twist on local dishes–Laksa Bogor, Octopus Taliwang and Sate Rembiga–promise a unique culinary experience. It also has a good selection of over 30 wine labels, from Australia to Argentina, including local corks from Bali. Breakfast is another highlight. The menu, presentedin an embossedsnake print folder,features an extensivecollection of dishes, including vegan and vegetarian options. Each guest can order two a la carte dishes, a rare and generous offering for a hotel. My favourite morning spot at L’Angelo Bianco is the wooden table by the beach, where I can enjoy the vista while hoping to get a glimpse of Mount Agungon thehorizon. I came in the wrong season, but the lovely food and beach were enough to keep mein myseat. Subscribe to CNA's Recommended Read A single handpicked story that we think you shouldn't miss.

    "article_text": "Sport Sport LONDON :Chris Eubank Jr was taken to hospital for precautionary checks after beating fellow Briton Conor Benn on a unanimous points decision in their thrilling middleweight grudge match on Saturday. All three judges scored the non-title fight 116-112 after a pulsating 12-round slugfest with both fighters setting a ferocious pace and going toe-to-toe in front of 65,000 at London's Tottenham Hotspur stadium. Eubank's promoters, Boxxer, said just before midnight that the winner had been taken to hospital by ambulance \"on recommendation of the onsite doctor.\" There was no love lost in the pre-fight hype to a clash between the sons of 1990s archrivals Chris Eubank Sr and Nigel Benn but the night lived up to expectations and brought fresh respect and embraces on both sides.

    "title": "GE2025: At 17, he was told by SDP chief Chee Soon Juan to look beyond politics. A decade later he's back as a party candidate",
    "article_text": "Up Close Up Close As founder of media outlet Wake Up Singapore, Mr Ariffin Sha has made his fair share of mistakes. But hiding away from them would be the easy thing to do, he says. Singapore Democratic Party’s Ariffin Sha on Apr 22, 2025. (Photo: CNA/Lim Li Ting) This audio is generated by an AI tool. Mr Ariffin Sha was only 17 years old when he first met Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) chief Chee Soon Juan in 2014. He was not yet of age to vote nor stand for the 2015 General Election, but he wanted to be involved – badly. Youths in Singapore wanted their voices to be heard and he saw himself as an amplifier of those voices, he told CNA TODAY. At the party’s old office in Jalan Gelenggang, Dr Chee had put an avuncular arm around the teenager and offered some words of advice. “Take it easy. Go and volunteer. Politics is not the only way to make a difference.” The year is now 2025, and I am face-to-face with the 28-year-old legal executive who is about to take part in his maiden election against a team comprising the most formidable of political opponents – the Prime Minister of Singapore, Lawrence Wong. The battleground is Marsiling-Yew Tee Group Representation Constituency (GRC), where Mr Wong of the People’s Action Party (PAP) has been an MP since 2015. And there are no points for guessing which opposition party Mr Ariffin is representing. Over a decade has passed but Mr Ariffin’s eagerness to speak up for Singaporeans has not wavered in the slightest. We spoke for over an hour at the SDP’s new two-storey office in Bukit Batok while he recounted the series of events that led him here today. He recalled: “Back then, Dr Chee told me to go out there and just serve the community. He said I would still be very young in 10 years' time, and if I still wanted to consider joining politics, I can.” “And here you are,” I said. He chuckled: “Yeah.” Even before he met Dr Chee in 2014, Mr Ariffin, at 16 years of age, had already founded news outlet Wake Up Singapore, which over the years has been known for its unabashed commentary and criticism of government policies. He should have been studying for his ‘O’ Level examinations, he admitted, but this was something he felt he needed to do. “Wake Up Singapore started because of my discomfort with the whole idea of streaming in schools. I remember my teachers saying things like: ‘If you don’t study hard, do you want to end up at ITE (Institute of Technical Education)?’” It was not just the sting of the comment that struck him, but the underlying message that certain paths were inherently inferior. That moment sparked a broader interrogation of societal norms, which would later continue during his time as a law undergraduate in New Zealand. There, he saw plumbers, electricians and other blue-collar workers treated with the same dignity as lawyers and bankers. It was a stark contrast to the social hierarchy he had observed growing up. “It was these things that made me realise that maybe we do need more alternative perspectives,” he said. The nation’s treatment of its migrant workers, and specifically the transportation of these workers to and from work sites in the back of lorries, is another issue that matters deeply to Mr Ariffin. It is aperennial problemthat has been raised in parliament since at least 2006. Wake Up Singapore listed abolishing the practice as one of its “13 things we will advocate for” on its Instagram page in 2023. A news site openly performing advocacy? I asked. “The unique thing about Wake Up Singapore is that we have never really pretended to be objective,” he said. “From day one, we’ve already said that the media playing field is not balanced. But in a sense, our presence provides the balance, right? It's not so much a question of whether we agree or disagree. In fact, if all of us come to an informed opinion at the end of the day, I think that's good. “If tomorrow the PAP makes good moves … Wake Up Singapore would be the first to applaud that.” If you had expected Mr Ariffin to be a microcosm of his publication – sharp, bold, unapologetically loud – his public debut as an SDP candidate would have proven you right. When Dr Cheeunveiled himto reporters last month, the young man was brimming with conviction as he spoke. He possessed an obvious charisma at theSDP rally in Choa Chu Kang stadiumon Thursday night too, flaunting a competent display of diction, inflection and cadence in his speech that has been praised by netizens. You could even argue that SDP’s original founder, opposition legend Chiam See Tong, would have been proud. Interestingly, Mr Chiam has given Mr Ariffin his stamp of approval before, having written a letter of recommendation for a scholarship at his alma mater – the Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand. Before that, Mr Ariffin had helped his wife, Mrs Lina Chiam, write speeches while she was a Non-Constituency MP in 2015. Asked to share more about himself, he tells me he is a fan of the football club Manchester United. Classic rock bands like Pink Floyd fill his playlists, but he is also a massive fan of Eminem. He is someone who often has friends two to three times his age because of the sheer scope of conversations they are able to have. Everything about him screams self-confident, self-assured and socially adept. But as I found out in quieter moments, offstage and away from the public eye, Mr Ariffin is soft and introspective. He pauses frequently between answering my many questions, whether it be about his personal interests or political goals, preferring to think his answers through rather than let out some unfiltered verbiage. “Honestly, I’m actually quite socially awkward,” he said at one point with a snicker. I brought up his speeches and told him that that was genuinely hard to believe. He offered a conjecture: “I think if you really believe in what you say, the confidence will come naturally. What I say doesn’t come from an academic place – it comes from lived realities, experiences that even I go through. “Singaporeans are very discerning,” he added. “It’s not about whether you come from a so-called humble background or the party tricks you can pull out. “Do people sense a genuine desire to serve, and the capability to speak up for them? If they have those two, everything else is a bonus.” For all his political ideals, Mr Ariffin is no stranger to controversy. In 2022, Wake Up Singapore published an article that turned out to be based on false claims about a patient’s experience at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH). The post went viral – and so did the fallout. Mr Ariffin was charged with defamation and hepleaded guilty. He paid the fine and issued a public apology. The woman who fabricated the story was also charged. Reflecting on the incident, he admitted to being “a bit naive”. “I could have done better, 100 per cent. “I naively believed that someone who was actually pregnant wouldn't lie about the death of the child that was still, you know, alive and kicking … but that said, there were things that I could have done as a publication to ensure it didn’t happen. “These things were not done, and I took full responsibility for it.” There was a temptation at the time to “just shut everything down”, Mr Ariffin told me, to do whatever he could to forget about it. “But I think the more difficult thing to do would be to continue our work, but in a more responsible way – with more stringent protocols in place.” That was what Mr Ariffin chose to do, and that resulted in what he felt was a silver lining amidst the dark clouds. Lessons learnt from the KKH saga gave him the conviction in 2023 to break the story about Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) Media inflating its circulation numbers. Just a day after the story went live, national broadsheet The Straits Times, a publication under SPH Media, confirmed the news. It felt like vindication. Nonetheless, the fact is that the young man has a taint on his record and reputation in the form of a conviction. Does he think this will affect his chances as a candidate? “I'm sure it may affect the perceptions of some voters, but I hope they are able to see that not everything is one-dimensional – that there are many layers of grey between the black and the white. “I hope they can see beyond that and give me a chance.” Mr Ariffin is fully aware of the uphill battle his team faces running against a PAP slate comprising the Prime Minister. He had previously told reporters that aside from an out-and-out triumph over the ruling party, making inroads to cut away at the incumbent’s margin of victory is crucial as well. I asked if that meant he was already conceding defeat. Not at all, he said: “My point is that even as Prime Minister, your mandate must be earned.” Mr Ariffin aims to put forward a platform consistent with the party’s slogan for the General Election – focused on helping people thrive, not just survive. It’s not just about finances but also the stresses of life, he said. The pressures people face in the workplace, the funds and mental capacity one needs to raise a family and the stresses young people face in the education system, for instance. “These are issues I hope to speak about more. Our goal is to run a clean campaign and focus on policies. We will fight the good fight and walk out with our heads held high.” But whether or not Mr Ariffin and team wins is almost besides the point. For him, politics is not a five-yearly exercise but a continuous process. The late night door-to-door visits, the policy papers, the manifestos – that’s the real work. The rallies and walkabouts done during the hustings are just the “front of the show”. He reiterates that he does not have any desire to be in the spotlight as a candidate. The only reason he has stepped forward, he said, is because he was summoned to. He said: “I think if the party calls on you, then you have to step forward.” No one expects his SDP team to beat the Prime Minister. Not even him. But if anything is clear from Mr Ariffin’s life thus far, it is that he likes to play the long game. He said: “After all, if you fall down seven times, you get up eight.” Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

    "title": "Commentary: Why film adaptations of popular video games often fall flat",
    "article_text": "Commentary Commentary Screen adaptations such as A Minecraft Movie and The Super Mario Bros Movie often find favour at the box office but much less so with critics, says a game studies expert. ONTARIO: Video game adaptations are having a moment. On television, shows like HBO’sThe Last of Usand Amazon Prime’sFallout– each based on popular game franchises – have been gigantic hits. On the big screen, 2023’s The Super Mario Bros Moviebroke box office records, and at the time of writing, A Minecraft Movie looks to bewell on its wayto generating US$1 billion in ticket sales. With these recent successes, it can be hard to remember that movie adaptations of video games have historically been notoriously bad, typically failing to win over audiences and critics alike. My first experience with adaptation disappointment came from the 1993 adaptation of Nintendo’s Super Mario Bros, starring Hollywood legend Bob Hoskins as Mario and John Leguizamo as his brother, Luigi. The film was a flop, garnering a 35 on aggregate site Metacritic and failing to break even at the box office. Curiously, the film looked nothing like the games, opting for a gritty, noir aesthetic and swapping out the cutesy enemies with horrifying monsters. Movie studio executives can perhaps be forgiven for trying to capitalise on the popularity of video games. With billions of players worldwide and a market valuation surpassing Hollywood and the music industry combined, video games are seemingly low-hanging fruit for commercial success. So why, with a few notable exceptions notwithstanding, are video game adaptations so difficult to pull off? One key issue is that video games and movies are two very different media with different functions and different representational strengths and weaknesses. At their most basic, video games are meant to be interactive. They provide players with goals to achieve and challenges to overcome through some combination of strategy, skill and luck. Sometimes, these goals and challenges are clear and direct. When a player sees a Goomba approach in Super Mario Bros, for example, they must press a button to jump on its head and defeat it; otherwise, the player takes damage and may have to start the level again. Other times, the goals and challenges are less direct. In open-world or “sandbox” games like Minecraft, players are given a high degree of freedom in how they interact with the game world. There are ways to “win” in Minecraft, but the true pleasure of the game lies in giving players freedom to explore a vast world and create unique structures, villages, or even functional computers. Interacting with a game world – its goals, rules and aesthetics – is a fundamentally distinct process from watching a film or reading a novel. Minecraft’s motto of “Create. Explore. Survive” is not readily applicable in media like film and books, though these media have experimented with interactivity too. So why have adaptations like The Super Mario Bros Movie and A Minecraft Movie been successful, at least commercially? Part of the reason is that these are massive franchises with instant brand recognition. Even people who do not play video games know who Mario is, and Minecraft is among the most popular games of all time. However, as we have seen with recent unsuccessful adaptations like Warcraft and Borderlands, brand recognition alone is not sufficient. One reason why The Super Mario Bros Movie and A Minecraft Movie have done well is that they get the “feel” of their respective worlds right. When Mario transports into the Mushroom Kingdom in the 2023 film, it looks and sounds like the Mushroom Kingdom players encounter in the games. The colours, shapes and sounds in the film closely match the colours, shapes, and sounds in the games. The Goombas look like Goombas, the power-ups look like power-ups and the film retains the whimsical nature of the games. Although the radical freedom afforded to players of Minecraft is difficult to replicate in a film, A Minecraft Movie nevertheless retains the look, sound and feel of the game. The Creepers look and behave like Creepers and the Piglins look and behave like Piglins. When Steve (played by Jack Black) first learns to build his first structures, the audience watches as he joyfully creates whatever he can imagine, gradually learning to build larger and more complex structures, just as players do in the game. Finally, it should be noted that while these films were commercial successes, they have failed to win over critics. On Metacritic, The Super Mario Bros Movie sits at 46 (though the user score is a healthy 8.2) while A Minecraft Movie has a similarly paltry 45. As the Los Angeles Times puts it in their review, “A Minecraft Movie is a block of big dumb fun”. So no, it is unlikely the film will win an Oscar for best picture. But its ability to capture the essence of Minecraft is clearly enough for audiences, many of whom have spent countless hours exploring virtual mines, fending off zombies and creating their own fantastical worlds.

    "title": "Hamas says open to 5-year Gaza truce, one-time hostages release",
    "article_text": "World World A Palestinian man inspects the site of an Israeli strike on a house, in Gaza City, Apr 24, 2025. (Photo: REUTERS/Mahmoud Issa) CAIRO: Hamas is open to an agreement to endthe war in Gazathat would see all hostages released and secure a five-year truce, an official said Saturday (Apr 26) as the group's negotiators held talks with mediators. A Hamas delegation was in Cairo discussing with Egyptian mediators ways out of the 18-month war, while, on the ground, rescuers said Israeli strikes killed at least 35 people. Nearly eight weeks into an Israeli aid blockade, the United Nations says food and medical supplies are running out. The Hamas official, speaking to AFP on condition of anonymity, said the Palestinian militant group \"is ready for an exchange of prisoners in a single batch and a truce for five years\". The latest bid to seal a ceasefire follows an Israeli proposal which Hamas had rejected earlier this month as \"partial\", calling instead for a \"comprehensive\" agreement to halt the war ignited by the group's Oct 7, 2023, attack on Israel. The rejected Israeli offer, according to a senior Hamas official, included a 45-day ceasefire in exchange for the return of 10 living hostages. Hamas has consistently demanded that a truce deal must lead to the war's end, a full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and a surge in humanitarian aid. An Israeli pullout and a \"permanent end to the war\" would also have occurred, as outlined by then-US president Joe Biden, under a second phase of a ceasefire that had begun on Jan 19 but collapsed two months later. Hamas had sought talks on the second phase but Israel wanted the first phase extended. Israel demands the return of all hostages seized in the 2023 attack, and Hamas's disarmament, which the group has rejected as a \"red line\". \"This time we will insist on guarantees regarding the end of the war,\" Mahmud Mardawi, a senior Hamas official, said in a statement. \"The occupation can return to war after any partial deal, but it cannot do so with a comprehensive deal and international guarantees.\" Later on Saturday, senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan reiterated that \"any proposal that does not include a comprehensive and permanent cessation of the war will not be considered.\" \"We will not abandon the resistance's weapons as long as the occupation persists\", he said in a statement. Israel pounded Gaza again on Saturday. Mohammed al-Mughayyir, an official with the territory's civil defence rescue agency, told AFP that the death toll had risen to at least 35. In Gaza City, in the territory's north, civil defence said a strike on the Khour family home killed 10 people and left an estimated 20 more trapped in the debris. Umm Walid al-Khour, who survived the attack, said \"everyone was sleeping with their children\" when the strike hit and \"the house collapsed on top of us.\" Elsewhere across Gaza, 25 more people were killed, rescuers said. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the latest strikes but it said that \"1,800 terror targets\" had been hit across Gaza since the military campaign resumed on March 18. The military added that \"hundreds of terrorists\" were also killed. Qatar, the United States and Egypt brokered the truce which began on Jan 19 and enabled a surge in aid, alongside exchanges of hostages and Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. With Israel and Hamas disagreeing over the ceasefire's next phase, Israel cut all aid to Gaza before resuming bombardment, followed by a ground offensive. Since then, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory, at least 2,111 Palestinians have been killed, taking the overall war death toll in Gaza to 51,495 people, mostly civilians. The Hamas attack that triggered the war resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people on the Israeli side, also mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures. Militants also abducted 251 people, 58 of whom are still held in Gaza, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead. Israel says the military campaign aims to force Hamas to free the remaining captives. On Friday, the UN's World Food Programme (WFP) said the hot meal kitchens it was supplying with food in Gaza \"are expected to fully run out of food in the coming days\". On Saturday, AFP footage showed queues of people waiting for food in front of a community kitchen. \"There is no food in the free kitchen, there is no food in the markets... There is no flour or bread,\" said north Gaza resident Wael Odeh. A senior UN official, Jonathan Whittall, said Gazans were \"slowly dying\". \"This is not only about humanitarian needs but also about dignity,\" Whittall, head of the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian affairs in the Palestinian territories, told journalists.

    "title": "Francis laid to rest as 400,000 mourn pope 'with open heart'",
    "article_text": "World World The coffin containing the body of late Pope Francis is carried inside St. Mary Major Basilica in Rome for his burial ceremony, Apr 26, 2025. (Photo: Vatican Media via AP) ROME: Hundreds of thousands of mourners joined world leaders, including US President Donald Trump, tobid farewell Saturday (Apr 26) to Pope Francis, a champion of the poor who strived to forge a more compassionate Catholic church. The Vatican said 400,000 people packed St Peter's Square and lined the streets of Rome for the funeral of the first Latin American leader of the world's 1.4 billion Catholics. After a solemn funeral, the Argentine pontiff's plain wooden coffin, a testament to a life of humility, was driven slowly to Rome's Santa Maria Maggiore church, where he was interred in a private ceremony. Cardinals marked his coffin with red wax seals before it was lowered into a tomb set inside an alcove, according to images released by the Vatican. Guatemalan Maria Vicente, 52, holding a rosary, cried as she watched the coffin being carried into Santa Maria Maggiore, the pope's favourite Roman church. \"It made me very sad. It's touching that he left us like that,\" she said. The marble tomb is inscribed with just one word: \"Franciscus\", his papal name in Latin. Trump was among more than 50 heads of state paying tribute to Francis, who died on Monday aged 88 after suffering a stroke. The president met several world leaders in a corner of St Peter's Basilica before the mass, notably Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in their first face-to-face meeting since their Oval Office clash in February. Francis was \"a pope among the people, with an open heart\", who strove for a more compassionate, open-minded Catholic Church, said Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, who led the service. There was applause from the masses gathered under bright blue skies as he hailed the pope's \"conviction that the Church is a home for all, a home with its doors always open\". Among the mourners were many tourists enjoying Rome in the spring, and thousands of pilgrims who had planned to attend the Sunday canonisation of Carlo Acutis, which was postponed after Francis died. But there has been a genuine outpouring of emotion following the death of a pope who sought to steer the Church towards a more inclusive direction during his 12-year-long papacy. Maria Mrula, 28, a student from Germany, said she drove 16 hours to be at the funeral. By \"giving to the poor and being with the poor\", Francis had inspired many, she said. \"The Church is alive,\" she said. \"It was great being here.\" Italian and Vatican authorities mounted a major security operation for the ceremony, with fighter jets on standby and snipers positioned on roofs surrounding the tiny city state. Red-robed cardinals and purple-hatted bishops sat on one side of the altar in St Peter's Square during the funeral, with world dignitaries sitting opposite. In front of the altar lay the pope's simple cypress coffin, inlaid with a pale cross. The funeral set off nine days of official Vatican mourning for Francis, who took over following the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI in 2013. After the mourning, cardinals aged under 80 will elect a new pope from among their number. Many of Francis's reforms angered traditionalists, while his criticism of injustices, from the treatment of migrants to the damage wrought by global warming, riled many world leaders. Yet the former archbishop of Buenos Aires's compassion and charisma earned him global affection and respect. \"His gestures and exhortations in favour of refugees and displaced persons are countless,\" Battista Re said. He recalled the first trip of Francis's papacy to Lampedusa, an Italian island that has become the initial port of call for many migrants crossing the Mediterranean, as well as when the Argentine celebrated mass on the border between Mexico and the United States. Trump's administration drew the pontiff's ire for its mass deportation of migrants, but the president has paid tribute to \"a good man\" who \"loved the world\". Making the first foreign trip of his second term, Trump had what the White House called a \"very productive\" meeting with Zelenskyy before the funeral, before flying out shortly after. Kyiv published a photo of the encounter, the two men sitting face to face in red and gold chairs in the basilica as the pope's coffin lay nearby, out of shot. In the homily, Battista Re highlighted Francis's incessant calls for peace, and said he had urged \"reason and honest negotiation\" in efforts to end conflicts raging around the world. \"'Build bridges, not walls' was an exhortation he repeated many times,\" the cardinal said. Trump's predecessor Joe Biden also attended the funeral, alongside UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Germany's Olaf Scholz, Italy's Giorgia Meloni and Lebanon's Joseph Aoun. Israel, angered by Francis's criticism of the war in Gaza, sent only its Holy See ambassador. China, which does not have formal relations with the Vatican, did not send any representatives. Italian mourner Francesco Morello, 58, said the homily about peace was a \"fitting, strong and beautiful message\". Of the world leaders gathered, Morello noted: \"He could not bring them together in life but he managed it in death.\" Francis died of a stroke and heart failure less than a month after he left the hospital where he had battled pneumonia for five weeks. The Church's 266th pope loved nothing more than being among his flock. His last public act, the day before his death, was an Easter Sunday blessing to the world, ending his papacy as he had begun it, with an appeal to protect the \"vulnerable, the marginalised and migrants\". The Jesuit chose to be named after Saint Francis of Assisi, saying he wanted \"a poor Church for the poor\". He lived at a Vatican guesthouse rather than the papal palace. Catholics around the world held events to watch the proceedings live, including in Buenos Aires, where Francis was born as Jorge Bergoglio in the poor neighbourhood of Flores in 1936. Thousands gathered in his home cathedral for a dawn vigil, solemn mass and procession of remembrance, where mourners were urged to carry on Francis's work championing the poor and downtrodden. \"Let us be the outgoing Church that Francis always wanted us to be, a restless Church that mobilises,\" said the current archbishop of Buenos Aires, Jorge Garcia Cuerva. Francis never returned to his homeland after becoming pope but Esteban Trabuco, a 27-year-old rubbish picker, said he remained in spirit. \"He's here among the ragged ones, those of us living in the slums among the cardboard,\" he added. \"He knew about our suffering. How could we not be here today to say goodbye?\" Francis's admirers credit him with transforming perceptions of the Church and helping revive the faith following decades of clerical sex abuse scandals. He was considered a radical by some for allowing divorced and remarried believers to receive communion, approving the baptism of transgender believers and blessings for same-sex couples, and refusing to judge gay Catholics. But he also stuck with some centuries-old dogma, notably holding firm on the Church's opposition to abortion. Francis strove for \"a Church determined to take care of the problems of people and the great anxieties that tear the contemporary world apart\", Battista Re said. \"A Church capable of bending down to every person, regardless of their beliefs or condition, and healing their wounds.\" Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2025.

    "title": "Ed Sheeran’s One-of-One Watch Is a Nod to His Future Albums",
    "article_text": "Ed Sheeranis one of the top watch collectors in the musical sphere. Taking a page out ofJohn Mayer’s book, his extensive horological holdings span everything fromaffordable G-Shockstopink MoonSwatchestomultiplepièce unique Royal Oak perpetual calendars. This week, he wore another one with extra-special significance. Spotted on Sheeran’s wrist at Coachella last week was aRoyal Oakthat, well, doesn’t exist. The watch is a reference 16202BC “Jumbo” Extra-Thin—the RO that most closely modelsGérald Genta’s original design from 1972—that features a custom-made green fumé dial with music player symbols. (The 6 and 12 o’clock indices are “play” symbols; 5 and 11 o’clock are “stop” symbols; 1 and 7 o’clock are “pause”; 2, 4, 8, and 10 o’clock are “fast-forward” and “rewind” symbols; and 9 o’clock is “record.”) The special hour markers are a nod to hisupcoming album,Play,as well as planned follow-ups,Pause, Rewind,Fast-Forward, andStop. While many pièce unique dials feature interesting colors and riffs on standard typography, switching out the indices for something both relevantandattractive is a tough design problem.APand Sheeran definitely nailed it with this dial, which speaks to the life of a recording musician—especially one who’s as versed as a working songwriter for/with other artists as he is as an artist himself. And whileSheerancould’ve conceivably fit this dial to any RO of his choosing, we appreciate the choice of the 39-mm “Jumbo,” which hews closest to the spirit of the original model. While little information is available on Sheeran’s watch, the reference number 16202BC indicates a white gold case and matching integrated bracelet, the feature perhaps most associated with this model. At just 8.1 mm tall, it can slip easily under a cuff, and 50 meters of water resistance is plenty for virtually any activity short of proper scuba diving. Inside, the automatic Audemars Piguet cal. 7121 provides 52 hours of power reserve. Available in stainless steel with a classic blue Petite Tappisserie dial and in various other executions in gold and titanium, the “Jumbo” Extra-Thin is the most classic-leaningRoyal Oak, so called because its 39-mm diameter was considered large for the time. Not just any client has the privilege of commissioning a pièce unique. Many brands—we’re looking at you,Cartier—have pulled back on these programs, which have admittedly become bloated. (More than one top Cartier client has been miffed when they’ve discovered similar watches to their piece unique on other clients’ wrists.) The ability to commission a custom-dial watch from a brand that doesn’t advertise such a service means that you’re an unusually loyal customer who has spent an unusually large sum with the maison. Having such pieces made is somewhat of a tradition in music:Eric Clapton,John Mayer, andEd Sheeranhave all been spotted in pièces uniques. If you’re a musician without that type of juice at Audemars Piguet, the brand has you covered. You might be interested in the Royal Oak Offshore “Music Edition,” with a dial that resembles a volume unit (VU) meter that you’d find in a recording studio. That piece was a limited edition of 500 pieces, which clearly wasn’t rare enough for someone like Sheeran. Instead, the singer made his own piece that speaks to his passions. Seen onRyan Reynolds’swrist at the Time 100 Summit was theOmega Speedmaster Pilot—arguably one of the coolestSpeedyexecutions ever made. Released in December 2024, it’s a flight-qualified automatic chronograph with a combination 60-minute and 12-hour totalizer at 3 o’clock and a running-seconds indicator at 9 o’clock. The “artificial horizon” motif on the 9 o’clock register, the plane-tipped orange seconds hand, the luminous sword-shaped hands, and the bright pops of color on the dial all combine to hammer home the aeronautical-military theme, while the steel flat-link bracelet and Master Chronometer–certified movement make it a highly wearable everyday watch. Novak Djokovicarrived at the Laureus Sport Awards dressed in his Swiss best. AHublotbrand ambassador, the Joker wore the new Big Bang 20th Anniversary All Black, a black-ceramic take on the brand’sBig Bang—which launched in 2005. Djokovic’s reference features a large 43-mm case, a rubber bracelet, and a black dial with a dual-register chronograph display and 4:30 date window. Futuristic and high-end, it nevertheless boasts 100 meters of water resistance and an automatic movement providing 72 hours of power reserve, making it an excellent everyday or vacation watch. Djokovic may be the first to pair such a watch with a tuxedo. Tennis phenom Carlos Alcaraz alsoshowed up to the Laureus Sport Awardsin Madrid ready for (horological) war. On his wrist was aRolex Daytonabut no ordinary Daytona: a ref. 116576TBR, a quarter-million-dollar hunk of platinum with a diamond-set bezel and a light blue dial. Take a close look at the icy dial. Rather than the typical Daytona applied indices, this one features Eastern Arabic indices in blue, likely indicating that it was meant for the Middle Eastern market. Produced and sold in small quantities, suchEastern Arabic watchesare hot commodities on the collector’s circuit, beloved by celebrity clients as well as royal families, politicians, and businesspeople in the Middle East.Rolex, for its part, has been making such dials for decades. Ryan Goslingwore his standardTAG Heuer Carrera Dateto kick off his reign as the newest lead in theStar Warsuniverse. The watch is an elegantly simple 39-mm time-and-date model on a stainless steel bracelet. As the company’s most visible brand ambassador, Gosling has worn all manner of TAGs (and vintage Heuers) over the past few years,acknowledging toGQrecently that he’s thinking more and more about the relevance of watches to the characters he plays onscreen. The great thing about the Carrera Date? At $3,400, it’s one of the brand’s most affordable pieces.",

    "title": "“Build Bridges, Not Walls”: Pope Francis' Funeral Sermon Offered Thinly Veiled Reminder to President Donald Trump",
    "article_text": "One of Pope Francis’ dying wishes, as proclaimed by CardinalGiovanni Battista Reat hisfuneralon Saturday in Rome, where hundreds of thousands of mourners came to honor the “People’s Pope,” was that leaders of the world build bridges, and not walls. PresidentDonald Trump, who launched his political career, in part,on the phrase“Build The Wall,” sat in the front row. “Pope Francis incessantly raised his voice, imploring peace and calling for reason and honest negotiation to find possible solutions,” Cardinal Re said as he delivered the homily. “‘Build bridges, not walls,’ was an exhortation he repeated many times.” VATICAN CITY - APRIL 26,2025:US President Donald Trump and US First Lady Melania Trump arrive ahead of the late Pope Francis' funeral ceremony at St Peter's Square at The Vatican (Photo credit should read Marco Ravagli/Future Publishing via Getty Images) Aboard Air Force One on his way to Italy on Friday, Trump told reporters that he was attending the funeral “out of respect” for Francis, adding, “Iwonthe Catholic vote.” And since arriving in Italy, Trump has been documenting his trip on Truth Social, sharing videos of him walking toward his seat at the funeral and standing in front of the late pope’s simple cypress coffin. The president, along with his wifeMelania Trump, was one of several world leaders who were seated on the stairs of St. Peter’s Basilica for whatThe New York Timesreportswas a “solemn and majestic funeral.” Former presidentJoe Bidenand former first ladyJill Biden, Britain’sPrince William, UK Prime MinisterKeir Starmer, French PresidentEmmanuel Macron, Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelensky, along with other global heads, were also in attendance. Prior to Saturday morning’s service, President Trumpsat down withZelensky at the Vatican—the pair’s first meeting since theirtelevised clashin the Oval Office in February. White House spokesmanStephen Cheungcalled it a “very productive discussion,” but gave no details. In a separate social mediapost, Zelensky said they had a “Good meeting.” In this handout photo, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky (R) meets with U.S. President Donald Trump (L) during Pope Francis's funeral at St. Peter's Basilica on April 26, 2025 in Vatican City, Vatican. “We discussed a lot one-on-one. Hoping for results on everything we covered. Protecting lives of our people. Full and unconditional ceasefire. Reliable and lasting peace that will prevent another war from breaking out. Very symbolic meeting that has potential to become historic, if we achieve joint results,” the Ukrainian president wrote, thanking and tagging Trump. The president and Pope Francis have clashed several times since Trump’s first bid for the White House nearly a decade ago. In 2016, the popecriticizedTrump’s proposal to build a wall on the US-Mexico border, telling reporters at the time that, “a person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian.” Trump quickly fired back, saying, “For a religious leader to question a person’s faith is disgraceful.” “If and when the Vatican is attacked by ISIS, which as everyone knows is ISIS’s ultimate trophy, I can promise you that the Pope would have only wished and prayed that Donald Trump would have been President,” he said in a statement. Then, when the pair met during a 2017 trip to the Vatican, the president claimed they had a “fantastic meeting.” This interaction gave rise to theviral photoof Trump and Francis standing next to each other with very different expressions. Pope Francis (R) poses with US President Donald Trump (C), US First Lady Melania Trump, and the daughter of US President Donald Trump, Ivanka Trump (L), at the end of a private audience at the Vatican on May 24, 2017. Fast forward to Trump’s second presidency, and the pope again made a rare rebuke of the United States’ leadership. In a public letter from February to Catholic bishops in the United States, Francis described the program of mass deportations as a “major crisis.” Deporting migrants who often come from difficult situations, Francis wrote, violates the “dignity of many men and women, and of entire families,” adding that he had “followed closely the major crisis that is taking place in the United States with the initiation of a program of mass deportations,” and believes that any policy built on force “begins badly and will end badly.” Hundreds of mourners attend the funeral of Pope Francis in St. Peter’s Square on April 26, 2025 in Vatican City, Vatican. Cardinal Re’s homily on Saturday highlighted the pope’s insistence on traveling to places where people were experiencing displacement and insecurity about where they could live and how they would feed their families. “His gestures and exhortations in favor of refugees and displaced persons are countless,” Re said. “He established direct contact with individuals and peoples, eager to be close to everyone, with a marked attention to those in difficulty, giving himself without measure, especially to the marginalized, the least among us. He was a Pope among the people.” HowSebastian StanBecame Hollywood’s Most Daring Shape-Shifter Explosions, Hacking, Spoofs: Inside NewSecurity Threatsin the Skies Karen Read’s Retrial: Bring In the Witnesses WhatIvanka Trumpand Anti-Trumpers Have In Common Inside Elon Musk’s Grievance-FueledMAGA-morphosis Sinners’ End CreditsExplained The OriginalGirl of the Year Elon Musk’sBreeding SpreeIsSoMuch Wilder Than You Thought EveryQuentin TarantinoMovie, Ranked MeetElon Musk’s 14 Childrenand Their Mothers (Whom We Know of) From the Archive:Sinatra and the Mob",

    "article_text": "Virginia Giuffre, who put a face to the multitudes of women allegedly victimized byconvicted sex offenderJeffrey Epstein, died by suicide on Thursday, April 24, family members confirm. She was 41. Giuffre rose to global prominence in 2019, soon after Epsteinwas found deadin prison. According to Giuffre, when she was 15 and working at PresidentDonald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort,Ghislaine Maxwellapproached her as a masseuse for Epstein. Instead, Giuffre alleged, she was sexually abused by Maxwell and Epstein and trafficked to men around the world while under 18, including British royalPrince Andrew. Both men denied Giuffre’s allegations, but they also settled civil suits Giuffre brought against them: Epsteinpaying her$500,000 in 2009, and Andrewreaching a confidential agreement withher just days before thetrial in the casewas expected to begin. Neither faced criminal charges as a result of Giuffre’s accusations. (L-R) Michelle Licata and Virginia Giuffre attend the 2019 Women's Media Awards at Mandarin Oriental on October 22, 2019 in New York City. The repercussions of Giuffre’s claims against Andrew remain visible today. In an effort to repair his image, Andrew agreed toa 2019 interview with BBC’sNewsnightto discuss his relationship with Epstein and Giuffre’s allegations of abuse, but the interviewbackfired so badlythat the royalwas banished frommuch of royal life—and the interview, itself, was adapted into multipledramatic properties. “It is with utterly broken hearts that we announce that Virginia passed away last night at her farm in Western Australia. She lost her life to suicide, after being a lifelong victim of sexual abuse and sex trafficking,” a statement provided by a representative of Giuffre’s family reads. “Virginia was a fierce warrior in the fight against sexual abuse and sex trafficking. She was the light that lifted so many survivors. Despite all the adversity she faced in her life, she shone so bright … She was heroic and will always be remembered for her incredible courage and loving spirit. In the end, the toll of abuse is so heavy that it became unbearable for Virginia to handle its weight. We know that she is with the angels.” It appears that Giuffre was facing some significant struggles in her final weeks. TheBBC reportsthat she violated a legal order prohibiting her from making contact with her family in February; the following month, herpublicist saidthat Giuffre had sustained serious injuries in a vehicle collision, but declined to provide additional details. A March post by Giuffreto social mediasuggested she only had a few days to live as a result of the crash, but local authorities could not confirm such a collision. David Boies, representing several of Jeffrey Epstein's alleged victims, center, arrives with Annie Farmer, second right, and Virginia Giuffre, alleged victims of Jeffrey Epstein, second left, at federal court in New York, U.S., on Tuesday, Aug. 27, 2019. In a statement sentto People, a spokesperson for the Western Australia Police Force says that emergency services responders were called to a residence in Neergabby, Australia, on reports of an unresponsive woman. Virginia Giuffre, who has reportedly lived in Neergabby for several years, was pronounced dead at the scene, and while Major Crime detectives are investigating, the case is not considered suspicious. Josh Schiffer, an attorney for one of Epstein’s victims, tellsthe Guardianthat Giuffre deserves credit for bringing the convicted sexual assailant to justice. “The case wouldn’t have existed without the input, her cooperation, her bravery at the beginning, inspiring so many other people to come forward,” he said. “Her loss will hopefully be a marker and almost an inspiration for people to calling attention to the epidemic that is sex trafficking, that is the international sex industry. This is an issue that still persists. It changes its form all the time, and it exists all around the world. This just happened to be a really prominent example.” HowSebastian StanBecame Hollywood’s Most Daring Shape-Shifter Explosions, Hacking, Spoofs: Inside NewSecurity Threatsin the Skies Karen Read’s Retrial: Bring In the Witnesses WhatIvanka Trumpand Anti-Trumpers Have In Common Inside Elon Musk’s Grievance-FueledMAGA-morphosis Sinners’ End CreditsExplained The OriginalGirl of the Year Elon Musk’sBreeding SpreeIsSoMuch Wilder Than You Thought EveryQuentin TarantinoMovie, Ranked MeetElon Musk’s 14 Childrenand Their Mothers (Whom We Know of) From the Archive:Sinatra and the Mob",

    "article_text": "Deputy Secretary for Health Eddie Lee says authorities have already taken tourists’ needs into account when drafting new measures Tourists will be unaffected by Hong Kong’s new proposed control measures on tobacco products, an official has said, promising that such policies will strike a balance between bolstering public health and the economy. Deputy Secretary for Health Eddie Lee Lik-kong said on Saturday that authorities had already taken tourists’ needs into account when drafting the new measures, adding that their effects on the economy would be “minimal”. A day earlier, the government gazetted an amendment that outlined 10 short-term measures aimed at further curbing the smoking rate. It will be submitted to the Legislative Council for its first reading on Wednesday. The measures include plans to make it illegal for people to possess or use alternative smoking products in public by April 30 of next year. They also cover an expected ban on the sale of conventional smoking products with flavours other than menthol from the second quarter of 2027. Critics have said that some of the measures, particularly those concerning alternative and flavoured tobacco products, could harm the local economy by discouraging tourism.",
